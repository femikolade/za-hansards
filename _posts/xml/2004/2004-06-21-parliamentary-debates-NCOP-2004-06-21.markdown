                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
this House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

   That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   top  Scorpions  investigator  Mr   Cornwell   Tshavhungwa   was
           rearrested for violating bail conditions in connection to  fraud
           charges he is facing, when he spoke to a state witness while  he
           was out on R100 000 bail; and


       (b)  Mr Tshavhungwa, who is an advocate in the High Court, is accused
           of having taken bribes or received irregular payments  amounting
           to R550 000 from people under investigation by the Scorpions;


  (2) further notes that according  to  Scorpions  spokesman  Mr  Makhosini
       Nkosi, Mr Tshavhungwa will be appearing in Court on 21 June 2004; and


  (3)  believes  that  the  Scorpions  be  applauded  for  their  excellent
       performance and for demonstrating that all  perpetrators  shall  face
       the wrath of the law irrespective of whether they are  top  officials
       or ordinary citizens.

                      EXTENSION OF CHILD SUPPORT GRANT

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms J MASILO: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) recalls that President Thabo Mbeki, during  the  2004  state  of  the
       nation address, emphasised the  need  to  ensure  that  all  children
       eligible for the child support grant should be registered;


  (2) notes that the MEC for social development in North West has taken  up
       this challenge by  embarking  on  a  campaign  to  get  all  children
       eligible for the child support grant registered; and


  (3) commends the  MEC  and  her  department  for  the  vigour  they  have
       displayed in engaging all stakeholders such as the Department of Home
       Affairs,  the  Department  of  Education,   NGOs,   church   leaders,
       traditional leaders, farmers  as  well  as  business  communities  to
       assist in fulfilling our Government's promise to the children of  our
       country.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
              MOTION OF CONDOLENCE FOR THE LATE AGGREY KLAASTE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the untimely death of 63-year-old Mr Aggrey  Klaaste,  known  by
           local journalists as the ``nation-builder'' and pioneer  of  the
           concept ``community journalism'' and ``community newspaper";


       (b)  that Mr Klaaste, born in Kimberley, was editor  of  the  Sowetan
           newspaper, a prototype of community newspapers, since 1988;


       (c)  that he initiated a new  process  of  nation-building  to  steer
           South Africa away from an impending  civil  war  and  that,  not
           surprisingly, he was arrested  and  detained  for  his  moderate
           appeals; and


       (d)  that, until his premature death on  19  June  2004,  Mr  Klaaste
           remained faithful to the concept  of  community  journalism  and
           demonstrated his conviction by continuing to reside  in  Soweto,
           among people whose destiny was his major concern;


  (2) laments the loss of this stalwart of  progressive  journalism,  whose
       life and contribution serve as a benchmark  for  our  youth  and  the
       community of would-be journalists; and


  (3) therefore offers its message of support to the family  of  Mr  Aggrey
       Klaaste.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 MOTION OF CONDOLENCE FOR MRS ERENIA CHIKANE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms N A NDALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with a deep sense of  loss  the  passing  away  of  Mrs  Erenia
       Chikane, the mother of Rev Frank  Chikane,  Director-General  of  The
       Presidency;


  (2) recalls with pride the  enormous  contribution  she  has  made  as  a
       mother, mentor, guide and supporter of her  family  and  through  her
       unquestioning and  loyal  support  for  the  ideals  of  a  free  and
       democratic society;


  (3) conveys its deepest sympathies to the family of  Rev  Frank  Chikane;
       and


  (4) assures them of its support during this difficult time.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  BIRTHDAY WISHES TO PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI
                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms F NYANDA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates President Thabo Mbeki on his 62nd birthday; and


  (2) extends its best wishes to the President for the years ahead.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 CONGRATULATIONS TO SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C M DUGMORE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the performance of the South African rugby team in  the  second
       test at Newlands on Saturday against the Irish;


  (2) in  particular  notes  the  performance  of  Breyton  Paulse,  fondly
       referred to by the Newlands fans  as  ``Breyton,  jou  lekka  ding'',
       Schalk Burger and Percy Montgomery; and


  (3) therefore resolves to congratulate the South African  team  on  their
       victory against  the  Irish  and  to  wish  them  all  the  best  for
       Saturday's match against Wales and  for  the  forthcoming  trinations
       tournament.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        REVIVAL OF PUBLIC AUDIT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  in the Second Parliament the Ad Hoc Committee on Public Auditing
           Function, as mandated by the Assembly, had introduced the Public
           Audit Bill [B1 - 20004] in the House on 3 February 2004 together
           with its report on the Bill (see ATC of 11 February);


       (b)  the Bill, after a debate, was read a second time in the Assembly
           on 17 February, the committee's report being noted; and


       (c)  the National Council of Provinces was  unable  to  complete  its
           consideration  of  the  Bill  before  the  end  of  the   Second
           Parliament and the Bill consequently lapsed; and


  (2) therefore resolves, subject to the concurrence of the Assembly,  that
       the Bill be revived and consideration of the Bill be resumed from the
       stage previously reached with its passage through Parliament.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! As there is no speakers' list,  I  shall
now put the question. The question is that the motion be agreed to.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to
cast  their  provinces'  votes.  Are  all  delegation  heads   present?   In
accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces  the  opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote, if they so wish.

We shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order, per province. Delegation heads must please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in  favour,  against  or  abstain  from  voting.

                               (Policy debate)

Debate on Budget Vote No 15: Education

Debate on Budget Vote No 20: Sport and Recreation

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, since  there  will  be  one
speakers'list for both  Budget  Votes,  that  of  Education  and  Sport  and
Recreation, the Secretary will, therefore, read both the  first  and  second
Orders of the Day at once.

May I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister and Deputy  Minister  of
Education. Welcome back to this House. Likewise, to the Deputy  Minister  of
Sports, Arts and Culture, welcome on your first visit to this House.  But  I
say a special welcome to the Minister and Deputy Minister of  Education,  as
they are the former leaders of this House. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Ke  a  leboha  Modulasetulo.  Ke  batla  ho  kopa
moemedi ya tlotlehang, Sulliman,  hore  ano  re  o  a  dumela,  a  se  ke  a
leboha.[Laughter.] [Thank you, Chairperson. I would like to advise  the  hon
Sulliman to say ``we agree'', and not ``thank you''.]

Madam Chairperson, hon members of the NCOP, members of  executive  councils,
invited guests, ladies and gentlemen, I think  every  thinking  person  will
tell you that  the  most  diabolical  aspect  of  apartheid  was  its  Bantu
Education policy. Denying a person the opportunity to maximise  and  realise
his or her potential was an evil act. Our task, therefore,  is  very  clear.
Principally, it is to confound the architects of apartheid  Bantu  education
and to create and sustain an education system in which  opportunity  has  no
boundaries, in which every person has the right to believe that  he  or  she
will emerge from our education system equipped with  the  skills  that  will
enable him or her to lead a sustainable life.

It has taken a  great  effort  to  undo  the  damage  created  by  apartheid
education. Our key goals remain equity,  quality,  access  and  redress.  We
have been successful in all these areas, but I  believe  that  our  greatest
success has been  in  transforming  education  from  a  sector  serving  the
privileged few to a sector serving all our people. The  following  are  some
of our remarkable achievements.

We have better access to schooling than ever before. In 1975 there were  5,4
million pupils in school. In 2000 there were  11,4  million.  That  increase
was largely made up of African enrolments.

We have provided general education to all, within the compulsory  school-age
cohort of seven to fifteen years. The pupil-to-teacher ratio  has  improved.
The ratio has declined from 43:1 in 1996 to 38:1 in 2002.  This  means  that
pupils have better access to learning facilities than before 1994.

We've also succeeded in providing schooling for girls, as well as for  boys.
At primary and secondary levels the enrolment of girls is  higher  than  for
boys. There has been a lower school drop-out rate for girls than  for  boys.
Of course, we cannot but  be  concerned  that  we  should  monitor  what  is
happening to these young boys. But the progress and access  of  girls  is  a
pleasing statistic and success for our country.

We have also begun to achieve gender equity in  higher  education.  In  1988
there were 340,000 students in our higher education  institutions.  In  2003
there were 650 325 students in higher  education.  Women  outnumber  men  at
both universities and technikons, with 347 679 women  students  to  302  646
men. These are pleasing statistics and we  must  congratulate  ourselves  on
achieving this in the past ten years.

My  predecessors  in  the  Ministry  have  shaped   well-founded   education
policies, from general education through to higher education.  So  the  hard
work of policy formulation  has  been  done.  The  challenges  ahead  mainly
require the implementation of programmes that are already underway.

It is important, hon delegates, for us to remember that  the  responsibility
for transforming and  improving  the  education  system  is  shared  between
national Government and the provinces. For  general  education  and  further
education and training, the national department is responsible  for  overall
policy, monitoring and support, while  the  provinces  are  responsible  for
service  delivery  and  financing.  For  higher  education,   the   national
department is responsible for developing  policy,  and  monitoring  and  co-
ordinating Government financing.

The  important  role  of  provincial  education  departments   has   to   be
emphasised, because our opponents often misconstrue our system by  asserting
that it is centralised by ANC national control.  Provinces  play  a  central
role in implementation. They determine use of their  budgets  and  establish
priorities in the context, definitely,  of  national  norms  and  standards.
Such a framework, therefore, cannot be defined as reflecting a  centralising
ideology.

The objectives of our  Education  budget  are  to  support  the  erosion  of
poverty and to support economic growth. Budget 2004 does this  in  a  number
of important ways. The  budget  plans  that  you  will  learn  of  from  our
provincial colleagues will inform you of  the  school  nutrition  scheme  at
primary school level. About R838,2 million  has  been  set  aside  for  this
purpose in the 2004-05 financial year, and R918,2  million  in  the  2005-06
financial year. And I'm  pleased  to  be  able  to  indicate  that  all  our
provinces have the nutrition scheme in place.

We also plan to  accelerate  implementation  of  early  childhood  education
programmes and to ensure that all schools have grade R  classes.  This  will
support us in providing children with a core foundation  for  ensuring  that
they succeed at primary school level. Increased attention will be  given  to
ensuring that schools and colleges have the  resources  to  support  quality
learning and teaching. School libraries, and the provision  of  books  in  a
range of languages, must be made available to our educational institutions.

Members  would  know  that  there  is  the  Zifundele  [read  for  yourself]
campaign, currently underway by one of  our  major  radio  stations  in  the
country. And I hear that even the President's Office has pledged R5  000.  I
wonder which members have made a pledge to this campaign. I will  be  making
my pledge later today, and I hope that all members will do so as well.

Learning materials are being delivered  timeously  by  provincial  education
departments,  and  this  progress   will   continue.   Teacher   development
programmes are a priority. We will  strengthen  these  to  ensure  that  our
teachers play a full and effective role as the frontline in  our  battle  to
translate education access to acquisition of skills  and  knowledge  in  all
the learning areas, and most importantly in maths, science and the  language
of  learning,  English.  We  regard  this  focused  attention  to  effective
learning and teaching as our most significant  priority  because  it  neatly
locks into our next set of priorities.

Much has been said  about  unemployment  in  South  Africa,  and  about  the
yawning chasm between skills needed in our economy and  skills  acquired  in
our schools and universities. It is tragic that  South  Africa  now  has  an
emerging graduate unemployment problem.  A  recent  HSRC  study  into  human
resource development  points  to  the  strategies  South  Africa  must  give
attention to. Students and learners must acquire marketable  skills  at  our
schools and universities. Our training institutions need to  take  far  more
of an interest in the shape of our economy.

It is clear, for example, that  for  a  developing  country  such  as  ours,
managing of development is an important priority. Despite this, we  severely
lack adequately prepared managers, and tend  to  perpetuate  the  artificial
divide  between  learning  and  doing.  Economic  history  also  shows  that
sustained economic growth is usually  partnered  by  opportunities  for  all
citizens.  Our  economic  framework  continues  to  be  dominated  by  large
monopoly players, who wish to control everything and to  squeeze  out  small
entrepreneurs. Our Government has shaped popular  policies  that  allow  for
increased popular participation in our economy.

Unfortunately, our education institutions continue  to  perpetuate  training
for the idea of employment rather than training for economic  expansion  and
employment creation. It is  our  intention  that  the  colleges  of  further
education and training will increasingly fill this gap. The plans that  have
been formulated by the college sector address these inadequacies.

The provincial authorities have agreed that 2004 must be the year  in  which
adequate funds are provided to the colleges so that they begin to  implement
our strategic education priorities. Our higher education  institutions  will
also have to contribute to skills  development  by  focusing  on  responsive
programme offerings, by using  research,  such  as  the  HSRC  research,  to
develop responsive  programmes,  and  by  working  with  the  Department  of
Education  to  craft  effective  responses  to  our  economic   and   social
challenges.

We have already budgeted for the  recapitalisation  of  the  merging  higher
education institutions. The process of reconfiguring  the  higher  education
sector is a complex exercise and one that is likely to give rise to a  range
of difficult challenges. We are fully alert  to  the  need  to  monitor  the
merger processes constantly and to anticipate likely  problem  areas  before
crises emerge. The intention behind the mergers is to  promote  and  enhance
transformation, and not to disrupt the sector  in  a  manner  that  detracts
from or negates our noble objective. The developments thus  far  have  shown
that we have a strong possibility of success and a  huge  responsibility  to
ensure that we provide effective support.

In the May 2004 state of the nation speech, the  President  evoked  memories
of the Freedom Charter and the People's  Education  Campaign  of  the  NECC,
when he stressed  that  this  Government  will  ensure  the  achievement  of
opening the doors of learning and culture ever wider for the people  of  our
country.  As  indicated  in  the  achievements  referred  to  earlier,   the
education sector has been  acting  on  this  mandate  for  some  time.  With
respect to the specific targets outlined by  the  President,  we  intend  to
implement in the  following  ways,  while  strengthening  and  consolidating
areas in which we have already made considerable progress.

The first priority referred to by the President was that  we  should  ensure
adequate funding of  the  technical  colleges,  and  the  alignment  of  the
courses they offer with the requirements of  the  economy.  The  mandate  of
these colleges is to  provide  intermediate  skills  for  young  people  and
adults in order for them to participate actively in our economy. All  of  us
know that from recent statistics,  around  60%  of  the  unemployed  in  our
country are youth who are between the ages of 19 and 35. These young  people
need to receive training to skill them for the challenges of  a  globalising
economy. If we do not train them, they will remain trapped  in  poverty  and
underdevelopment.

Our colleges need to be funded, as I have said, and developed  in  a  manner
that will allow  them  to  provide  skills-upgrade  programmes  as  well  as
leading-edge programmes that answer to the challenge of  providing  for  the
critical, scarce skills needs of South Africa.

As a number of analysts have indicated in recent comments  on  our  national
Budget, our 2004 Budget doesn't contain funding for the recapitalisation  of
the further education and training colleges. However,  we  do  have  in  the
department the strategic plans of these colleges. We have used  these  plans
as a basis for an application for interim funding to our National Treasury.

The further education and training  sector  has,  we  believe,  reached  its
maximum utilisation of  current  investment.  They  are  budgeted  to  spend
around R4,8 billion in the next three financial years. We  proposed  that  a
further R3,1 billion be made available to  the  sector.  I  have  been  very
pleased to note  that  several  of  the  provincial  departments  have  also
announced commitments to this vital sector of education.

Beyond these beginnings, we  believe  that  much  success  can  be  achieved
through  partnerships  with  the  business  community,  which  has   already
invested heavily  in  the  restructuring  of  our  colleges.  We  intend  to
initiate discussions with a number of sectors to  explore  partnerships  and
programmes of co-operation.

Our President also charged to ensure that  through  the  merger  process  of
higher learning institutions, we  indeed  ensure  that  they  become  single
institutions with a unified institutional culture. We  will  strengthen  our
role in supporting and monitoring this process. Our President was  referring
to issues of institutional change that are far more fundamental than  merger
processes.

Many of the merging institutions enter the partnership as unequal  partners.
The temptation to dominate will  influence  many  of  the  necessary  change
processes. We as the Department of Education will have  to  ensure  that  no
institutional dominance of  race,  culture  or  numbers  is  permitted.  Any
outcome of dominance confirmed will set in place the apartheid  features  of
power and oppression. It is this form of  outcome  that  the  President  has
urged attention be devoted to. We will monitor structure changes, new  rules
and statutes very carefully. We will intensify our work to ensure  that  the
transformative aspirations of the mergers are indeed realised.

This  will  require  unwavering  commitment  on  the   part   of   the   new
institutional  management  and  governing  structures  to  ensure  that  the
challenges we face in the development of a new integrated culture of  shared
values and loyalties, attitudes and conditions of  work  are  addressed  and
achieved.

The  department  will  also  monitor  and  track   the   transformation   of
institutional cultures in all higher education institutions,  including  the
ones unaffected by mergers. This process has indeed already begun. In  2003,
these institutions submitted three-year rolling plans for  the  period  2004
to 2006. They are supposed to clearly outline the strategies they  have  put
in place - and their plans certainly do so, and they address the  matter  of
inclusive institutional cultures.  The  stated  objectives  and  targets  in
relation to this priority will  form  the  basis  of  future  allocation  of
subsidies to these institutions.

We have also been enjoined to ensure  that  no  learner  or  student  learns
under trees, in a mud school or in dangerous conditions. In 2003 there  were
494 cases of schools without any classrooms. By this year,  the  number  has
decreased to 152, the majority of which are in Limpopo province. This  is  a
declining phenomenon. But we have to note that we do face the challenge,  as
the education sector, of the  rural-to-urban  migration,  which  poses  many
problems, because as we build  new  schools  were  children  were  schooling
under trees, families move into towns  were  we  then  need  to  create  new
institutions. So we do face quite a problem, which arises  from  a  movement
of people in search of work and new opportunities. We have seen a number  of
provinces, particularly  Gauteng,  develop  innovative  responses  to  these
challenges, such as mobile classrooms, for example.

Our department is now broadening the scope of the programme by also  looking
at those schools that have facilities that require maintenance  and  further
upgrading. We have a record of thousands of  schools  that  are  in  such  a
condition, and clearly a great deal of funding is needed to address this.

At the Council of Education Ministers' meeting held  early  this  month,  we
agreed that we would give priority to providing decent schooling  facilities
for the pupils of our country.  All  our  provincial  colleagues  agreed  to
scrutinise already tight budgets to ensure that no child learns under  trees
by 31 March 2005. We will liaise with the Public  Works  department  to  co-
operate  in  delivering  on  this  promise.  We  believe  it  is  absolutely
necessary for us to respond practically to this call by our President.

The Council of Education Ministers has further agreed  that  the  department
should strengthen  its  monitoring  role  to  ensure  that  the  targets  we
collectively set are attained. We have agreed to ensure that work has  begun
on the new buildings that we require during the course of this  year.  We've
also been asked to ensure that all our schools have access  to  clean  water
and sanitation. We are working with our colleagues from  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry to ensure that we indeed achieve this  particular
objective.

An important priority set by the President is that of  expanding  the  reach
of the Adult Basic Education and Training programme and aligning  this  with
the training objectives of the Expanded Public Works  Programme.  We  intend
to increase the number of learners enrolled in current  ABET  programmes  by
29 000 in the current financial year. We intend to do  this  in  partnership
with various community and  nongovernmental  organisations  working  in  the
field of adult basic education.  We  are  very  pleased  with  the  progress
adults are making in obtaining ABET level 4 outcomes, with 26  067  students
writing examinations last year.

The Minister of Labour and I have been meeting to  discuss  co-operation  in
integrating education and training. The provision of adult  basic  education
and training is, I believe, one of the areas for such co-operation. We  will
require our departments to provide us  with  a  full  audit  of  Government-
funded  adult  education  provisions,  including  the   current   level   of
investment in this sector within a month  so  that  we  can  decide  whether
current investment is optimal or whether it needs redirection.

We will also urgently and continuously assess the basic  learning  needs  of
adults and youths participating in  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.
This will allow us to integrate education and training into  the  productive
activities of the programme, thus ensuring the  development  of  much-needed
skills for use beyond the life of the Expanded Public Works Programme.

We must also ensure that social security  initiatives  such  as  the  school
nutrition programme do reach all our children. We will reach over 5  million
learners in approximately 15 000 schools in farm and rural communities  this
year. We will  continue  to  work  with  these  communities  to  ensure  the
establishment of sustainable food security  initiatives  and  to  strengthen
our efforts towards the  creation  of  increased  job  opportunities  and  a
culture of self-reliance.

I would like to conclude by saying  that  there  are  three  issues  that  I
believe continue to require our attention this year, and on which  we  hope,
and intend, to announce policy.

Firstly, the issue of school fees and  exemptions.  Financial  exclusion  of
poor pupils is one of the biggest challenges  we  face  in  the  department.
Existing legislation protects poor pupils from  exclusion  by  allowing  for
school fee exemption, by allocating a seven-times higher per capita  to  the
poorest pupils than the least poor, and by seeking to ensure  that  teaching
resources are distributed equitably among schools.

However, the recently published report on the costs  of  education  suggests
that the hidden costs of textbooks, school lunches and school  uniforms  are
still  presenting  a  relatively  expensive  education  for  the  poor.  Our
department is committed to abolishing the school fee demand for the  poorest
in our society. We believe that this is  a  growing  demand  from  community
organisations and structures nationally, and we intend to respond  to  this.
Our provinces are already looking into this issue, and  we  are  looking  at
the manner in which we should be able to provide  support.  I  believe  that
parents must monitor schools to ensure that school governing bodies  do  not
easily exclude and remove poor children from our schools. This is  happening
today and it is  important  that  parliamentarians  assist  us  in  guarding
against this practice.

We must also stop corporal punishment and the abuse of  children  physically
in our schools. I'm distressed about what we see. We  await  the  report  of
our committee that is looking into how  we  could  improve  farm  and  rural
schooling in South Africa, and we hope to come to  this  House  to  announce
our programme in that regard. I thank you and hon members for  listening  to
our speech. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!  Before  I  call  upon  the  hon  Deputy
Minister of Sport and Recreation to address the Council,  may  I  take  this
opportunity, once more, to inform the  departments  that  we  have  taken  a
decision in the Council to continue with the debate in cluster form.  It  is
a cluster that was formulated, of course, by the then  Chief  Whip  of  this
House, now Deputy Minister of Education. But we feel that  it  is  important
that we continue with this system because education  and  sports  are  quite
closely linked, and, therefore, we feel that we are on the  right  path,  as
the NCOP, when we say: Teach them sport whilst they are  still  young,  grow
them in sports and keep them healthy.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Thank  you,  Madam  Chair,  for
welcoming me to this august House. I  want  to  assure  the  House  and  the
delegates that I do feel very welcome.

Yes, you are absolutely correct, sport, at the end of the day, is not  about
engaging people for 90  minutes  on  the  sports  field,  but  it  is  about
delivering a rounded person to society and for the benefit of our  wonderful
country, South Africa.

I ask this House to accept the  apologies  of  our  Minister  of  Sport  and
Recreation, Rev Stofile, for being absent today.  The  House  may  be  aware
that he is at present attending  the  World  Anti-Doping  Agency  Foundation
Board Meeting in Canada. We trust that the importance  of  this  meeting  is
understood and appreciated by this House.

May I say that I support the leadership of our Minister  in  this  important
portfolio of Sport and Recreation. I can confirm that in the short space  of
time that we've been  working  together,  I  have  been  stimulated  by  his
experience and knowledge. He spent  40  years  of  his  life  in  sport  and
sporting circles. What a lifetime.

It is an honour to deliver my maiden Budget  Vote  address  in  this  august
House just over a month  after  being  appointed  Deputy  Minister  in  this
portfolio. I may say that in this short space of time, the  Minister  and  I
have spent a lot of time orientating ourselves in the  new  environment.  We
have started to make strategic adjustments to  the  course  that  sport  and
recreation is taking in our country. The past few  weeks  have  been  heady.
However, we have taken up the challenge with the enthusiasm that  a  dynamic
area such as sport and recreation deserves.

As a team, the  Minister  and  I,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Sport  and
Recreation, the Select Committee on Education and Recreation,  the  evolving
Ministry of Sport and Recreation and the  department,  with  its  associated
public entities, will soon be moulded into a well-oiled  machine  that  will
take sport to new heights in our country.

Ek is  dankbaar  teenoor  die  agb  President  vir  die  geleentheid  om  as
Adjunkminister in hierdie uitdagende en opwindende portfeulje te  kan  dien.
Sport is en bly 'n belangrike boublok in nasiebou  en  versoening.  Trouens,
wanneer ons sportspanne  wen,  gaan  dit  goed  met  alles,  maar  as  hulle
verloor, gaan dit sleg, en om wyle Koos du Plessis vryelik aan te haal,  dan
is -


  ... alles wat eers vas was, die tafel en die laaikas, versmelt tot  blote
  skadu's teen die muur.

Dan kan ons ``toringblokke beplan'', maar in die gemoed van ons  mense  ``is
die slopers betrokke''.

Daarom kan ons vandag sê ons sal poog om alles vas te  sement,  so  ook  ons
nasietrots en gemeenskaplike patriotisme, want as  Suid  Afrikaners  ís  ons
mos 'n eenheid  in  verskeidenheid!  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[I am grateful to the hon President for the opportunity to serve  as  Deputy
Minister in this challenging and  exciting  portfolio.  Sport  is  and  will
remain an important building block for nation-building  and  reconciliation.
In fact, when our sports teams win,  things  go  well,  but  if  they  lose,
things go badly, and to quote the late Koos du Plessis freely, then -


  ... alles wat eers vas was, die tafel en die laaikas, versmelt tot  blote
  skadu's teen die muur. [... anything that was once solid, the  table  and
  the chest of drawers, melts into mere shadows on the wall.]

Then we can plan our ``toringblokke''  [high-rise  buildings],  but  in  the
minds of our people ``is die slopers  reeds  betrokke''  [they  are  already
being demolished].

Therefore we can say today that we will strive to join everything  together,
thus also our  nation's  pride  and  common  patriotism,  because  as  South
Africans we are indeed united in our diversity!]

I am equally encouraged  by  the  extent  to  which  people,  from  all  our
communities, have rallied around me in support of  the  cause  that  we  are
pursuing and the direction that we are taking. In particular,  the  positive
feedback that I received in response to the successful bid for  hosting  the
2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup finals has reconfirmed my  belief  in  the  value
that sport and recreation  have  in  consolidating  nation-building  in  our
democracy. The phone calls that I have received, especially from  Afrikaans-
speaking  compatriots,  in   response   to   these   outcomes,   have   been
inspirational and are  confirming  the  potential  of  sport  as  a  nation-
builder.

We take this opportunity to  acknowledge  the  great  strides  made  by  our
predecessors, Ministers Steve Tshwete and Ngconde  Balfour,  in  moving  our
sport towards the goal of our dreams. Sport is  a  very  important  part  of
society. It is also an important barometer of how a  particular  society  is
organised. For that reason, our country also has  a  responsibility  to  use
sport to assist our people move in a particular direction, the direction  of
a deracialised South Africa which is sensitive to  gender  issues;  a  South
Africa that is also biased in favour of the poor  and  those  at  risk:  the
children, the youth, women, the  aged  and  people  with  disabilities.  The
dignity of these people must be restored. Their freedom to have access to  a
better life must be protected. We believe that sport can  play  a  big  role
towards achieving these goals of Vision 2014.

Sport is a powerful transformative force. It only depends on the  agenda  of
those in charge for it to fulfil this  potential.  In  our  democratic  era,
sport has started to make a substantive contribution to nation-building  and
reconciliation. We take this opportunity to congratulate the leaders of  the
Soccer World Cup Bid 2010. The challenge that faces our  department  is  how
to build on these  successes  and  how  to  use  them  to  build  a  united,
patriotic and motivated nation.

We are challenged to inculcate  a  spirit  of  nonracialism  among  players,
administrators and federations. We are challenged to  level  the  proverbial
playing fields in the accessibility of sport and  recreation  opportunities,
facilities and amenities, as well as resources, to all  our  people  without
discrimination. We are challenged to make South  Africa  a  playing  nation,
and subsequently a healthy nation, a responsible, but also tolerant nation.

As a  department,  we  are  not  only  driven  by  our  own  objectives  and
priorities,  we  contribute  substantially   to   certain   objectives   and
priorities as articulated in the President's state  of  the  nation  address
this year.  He  emphasised  the  role  that  the  institution  can  play  in
improving the quality of  life  of  all  our  people.  When  he  wished  our
participants in the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games well, he  reminded
them of the role that they can play  in  nation-building  and  in  promoting
national pride, and of their responsibility as ambassadors of  the  country.
In congratulating  the  2010  Soccer  Bid  Company  on  their  success,  our
President urged the nation to unite in order to ensure the success of  2010,
as promised in our submission to FIFA.

Sport and recreation has the potential, and is already contributing, to  the
President's   identified   priority   of   eradicating   poverty   in    the
underdeveloped country. We  do  so  by  creating  employment  opportunities,
generating income and, therefore, assisting with poverty relief  in  a  very
material sense.

The President also stressed the need to address  the  persisting  conditions
of racial and gender inequality that is so visibly articulated  through  the
lack of representivity in our national and  other  sports  teams.  This  can
only mean that resources must be  directed  at  creating  opportunities  for
those who were previously excluded and disadvantaged.

Sport contributes admirably to the President's call for developing  a  sense
of  national  unity  and  patriotism.  When  our  representative  teams  are
successful, we destroy those remaining  vestiges  of  social  barriers  that
stand in the way of unfolding our freedom. Let me say, unwillingness  to  do
so will be injurious to our common humanity.

The President also urged South Africans to develop  active  lifestyles  that
will contribute to a healthier nation, a decrease in  the  country's  health
bill and greater levels of productivity. Sport and recreation is  all  about
an active lifestyle and will, therefore, play a major role in  this  regard.
This calls, obviously, for joint initiatives with the Departments of  Health
and Education.

Sport and recreation  continues  to  be  a  vehicle  amongst  the  youth  in
particular. It promotes positive experiences. We aim to  counter  antisocial
behaviour and to promote a sense of belonging. We  aim  to  assist,  through
sport, a community spirit in  pursuit  of  greater  social  cohesion,  crime
prevention and moral regeneration.

The President emphasised the need for promoting co-operative  governance  in
our society, especially between the three spheres of government.  Sport  and
recreation is delivered at the local level,  where  communities  participate
socially, recreationally and in formal  sport  and  recreational  clubs.  We
have to  ensure  that  the  structures  at  these  levels  are  sufficiently
capacitated to ensure that sport and recreation services are delivered,  and
in a way that provides the basis for getting the nation to play.

We have to ensure  that  the  Integrated  Development  Programmes  of  local
authorities, the Growth and Development Strategies of the provinces and  the
National Spatial Perspective of the national Government are  in  sync.  This
is an objective of our Government that we dare not fail. In  particular,  we
have to ensure that the local sphere of government continues  to  prioritise
and invest in sport and recreation facilities, getting our nation  to  play,
and improving the quality of life of our people.

When we think of the needs of the majority of the  people  of  our  country,
the most important and pressing need is job creation, income generation  and
poverty  alleviation.  As  Sport  and  Recreation,  we  have  taken  up  the
challenge.  We  commit  to  this  with  the  knowledge  that  certain  local
authorities are under pressure not to prioritise  sport  and  recreation  in
terms of expenditure.

We trust that all local authorities will assist in ensuring that we get  the
nation to play in such a way that  sport  and  recreation  will  affect  the
lives of our people on a daily basis. We  ask  for  the  commitment  of  the
local authorities to our programmes, because it is in our communities  where
the Makhaya Ntinis, the Lucas Radebes, the Ezekiel Sepengs and  the  Bakkies
Bothas  are.  In  fact,  our  communities  and  our  youth  deserve   better
opportunities.

Sport and recreation also contributes to the economic objectives as set  out
by Government in other ways. As part of the national  strategy  for  hosting
international events in our country, we have turned to the  lucrative  world
of bidding for and hosting major sport events. As a matter of  interest,  we
conducted an economic impact study on the 2003 Cricket World  Cup  that  was
hosted by South Africa. It is estimated that  the  economic  impact  of  the
Cricket World Cup on South  Africa,  in  terms  of  South  African  economic
activity, was R2 billion. In terms  of  the  net  foreign  spending  in  the
country, the economic impact was R1,1 billion. That indicates  the  benefits
for the economy when such events are hosted.

Foreign visitors, for instance, viewed the 2003 Cricket World Cup in a  very
positive light. The main concern of visitors before  the  event  was  safety
and security. However,  this  concern  showed  the  biggest  improvement  in
ratings before and after the event. In fact, 99% of visitors indicated  that
they would return to South Africa and would recommend it  as  a  destination
to others.

May I just say to this august House that the findings  of  this  survey  are
published on our website. Just click there and get to know what this is  all
about.

The Cricket World Cup is a minor international event. The Soccer  World  Cup
is the second biggest sports spectacle in the world, surpassed only  by  the
Olympic Games. The benefits to our country of that event  in  2010  will  be
immense. We will have to plan and prepare together to ensure  that  we  reap
the maximum benefit from it. We must  ensure  that  the  continent  and  our
region benefits. It is our duty to consolidate as Africans and to  show  the
world who we are, what we are and what it is that we can offer.

Whilst on the hosting of international events, we must refer to  bidding  in
general. While we are acutely aware of the extent  to  which  hosting  major
international events is prestigious to federations and to  our  country,  we
have to do it in a responsible way.  We  do  not  want  to  be  seen  to  be
gluttonous by other countries. We also do not want  to  offend  African  and
other countries by being too robust in competing for such events. To  manage
the situation, we are in the process of finalising our bidding  and  hosting
strategy for sporting events. This will be part  of  the  national  strategy
for hosting international events.

In  our  view,  the  starting  place  to  achieve  success  at  the   elite,
international level, is to get the basics right.  Community  clubs  must  be
revived and our children in township and village schools  must  be  assisted
to participate in sport. School sport  is  a  nursery  for  participants  in
senior competitions. School sport is a crucial  lever  in  empowering  young
people towards healthy and active, but disciplined lifestyles. There  is  no
short cut to this. There are many reasons for nonparticipation in  sport  by
most schoolchildren. One key reason is the absence of a  well-oiled  machine
to organise and manage school sport. Township and village schools  need  the
most support in this regard.

We are strongly arguing  here  for  focused  attention  on  the  school  and
community clubs in building a broad base  for  talent  scouting,  developing
and nurturing. This is the mass that will transform society  and  eventually
deracialise it. We must go back to Wednesday  afternoons  as  school  sports
day. But this cannot happen by chance. The Department of Education  and  our
department are currently fine-tuning how this vision should be implemented.

This presentation cannot be complete if we say nothing about  transformation
in sport. We are fully aware that sport is a voluntary association and  part
of the organs of civil society. But  even  this  characterisation  of  sport
does not afford it immunity from changing towards a nonracial and  nonsexist
dispensation. As such, Government  cannot  fold  its  arms  when  things  go
against the grain of our strategic objectives and contrary to the spirit  of
our Constitution. This is why  we  will  guide  and  assist  federations  on
policy-related issues and on issues that impact on change.

In  this  context,  we  have  already  pronounced  that  we  will  not   ask
federations to go back to quotas. It  is  important  to  remember  that  the
federations themselves used quotas as a tool  to  encourage  respresentivity
in our teams. The federations have since abandoned quotas. We are not  going
to revive them.

But nobody can deny that the intended  development  of  black  talent  never
really resulted from quotas. Black children  from  ex-model  C  schools  had
their talent developed, and it blossomed. They were then window-shopped  for
the purpose of window-dressing provincial and national teams.  Their  talent
was relegated to a status of a tolerated quota player. This  diminished  the
dignity and pride of talented black players. They continue  to  be  seen  as
outsiders who must be subjected to the  paternalistic  attitudes  of  racist
relics.

Our focus will rather be to build the right attitude and skills from  below.
The dinosaurs at the professional and top levels will perish  by  attrition.
We want to encourage South Africans and young players  not  to  be  derailed
from nation-building and reconciliation by such racist pranks as  the  flags
of apartheid South Africa that often appear at some of our sports  stadiums.
All our youth must side with the future. The future is a  united,  nonracial
and nonsexist South Africa. Our teams must now build towards that.

To conclude, sport is always a reflection of the type of  society  a  ruling
class is trying to build. Our  Government  is  trying  to  build  a  united,
nonracial and responsible society. We are trying to restore the  dignity  of
all our people and infuse them with a spirit of  caring  and  tolerance  for
others' differences. We hope  to  fast-track  the  catch-up  programmes  for
previously disadvantaged groups  and  communities.  We  are  confident  that
there are many South Africans from all walks of life who are ready to  enter
into this contract with us. Now is the time! ``Nako ya  Afrika  e  fitlhile.
Ke a go leboga.'' [Africa's time has come. I thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Hon Chair, hon Minister, Deputy Ministers, MECs  present  here,
all special delegates and hon members, I want to take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate the Minister of Education and his Deputy - and,  of  course,  I
must also include the Minister and Deputy Minister of Sport  and  Recreation
- on  their  appointment  to  head  -  politically  -  this  very  important
department in  our  country.  This  department  is  at  the  centre  of  our
transformation agenda.

Clause 29, section 1 of our Constitution states in no uncertain terms  that,
and I quote:


  (i) Everyone has the right -


       (a)  to a basic education, including adult basic education; and


       (b)  to  further  education,  which  the  state,  through  reasonable
           measures, must make progressively available and accessible.

This is the cornerstone of the mandate of the  Department  of  Education  at
the national and provincial levels.  Since  the  advent  of  the  democratic
order in our country, the education authority  has  been  hard  at  work  to
realise its noble and lofty ideals. In this regard, we can safely  say  that
there has been  a  remarkable  achievement  in  dismantling  the  fragmented
apartheid education system and, on its ruins, building a  democratic  system
of education  poised  to  produce  balanced  learners  who  will  contribute
meaningfully to the growth and development of our country.

The entire legislative framework is now in place and the department can  now
only move from victory to victory. This does not suggest,  of  course,  that
there are no challenges, as the road ahead is not adorned  with  roses.  The
department itself has identified five priority areas which it would want  to
deal with in the next five years. As a committee, we agree  with  them,  and
in our oversight work we  will  be  watching  with  keen  interest  how  the
department addresses these problems.

A review that the department undertook last  year  reveals  that  there  are
many hidden costs, as the Minister has indicated, that affect  our  children
in schools, especially in the previously disadvantaged  areas.  These  range
from lunches to learning materials. It was also found that  there  are  many
schools out there which are breaking the law by not exempting students  from
poor families from paying school fees.

Some schools continue to withhold learners' reports and others exclude  them
from participating in some school activities because  of  the  inability  of
their parents to pay school fees. We are saying  that  in  addressing  these
problems  the  department,  including  the  provinces,  must  also  consider
criminal charges against such schools. This is so because it is  clear  that
they are disregarding the supreme law and other laws of our country.

Moreover, the Freedom Charter, our  policy  document,  says,  and  I  quote:
``The doors of learning and culture shall be opened.'' It does not say  that
these will be open only to those  who  have  money,  but  to  all.  In  this
regard,  we  also  welcome  the  idea  of  looking  at  the  possibility  of
abolishing school fees in the poorest schools.

Adult basic education is a prerequisite if we are  serious  about  banishing
illiteracy in our country. This is a legacy we inherited and it is a  factor
to the further development of our country. We agree  that  Government  alone
will  not  succeed  in  the  war  against  illiteracy  if  communities   and
nongovernmental organisations are not putting the  shoulder  to  the  wheel.
We, therefore, call upon public representatives, here and elsewhere  in  our
country, to take the lead in  the  struggle  against  ignorance.  We  cannot
afford to have illiteracy continuing unabated in this world of  science  and
technology, lest we remain on the periphery in this globalising world.

The decision to move the  National  Schools  Nutrition  Programme  from  the
Department of Health to the Department of Education was a correct one.  This
will go a long way towards ensuring proper monitoring,  because  it  is  the
education officials who are at schools at  all  times.  Besides,  this  will
mean that the department will be responsible for the overall development  of
the child when at school. One educationist, called Duminy, once said:  ``The
whole child goes to school.

Certain provinces  have  identified  some  challenges  with  this  programme
where, for example, you have two children from the same poor family. One  is
given food and the other is not,  because  he  is  above  Grade  Seven.  The
reality is that both these children are  hungry.  The  question  is:  Is  it
proper to give food to one and deny the other? But we  can  say  with  pride
that some provinces are using creative methods to address this problem,  and
we hope that they will share those  methods  with  us  here  today,  because
provinces are represented here today.

The President, in his state of the nation  address,  raised  very  pertinent
issues relating to education. For the sake of  this  debate,  we'll  confine
ourselves to those issues that are concurrent or relate to section 76  only.
He said, and I quote:


  By the end of this financial year  we  shall  ensure  that  there  is  no
  learner and student learning under  a  tree,  mud  school  or  any  other
  dangerous conditions that expose learners and teachers to the elements.

Furthermore, he said:


  ... we expect all schools to have access to clean water  and  sanitation,
  on which I will lay more emphasis in this financial year.

The national department is  responsible  for  norms  and  standards,  policy
formulation and its monitoring. It is the provinces  that  must  see  to  it
that there is realisation of these directives from the President.  Now  that
the provinces  are  represented  here  today,  they  must  tell  us  of  the
programmes they have put in place to realise these in this  financial  year,
as the President directed. Do they have the necessary budget to  do  so?  Do
they have the necessary capacity? What is it that they want Treasury or  the
national department to help them with? Will they augment their  budget  with
provinces' own revenue to address these problems? Provinces must  shout  for
help now. They must not wait until the end of the financial  year,  when  we
ask them how far they have gone, only to tell us that they did not have  the
required resources.

Addressing the Ghanaian Parliament on the  noble  task  of  teaching,  on  6
December 1960, Kwame Nkrumah said, and I quote:


  Our teachers, in whose hands, metaphorically speaking, lies the future of
  Ghana, must be dedicated men and women. Their efficiency  must  be  self-
  evident, for I believe and know it to be true that the more  efficient  a
  person is in his profession, the more likely he is  to  regard  it  as  a
  vocation, and subsequently the more dedicated he would be.

This truism was said more than forty years ago, yet it is  so  relevant  and
so fresh even today. However, we must add that dedication needs  recognition
and reward, and that we must endeavour to recognise and reward our  teachers
in order for them to know how we value them. Many teachers out there, I  can
tell you, have very low self-esteem.

When we address the problem of rampant poverty in schools, we  believe  that
we must adopt a holistic approach and also address the  problem  of  poverty
among teachers. I come from that situation and I know  how  it  is.  We  say
this conscious of the competing priorities of Government. We also know  that
the best investment that any government can make is investment in  the  grey
matter between the ears of a child.

We regard as one of the most important functions of  Sport  and  Recreation,
the provision of sporting facilities for the nation to pursue its  interests
and hobbies in an organised manner. This enables young  people  to  discover
and develop their talents  to  the  advantage  of  the  nation.  Sports  and
recreation instil  in  young  people  high  regard  for  great  virtues  and
patriotism, and unselfish service to their communities and  the  country  in
general.

Sport and Recreation has, since the advent  of  democracy  in  our  country,
laid a solid foundation for infrastructure development through the  flagship
programme known as Building for Sport and Recreation. At the centre of  this
programme is, in fact, the creation  and  upgrading  of  sports  facilities.
But, creation of infrastructure alone would not address the problem  if  the
Ministry of Sport and  Recreation  is  itself  not  transformed  to  broaden
access, as we know where we are coming from.

We have to move  away  from  the  situation  in  which  certain  sports  are
associated with certain racial groups or seen to be belonging to  a  certain
elite. When a South African  team  participates  in  international  sporting
activities, it must not be mistaken for  a  European  team.  It  must  truly
represent the demographics of this country. Of course, a lot has  been  done
in trying to realise this.

School sports can play a pivotal role  in  moulding  balanced  children.  We
believe that co-operation between the Departments  of  Education  and  Sport
and Recreation will be at  the  centre  of  successfully  implementing  this
programme. We, therefore, believe that proper education can only take  place
if our boys and girls are healthy, have a healthy mind in a healthy  body'',
as they say.

In conclusion, may I say, as it is said, and I quote:
  A little learning is a dangerous thing; drink  deep,  or  taste  not  the
  Pierian spring. There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking
  largely sobers us again.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms O TSOPO (Free  State):  Madam  Chair,  hon  Minister  Ms  Pandor,  Deputy
Ministers,  colleagues  in  education,  sports  and  recreation,  hon   NCOP
members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  hon  Minister,  Ms  Naledi   Pandor,
addressed key issues of  our  education  system  during  her  budget  speech
today. In support of her speech, I will highlight some, though not all,  the
issues or challenges facing the Free State department of education.

One of the  bigger  challenges  facing  us  is  the  implementation  of  the
employment equity plan within the department.  This  is  in  line  with  the
departmental strategies and targets. We  need  to  increase  the  number  of
persons with disabilities employed by the department from 0,5%  to  2%  over
the next two years.

We will also be addressing the poor male: female ratio at management  level,
including school management level, starting from this financial  year.  This
will be done on merit, as we cannot afford  to  compromise  quality  service
delivery to our deserving communities. As the Minister  has  stated  before,
there are many more women than men in  our  country's  demographic  profile.
Therefore, the social progress of our country requires that we  nurture  all
our talent.

In order to improve effectiveness  and  efficiency,  as  well  as  eliminate
duplication and wastage, the department has already deployed  its  managers,
starting from chief directors to  assistant  managers.  The  said  officials
assumed their new roles on 14 June 2004, and this was done during the  first
phase of this process as  there  are  still  other  phases  to  come.  As  a
department,  we  will  also  be  filling  several  critical  vacant   posts,
especially the eight  accountant  posts,  mainly  to  increase  capacity  at
district level and establish a fully-fledged internal audit unit.

Since the inception of the skills levy and skills  development  legislation,
the Free State department of education has made available 1% of  its  salary
bill  for  the  human  resource  development  of  its  employees.  For  this
financial year, special focus will be on employees of the  lowest  level  of
the organisation. On the other hand, the department wants to accelerate  the
elimination of unqualified and underqualified educators  within  our  system
during the MTEF period.

[As we continue to develop  and  strengthen  the  Department  of  Education,
which has the interests of our nation  at  heart,  we  are  going  to  offer
thorough care and support to poor  households  and  struggling  children  by
providing them with transport to school in  this  financial  year.  This  is
only meant for children who walk a distance of  21  km.  Four  million  rand
have been put  aside  to  implement  the  programme  in  Xhariep  and  Thabo
Mofutsanyane.

To improve the standard of  education  of  children  staying  on  farms,  we
opened hostels that had been closed to give these  children  a  place  of  a
high standard to stay close to schools near  towns.  The  822  learners  are
also being given nutritious food of top quality that  is  good  for  healthy
bodies. Nine million rand  is  being  put  aside  to  carry  this  programme
forward.

According to the statistics of the department, there are 31 000  orphans  in
schools in the Free State. These orphans must not  be  made  to  pay  school
fees, and I want to  emphasise  that  schools  should  not  to  ignore  this
principle.  To  help  orphans  and  the  schools  they  are  attending,  the
department has put aside R1,5 million for this financial year.

The transfer of the feeding programme for children from  the  Department  of
Health to the Department of Education was well done. At present the  feeding
programme is going well  in  all  the  regions,  as  planned.  The  159  082
learners who are found in those rural regions benefit from  this  programme.
We intend to expand this programme to 287 000 children next year,  until  we
cover learners at secondary schools.]

We have already made strides regarding further education and  training,  and
have  already  signed  learnership  contracts.  To  date,   84   learnership
contracts have been signed between further education and  training  colleges
and the following Sector Education and  Training  Authorities:  the  Primary
Agriculture   Education   and   Training   Authority,   the   Manufacturing,
Engineering and Related Services Seta and the  Forestry  Industry  Education
and Training Authority.

Three new programmes and learnerships will be introduced this year, and  the
enrolment at further education and training colleges  increased  by  15%  in
2003.  We  are  currently  mobilising  to  ensure  that  we  increase   this
percentage in this financial year. The budget for the further education  and
training sector was therefore increased  by  12%  to  R128,978  million.  In
addition to this, R1,08 million was set aside for maintenance.

As regard adult basic education and training,  our  challenge  is  to  align
further education and training activities with  adult  basic  education  and
training activities to ensure that this sector becomes  more  effective.  As
the President mentioned during his state of the nation address, we shall  be
expanding the reach  of  adult  basic  education  and  training  programmes,
aligning them with the training objectives  of  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme.

We are indeed committed to changing the way our adult  basic  education  and
training centres are run. We are in the process  of  establishing  effective
mechanisms and strategies to attract  more  learners  to  the  centres.  The
budget allocated this year is R85, 060 million.

[In the field of technology  we  have  already  implemented  the  E-Learning
programme.  This  was  done  with  the  main  intention  of  developing  and
implementing the department's main task, which is to provide curriculums  at
our institutions. To launch the E-Learning programme R30  million  has  been
set aside in this year's budget.]

In 1994 our department inherited huge backlogs  in  classrooms  and  related
infrastructure at the historically disadvantaged areas within the  province.
The department needed to build 165 new schools in order  to  provide  access
for learners in these areas. This backlog was reduced from 165 in  1994,  to
49 in 2004, and was achieved in partnership with the  department  of  public
works, roads and transport.

In 1994 there were 71 platoon schools in the province, and  by  the  end  of
2004, there will only be 19 platoon schools. A further  10  platoon  schools
are envisaged to be built within the MTEF period, thus effectively  reducing
them to nine. An amount of R10 million has been allocated  for  the  day-to-
day maintenance of schools, while  R31,28  million  has  been  allocated  to
school renovations, and R122,598 has been allocated  for  capital  works  in
this financial year.

[Our main aim as the department, is to speed up the projects  for  supplying
water, electricity, sewage and telecommunication services to all people  who
are not connected at all now. This  is  in  line  with  our  declaration  of
intent or manifesto. In order to achieve this, we must work  in  partnership
with departments such as the Department of Water Affairs  and  Environmental
Affairs and Forestry, together with Eskom and Telkom.

About 260 schools will be revamped and renovated yearly in  the  next  three
years. As much as 60% of these aid programmes will be part of our  education
action plan in rural areas. This  will  help  to  improve  the  standard  of
teaching and learning in our schools throughout the province.  The  standard
of telecommunications will make it easier for  those  who  are  involved  in
education, where important issues are  discussed  in  relation  to  national
education in our country.]

In conclusion, this really is a mammoth  and  daunting  task  we  are  faced
with. However, we still recommit ourselves as the Free State  department  of
education to living up to our vision of improving the  quality  of  life  of
all Free State citizens, by providing quality, lifelong learning,  education
and training.

I therefore support the budget speech of the Minister. [Applause.]
Ms D ROBINSON: Madam Chair, hon Ministers and hon members, firstly, I  would
like  to  congratulate  Minister  Pandor  on  her   appointment.   It's   an
appointment that many have welcomed, as we know that she has  the  interests
of quality education at heart -  quality  as  it  applies  to  learners  and
educators alike. I was also glad to hear that she shares my love  for  books
and the need for libraries - a great lady to have at the helm!

I was also encouraged to read that the Minister had  some  genuine  concerns
about the impact and implementation of  OBE.  I  trust  that  the  issue  of
continuous assessment will be one that you will pay attention  to,  as  this
is one of the main causes of low morale experienced by  educators.  Many  of
them feel that they are drowning  in  endless  paperwork  and  do  not  have
enough time to get on with the job  of  teaching.  Outcomes-based  education
has also become very expensive for parents as the  departments  do  not  all
provide the resources. Many of the teachers, especially in the rural  areas,
have not been adequately trained, so they struggle  to  cope.  Many  schools
suffer the additional disadvantage of being far from libraries and  so  have
no access to reference works.

So, I will renew the call  I  made  last  week  for  increased  spending  on
libraries, but this time in the words of Eleanor Sisulu and  the  historian,
Paul Zeleza - for your benefit, Mr Dugmore. Books and libraries are  clearly
not a developmental luxury but an essential, especially in  the  information
age. A culture of literacy and reading is essential, not only  for  cultural
growth but also for economic growth and development. We need  to  lobby  for
the three Ls - language, literature  and  libraries.  We  need  to  convince
those who control the national purse strings: no books, no renaissance.

When we speak about the needs of learners, we must  never  forget  that  the
morale of educators is also a vital  factor,  that  educators'  rights  must
also be protected - not just those of the learners. It seems as if there  is
an imbalance, and the teachers  are  left  feeling  inhibited,  nervous  and
vulnerable because the Big Brother  is  watching.  The  threat  of  hearings
hangs over their heads like the sword of Damocles.

For effective functioning, there should be mutual respect between  learners,
educators and the provincial  departments.  The  leadership  style  of  some
departments leaves much to be  desired.  High-handed  autocratic  attitudes,
lack of adequate  communication  on  issues  that  affect  teachers  -  both
administrative and professional - lead to demotivation.

The DA is concerned that some provinces,  such  as  Limpopo,  have  not  yet
finalised their teachers' redeployment programme.  There  are  teachers  who
have been employed for more than seven  years  but  are  still  regarded  as
temporary. They have to wait for up to  three  months  or  more  to  receive
their pay. The usually vocal teachers' union, Sadtu,  is  mum  because  they
have lost touch with their mandate. What has  happened  to  the  Batho  Pele
service standards? This is a problem that is of great  concern  to  the  DA,
and I call for an urgent investigation.

The loss of  music  and  art  tuition  to  the  school  system  has  been  a
tremendous blow to our society. Not only has  our  cultural  landscape  been
denuded, but the talents of many pupils are being stunted.  Many  who  could
make a living as musicians or composers are being denied this.  We  urgently
need to re-employ all those music and art teachers who can add value to  the
lives of our talented youth.  This  policy  has  affected  particularly  the
poor, who cannot afford to have private lessons. We need to encourage  South
African  composers  and  musicians  to   grace   our   big   festivals   and
celebrations.  Why  not  arrange  competitions  and  sponsorships  for   the
talented? Why should we import  music  from  abroad?  South  African  talent
should be nurtured. We need well-rounded citizens.

One of the challenges South Africa faces is the growing concern  of  parents
from all socioeconomic backgrounds about the quality of education  of  their
children. Many attempts have been  made  to  assure  parents  that  all  the
changes that have been made and the  increased  spending  on  education  are
evidence of progress. But we cannot just accept that  all  the  spending  is
necessarily investment in the future. How the funds are applied is vital.

The declining matriculation exemption passes and  the  poor  performance  of
South African learners in the Third International  Mathematics  and  Science
Study, Timms, is cause for concern. Parents  fear  that  this  will  have  a
negative impact on the learning and earning capacity of  their  children  as
they now compete in a more open  economy.  They  also  know  that  they  are
having to pay more and more for their children's education and  they  wonder
whether they are getting value for money.
Similar concerns about quality have been  expressed  at  the  level  of  the
state. One example is from the review of financing, resourcing and  cost  of
education in public schools. There is considerable evidence  that  indicates
that the quality of education in South African schools  is  worryingly  low,
relative to what South Africans spend on schooling.

Scores that measure reading skills amongst Tanzanian learners are about  50%
higher than South Africans scores.  This  confirms  the  increasing  concern
about the quality of the  educational  outcomes  as  well  as  about  uneven
distribution. Over the past decade,  the  apartheid  barriers  to  education
have been dismantled and we have moved, through transformation,  to  a  more
equitable dispensation. We welcome this, but the real challenge lies in  how
we deal with the issue of quality, as this will determine the future of  our
country. This will also be the deciding factor when parents decide where  to
enrol their children.

What are parents asking for? They are asking for safe  and  stable  schools.
This refers not only to the safety of the school  environment  but  also  to
substance abuse and disease. They want  strong  management  and  leadership;
provision of clear,  understandable  and  accurate  information  about  what
their children will be learning  at  school;  some  informed  discussion  at
school  level  about  subject  choice,  standards  and  learning   material;
properly qualified and well-prepared educators equipped  to  deal  with  the
curriculum  -  and  I  welcome  the  news  that  you  have  given  us  about
improvements in this area; adequate arrangements  for  children  to  receive
learning support material; a credible and understandable  assessment  centre
that  reflects  progress;  reporting  on  this  progress  that   is   clear,
consistent and regular; details of and  assurance  about  the  validity  and
status of qualifications to be obtained at various points of  possible  exit
from schooling, ie General Education and Training Certificate,  and  Further
Education and Training Certificate; and clear,  believable  benchmarks  that
show the health of the system.

We are indeed heartened to hear how Minister Stofile is  wanting  to  revive
the culture of sport at school. That time will be set aside. The  discipline
that comes with participation in sport and  being  part  of  a  team  builds
character and can only be beneficial to  our  learners  and  increase  their
self-esteem. We must never underestimate the value of role  models  and  our
sporting heroes. Increased involvement and interest in sport  will  help  to
reduce delinquency, crime and drug abuse - problems that beset our youth.

Efforts to encourage indigenous sport, particularly morabaraba  and  moruba,
are  to  be  commended.  Striving  for  excellence,  whether  in  sport   or
education, is what will make South Africa a winning nation. Let this be  the
goal that unites us for  the  mutual  benefit  of  all  our  people.  Enkosi
kakhulu! [Thank you very much.] [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chair of Chairs, hon Ministers, hon MECs, special  delegates
and hon members of the House, I want to start by congratulating the hon  Mrs
Naledi Pandor on her election as Minister of Education, Mr  Enver  Surty  as
Deputy Minister of Education, and Mr Gert Oosthuizen as Deputy  Minister  of
Sport and Recreation. I know that you will do well in your  portfolios,  and
we wish you all good luck and strength in your terms of office.

Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress  in  education.
Education is one of the most important long-term investments a  country  can
make. The first decade of our democratic  Government  witnessed  significant
reform in education. Major achievements in education have been made  in  the
past, and I am glad to hear the Minister announce that the  Government  will
still be looking at ways to improve and enhance our education system.

An extremely worrying factor is the drug abuse in our schools.  As  we  have
seen in the media, some of our schools have already  become  one-stop  shops
for selling drugs to our students at school. We  must  also  recognise  that
substance abuse  is  a  complex  problem  and  that  interventions  must  be
relevant to the particular context. In  all  cases  a  supportive  response,
aimed at correcting the problem, is  encouraged.  Random  drug  testing  and
searches must be encouraged at schools and parents must be involved as  soon
as possible.

We must actively try to promote the support  base  between  teacher,  parent
and student at our schools. Children learn best when  parents  and  teachers
work together in partnership and when they  share  responsibility  for  this
partnership. Through this partnership, we should and would be able  to  root
out this drug abuse evil in our schools. Every child in  South  Africa  must
have a first-rate education, because there are no second-rated children  and
no second-rated dreams.

Sport and recreational programmes can and will play an important  role,  not
only in delivering services and highly needed benefits to the poor in  South
Africa, but also by providing income  and  training,  and  by  building  and
developing skills. The fabric of South African society is continually  being
transformed, creating greater stability and peace and laying the  foundation
for creating opportunities and circumstances in which  both  the  individual
and collective human potential of the nation can truly come to fruition.

Ministers, the New NP supports the goals set out by you and your  department
and we would like to thank you and your provincial  counterparts.  We  would
like to help you turn the tide to build and strengthen a  people's  contract
for a better South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C DUGMORE (Western Cape): Madam Chairperson, our  national  Minister  and
Deputy Minister of Education and Deputy Minister of  Sport  and  Recreation,
MECs, hon members, invited guests and comrades, I think we are  indeed  very
fortunate to have the combination of Ministers Pandor and Surty  who  worked
so closely and effectively within the NCOP, as many of us  who  have  spoken
here previously would bear testimony to. To have the  two  of  them  working
together, I am sure, fills us all with  great  hope  for  education  in  our
country. I know that we in the Western Cape will not  abuse  the  fact  that
our  national  Minister  is  actually  from  this  province,  but  we   will
definitely be calling on her from time to time to fulfil a special role.

It is really strange that Mrs Robinson doesn't  appear  to  have  leant  her
lesson, because when we were here last week she made certain very  incorrect
and confusing statements about books. I think it is clear  that  she  should
follow the example of the New NP which has now actually adopted the  Freedom
Charter which talks about a South Africa that belongs to all who live in  it
and which lays the basis for the people's contract  that  our  President  is
talking about, because when she talks about books all she can say is money.

The last time we were in this House I gave  her  the  example  of  a  school
which initiated a library project with the help of  the  local  authority  -
this is Pelican Park. They  actually  make  that  school  available  to  the
community every afternoon, every Saturday. I would appeal  to  her,  in  the
context that we are also discussing sport here today, to follow the  example
of Graeme Smith's partner, Minki van der Westhuizen,  who  is  taking  clear
steps  to  collect  learning  materials  and  helping  to  distribute  those
learning materials. Young people like that show more wisdom  and  commitment
than Mrs Robinson and all the  people  in  the  DA,  because  all  they  can
actually do is to come here and complain.

The whole issue of funding our libraries, all of us know,  is  part  of  the
process of our local authorities, our provinces, looking at  the  issues  of
powers and functions. What is also strange to me is that she talks  in  this
House about her passion for sport. Does she know  that  one  of  the  former
MECs for education in the Western Cape - who was and still is  a  member  of
her party - actively discouraged sport in school, and  said  that  all  that
was important was the issue of time-on-task, learning and reading?  And  yet
this DA is so confused after this election that they continue  to  send  out
mixed messages - the one  doesn't  know  what  the  other  one  is  actually
saying. [Interjections.]

We have seen once again that the New NP's Mr Adams,  who  spoke  before  me,
focused on a real issue confronting  our  learners,  that  of  tik  and  the
problem of drugs. It appears that  this  DA  is  living  in  another  world.
[Interjections.] Our Government welcomes the  sentiments  expressed  by  our
national Minister, both in the National Assembly last week  and  again  here
today in the National Council of Provinces.

I want to inform members  of  this  House  that  our  Minister  has  already
attended a number of meetings in our province. I can assure you, at the  FET
workshop for teachers in one of  our  districts,  of  the  response  of  our
teachers and managers to  our  Minister's  statement  that  she  is  working
towards a system in which managers in our education system manage a  climate
for our teachers to teach  and  learners  to  learn.  I  think  it  is  this
decisiveness and understanding of how we need  to  move  that  is  inspiring
people in regard to the leadership that our  Minister  is  actually  giving.
From our side in the province, we commit ourselves  to  taking  forward  her
call to improve access to quality education and better  performance  through
quality service and the creation of opportunities for all.

In fact, the manner in which, in particular today, the  DA  who  spoke  just
previously have, for instance, refused to acknowledge  -  as  our  Ministers
informed this House again today -  the  progress  which  has  actually  been
achieved is, I think, extremely disappointing. I think that we need to  have
an honesty in this debate to actually recognise that for the  vast  majority
of South Africans, there has been an improvement in  our  education  system.
People can feel that. It is not surprising that in 1994, 60% of  the  people
voted for the ANC and now in 2004 it has  reached  70%.  Something  must  be
going well that our people, and in particular our youth, support  this.  Yet
the DA, as I said ....

... hulle lewe in 'n ander wêreld. Hulle weet nie wat aangaan in  hulle  eie
areas nie. Hulle kom hierso en praat van dinge wat die gewone mense  op  die
grondvlak nie eintlik verstaan nie. [Tussenwepsels.] [...  they  are  living
in another world. They do not know what is happening  in  their  own  areas.
They come here and talk about things that people at grassroots level do  not
really understand. [Interjections.]]

So, our  Premier  in  our  province  has  adopted  the  strategy  of  Ikhapa
Elihlumayo - growing the Cape - and, in  fact,  this  is  a  strategy  which
informs the vision that we have set for our province of the Western Cape  as
a home for all.

Intshonakoloni ikhayalethu sonke. [The Western Cape is a home to all.]

Die Wes Kaap is 'n tuiste vir almal. [The Western Cape is a home to all.]

So the strategy to get to the home for all  is  Ikhapa  Elihlumayo,  and  we
have been challenged as a department to in fact provide the  human  resource
personnel for the Western Cape education department.

I would like to thank our national Minister again. I  am  not  sure  whether
members are aware that the framework for developing  a  human  resource  and
skills development strategy for the Western Cape was, in fact, developed  by
a committee of Dr Franklin Sonn and our hon Minister. It has some  fantastic
proposals here about how we need to develop our human resources to  actually
align them not only with the skills that our  economy  needs,  but  also  to
create  entrepreneurship  and  the  environment  in  which  further   wealth
creation can actually happen.
In fact, this strategy was basically endorsed by the Provincial  Growth  and
Development Summit in  the  Western  Cape  where  many  of  the  resolutions
endorsed the report which our national Minister was involved in. I  am  very
happy as well that our Minister has raised the issue  of  the  functions  of
national government and the functions of provinces.

Do you know, hon members, that in this  province  we  have  had  a  problem,
because previous MECs, in particular from the DA, have seen fit to  actually
declare a policy war against the  national  government  -  going  to  court,
fighting at every Council of Education Minister's meeting, so much  so  that
learning and teaching have actually been disrupted in  this  province?  That
has actually been a policy dichotomy which they have  created.  What  really
shocked me was that I thought when  the  hon  member  responsible  had  been
redeployed to the National Assembly, that there might be a  change.  But  in
response to our National Minister's speech in the NCOP, you  know  what  she
said? She said that given that there wasn't adequate literacy and  numeracy,
which we acknowledge as an issue in our province, parents should go  to  the
Constitutional Court; take the government to court.

Nou, waarmee is sy besig? Wie se geld wil sy nou al weer mors? [Now what  is
she doing? Whose money does she want to waste now?]

I want to request that the DA accept that this government has  a  democratic
and a legitimate mandate, that as we developed outcomes-based education,  we
revised the national curriculum, and we are moving, and that it is not  good
for members to try to create different  loyalties  among  certain  Education
department officials, which actually undermines  the  very  mission  of  our
Education department.

Hulle veroorsaak soveel verwarring hierso in die  Wes  Kaap  ...  [They  are
causing so much confusion here in the Western Cape ... ]

... that they are actually impacting on our  ability  to  achieve  what  our
national Minister and the Deputy Minister are trying  to  achieve.  We  have
had skirmishes, court battles, officials being misused  and  abused,  and  a
very negative climate actually being created. The one major problem that  we
have not come to accept is that people always want to  give  the  impression
that the Western Cape is better, etc, and in many ways we are proud of  what
we have achieved, but do you know that in our province five years ago  there
were only 20 African students doing maths on the higher grade?  Twenty!  And
because of the history of how our  province  has  developed,  many  coloured
learners have been directed towards just being artisans because there was  a
preference in this way. They were not encouraged to  actually  do  maths  on
the higher grade, yet people from the party that we all know  so  well  want
to stand up and say the matric results were the best.

However, if you actually look at this, why does Limpopo - a province  which,
as our Minister has informed us today, still has serious problems  -  do  so
well in higher grade? What have they actually been able to do right that  we
in the Western Cape and other provinces haven't? I  think  we  need  not  to
have study tours to Australia, but rather check what it is that  Limpopo  is
doing right that they are doing so  fantastically  well  when  it  comes  to
higher grade mathematics, because clearly they are achieving something.

But, of course, the DA will  just  say  money,  money,  money.  They  should
follow, as I said before, what the NNP did and look at the Freedom Charter.

Kyk na daardie Vryheidsmanifes. [Look at that Freedom Charter.]

Ukuba  uyayifunda  laFreedom  Charter  uyabona,  uzakuvuma  ukuba  kunenyani
phakathi kweFreedom Charter, iinyani  uyabona.  [If  you  read  the  Freedom
Charter you will agree that there is truth in it, you see.]

En dan sal ons begin om te werk. [And then we will start working.]

That is what we actually need to do. I  am  very  happy  that  the  national
Minister has referred to  the  challenges  that  we  face  in  literacy  and
numeracy.

Maar, Die Burger is nie reg as hulle sê dat een uit ses in die  Wes  -  Kaap
kan tel nie. [But Die Burger is not right when they say that one out of  six
can count in the Western Cape.]

This was a survey done with our Grade sixes, building on a  previous  survey
done with Grade threes. Clearly, it is a matter of great concern, which  our
national Minister also talked about  in  the  National  Assembly,  that  our
Grade sixes are not performing at the level that they should  be.  But  this
does not mean that they cannot read and write. Already, our  department  has
put 100 books into each and every school. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs A MOTSHEKGA  (Gauteng):  Chair,  hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  MECs
present, members of the NCOP,  permanent  delegates,  comrades,  ladies  and
gentlemen, as Gauteng we want to start off by stating that we fully  support
the Minister's Vote  and  are  committing  ourselves  to  ensuring  that  we
implement to the letter all the priorities identified  in  the  Vote.  After
the  Friday  debate  we  requested  the  department  to  study  closely  the
Minister's Vote to see if there were any gaps in  our  plans  and  what  the
Minister has announced as  priorities.  Priorities  in  education,  and  the
cycle we will be engaging in are expressed  formally  in  various  documents
from our manifesto as the ruling party  to  the  President's  state  of  the
nation address, the Minister's input, the Premier's priorities -  these  are
all contained in the priorities that we will be announcing on  the  30th  of
this  month  as  the  province.  On  the  whole  these  priorities  strongly
emphasise education's role in  transforming  society,  contributing  to  the
country's economic growth, bringing about social equity and development.

Minister,  we  are  quite  confident  that  our   predecessors   have   made
significant gains in the first decade of freedom and democracy in  achieving
a viable public schooling system. The challenge in the  next  period  is  to
consolidate  the  advances  made  since  1994  and  move  towards   quality,
excellence and innovation in schooling whilst continuing to broaden  access.
As the province we went into a workshop immediately after the elections.  In
subsequent meetings we endorsed amongst other  things  the  need  to  ensure
universal  access  to  early  childhood  development.  This  is   recognised
internationally as important for future sustainability.  We  also  committed
ourselves to improving the responsiveness  of  our  education  and  training
systems to the changing needs of our economy  and  particularly  the  growth
aspect which the Gauteng province is committed to.

Based on this we have been requested  as  the  department  to  be  the  lead
department in developing skills programme for the  province,  and  hence  we
will be looking forward to a discussion with the  Department  of  Labour  to
see how those  inform  the  programme  that  we  have  to  develop  for  the
province.  We  also  committed  ourselves  to  ensuring  that  our  training
programmes are able to respond to the fact many people do not  get  jobs  in
the formal economy in the  short  term,  yet  require  increased  skills  to
survive and improve the quality of their lives. Such  skills  include  Abet,
life skills and other practical skills for self-employment.

We also committed ourselves to paying particular  attention  to  the  skills
that would  lead  to  sustainable  livelihoods  in  the  rebuilding  of  our
communities and families and that would  reduce  social  conflict,  domestic
violence and the abuse of women and children. These will include  parenting,
life skills, awareness of substance  abuse,  and  education  about  HIV  and
Aids,  as  well  as  educating  our  kids  about  the  problems  of  teenage
pregnancy. We will be putting strong emphasis on  the  appropriate  skilling
of youth including through learnerships.

Again,  we  will  be  looking  for  your  guidance  in  terms  of   national
learnerships that have been put in place and as a province we will  also  be
awaiting guidance from the national department. We will  also  be  improving
investment in innovation research and  development  by  the  private  sector
through working closely with higher institutions  to  make  sure  that  they
capacitate us as a province.  One  of  the  challenges  that  we  see  as  a
province is that of  implementing  inclusive  education  for  children  with
special needs. There are still some problems that  are  not  going  away.  I
think we have not made the progress that we would want to  make  within  the
sector of special needs education.

Our other challenge is ensuring success in our efforts to  improve  learning
in  and  the  teaching  of  mathematics,  science  and  technology.  I   was
especially tasked by the Premier to give outputs in terms of how  we  ensure
that our children are not registered only for standard grade maths, but  are
assisted to participate in higher grade maths, paying special  attention  in
particular to the girl-child and encouraging  girl-children  to  participate
in the  science  and  maths  programme.  As  a  province  we  will  also  be
harnessing e-pedagogy and Gauteng online for the  benefit  of  our  learners
and teachers, because we  also  want  to  fight  the  digital  divide  which
manifests itself as a divide between the poor and the rich.

We will be improving  the  use  of  school  infrastructure  by  the  broader
community, including IT, because we also  want  to  turn  our  schools  into
community  centres  and  promote  life   skills,   citizenship   and   moral
regeneration issues through the schooling system.  We  are  quite  confident
that we have had quite a number of successes  especially  in  making  public
education a viable system. We have successfully transformed the  system  and
governance  of  education  delivery   in   Gauteng.   We   have   a   single
administration and have successfully completed the second elections for  our
school governing bodies. We have set up a  number  of  councils  and  bodies
which support  and  advise  us  as  government  and  we  have  improved  our
infrastructure in many respects. I think we have also fought the backlog.

We think that one of our  achievements  has  been  improving  the  level  of
quality in education in our province by increasing the  level  of  literacy.
We also think that we have been able to dent, though not  quite  adequately,
the level of illiteracy in the province. So we will  also  be  strengthening
our efforts, as also  mentioned  in  your  speech,  Minister,  in  terms  of
strengthening our Abet sector to make sure that it  helps  us,  finally,  to
break the back of illiteracy. The province has,  over  the  last  10  years,
increased access to primary and school education. The Western Cape  delegate
mentioned in his speech that we have a unique feature in  that  we  have  an
amazing ingrowth of learners. Currently, I know my department  is  panicking
about what we are going to do in admissions, because I am told it  does  not
matter how much we have planned, come January there  are  new  learners  who
have moved into the province making planning  impossible.  So  we  are  also
confronted with that problem, but we are sure we will be able to manage  and
make sure that no child is turned away or is not given access to education.

We also think that we have improved qualitatively, not only  quantitatively,
in terms of increasing access to  our  education,  because,  as  the  matric
results indicate, our current average now shows that we have moved from  78%
to 85%. The number of schools that had poor  pass  rates  has  been  reduced
dramatically - no school in Gauteng in the past year produced results  below
15%.

In terms of infrastructure, we think we have in a way tried to  address  the
inherited backlogs in infrastructure, though unfortunately as a province  we
also have the unique factor in that our good  infrastructure  is  locked  in
nongrowing areas. Therefore we  are  running  empty  schools,  and  have  no
schools in areas where there are people.  We  are  also  trying  to  address
that.
The gains made in the sphere of education and training must be leveraged  to
increase numbers in higher levels of  learning,  especially  in  the  fields
aligned to the required skill sets of growing economic  sectors.  Hopefully,
the above-mentioned and other initiatives will result in  a  changed  skills
profile in our population. Skills development outcomes must be  increasingly
aligned with job opportunities forecasted from the growing sector.

We will be giving more attention, as I  said  earlier,  Minister,  to  early
childhood development. Only 25% of children up to the age of six in  Gauteng
are attending the ECD site and those not attending are  most  likely  to  be
deeply poor and vulnerable to health  and  other  social  risks.  There  are
significant societal benefits from investing in  our  young  people.  Again,
the department is  ensuring  access  to  education  in  all  the  provinces.
Despite the fact that we say we have abnormal growth, we are  fighting  hard
to make sure that no child is turned away from our schools.

Some of our findings indicate that whilst  we  have  improved  in  terms  of
quality, the dropout rate, especially amongst  our  secondary  learners,  is
unacceptable. This is one of the areas that we will be  addressing  to  make
sure that we understand what causes our learners to drop out at such a  high
rate between Grades 9 and 11 and to ensure that we arrest  that  growth.  In
the meantime we are also looking at ensuring that we give more attention  to
and put more pressure on primary education.

We feel it is quite unfair to allow children to go through a weak  education
system, only putting pressure on them when they get to matric. We  will  pay
more special attention to our primary education. There has been  substantial
improvement in learner performance across all the districts  in  the  senior
certificate examinations and, as I said, the pass rate has improved  and  we
think that we will not go into reverse in  that  regard,  but  will  improve
quite dramatically.

Our vision as a department is  smart  service  delivery  of  quality  public
education, which promotes a dynamic  citizenship  for  socioeconomic  growth
and development of Gauteng and South Africa in general. We  want  to  be  at
the cutting edge of  curriculum  delivery  and  provide  access  to  quality
lifelong learning and opportunities. This will be shaped by  the  principles
of transformation, equity, redress and  ubuntu.  The  emerging  five  themes
from our plans are those of developing the spirit of learning  and  teaching
and contributing  to  the  national  identity;  implementing  a  technology-
enabled environment; providing high and  quality  and  effective  education;
developing the capacity to  ensure  efficient  delivery  of  education;  and
contributing to economic growth, poverty alleviation and job creation.

Before I run out of time, Minister, I want to quickly  respond  to  some  of
the issues  that  I  think  were  raised  in  your  speech,  which  we  will
undertake. I think one of the things that the Minister raised was the  whole
question about poverty and making sure that we  address  poverty  among  our
children. I am proud to  say,  Minister,  that  as  a  province,  under  the
leadership of Social Development, we have agreed on a single window  package
of services for children in  difficult  situations.  As  education,  we  are
excited about the programme, because we think it will  benefit  greatly  our
constituencies who are our learners. This  package,  amongst  other  things,
will ensure that children are given uniforms, are exempted from paying  fees
before they are even harassed into  motivating  why  they  can't  pay,  have
identification to allow them to go through a medical  system.  We  are  also
negotiating with the transport system to make sure that all children  within
the package are not being harassed or they are exempted from expenses.

In terms of what the Premier was saying and what you have said  Minister,  I
think the whole idea is to make the  education  system  affordable  so  that
it's not the safety net that we rely on, but is pro  poor  and  friendly  to
the poor. As I said, we are looking  at  ensuring  that  we  have  a  skills
programme that enables us to respond to the needs of the  province,  and  we
will be awaiting the results of your negotiations with Labour  and  see  how
we can fit in as a province.

The other issue that was raised in your address and also in the  President's
address is the issue of infrastructure. And, again, we are putting plans  in
place to make sure that we  address  the  needs  of  infrastructure  in  our
province despite the fact that we have abnormal  growth  and  very  abnormal
situations. For instance, we will have primary schools  with  up  to  3  000
children because of the lack of infrastructure.  We  are  putting  plans  in
place to make sure that we are able to address that.  We  are  also  working
hard to make sure that along national guidelines the FET  sector,  the  Abet
sector, the ECD sector also transform to  enable  them  to  respond  to  the
needs and the priorities identified by yourself and the President.

And in relation to clean water and sanitation, the  province  has  committed
itself to meeting this challenge, and  where  necessary,  we  will  even  be
bringing in potable water where we have no bulk provision of water  to  make
sure that we are able to provide water in our schools. In  relation  to  the
chairperson's view about nutrition, we as Gauteng are proud to say  we  have
even begun to pilot school nutrition or school programmes in poor areas  for
high school children. Although we do not have a huge budget, we  are  hoping
that we will be able to address this need. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms J MASILO: Thank you hon Chairperson. Hon Minister  of  Education,  Deputy
Ministers present here today, hon  members  of  the  House,  MECs  from  the
provinces and special delegates, I wish  to  extend  my  congratulations  to
both the Minister of Education and the Minister of Sport and Recreation.  We
are fully aware of the enormous responsibilities that these  two  Ministries
encompass.

When the ANC  envisaged  and  drafted  the  Reconstruction  and  Development
Programme, we wanted to ensure that we moved away from the gutter  education
that was our inheritance from the past. In  the  January  8  statement,  the
President of the ANC and the Republic of South Africa commented on the  fact
that one of our victories in the  struggle  against  poverty  should  be  to
build more classrooms so that  none  of  our  children  should  study  under
trees. The department has  responded  in  its  budget  by  accelerating  the
school building programme to adhere to the President's call that no  learner
will learn under a tree or in a mud school by the end of the year.

The ANC has consistently  insisted  that  everyone  should  have  access  to
education. More particularly, the poor should have  quality  education  that
will break the cycle of poverty that was the status  quo  in  the  past.  We
commend the department's focus  on  the  subsidy  to  schools,  particularly
those that are serving the needs of the poor communities. This will  help  a
lot in the funding structures at these schools to ensure that these  schools
are  adequately  provided  for  in  terms  of   infrastructure   and   basic
educational resources.

This will also ensure that poor communities are not  forced  to  pay  school
fees that are beyond their  means.  The  Department  of  Education  is  also
called upon by the President to expand the reach of the Abet  programme  and
align  it  with  the  training  objectives  of  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme. As the ANC we envisaged that the Abet programme would  give  back
to our people the education they had been denied, and have the  high  levels
of illiteracy eradicated completely. It becomes important,  therefore,  that
the  department  strengthens  its  monitoring   and   evaluation   reporting
structure on this Abet programme to ensure  that  a  province  such  as  the
North West can have an efficiently run programme that  will  not  be  closed
unnecessarily. We also need to ensure  that  educators  are  paid  on  time.
Essentially, we are  asking  the  department  to  clear  away  any  and  all
maladministration practices.

The ANC has to  congratulate  the  department  on  the  improvement  in  the
examination results generally, but  in  particular,  matriculation  results.
Abet candidates have in the past suffered a great disadvantage  with  regard
to examination results.  The  department  has  addressed  Abet  examinations
through  its  national  policy  that  requires  provincial  departments   on
education  to  establish  examination  boards.  It   would   then   be   the
responsibility  of  these  boards  to  facilitate  the  process  of   policy
formulation on examinations and any other matters such  as  examinations  in
adult centres in provinces.

The President highlighted the need to extend basic  infrastructure  such  as
water and sanitation to all schools by the end of this year.  We  know  that
our children find it difficult enough to  come  to  school,  fight  for  the
monies to pay school fees, buy school text books.  We  need,  at  least,  to
ensure that while they are at school they have the basic running  water  and
toilets to perform their ablutions.

A new danger has crept into  our  schools,  namely  that  young  people  are
becoming targets of drug and substance  abuse.  Increasingly  schools,  even
primary schools, are reporting a  huge  increase  in  the  number  of  young
children who become dependent on drugs. Poorer children resort  to  stealing
from neighbours, friends and even strangers to pay for their new habit,  and
richer children steal things from their parents and sell them. All  of  this
means that we now  have  a  large  group  of  young  children  resorting  to
antisocial behaviour in order to maintain their addiction.

Parents and teachers are fighting an almost losing battle to  try  and  turn
back the tide of substance abuse. All of us should  be  vigilant  to  ensure
that our vulnerable children are not used by druglords. ``Your child  is  my
child; my child is your child.''

We  believe  that  all  the  relevant  departments  should  work  with   the
Department of Education to fight against poverty. Some  of  the  areas  have
already been outlined by the  department,  such  as  investing  in  a  basic
minimum package to relieve the poorest learners from paying schools fees  by
giving them a 40% learner subsidy,  particularly  learners  from  rural  and
farming areas.

Other  poverty  relief  options  are  transport   subsidies   and   boarding
allowances. In the North West province, for  instance,  boarding  facilities
are being implemented and are accommodated in  the  2003-04  budget.  Halala
North West, halala! For children from far away rural and farming areas  food
security is already being budgeted for in  this  budget  cycle  through  the
Food Nutrition Programme as well as through food gardens. The Department  of
Health has handed over this responsibility to the Department  of  Education,
as from April 2004. As the ANC we are  happy  to  support  Budget  Vote  15:
Education. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon  members,  I  echo  all
members  in  congratulating  our  Ministers.  Education  is  power;  without
education the future is uncertain, disempowering and  gloomy.  That  is  why
parents from all walks of life do everything within their power  to  educate
their children at all levels, arming them with  the  knowledge,  wisdom  and
power they deserve in life, but this depends on the capacity and  capability
of both parents and children.

The  Department  of  Education  embraces  every  facet  necessary  for   the
promotion of effective education in the national and provincial  spheres  of
government. The programmes formulated are testimony to  this  endeavour.  In
order to drive these programmes in all areas meaningfully  and  effectively,
poor people must be taken into consideration, as it is  mostly  poor  people
who suffer when they fail to fulfil their obligations as  parents  owing  to
the socioeconomic problems  they  are  faced  with,  for  instance  poverty,
unemployment, low income, illness and other factors currently engulfing  the
normal societal status of individuals and their families.

The Constitution of the country  clearly  stipulates  that  everyone  has  a
right to education, but when it comes to achieving  this  for  some  parents
who fall within the  bracket  I  have  just  mentioned,  educating  children
becomes a heavy task, a struggle and a burden they  cannot  carry.  This  is
manifested by a failure to pay school fees, and buy books,  school  uniforms
and other requirements that are needed. Most  families,  especially  in  the
rural areas, depend on the old age pension of a family member for  survival.
A pensioner becomes the breadwinner for all the family  members,  young  and
old.

Education therefore becomes affordable to  middle  class  and  high  society
only. We are living in a country of haves and have-nots. The  Department  of
Education is the only hope  when  it  comes  to  easing  the  pressures  and
burdens, some of which I  have  just  mentioned,  experienced  by  the  poor
families.

Children from these families are chased away from schools as a way to  force
parents to pay school fees. If nothing can be done to assist them, they  end
up leaving school miserable and dejected, and, worse than that,  uneducated.
Some children walk very long distances to the nearest  school.  My  Minister
mentioned that in her speech. When they reach school they are tired,  hungry
and listless, and their concentration becomes affected.

The masters of the previous  undemocratic  government  contributed  a  great
deal  to  the  problems  I  have  just  mentioned.  We  salute  the  present
Government for introducing the feeding scheme  at  schools  as  a  means  to
promote good teacher-child relationships and effective education.

Imfundo iyisikhali sanamuhla. Bonke  abantwana  bayayidinga  empilweni  yabo
yonke.  Imfundo  iyifa  kodwa  manje   ubunzima   obuhlangabezana   nabazali
abaphokophelele  ukufundisa  abantwana  babo  kwenza  imfundo  ibe  wumqansa
kubazali. Kukhona inkinga  yemali  yesikole.  Umnyango  uyagcizelela  ukuthi
abantwana abangaxoshelwa le mali, kodwa bayaxoshwa nsuku zonke kuthi  abanye
bajeziswe  ngokuthi  bangahlolwa   ezifundweni   zabo.   Abanye   abayitholi
imiphumela yabo uma kwenzekile bahlolwa. Unya lolu  mhlonishwa  Ngqongqoshe,
asazi ukuthi uzolulungisa kanjani.

Imikhandlu  ephethe  izikole  okwakungezabamhlophe  bodwa  ayifuni   ukuxuba
izinhlanga. Umuntu uye athole ukuthi isikole  sixube  abantwana  bezinhlanga
zonke kodwa umkhandlu ugcwale abebala bodwa, bese kuba khona oyedwa  welinye
ibala  ukugcina  icala  lokuthi  umkhandlu  uxubile.  Akukuhle  neze  lokhu.
KwaZulu-Natali,  lapho  ngivela  khona,  kukhona  lokhu.  Lokhu  engikhuluma
ngakho akusiwo amabunge nje.

Ngize  kwimifundaze  -  uxhaso  lwemali  yokufunda  kulabo   asebezophothula
izifundo sengathi lunganezelelwa. Imali iyinkinga kubazali abahola  kancane.
Ngasohlangothini lolimi, uma ufuna ukugqilaza umuntu, mncishe ulimi  lwakhe.
Izingane zethu zisaxakwa ngolimi  lwesiNgisi  nesiBhunu  nanamhlanje.  Kanti
siyofika nini isikhathi lapho ingane izozikhethela ulimi eluthandayo?

Maqondana  nezinsiza-kufunda  ezikoleni  ezisemakhaya,  umthwalo   womnyango
ukugcwalisa lezi zidingo ukuze abantwana  bafunde  ngenkululeko.  Siyethemba
ukuthi isabiwomali somnyango siyokwazi  ukwengeza  kuthi  xaxa  kule  ndima.
Umnyango onezidingo eziningi kakhulu lo wemfundo.  (Translation  of  isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Education is a weapon nowadays. All the children need it  throughout  their
lives. It is  an  inheritance,  but  now  the  difficulties  encountered  by
parents who are determined  to  educate  their  children  make  education  a
serious problem for parents. There  is  the  problem  of  school  fees.  The
department stresses the fact that children  should  not  be  dismissed  from
school because of school fees. But every day  some  learners  are  dismissed
from school, while others are punished by being excluded from  examinations.
In certain cases those who  are  examined  have  their  examination  results
withheld from them. This is very cruel, hon Minister, and we wonder how  you
are going to rectify this.

The previously white school governing bodies do not want  racial  diversity.
One finds that the school is multiracial, and yet the school governing  body
is dominated by white people, save for one person of colour who  is  made  a
token just to give the impression that the governing  body  is  multiracial.
This is not fair. In KwaZulu-Natal, where I come from,  the  scenario  I  am
referring to here is a reality.

On the subject of bursaries, it would be a good idea to  increase  financial
assistance to students at the final level of study. Money is a real  problem
to parents with a low income. Regarding the issue of language, if  you  want
to enslave a person, deprive him of his language.  Our  children  are  still
being bombarded with English and Afrikaans even today. When  will  the  time
ever come when children can make their choice regarding language?

As far as teaching resources in rural  schools  are  concerned,  it  is  the
responsibility of the department to satisfy these  needs  so  that  children
can learn freely. We hope that the  department's  budget  will  be  able  to
provide more funds in this area. The Department of Education has  a  lot  of
needs.]

The IFP supports all measurable objectives  of  the  department's  strategic
plan, that is further education and training, as they empower  the  educator
with more knowledge  to  plant,  develop,  evaluate  and  maintain  national
policy and systems for further education and  training,  including  national
assessments and quality assurance systems. Programme 6, as we  have  stated,
focuses  on  an  effective  and  efficient  higher  education  system   that
contributes to fulfilling  South  Africa's  human  resource,  research,  and
knowledge needs.
The department should monitor the transformation process in all  schools  in
order to pay more  attention  to  educators,  school  governing  bodies  and
languages. Governing bodies must portray the demographic structures  of  the
institutions. This should apply to educators as well. Children must be  free
to select the language of their choice.

The department is faced with the massive task  of  building,  upgrading  and
renovating schools where these needs arise. We are also aware  of  the  need
for human resource  development  in  all  categories.  Your  budget  clearly
defines this. We just hope that all moneys will be utilised  effectively  to
avoid roll-overs. KwaZulu-Natal has a high  demand  for  capital  and  human
resources. The IFP supports the Budget Vote. I thank  you.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs  P  McKAY  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chair,  Madam  Minister,  Mr  Deputy
Minister, MECs, NCOP members and special delegates,  I  have  listened  with
interest today to what is happening in education and  what  is  intended  to
happen. I have a concern, coming from KwaZulu-Natal, in that we are  now  on
our seventh Minister of education and things have not gone very well in  our
province.
We have 3 million learners, 75 000 educators, 10 000 support  staff,  and  I
am afraid things are pretty much in disarray.  Nevertheless,  our  Minister,
Ina Cronjé, has in the two months since she has been sworn in travelled  the
length and breadth of the province to try to get a handle on what  is  going
on so that she can prioritise what needs to be prioritised.

We are aware that the  role  of  education  is  fundamental.  I  attended  a
meeting here in this city about three years  ago  that  was  hosted  by  the
Minister of Social Development, the hon Dr  Skweyiya.  Ninety-two  countries
attended the  meeting,  which  was  on  the  issue  of  eradicating  poverty
especially in developing countries.  What  came  out  of  that  meeting  was
education, education and more education.

I have heard concerns, including that of our hon Minister,  who  was  on  TV
this morning, about the Social Development  budget  increasing  and  thereby
impacting negatively on other budgets, including that of Education. I  think
we all know that the long-term prognosis for this country is to spend  money
on education so that we can gradually wean people off the  need  for  social
security. We heard Mrs Vilakazi speak about how many  people  are  dependent
on their old age pensions. We are well aware of this, but the future of  the
country is to educate people so that they will become  employable,  be  able
to go out to work and turn this situation around.

I am very sad to say that we are still picking up a lot of problems  in  our
province. We have stories, for example, of teachers  sharing  classrooms.  A
school recently came to my attention  where  the  teachers  teach  biweekly.
They put 80 children in the classroom, and the one teacher teaches  the  one
week and the other teacher the other week.

We still have problems on payday. If you go into the townships you will  not
find the children in school. How do you develop a culture of education  when
the teachers are not willing to educate?  We  have  to  do  something  about
that, and our Minister has committed herself to ensuring that this  sort  of
practice is eradicated.

We are also looking at the relevant curricula in terms of what we should  be
doing. For example, the  issue  of  children  walking  to  school  has  been
mentioned by Mrs Vilakazi and others. Our province is in  consultation  with
the Minister and  the  Department  of  Transport  about  trying  to  provide
transport so that children need not walk these  long  distances  to  school.
Today is the shortest day of the year and many children will  have  set  out
to go to school in the dark this morning, and will return  in  the  dark  if
they haven't already dropped out owing to the  problem  of  having  to  walk
those long distances.

Curricula have to be relevant for children such as street children who  drop
out of school. If one wants to  reintegrate  them  back  into  society,  you
cannot put  them  in  a  normal  classroom.  There  has  to  be  specialised
education for them, which is on the cards in terms of  schools  for  further
education and training.

The same goes for children who are dropping out of school in droves  because
their parents are ill and dying from Aids. Many children are now  having  to
leave the classroom to look after siblings and to  try  to  nurse  sick  and
dying parents. These children will need to come back  into  the  system  and
eventually catch up, and the system needs to  be  geared  up  to  cope  with
this.

There is concern in our province about schools  not  being  able  to  manage
their budgets, and our Minister went  to  a  school  ...  Oh,  my  time  has
expired. Thank you very much. This was  my  first  time  speaking  here.  We
support the Budget. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms P WILLIAMS (Northern Cape):  Hon  Chair,  I  was  confused  just  now;  I
thought I was in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.  Hon  Chairperson,  Minister
Pandor  and  Deputy  Ministers  Oosthuizen  and  Surty,  special  delegates,
comrades, ladies and gentlemen, the  Northern  Cape  province  congratulates
Minister  Naledi  Pandor  on  her  appointment  as  national   Minister   of
Education.

En in die Afrikaans van die Noord-Kaap wil ons vir u sterkte, gesondheid  en
wysheid toewens vir die volgende vyf jaar. [And  in  the  Afrikaans  of  the
Northern Cape, we wish you strength, health and wisdom  for  the  next  five
years.]

Allow me, hon Chairperson, to begin my speech  by  recalling  the  words  of
Gabriel Mistral, a Nobel Prize-winning poet from Chile in his poem  entitled
His name is:


  We are guilty of many errors
  And many faults
  But our worst crime is abandoning the children
  Neglecting the fountain of life.
  Many of the things we need
  Can wait
  The child cannot
  Right now is the time his bones are being formed
  His blood is being made
  And his senses are being developed
  To him we cannot answer: Tomorrow!
  His name is Today.

The results of the Senior Certificate  examinations  and  all  our  work  in
education is centred on the wellbeing of our children. And this  is  because
the steps we  take  today  will  determine  the  future  prosperity  of  our
country,  which  ultimately  belongs  to  our  young  people,   and   future
generations that will follow. We cannot and dare not let them  down.  It  is
with this thought in mind that we as a Northern Cape province  presents  the
following priorities: to improve school  functionality  and  ensure  quality
education in  schools,  the  successful  implementation  of  the  integrated
quality management system, presents a central plan  for  the  attainment  of
these objectives. The three systems  constitute  the  IQMS,  this  is  whole
school  evaluation  development  al  appraisal   system,   and   performance
management. And all three are critical  for  ensuring  school  functionality
and quality education in schools.  The  necessary  structures,  including  a
provincial training team, have been set up for implementation. All  schools,
including  the  principal  and  educator,  have  been  at  training  and  an
information manual is now being distributed to schools.

The Northern Cape education department  remains  totally  committed  to  the
full and  effective  implementation  of  the  IQMS.  The  school  management
development programme is also a priority and  is  geared  at  improving  the
efficiency of the school management, ie principals, deputies  and  heads  of
departments. A dedicated unit in the department  was  established  for  this
purpose. The unit  has  already  concluded  training  on  a  generic  school
management module for all principals with less than three years  experience.
The school governing body training indicates the critical nature  of  school
governance to ensure that schools are functional and that quality  education
in schools is assured.

The Northern Cape education department has the responsibility of  being  the
provincial  custodian  and  team  driver  for  human  resource  and   skills
development.  The  department  is  now  concluding  the  development  of   a
provincial human resource and skills development  strategy  and  plan.  This
plan will be clearly aligned  to  the  socioeconomic  growth  plans  of  the
province.

A provincial skills development forum has ensured that all departments  have
a  workplace  forum  in  place.  The  province  has  already  launched   its
internship programme by identifying and placing 200 interns.  In  line  with
the Minister's speech, strengthening the FET college sector is  crucial  for
human resource and skills development. The  two  merged  FET  colleges  will
elect new councils and have started to realign its  programme  offerings  to
be more  responsive.  Both  colleges  are  already  offering  a  variety  of
learnerships and positioning themselves to becoming the public providers  of
choice.

Skills development in the ABET sector further adds to this strategy.  Skills
programmes are offered in 20 centres,  also  in  conjunction  with  the  FET
colleges. Our  school  food  security  programme  is  at  the  core  of  our
endeavours to fight poverty and also represents a key initiative to  support
the objectives of the Expanded Public Works Programme. A total  of  178  000
learners in 575 schools and community ECD sites are being fed. Food  gardens
are being established at all primary schools.

The hon member from the DA  was  very  concerned  about  the  high  cost  of
education and the impact of that on the poor learner. We as a  province  are
saying that we fund through  the  funding  norms  and  standards  of  public
schools, that fund poor schools six times more than the rest  of  the  other
schools.

Our  commitment  to  transforming  the  curriculum,  teaching  and  learning
methodologies  remain  unchanged.  All  preparations  for  implementing  the
revised national curriculum statement in the intermediate phase in 2005  are
in place. All intermediate phase educators will be  trained  in  the  winter
vacations. Advocacy for  outcomes-based  education  in  the  FET  phase  has
already started. All schools with a  learner  enrolment  in  excess  of  100
already have a computer laboratory of at least 10  computers.  This  amounts
to 86% of all schools in the province. A project currently  underway  funded
by USAID aims to install internet connectivity and e-mail facilities at  254
schools. An ICT curriculum unit is being established to ensure that ICT  are
infused into the curriculum at all learning and teaching activities.
In conclusion, our other priorities  are  to  implement  the  ABET  Act  and
ensure growth in  the  sector  and  to  expand  provision  of  education  to
learners with barriers to learning by implementing  White  Paper  No  6.  We
will also expand access to reception year,  Grade  R.  and  ECD  programmes,
focus   on   mathematics,   science   and   technology,    improve    school
infrastructure, as agreed upon  by  the  National  Minister  and  provinces,
special focus on delivery in nodal areas - that is Galeshewe  and  Kgalagadi
- and to fight HIV/Aids. We therefore support the  budget  of  the  national
Minister. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev E ADOLPH: Hon  Chairperson,  National  Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  the
director-general of the Department of Education, MECs  and  all  members  of
this House, let me take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Pandor on  this
new and challenging  portfolio  in  which  you  involve  yourself  and  your
Deputy. You have also inherited a number of challenges within the  education
department. We have to commend your predecessors  for  achieving  a  lot  of
success in terms of restructuring the department, in terms of equity  and  a
host of other issues.

I don't have much time, however. There are such a  lot  of  tangible  issues
that you need to tackle, but I will restrict myself to  a  couple  of  them.
First of all, I'd like you to know that you have  a  budget  of  which  more
than 80% is being spent on salaries for teachers  and  educators,  and  that
that the rest will be spent on development and entrepreneurship as  well  as
capital projects. I'm not  sure  whether  you  will  beat  the  deadline  by
building 95 new schools by the end of  this  financial  year,  as  no  child
should be taught under a tree. That is the President's  obligation  and  his
instruction to  us,  by  the  end  of  March  2005.  With  this  little  and
inadequate budget, I'd like to know how you will  be  achieving  this  idea,
and also your vision of abolition school fees.

Let me get back to basics. We  in  the  ID  are  very  concerned  about  the
accessibility to school institutions for  our  learners.  We  are  concerned
about the exclusion of poor learners out of the education stream. It is  sad
to note that parents have to use social grants to pay the  school  fees,  to
keep their children in school, whereas it  is  a  Constitutional  obligation
that every child should have free access to school and education.  How  come
they have been excluded by huge amounts of money for textbooks, etc?
I'm also concerned about the fact that in some cases - I  wouldn't  say  all
cases - that you are struggling with the problem of incompetent managers  at
district level and other levels so  as  to  implement  your  priorities  and
policies according to the target set by the department itself. I would  also
like to focus your attention on the fact that  you  are  struggling  with  a
shortage of teachers and educators. It is time maybe that we reconsider  the
positions of those qualified, skilful educators, especially  in  the  scarce
subjects like mathematics,  science  and  technology.  They  took  severance
packages a couple of years ago; they are sitting  at  home  currently,  they
have the skills, and they are unemployed. Why can't  you  consider  bringing
them back and  enhancing  quality  education  to  our  learners  instead  of
retraining them? It would be a  more  cost-effective  process  incorporating
within the system again. Thank you. My other concern is integration  in  the
school system. [Interjection.] [Time expired.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  EDUCATION:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,   Deputy
Minister Oosthuizen, hon MECs, members of the NCOP, and  special  delegates,
it is indeed a pleasure to be back home. Several months ago,  prior  to  the
elections, when I bade farewell to the  members  of  the  NCOP,  I  casually
remarked that it appears as if my destiny is intertwined  with  the  destiny
of my Minister. Little  did  I  realise  the  prophetic  importance  of  the
statement which brings us together at this moment in time  to  face  what  I
may describe as, perhaps, the most significant and  critical  challenge  for
the future of our country.

Given her extraordinary ability and commitment, and  the  past  co-operation
we both received from the provinces, I am cautiously confident that we  will
achieve a measure of success in providing quality education to  our  people,
especially the poorest  of  the  poor,  for  the  reasons  set  out  by  Mrs
Vilakazi, and the challenges that have  been  enumerated  by  Mr  Adolph  in
terms of the constraints with regard to the budget, etc.

It is a special privilege for me to participate in this  debate,  and  I  am
sure I do not have to persuade anyone of my attachment  to  the  NCOP.  More
importantly, the manner in which your  Select  Committee  on  Education  and
Recreation is structured, makes the committee the ideal vehicle  to  develop
a holistic view of the scope and the breadth of education. We  will  be  the
first to agree that sport and recreation, arts and culture, and science  and
technology are essential components of  the  spectrum  and  rich  fabric  of
education. An integrated approach to education and training  must  therefore
be the correct approach. Incidental to this exercise  is  the  need  to  co-
operate and integrate our initiatives and programmes.

I wish to focus today on a number  of  initiatives  and  programmes  of  the
Department of Education, which will give us the flavour of the kind of  work
that is being done. It will also identify some critical areas of  work,  and
where urgent  interventions  are  needed.  The  first  initiative  is  named
Dinaledi, but not after the Minister  of  Education.  This  programme  is  a
comprehensive attempt to deal with the real concerns about  the  extent  and
the quality of the teaching of  mathematics,  science  and  technology.  One
hundred and two schools have been selected by  the  provinces  as  the  lead
institutions for Dinaledi. Over the past two years these schools  have  been
provided with additional facilities and resources, including libraries,  and
teachers have been targeted for special training in these areas. Already  we
have seen some of the effects of  these  interventions,  with  the  Dinaledi
schools  achieving  much  better  results   in   these   subjects   in   the
matriculation examinations. However, much more has to be done.
Dinaledi is not just about these 102 selected schools.  It  is  intended  to
create  sustainable  models  for  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and
learning in mathematics, science  and  technology.  Furthermore,  it  is  to
encourage many more learners, especially  girls,  to  take  these  subjects,
which are critical for  the  development  and  growth  of  our  nation.  The
planned introduction of a compulsory mathematics programme for  every  child
in the new FET curriculum, either in the form of mathematical  literacy,  or
more traditional forms of mathematics, is an indication of  our  seriousness
in this matter.

It is our view, Mr Dugmore, to increase the learnerships  from  20  to  more
than 2 000 in the  Western  Cape,  with  this  kind  of  programme  that  we
envisage. To expand these programmes to rural schools  and  more  townships,
the matter of salary incentives to  encourage  teachers  with  these  scarce
skills to work in hardship posts and in rural areas is under  consideration.
This may also help the migration of learners from township schools  to  more
privileged schools in urban areas, as indicated by the MEC from Gauteng.  We
must also co-ordinate closely with the Department of Science and  Technology
and the Department Labour, to respond to the vocational and career paths  in
the research and development areas that are necessary to match the  acquired
skills.

Also, at school level, but with a very different orientation  -  I  am  sure
Mrs Robinson will be glad to hear this - we have given renewed attention  to
the role of sport and recreation. A healthy mind needs a healthy  body,  and
all schools should include time for physical education,  and  for  organised
recreation. These are part of the curriculum, and not just a "nice to  have"
addition to teaching and learning. In so far as the issue  of  Wednesday  is
concerned, you will have to confer with our hon Minister of  Education,  who
will develop a particular policy, Mr Oosthuizen.

For this purpose we are working with Sport and Recreation  South  Africa  to
ensure the proper integration, co-ordination  and  management  of  sport  at
school. We are quite clear that school sport is  the  domain  of  education,
and we will take responsibility for its support. But at the  highest  levels
of representative, competitive sport, we need to  acknowledge  the  role  of
national  sports  associations  and  federations.  These  bodies  should  be
providing guidance and support to schools, to ensure that learners  have  an
opportunity to explore a variety of sporting codes, some of which  they  may
not have been aware of before.

The recent media story about a  young  boy  from  Langa  who  has  become  a
champion horse rider, is a good example of the extraordinary talent  of  our
people,  who  need  to  be  given  opportunities  to  develop.  The  further
advantage of developing ability in different codes is quite clear  from  the
weekend. We were disheartened when we heard how Bafana Bafana  lost  3-0  to
Ghana, but at the same time we celebrated the victory of the  Springboks  in
rugby and the victory of Retief Goosen in the United States Open.  So,  this
certainly is, as the Deputy Minister correctly pointed out,  a  vehicle  for
nation-building and reconciliation.

As we pay attention to school sport and recreation, we must be mindful  that
there are many indigenous games that have a particular meaning and place  in
different communities. By promoting these activities  we  will  be  able  to
promote social cohesion. Similarly, as we  promote  recreational  activities
such as chess to stimulate learners' creativity and thinking, similar  goals
can be achieved when learners participate in playing morabaraba and  diketo.
I am sure, Ms Robinson, we would like to hear that you  are  drawing  closer
to the ethos of the ANC in  terms  of  how  education  should  be  developed
holistically.

Social cohesion will also be  promoted  through  the  revival  of  arts  and
culture in all our schools. Local  government  structures  have  a  critical
role to play in this area through co-ordinating programmes  on  the  diverse
indigenous customs. The promotion of an inter-generation dialogue  programme
between  elders  and  the  youth  is  an  important  strategy  that  can  be
considered by our local  government  structures.  These  programmes  can  be
facilitated with the local Department  of  Education.  A  recent  review  of
school governance found that  school  governing  bodies  had  found  a  high
degree of support among all communities, both rich and poor.

This is very positive, and provides a foundation  for  further  development.
But the report also noted that these governing bodies  were  constrained  by
the fact that they could only impact upon an  individual  school,  and  that
there were no provisions for schools to co-operate outside of  their  school
fences. In some instances  schools  have  initiated  an  organic  clustering
process, to  facilitate  a  more  collective  approach,  and  a  sharing  of
resources and facilities. This is very healthy and  commendable.  We  cannot
promise  every  school  all  the  facilities  it  desires,  because  of  the
constraints referred to by Mr Adolph. But  there  is  no  reason  why  every
child should not  have  access  to  such  facilities,  if  these  were  more
centrally provided, and made available to a range of local schools.

The challenge to historically privileged schools is to twin with or  cluster
with other schools and make their amenities and their facilities  available,
so that they could then say that they have contributed  to  the  integration
of our society, and the development at all levels  in  terms  of  education.
This certainly points  us  to  the  significant  role  of  local  government
structures, that is municipalities and district councils, in supporting  the
delivery of education. It is much easier for a local  municipality  to  send
in a grader to level a field than for Public Works or Education  to  go  out
and tender, to get a contractor on site for the same purpose.

While Mr Oosthuizen is busy with the proverbial  levelling  of  the  playing
fields politically, our concern is about  providing  level  playing  fields,
and Mr Setona in the Free State is quite aware of the challenges of  playing
soccer on an uneven playing field. A community library may  be  built  in  a
location that allows a number of schools to use it during the morning,  with
the community using it in the afternoon and evenings. We must  at  the  same
time acknowledge and  recognise  that  there  are  many  municipalities  and
district councils, such as the one that I am  from,  the  Bojanala  District
Council, that have included the provision of  resources  both  in  terms  of
infrastructure and services in their strategic plans.

The role of the South African  Local  Government  Association  in  promoting
awareness among municipalities in relation to education provision must  also
be recognised. We should scrutinise  the  integrated  development  plans  of
local government, with a view  of  asking  how  these  IDPs  relate  to  the
challenges of education provision. We must also ask about the role  of  ward
committees in the educational sector, and  encourage  the  establishment  of
education desks at municipalities, district councils, and the  substructures
of metropolitan areas. Mr Dugmore is correct that it is necessary to  secure
the ownership of public schools by communities, and for  schools  to  become
the centres of community life.

Remember, they are public schools, not state schools. Use them  after  hours
for social, cultural, religious and sporting activities.  This  engenders  a
wonderful  sense  of  community  spirit  and  enhances  ownership   of   the
institution, and also contributes to safeguarding its assets from  vandalism
and theft. We will therefore be  continuing  our  dialogue  with  Salga,  to
ensure that they also contribute to the provision  of  educational  services
such as water and electricity,  and  where  possible  to  provide  these  at
preferential rates.

In short, we are calling for an approach that involves a number of  national
government departments, provincial governments,  especially  the  department
of education, as well as local governments. We will also expect  our  people
to contribute whatever they are able to, not merely in monetary  terms,  but
also in terms of time  and  support  for  the  school,  its  principal,  its
teachers,  and  its  learners.  Bear  in  mind  that  we  decided   in   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme that we lead  a  people-driven  and
people-centred revolution, not a bureaucratic one.

Education is the responsibility of all of  us,  and  quality  education,  to
which we are committed, will only become a reality when  we  have  mobilised
every possible resource and every possible  person  to  make  their  special
contribution. Our vision is a shared vision and our task must  therefore  be
a shared task. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Hon Deputy Chair of Committees, hon  Ministers,  hon  MECs
from different provinces, and hon members, I greet you  all.  Hon  Minister,
allow me the opportunity to congratulate you  on  your  appointment  to  the
education portfolio and also the Deputy Minister.

The range of challenges facing the department is  wide  and  each  of  these
challenges requires urgent attention. The  highest  priority  is  to  ensure
that our children  leave  school  with  the  ability  to  become  productive
participants in the social and economic life of our society.

Apho   ndisuka   khona,   eMpuma   Koloni,   emaphandleni,   apho    izikolo
zisesezingxondorheni,  kuninzi  ekusafuna  ingqwalasela  yesebe.  Iititshala
ezifundisa phaya azifuni  kuhlala  ngenxa  yeemeko  kweezo  lali,  itsho  ke
imfundo ebantwaneni iqhwalele ngamandla.

Kufuneka  umgangato  wezikolo  ufane  kanye  nowezasezidolophini,   nemfundo
ngokunjalo, ukwenzela neetitshala ezi zingabathathi  abantwana  bazo  zibase
kwizikolo ezisezidolophini. Wofika abantwana bezishiya izikolo  zasezilalini
besiya ezidolophini. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Where I come from, the rural areas of the Eastern Cape, where  schools  are
still inaccessible, there is a lot that still needs  the  attention  of  the
department. The teachers  who  teach  there  are  no  longer  interested  in
staying because of the  conditions  prevailing  in  those  areas,  and  this
results in great non-delivery of proper educations to learners.

The standards of schools and  education  should  be  improved  to  the  same
levels as those in the urban areas so that teachers  would  not  send  their
own children to schools in the urban areas. You will  find  learners  moving
from schools in the rural areas to the urban areas.]

Another pressing challenge, Chairperson, is to ensure that every school  has
classrooms, water, sanitation, electricity, libraries and sport facilities.
Nabo aba bantwana kufanele bazifumise bonwabile ezikolweni  zabo.  Ndiyavuya
ukuva  uMphathiswa  esitsho  ukuba  ngokuphela  kwalo   nyaka,   ziya   kube
ziqwalaselwe ezo zinto.

Okokugqibela,   kufuneka   zikhuselwe   kangangoko   iititshala   nabantwana
kwizikrelemnqa   ezibavingcela   ezindlwini   nasezindleleni    xa    besiya
esikolweni. Siyabulela ke ukuva  uMphathiswa  ethetha  ngesondlo  sabantwana
ezikolweni, itsho loo nto  abantwana  bakhuthazeke,  baye  esikolweni.  Nabo
kungekho nto kumakwabo,  baya  esikolweni  besazi  ukuba  kukho  into  abaza
kuyifumana, kutsho ke kube lulutho kubo bafumane imfundo  ebhetele.  Enkosi.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[They also, these learners, are supposed to be happy at their schools. I  am
happy to hear the Minister saying that by the end of this year these  issues
will have been addressed.

Finally,  teachers  and  learners  are  supposed  to  be  protected  against
criminals who attack them in their homes and on the road  on  their  way  to
school. We are thankful to hear the  Minister  speaking  about  the  feeding
scheme of learners whilst at school; that alone will encourage  learners  to
attend school. They also have nothing at their  homes;  they  go  to  school
knowing there is something to their benefit; it is  to  their  advantage  to
achieve a better education. I thank you.]

Mr M MATOMELA:  Deputy  Chair  of  Committees,  thank  you  very  much.  Hon
Minister, Deputy Minister, MECs and hon members, since  the  department  was
established as  one  single  department  in  1995/96,  we  have  faced  many
challenges as department. The path has  not  been  easy,  but  we  are  much
closer today to realising the ideal of a stable department.  The  fact  that
we have appointed a permanent secretary and people in key  management  areas
like finance, enables us now proudly to say that we have people who seem  to
understand what they are doing. And therefore we  want  to  ensure  the  hon
Minister that the issue is going to be attended to.

We have a provincial growth and development plan in the  Eastern  Cape,  and
each department is expected to  align  its  programmes  to  that  plan.  The
Department of  Education  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  human  resource
development strategy of the province. It is therefore essential that if  the
province is to attain its full potential its public  education  system  must
provide learners who are equipped with the necessary  skills  to  impact  on
the economy. In this area, we are looking  in  particular  at  two  sectors,
that is the adult Basic education and training  and  further  education  and
training, especially the FET colleges.

In the province, as a result of our vision for appropriate skilling  of  our
future  and  present  workforce,  captured  in  our  provincial  growth  and
development plan, we had already decided to allocate more resources  to  FET
colleges over the MTEF period. We have allocated R166  million  during  this
financial year. It is expected that such resources will be used  to  improve
infrastructure, equipment and curricular offerings, so as to enable them  to
meet their goals, as set out in the provincial growth and development plan.

In the field of ABET, the Eastern Cape has been doing very well. We want  to
indicate, of course, that even after 10 years  of  freedom,  the  illiteracy
rate in the Eastern Cape remains unacceptably high. The  inability  to  read
and write or to function effectively as  a  citizen  and  employee  condemns
thousands of our people to unemployment and permanent poverty.

We  have  allocated  R140  million  towards  this   programme,   a   further
improvement on last year's allocation. It is  worth  noting  that  the  ABET
programme run by our department goes beyond the  formal  programmes  leading
to the academic qualification at ABET level  4.  We  have  begun  innovative
programmes in agriculture, poultry farming  and  skills  development.  These
are being well attended.

The opportunity to dovetail our  efforts  with  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme  is  very  welcome  and  will  definitely   boost   our   efforts.
Unfortunately, due to economic  factors  prevalent  in  the  province,  even
successful learners who graduate from the  ABET  programmes  are  unable  to
secure employment. So greater skilling and work experience on the EPWP  will
doubtlessly enhance their future employability, restore  their  dignity  and
make them productive members of society.

Chairperson, let me deal with infrastructure. The department  faces  massive
challenges in providing sufficient, suitable  classrooms  for  its  learners
and teachers in the province. As indicated earlier, the community has  built
many of the structures where learners are taught. Many of  these  structures
are unsafe and do not conform to minimum standards. The  province  does  not
have any learners learning under trees, except  to  alleviate  unanticipated
overcrowding, but we have some 890 mud schools, which need  to  be  replaced
with safer structures.

Costs are estimated at more than R1 billion. We  had  planned  to  eliminate
these backlogs by 2006 and the provincial legislature continues to  allocate
additional resources to this end. We have allocated R498  million  for  this
year. The presidential  injunction  that  no  learners  should  be  in  such
structures by the end of this financial year excites us, as  definite  steps
are going to be taken to redress a situation that we  have  been  struggling
with for years. The hon Minister and  the  Deputy  Minister  have  committed
themselves to assist us in dealing with this issue.

The province  faces  major  challenges  with  regard  to  funding  that  may
jeopardise all the wonderful plans I have been sharing with you  today.  Due
to overspending in the last  two  financial  years,  the  department's  bank
account was some R602 million in the red  as  at  31  March  2004.  To  make
matters worse, calculations done in the department would  seem  to  indicate
that the department has been underfunded on personnel to the  tune  of  R150
million. Despite continuous interaction with  our  provincial  Treasury,  we
have not succeeded in getting more  funding.  The  department  is  currently
spending  more  than  92%  of  its  personnel  budget  on  educators,   thus
sacrificing  administrative  support  personnel  to  accommodate  this.  The
result has been a largely dysfunctional head office and a huge vacancy  rate
in the 24 district offices. It is  quite  obvious  that  something  must  be
done.

Of course we know that it is a crime to spend beyond one's budget  in  terms
of the PFMA, but one surely cannot  be  expected  to  deliver  an  increased
level of service and accelerated programmes under these  circumstances,  and
therefore we really  need  this  R150  million.  Nothing  would  please  the
province more than to see its colleges more productive,  its  ABET  learners
gainfully employed and its  building  programme  accelerated,  so  that  its
learners receive a quality public education. My officials and I stand  ready
to deliver on our programmes.

One is reminded of what we  are  facing  in  the  department  regarding  the
underfunding we experience. I remember in the National  Assembly,  when  the
hon Minister was addressing the committee stage,  and  as  she  was  talking
about over-expenditure she looked at me,  and  we  are  going  to  try,  hon
Minister, to remain within budget, but unfortunately when we do that we  are
going to go for the soft targets with this infrastructure.

Let me conclude by quoting what Winston Churchill said when he  was  talking
to the USA: ``Give us the tools and we will finish  the  job.''  [Applause.]
Hon Minister Churchill got his additional warships and aeroplanes.  We  hope
we too shall be given the resources to enable us to finish  the  job.  Thank
you very much.

Mr A GRINKER: Mr  Chairperson,  it's  a  daunting  prospect  for  me,  after
watching the debate of this House for such a long time from the  gallery  as
an official, to now be placed in the lion's den.

Firstly, allow me to congratulate the new Chairperson of  the  NCOP  on  her
appointment.  She  is  sitting  over  there.  Secondly,  I  would  like   to
congratulate the Minister and the Deputy  Minister  on  their  appointments,
but I would caution with words from the film Spiderman: ``With  great  power
comes great responsibility.'' Nowhere is this more the case  than  with  the
education portfolio in  South  Africa.  It  was  Diogenes  who  said:  ``The
foundation of every state is the education of its youth.''

In this regard, I would like to  highlight  some  of  the  stark  challenges
facing education in the province of KwaZulu-Natal - the  biggest  department
of education in the country. In KwaZulu-Natal, 333 schools have no  toilets;
51% of schools use pit latrines; the backlog in the provision of  classrooms
is some 14 667 classrooms, which at the present rate  of  construction  will
take some nine years to address; 56% of schools are accessible  by  footpath
or gravel road only; 60% of schools do not have mains power; 34% of  schools
do not have water on site; and only 59%  of  schools  have  working  science
laboratories.

I would like to refer to the two statements made by  the  President  in  his
state of the nation address, to which the  hon  chairperson  of  the  select
committee referred. With regard to the first issue around  the  provisioning
of classrooms, we welcome the statement  by  the  Minister  today  that  the
scope of this programme is to be broadened. Secondly,  with  regard  to  the
provision of sanitation and water  to  schools,  we  have  to  ask  if  this
programme will indeed be achieved in the timeframe stipulated. We  sincerely
hope that that will happen, but we need to get more details in this  regard.
And, I would like to say to the hon chairperson of the select  committee:  I
hope you realise I am indeed shouting at this point in time.

Maybe a start would be made if the national department  were  to  relook  at
the issue of a new office for  the  department  on  the  planned  government
boulevard, which  threatens  to  dramatically  increase  the  administrative
expenditure of the department over  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework
period. Perhaps this money would be better spent on  the  conditional  grant
for sanitation.

Another  environmental  factor  that  is  having  a  devastating  effect  on
education  in  KwaZulu-Natal  is  the  issue  of  HIV/Aids.  Currently,  the
department has a budget for 320 substitute educators  to  cover  a  base  of
some 74 000 educators. It's  estimated  that  a  further  2  800  substitute
educators are needed to cope with the realities of the  pandemic,  which  is
causing many educators to be away from work for extended  periods  of  time.
This would require that the  department  should  find  the  additional  R240
million.  Already,  some  6%  of  working  days  are  lost  due  to  teacher
absenteeism in secondary schools.
The national HIV/Aids conditional grant is an  important  tool  in  creating
awareness around the pandemic but more needs to be done.  This  may  include
learning from the private sector, particularly the mines, which, faced  with
similar challenges, calculated that the most cost-effective strategy was  to
implement their own  antiretroviral  roll-out  plan.  Certainly,  Government
does not have the same resources as  the  private  sector  but,  ultimately,
this may be the most cost-effective strategy. Many educators could also  get
ARVs through their medical aid. It's up to the department to  educate  staff
in this regard and to destigmatise much of the hype that  has  been  created
around the taking of such medication.

In the film Jerry Maguire, the professional football player played  by  Cuba
Gooding Junior uttered the following statement to the sport agent - who  was
played by Tom Cruise: ``Show me the money''. It is in this  context  that  I
would like to raise the issue of unfunded mandates faced by  the  provincial
education department. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms D D  PULE:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Education,  hon  Deputy
Ministers, hon members of the NCOP and hon  MECs  present,  hon  members  of
different provinces, ladies and gentlemen, let me  start  by  congratulating
Madam Chairperson on her appointment; secondly, our  new  national  Minister
of Education and the Deputy Ministers;  and  thirdly,  all  members  of  the
National Council of Provinces for being elected and re-elected to  come  and
serve the aspirations  of  the  poor  majority  of  our  country  as  public
representatives.

The 2004 decisive victory was scored in the context of 10  successful  years
of transformation in which we have pushed back the frontiers of poverty  and
rural underdevelopment. I rise today to take part in this debate  with  full
confidence to assure our people that only the ANC can and will do more.

Hon Minister Pandor, your budget speech takes forward the  work  where  your
predecessor has left off. It consolidates  qualititative  advances  made  in
the past decade and for that reason, Mpumalanga fully supports this  budget.
We support this budget because it contributes  to  the  national  effort  of
ensuring that all children in all points  of  the  country  have  access  to
quality education, and of reaching full gross enrolment in primary  schools.
The budget speaks to the issue  of  early  childhood  development,  with  an
understanding that  if  we  strengthen  the  foundation  of  our  education,
primary, secondary and tertiary levels will achieve positive results.

This budget in front of this House  today  contributes  towards  building  a
rational  and  seamless  high  education  system  that  will   embrace   the
intellectual  professional  challenges  facing  South  Africa  in  the  21st
century - an African century. I want  to  congratulate  the  department  for
having won the International Grand Prix Award for best children's  programme
at the World Media Festival in Hamburg, Germany. Your budget, hon  Minister,
gives practical expression to our noble cause of creating a caring  society.
Our schools have helped mitigate the  hardships  of  hunger  faced  by  poor
children  from  poor  households  through  the  feeding  scheme  or   school
nutrition programme.

The programme is being transferred from health department to  education  and
we support the move and  hope  that  such  transfer  will  not  disrupt  the
functionality of the programme. However, because of the rural  condition  of
our  province,  Mpumalanga,  the  financial  resources  allocated  for  this
purpose are not enough for the needy  learners.  We  call  on  the  national
department to help us introduce measures such as starting  school  vegetable
gardens in order to supplement  the  diet.  For  this  to  happen,  we  will
require the commitment  of  school  communities;  water  supply  and  proper
security at schools. The extension of this programme, which  is  to  include
learners at senior phase and in the  FET  band  is  another  challenge,  hon
Minister.

The institute for higher learning in our province remains a priority and  we
would plead with the Minister to fast-track its delivery. The population  of
the province has been waiting to see this dream come  into  reality.  I  was
specifically requested by my portfolio committee to put that issue  squarely
on the national agenda today. And I hope that the  hon  Minister  will  shed
light on the progress made thus far when she responds to the budget debate.

The ANC in our province has sought and continues to  seek  to  confront  the
challenges of children learning under  trees  and  in  unsuitable  classroom
conditions. Although there are no children who attend  lessons  under  trees
in Mpumalanga, the classroom condition of overcrowding  persists  and  could
undermine the work that the department does. This challenge,  based  on  the
funding trend over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, will  remain  with
us for the next seven years, hon Minister.

We still face a number of challenges as a province in relation to  providing
a better education for all. We still have children learning  under  asbestos
roofs; there are more than 500 schools with no electricity; there  are  more
than 400 schools without any water supply and sanitation. We  are,  however,
expected to improve during this financial year.

Allow me also to indicate, however, that we have made tremendous strides  or
progress on the provision of scholar  transport  and  amalgamation  of  farm
schools. Our matric results also remain a challenge. Although  in  the  past
academic year, 2003, we recorded an increase in the pass rate,  the  overall
performance has  not  improved  and  the  department  has  acknowledged  the
weakness. Plans are being put in place to resolve related problems.

In conclusion, we would like to call upon the national  department  to  help
us resolve some of our problems that we  have  mentioned  here.  We  believe
that together we  can  provide  better  education  for  all.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]
Mr P MALEFANE: Thank you, Chairperson, hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister  and
members, I feel privileged and  honoured  to  be  given  an  opportunity  to
represent the Gauteng province as Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee  on
Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture  in  this  Council.  Before  I  go  any
further, I  would  like  to  start  by  expressing  our  gratitude  for  the
magnificent work done by the bid committee and other  partners  in  ensuring
that the 2010 Soccer Bid  comes  to  South  Africa.  We  all  witnessed  the
passion of all South Africans and the commitment of the national  Government
to this event.

We would like to assure you that in Gauteng we would  work  tirelessly  with
relevant stakeholders to ensure that  all  the  necessary  requirements  and
infrastructure for an excellent World Cup are  effectively  and  efficiently
done and adhered to in our province. Our Premier, comrade  Mbazima  Shilowa,
when he was opening the legislature, also highlighted the 2010 World Cup  as
one of the key strategic  areas  for  our  province.  Furthermore,  our  MEC
Barbara Creecy also committed her department to provide available  resources
to ensure that Gauteng becomes a home for all our visitors during the  World
Cup in 2010.

As members of the portfolio committee, we will monitor developments on  this
issue with microscopic eyes. The reason for this is that we  have  witnessed
the role that events of this  magnitude  play  in  uniting  our  people  and
healing the nation that has been divided by the ills of  the  most  inhumane
system in the universe. We witnessed a rainbow nation united  for  a  common
cause during the Rugby World Cup and Cricket World Cup  respectively  staged
in our country.

Historically, colonials introduced soccer to Africans to help civilise  them
but they turned  the  game  into  an  arena  for  Africanness.  Early  teams
included players from  all  South  African  groups  but  apartheid  strictly
segregated sports. Soccer became a sport for blacks in  contrast  to  rugby,
which was for the Afrikaner and cricket for the English. White  players  and
fans continually attempted to participate in  black  soccer  throughout  the
apartheid years, forcing the government to accept integration by  1980.  For
example, soccer was and remains the  urban  space  for  the  performance  of
Africanness by  and  for  Africans,  but  it  is  also  a  major  venue  for
demonstrating and reworking modernity and progress. Black players and  fans,
because of their acceptance of the  players'  Africanness,  enthusiastically
welcome white players and fans,  which  South  African  professional  soccer
requires.

Therefore, let me submit to you that the paradox of nation-building in  many
deeply divided societies is  one  of  reconciling  ethnic  allegiances  with
overarching loyalty to the state. This is because the  forces  of  ethnicity
and nationalism that emerged in  our  societies  tend  to  be  socially  and
politically salient, thus making the process  of  nation-building  not  only
difficult, but also complex. Innocent questions about sports can  soon  lead
to  fairly  heated  and  complex  debates  about   states,   territoriality,
governance and representation. With very  few  exceptions,  all  states  are
faced with the problem of managing a sense  of  national  identity  and  all
world sports organisations, are faced with the pressure  of  changing  world
relations.

South Africa's transition to democracy and acceptance as  a  member  of  the
community of nations have been accompanied by the quest for a  new  national
identity. The ANC-led Government, and former President  Mandela  personally,
encouraged the ritual celebration of the  rainbow  nation  at  international
sports events such as the 1995 Rugby World Cup.  Arts  and  cultural  events
such as the 1997 South African Music Awards have  also  been  occasions  for
celebrating the emergence of the  rainbow  nation.  The  by  now  ubiquitous
image of South Africa as the rainbow nation seems to have caught the  public
imagination. It symbolises the new South Africa, the imaginary nation  being
constructed in the postapartheid era.

In Africa, most leaders have  viewed  sports  as  a  means  of  uniting  the
disparate ethnic groups contained in their  new  nation  states.  Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, for  one,  said  that  the  Springbok  jersey  worn  by  South
Africa's national teams could now weld races together rather  than  dividing
them  as  in  the  past.  In  many  countries  certain  sports  have  become
identified with the nation and its distinctive character. Sports  have  also
been created to express a particular national vision.

It was sons and daughters of this country  from  different  races  who  rose
against all odds to dispel the stereotype that restricted certain sports  to
specific race groups. We know this history too well  because  among  nations
South Africa has learned the incredible ability of sports to bring  together
different communities, as well as develop  sporting  individuals  for  their
own and that of their families' economic wellbeing. As demonstrated  by  the
many athletes in this country, sports is a tool against racism, as  well  as
a necessary developmental mechanism, especially  in  communities  that  have
been ravaged by poverty and underdevelopment.

We view the R1 million from the national Department of Sport and  Recreation
as a mechanism to support different initiatives  of  mobilising  communities
into mass participation, as well as contributing towards building a  healthy
nation. Though the amount seems to be small, we are confident that  it  will
be increased as we aspire to decrease the health budget by moving away  from
a society of sick people  to  that  of  healthy  and  recreationally  active
people. This grant has a  direct  bearing  on  the  people  developing  into
healthy, skilled and productive people and building an effective and  caring
government,  deepening  democracy  and  nation-building  and  realising  the
Constitutional rights of the people of  our  province  and  the  country  at
large.

In Gauteng, we regard the establishment of academies  in  all  provinces  as
fundamental bases for monitoring and developing high  performance  athletes.
Given that over the years, starting from the first Olympic participation  of
South Africa in 1992, the team that has represented South  Africa  has  been
predominantly white and it is imperative that a system  has  to  be  devised
that  will  assist  in  addressing  this  scenario.  Furthermore,  that  the
delivery of the national teams depends on  the  production  of  such  talent
from across all the corners of the country. There  is  thus  a  need  for  a
coherent and co-ordinated strategy towards achieving such a  goal.  As  such
all provinces and regional structures need to be part of  a  major  planning
strategy consistently developing high performance athletes, who will form  a
pool from which outstanding sport  ambassadors  can  be  produced  who  will
compete internationally. The state must unapologetically intervene  to  make
sports both representative and nonracial in our country.

The absence of a process and programme such as the academy would imply  that
the country would be less competitive globally and that the  current  narrow
development initiatives, which have only delivered a skewed  and  imbalanced
South African team, would be perpetual for a sustained period  of  time.  As
we celebrate the decade of democracy, we want to acknowledge that  sport  in
South Africa still has a long and winding  road  to  travel  before  we  can
reach the  pinnacle  of  our  dreams.  Racism  and  segregation,  which  are
atrocities of the  past,  are  still  manifesting  themselves  in  different
sporting codes in this country. This is obviously the challenge for  all  of
us if we want to unite our people through sports.  Our  sports  people  have
the standing and the influence to play a leadership role  in  achieving  our
ideal of making sports accessible to all our people, and  to  further  raise
sporting standards. Let this budget assist to achieve our  dream  of  having
representative  nonracial  sports  in  our  country,  by  focusing  more  on
development  and  less  on  fire-fighting  the  problems  of  commercialised
professional sports.  Let  it  not  be  business  as  usual.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms N JAJULA: Thank you, Chairperson. Chairperson and hon members, I rise  to
congratulate the Ministers in both departments in the cluster,  my  Minister
of Sports and Recreation in absence here, and the  education  ministers  and
their deputies.

As a province, Chairperson, sports and recreation in the Eastern  Cape  aims
toward an improved quality of life for the people of  the  province  through
sports and recreation in the context of  a  united,  non-racial,  non-sexist
and democratic South Africa.

The above will be achieved through the promotion of an  active  and  healthy
lifestyle through sports and recreation programmes.

We have strategic goals that we are aiming towards which  are  reflected  as
follows: to increase and enhance mass participation of  sports  persons  and
administrators in multiple  codes;  to  promote  the  creation  of  economic
opportunities and benefits in the sports  fields;  to  realise  the  social,
health and  economic  benefits  for  participants;  and  to  facilitate  the
development  of  quality  infrastructure,  opportunities  and  services   to
support participation.

For these we have allocated an amount of R6,9 million which  is  ring-fenced
for capital expenditure in a sense to promote infrastructure in  sports.  We
have to transfer R4 million for recreation structures in the  province,  and
R6 million is allocated for personnel in this arena.

We have a strategic  focus  that  will  impact  on  the  following  aspects.
Firstly, the development and promotion of sports and recreation  legislation
and policy will be finalised  within  this  financial  year.  It  will  give
direction to the province  and  strategies  on  the  promotion  of  athletes
towards excellence.

Within the first 100 days of this Government the  service  delivery  in  the
province will be witnessing the following: We have  already  started  a  new
sports centre in Willowvale that is worth  R400  000.  It  is  part  of  the
Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  whereby  the   local   communities   are
economically benefiting as a result of job creation.

It also includes the establishment of a  Sport  and  Culture  Council  as  a
springboard for development of sport and recreation in the rural areas.

In partnership  and  linkages  with  the  Department  of  Education  we  are
especially  focusing  on  the   following   areas   of   co-operation:   the
resuscitation of girl guides and boy scouts; the promotion of sports in  the
province that has taken  off  in  the  last  two  weeks;  the  emergence  of
physical education in township and rural schools;  funding  of  sport  games
and management thereafter.

Furthermore, it will include capacity-building and empowering projects  that
include training of coaches, especially for mass participation programmes.

We are supporting the Eco-Adventure Challenge with the budget  of  R200  000
for 24 clubs throughout the province.

Serious commitment has been made to the preparation of athletes  in  the  12
sporting codes for the 2005 SA  Games.  An  amount  of  R750  000  has  been
allocated for this activity. The amount reflected here is  going  to  assist
us to achieve a better standard of sports during the next financial year.

The 2010 World Cup project is an enormous task. The preparation of a  master
plan is already done. The  infrastructure  development  with  improved  mega
facilities is the grand idea of that assistance. In  order  to  promote  the
juniors in sports, we have the  Chris  Hani  Provincial  Soccer  Competition
that will form  part  of  the  preparation  for  the  future  Bafana  Bafana
qualifying starts in 2010. This is going  to  be  set  up  for  the  juniors
during this month in the Chris Hani district.

The awareness of HIV/Aids throughout sports and recreation  programmes  will
always be a consistent feature in  all  our  tournaments.  It  is  critical,
Chairperson, to ensure that the people become aware that in sports you  need
to be healthy, and to enhance the quality of sports you need to abstain  and
stay away from situations in which you may be  infected  with  HIV/Aids.  We
are dealing with this in partnership with the IDPs and business, as well  as
other departments.

Hon members, I trust that throughout the promotion  of  sports  in  general,
and an awareness of its values and standards  and  ethics,  the  crime  rate
will definitely drop, and  moral  standards  will  be  uplifted  and  health
consciousness will be the order of the day.

Sports, therefore, hon members, is not just supposed to be seen  as  one  of
the leisure time activities. As a department  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  Madam
Minister of Education, we are requesting your department to  see  sports  as
part and parcel of the curriculum. It should not be done just by the way  by
those educators who are willing to participate in sports, but it has  to  be
seen as one of the professions where our learners could  grow  up  achieving
excellence in sport.

Sports can also be a tool  effective  enough  to  spearhead  reconciliation,
nation-building and inspire pride in the genuine national activities.

All the above programmes and strategic focus for the 2004-05 financial  year
are going to continue to support progress within the Provincial  Growth  and
Development Plan, which includes infrastructure development, human  resource
development,  poverty   eradication,   institutional   transformation,   and
tourism. That will lead the  province  to  its  best  capability  to  create
sports as one of the fields in which people can trust  and  live  a  healthy
lifestyle.

We believe that through sport, as we say, a healthy mind in a  healthy  body
will be taken care of in the province of the Eastern Cape. I thank you,  hon
members. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, MEC. Just before we  proceed,
may I recognise Dr Conroy in the gallery. He is one of  the  former  members
of this House. Thank you, Dr Conroy. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Thank you very much, Chairperson, hon Minister  and  Deputy
Ministers present, hon special delegates and hon members of  this  House.  I
need to say that we welcome the Minister of  Education  and  her  Deputy  to
this House, the House that they have led  and  nurtured  for  the  past  two
years. It is a pleasure to have them with us.

Education continues to  enjoy  the  highest  priority  in  terms  of  budget
allocations.  However,  the  process  is  so  complex  that  the  more   the
allocation is increased to satisfy the  needs  and  demands,  the  more  the
needs and demands increase further so that the process continues unabated.

The problem is further aggravated by the fact that the more we grapple  with
the shortages of classrooms due to increased enrolments in the schools,  the
more the weak structures of yesteryear are destroyed by natural  causes.  We
need to remember, hon Chairperson, that at that time the  general  trend  of
thought was ``dit is goed genoeg vir hulle'', it is good enough for them.

I think as members of Parliament we need,  in  our  oversight  and  pastoral
visitations to our provinces, to emphasise environmental education in  which
we encourage tree planting around our schools to serve as wind breaks.

Notwithstanding the above,  we  are  in  full  support  of  the  President's
priorities which have been corroborated  by  the  hon  Minister  on  several
occasions recently to remove the learners from learning under the trees.

With regard to sports and recreation, hon Chairperson, I need to  point  out
that the 2010 World  Cup  bid  has  aroused  the  expectations  of  a  large
majority of our people everywhere.  Our  people  are  expecting  to  benefit
through work opportunities that could arise and, of course, to  be  able  to
attend the games if they are held within their reach.

It is noted with appreciation that the allocation for the 2004-05  financial
year is increased by R179,3 million,  which  would  fund  the  building  and
upgrading of sports and recreation  facilities  and  of  course  this  would
benefit the poor.

In the North West province, hon Chairperson,  the  initial  indications  are
for the extension of a stadium at Orkney into a 42 000-seat  stadium  and  a
similar extension is intended for the Phokeng/Rustenburg  stadium.  However,
it would appear that a 75  000-seat  stadium  at  Mmabatho/Mafikeng  is  not
included among those to be utilized in 2010. It is the nearest to the  rural
poor that we intend to cater for. Otherwise, the UCDP supports  both  Budget
Votes. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J MAFEREKA (Free State): Chairperson, hon Minister of  Education,  Deputy
Ministers,  chairpersons  present   here,   permanent   delegates,   special
delegates, ladies and gentlemen, let me also join hands with those  who  are
wishing success to the new Chairperson of the NCOP,  Comrade  Joyce  Kgoali,
and the Minister of Education, Ms Naledi  Pandor.  I  must  say  Ntate  [Mr]
Mseleku, you are in safe hands. I am saying  this,  because  I  have  worked
with the Minister. She is a committed woman with lots of ability and she  is
fearless.

I mean fearless, because we were once in Africa, and  South  Africa  had  to
present its position as far as women  were  concerned  to  parliaments.  She
stood in front of those men in Ghana and told  them  that  in  South  Africa
women have a place in Parliament. There was a big roar in the house.  I  was
frightened. [Laughter.] Because there is only one plane and  if  you  missed
it, you would be left behind. There  was  great  unhappiness  when  we  left
there, and she repeated it in Malawi and it was endorsed  when  we  were  in
Trinidad and Tobago. I can say with pride that  today  at  least  women  are
being recognised in all African parliaments because  of  her  leadership  in
the CPA conferences.

In his budget speech, hon Minister Stofile addressed the  key  issues  which
served  as  challenges  to  us  as  Government  with  regard  to  sport  and
recreation, and these include  mass  participation  in  school  sports;  the
national sports academy system;  transformation  and  legislation,  just  to
mention a few. These issues have a direct bearing  and  implication  on  the
province as we are also grappling with them. In support  of  the  Minister's
perspective I would like to address  myself  to  developments  in  the  Free
State regarding these issues.

In addressing myself to the matter of sports  and  recreation  in  the  Free
State, I start from a position of strength, since the  Free  State  people's
beloved soccer team, Phunya Sele Sele, has registered a  double  victory  by
being readmitted to the PSL, and also by winning the title  of  championship
of the first division league. They are the overall  winners.  They  received
R100 000. This will undoubtedly give further impetus to the sporting  spirit
in the province, particularly amongst the up and coming young stars  in  our
province.  We  are  also  delighted  that  the  province  has  enjoyed  much
attention with the hosting of the Bafana Bafana and Cape  Verde  match,  the
Amabokoboko and Ireland first test match, as well  as  the  ABSA  Cup  final
match.

These sports opportunities boosted the morale of the Free Staters  who  have
often felt marginalised regarding the hosting of  such  sporting  events.  I
emphasise that these events received massive support in terms of  attendance
by the Free Staters. As a department, we need  to  take  advantage  of  this
prevailing sporting mood amongst our  people.  In  his  budget  speech,  the
Minister raises challenges to the effect that:


  Community clubs must be revived and our children in townships and village
  schools must be assisted to do sport.
Work  towards  this  goal  in  the  province  is  already  under  way.   Our
department, together with Sport and Recreation SA, embarked  on  a  Building
for  Sport  and  Recreation  Programme.  This  programme  consists  of   the
provision of multipurpose sports facilities or  the  upgrading  of  existing
sports facilities, and is funded by the National Poverty  Alleviation  Fund.
In the previous financial year an amount of R12,4 million was  budgeted  for
the upgrading and construction of 15 basic  sport  facilities  in  the  five
district municipalities of our province. For this financial year  an  amount
of R10 409 371,00 has been allocated to the Free State province and it  will
be utilised to further advance this objective.

Furthermore, once again in partnership with Sport  and  Recreation  SA,  the
department is also embarking on a mass  participation  in  sport  programme,
with the objective to  facilitate  participation  in  sport  and  recreation
activities  within  disadvantaged  communities.  The  focus  is   on   rural
communities, which is in line with the challenge  raised  by  the  Minister,
cited above. For the current financial year, an amount  of  R1  million  has
been allocated to the Free State  province,  and  it  will  be  utilised  to
achieve  maximum  participation  by  communities,  for  example,  20   local
municipalities will be targeted to participate  in  various  sporting  codes
such as aerobics, general gymnastics, fun-runs, big walks, street  ball  and
indigenous games on a weekly basis, with a  projected  annual  participation
of 110 000 people.

We aim to achieve the following percentages of  the  various  categories  of
people participating in sports and  recreation:  40%  women;  1,5%  disabled
people; 80% youth; 10% adults and 10% of all the elderly. For  the  rest  of
the MTEF period, an amount of R2,6 million has been granted for the  2005-06
financial  year,  and  R4,3  million  for  the  2006-07  financial  year  to
facilitate mass participation in sport. I have no doubt that we  will  go  a
long way in terms of addressing these challenges.

Quality and excellence in sport is our battle cry.  The  Minister  has  also
raised a challenge in this regard when he stated:


  When we host major events in our country, we must also  ensure  that  our
  own teams participating in them are competitive to maintain the  interest
  of the paying public and to enhance the benefits  that  can  accrue  from
  them.
Investment in sport through such ventures as the Sports Academy is  thus  an
absolute necessity, as the Minister suggested. In our province we intend  to
achieve these  goals  of  quality  and  excellence  in  sports  through  two
institutions: the Free State Sports Science Institute  and  the  Free  State
Academy of Sport. Pertaining to the Free  State  Sports  Science  Institute,
the purpose of this institute is to  provide  equitable  access  to  quality
sports science and rehabilitation services, which  will  contribute  to  the
national effort of putting South African on a path of sustainable growth.

At the moment, we are constructing facilities at the Free State  Psychiatric
Complex, which consists of the following sections,  namely,  fully  equipped
fitness and testing facilities;  a  mobile  fitness,  exercise  testing  and
evaluating unit; an 80-metre  speed  track;  an  auditorium  for  about  130
people;  a  fully  equipped  gymnasium;  consultation   rooms   for   multi-
disciplinary teams; overnight facilities; catering and a restaurant;  sports
valuable facilities for netball, athletics, cricket, tennis,  soccer,  golf,
hockey and tennis; an indoor swimming  pool  and  a  multipurpose  hall  for
approximately 500 people. I hope that all the provinces  can  come  and  see
this wonderful thing.
The funds for the construction and provision of equipment of the Free  State
Sports Science Institute have been provided by the  national  Department  of
Sport and Recreation,  through  their  Building  for  Sport  and  Recreation
Programme and the National Lottery Distribution Agency with the  Free  State
Academy of Sport, as well as the Metheo District  Municipality,  as  funding
agents. Funds for  equipment  and  capacity-building  are  provided  by  the
Flemish government and the National Lottery  Distribution  Agency.  A  total
amount of R8,3 million has been secured for the Free  State  Sports  Science
Institute from outside sources. In addition to this, my department has  also
allocated an amount of R6,5 million from its infrastructure  budget  in  the
current financial year for the construction of these facilities.

On  the  other  hand,  the  Free  State  Academy  of  Sport,  which   is   a
nongovernmental association, serves to enhance the level of  performance  of
talented athletes and coaches through scientific and  medical  support,  and
to secure developmental pathways, resulting in  more  representative  teams.
Although the focus of the academy is primarily on  provincial  athletes  and
coaches, the infrastructure that was developed is able to  support  athletes
and coaches at a national level. This year my department's  contribution  to
the Free State Academy of Sport amount to R1 million as a transfer  payment,
mainly for capacity-building and the implementation of their programmes.

I agree wholeheartedly with hon Minister Stofile  that  everything  possible
must be done to ensure that we have a successful 2010 Soccer  World  Cup  in
our country. As a province, we are moving milestones  to  live  up  to  this
challenge. The budgetary allocations I have  just  outlined  above  for  the
infrastructure development and for encouraging mass participation in  sport,
as well as measures undertaken to  ensure  quality  and  excellence  in  our
sporting codes, is a clear  manifestation  of  our  preparedness  for  2010,
except we need another two big stadiums, because we have  only  one  in  the
Free State. [Interjection.] [Applause.]

Mrs M NGUBANE-MADLALA: Sihlalo, mangiqale ngokubingelela oNgqongqoshe  kanye
noNdunankulu abaphuma ezifundazweni  ezahlukene,  ngibingelele  abahlonishwa
kanye namaqabane. [Hon Chair, let me start by  greeting  the  Ministers  and
the Premiers from various provinces, hon members and comrades.]

Chairperson, the role of sport and  recreation  in  society  is  to  promote
enthusiasm  to  provide  an  important  avenue   for   social   development,
particularly amongst the youth. Its role is also to educate the youth  about
health and broader  social  and  societal  issues.  Sport  empowers  people,
teaches leadership and citizen skills as  well  as  the  importance  of  co-
operation towards shared goals.

Sport challenges inequalities in gender, race and  disability.  It  educates
against  antisocial  behaviour  and  reintegrates  the   disadvantaged   and
socially excluded groups. Most importantly, sport  enhances  national  pride
and a strong sense of patriotism, especially in this country of ours with  a
long history of segregation, racial, gender and ethnic discrimination.

Since 1994 sport has been the most powerful tool for reconciliation and  for
the development of previously disadvantaged communities and  other  sectors,
which were not  previously  recognised  as  key  sectors  of  South  African
society. Of course it has been one of the most  important  cohesive  factors
in uniting the cities of the South African nation.

Funding  for  this  department,  Sport  and  Recreation  South  Africa,  has
increased from R90 million in 2002-03 to  R130  million  in  2003-04.  Total
allocation for this current  financial  year  is  R137  270  million,  which
includes R5 million for sports promotion and facility management training.

I must mention that sport plays a  crucial  role  in  the  economy  of  this
country, for example, in 2000 sport and recreation contributed 2 000 of  the
Gross Domestic Product in South Africa.  According  to  a  survey  in  2000,
sport and recreation provided employment for some 34 325 full-time  workers,
6 540 part-time workers as well as about 8 000 volunteers.

I must mention that since the inception of the first  democratic  Government
in 1994 considerable progress has been made in terms of sporting  facilities
and  the  implementation   of   development   programmes   in   historically
disadvantaged communities, particularly in the townships and rural parts  of
the country.

Much of this progress has been due to  the  utilisation  of  poverty  relief
funds that targeted the use of the  existing  sports  budget.  The  sporting
federation funding was secured  from  external  sources  and  projects  were
implemented by the private sector. This progress  made  in  sport  thus  far
appears to be  largely  outweighed  by  the  problems  and  challenges  that
continue to face historically  disadvantaged  communities,  particularly  in
the rural areas and townships. Hence, sport in  South  Africa  continues  to
face numerous problems that negatively impact on programmes in this  sphere.
For us to overcome some of these problems I  believe  we  should  work  hard
with the Department of  Sport  and  Recreation.  It  is  necessary  that  we
encourage the youth of this country  to  participate  in  large  numbers  in
sport and recreation activities. That in itself will enable us  to  increase
investment at the grassroots level  rather  than  at  the  federation  level
where activities tend to be focused on competitive sport.

For the country to obtain a high  performance  in  sport  we  need  to  look
deeply at the fragmentation of the sporting fields.

Sihlalo,  ngamanye  amazwi  ngichaza  ukuthi  kubalulekile  kithina   ukuthi
sikhuthaze  izingane  zethu   ukuthi   zizibandakanye   kwezemidlalo   kanye
nezokungcebeleka.  Inkinga  enkulu  ukuthi  izingane   zethu   siyazenqabela
singabazali  ukuthi  zibambe  iqhaza  kwezemidlalo  ezikoleni.  Ngisho  noma
izingane   zidlalela   isikole,   singabazali   asizihluphi   neze    ukuthi
siyozibukela   sizikhuthaze.   Lokho   kudala   ukuthi   izingane   zijabhe,
singakhohlwa ukuthi ithalente libonakala lapha ezinganeni.

Ngithanda  ukusho   ukuthi   ugotshwa   usemanzi.   Kubalulekile-ke   ukuthi
sizikhuthaze izingane kwezemidlalo ngoba  uma  singenzi  njalo  singabazali,
sizikhuthaza ukuthi zithathe enye  indlela  edukile,  indlela  yokusebenzisa
izidakamizwa. Ngalokho, isizwe sonkana siyawa.

Kubalulekile    ukuthi    sizikhuthaze    zibuyele    emidlalweni    yomdabu
enjengezingendo, ingaqabethu kanye nokunye. Phambili  izinkundla  zazingekho
nhlobo kodwa manje uHulumeni uyazama.  Ngisho  nasezikoleni  izingane  zethu
zazidlalela obhuqwini ikakhulukazi empahandlelni nasemalokishini.  Zazidlala
ibhola likanobhutshuzwayo ngaphandle kwezicathulo ezifanelekileyo.

Kunezinye    izinkinga    engingaziphawula     emphakathini.     Abesifazane
abakhubazekile kanye nabampisholo abanakiwe, amalungelo abo  awagcwalisekile
neze kwezemidlalo. Kunesidingo sokuthi nakho lokho kubhekwe ngeso  elibanzi.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, in other words it is important to encourage  our  children  to
take part in sport and recreation. Our main problem is that  we  as  parents
prevent our children from  participating  in  school  sports.  Even  if  our
children are playing for the school, we as parents don't bother  to  go  and
watch and encourage them. That  discourages  children,  and  we  should  not
forget that this is where talent is identified - in children.

I submit that the future lies with  the  youth.  It  is  important  that  we
encourage children to participate in sport, because if we don't do  that  we
are encouraging them to take devious ways and  abuse  drugs.  Therefore  the
whole nation perishes.

It is important to encourage them to go back to traditional sports  such  as
tossing  up  stones,  skipping  rope,  etc.  There  were  no  sport  grounds
previously, but now the Government  is  trying  to  provide  them.  Even  at
school our children were playing on  gravel  grounds,  especially  in  rural
areas and townships. They were playing soccer without soccer boots.
There are other problems I can point out  in  the  community.  The  disabled
women and  blacks  are  not  accommodated,  their  rights  are  not  equally
fulfilled. There is a dire need to scrutinise that.]

It is important that sporting facilities  are  maintained.  I  must  mention
that in the province I come from, Gauteng,  facilities  are  dilapidated  or
vandalised and  are  not  maintained  properly  by  our  communities.  White
elephants are found in the so-called minority areas.  Those  facilities  are
not utilised at all. Even if, in the near future, the  department  continues
to  provide  funding  for  facilities,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the
provincial government to continue implementing the project  and  maintaining
the facilities which they then own. These facilities  will  be  managed  and
run by community-based sports councils created by the South  African  Sports
Council.

I am encouraged by the fact that the Department of Sport and Recreation  and
the Department of Education are finalising their objective of  the  location
of school sport. I am further encouraged by their objective of  establishing
a national sports academy, which should be  finalised  during  this  current
financial year.
By putting sport at the forefront, the country can gain major  achievements.
We can use sport as a medium that can  contribute  to  resolving  issues  of
national importance, such as  HIV/Aids,  unemployment  and  economic  growth
through, for example, sports tourism and also in improving levels of  health
in the community.

Winning the 2010 World Soccer bid also means  a  complete  renewal,  revamp,
renovation and revival of many of the country's sporting  facilities.  Thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Thank you, Chairperson.  Chair,
the hon Tolo, the previous speaker - hon Magubane-Madlala and various  other
speakers in this House referred to the Building  for  Sport  and  Recreation
programme. I think it  is  befitting  that  we  just  give  them  some  more
information pertaining to that particular programme.

Specific reference was made, just now,  by  the  hon  member  regarding  the
budget of sport and recreation  only  -  the  building  side  of  sport  and
recreation, and not the department as such. In 1995, it was determined  that
in order to eliminate the backlog in sport and recreation facilities by  the
year 2005, we would need an investment of some  R5  billion.  We  were  also
aware that given the sport and recreation budget  of  the  provinces,  whose
competency it is to build  those  facilities,  we  would  never  reach  that
target.

We accordingly set out to acquire those funds from the  national  department
and registered our first success in 1995 by procuring R150 million from  the
Reconstruction and Development Programme. When those funds dried up  at  the
end of 1999 the building programme came to an end. We  were  again  rewarded
in the year 2000, when we successfully made a bid  for  resources  from  the
Poverty Relief Infrastructure Creation and Jobs Summit  Fund.  That  enabled
us to build some more sport and recreation facilities in our communities.

The results of this programme - and reference was also made to  that  -  are
remarkable, especially as it pertains to the impact we were able to make  on
the social indicators. Over the three years of this project we were able  to
employ 13 000 people. These were temporary jobs during the  initial  labour-
intensive building phase. But, Sir, I think it is important to say that  30%
of the people we employed were women, 20% were  youth  and  2%  were  people
with a disability.

We have managed to build and upgrade more than 250 facilities over the  past
three years. And, as a result of our performance, we were rewarded with  the
extension of this very project by a further year, during which  we  plan  to
build another 110 facilities. The fact  of  the  matter  is:  to  reach  our
overall target, as set out, by 2005 we  are  still  in  need  of  some  R4,5
billion.

In the  next  financial  year,  the  resources  for  this  project  will  be
transferred to the Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant  of  the  Department  of
Provincial and Local Government. Our tasks, as a department, will be one  of
policy development and monitoring, advocacy and reporting  on  the  progress
that we make. We remain confident that local authorities  will  continue  to
recognise, with the help of this honourable House, the need  for  sport  and
recreation facilities despite other pressing needs.  We,  as  a  department,
will redouble our advocacy efforts to make sure  they  are  recognised.  The
Minister and I will obviously continue lobbying for ring-fenced  amounts  of
money to address the very urgent needs.

But, may I just say, my hon colleague the Deputy Minister of Education  made
reference this afternoon to the facilities they also intend  to  create.  It
may be possible, if we have their  assistance,  to  approach  the  Municipal
Infrastructure Grant to see whether we cannot create  facilities  closer  to
schools, but facilities which will  also  be  accessible  to  the  community
after hours, as he indicated.

The hon Mrs Robinson spoke about  indigenous  sport  and  I  would  like  to
inform her that we have a flourishing programme, which is managed by the  SA
Sports Commission, as far as indigenous  sport  is  concerned.  We  have  an
indigenous sports affair that is held  annually.  Certain  groups  of  South
Africans  will  participate  in  the  international  indigenous   games   in
Montreal, Canada, later this year. And, for the first  time,  this  year  we
have set aside resources for  the  delivery  of  indigenous  games  in  this
country. So, I think it  is  important  that  we  just  bring  that  to  her
attention.

Various references were made  to  drugs  in  schools.  The  hon  Adams  made
reference to that, but drugs reach a bit wider, as is  reflected  in  doping
in sports as well. Sports role-models have a role to  play  and  a  duty  to
counteract this by highlighting the dangers associated with doping and  drug
abuse. The SA Institute for Drug-free Sport, which is  a  public  entity  of
our department, also plays an important role in educating the  community  on
the dangers of drug abuse by means of their programmes. May  I  just  remind
this hon House that our Minister of Sport and  Recreation,  when  he  wished
our athletes going to Athens well, he also cautioned them not  to  embarrass
this  country  by  testing   positive   for   banned   performance-enhancing
substances. Drug and substance abuse is  an  evil  in  our  society  and  it
therefore warrants all our efforts to combat this evil on every front.

A lot of reference was also made to the national sports academy  system  and
we think that it is important that we just highlight some of the issues.  We
are aware of the  levels  of  investment  required  to  sustain  competitive
athletes and competitive teams. Reference was made to R1 million by  Gauteng
and some other amounts here and there but, overall, Government has made  its
first commitment the establishment of a national sports academy  system.  It
gave R10 million investment as seed capital during  this  current  financial
year. This will be utilised through assisting  in  the  preparation  of  our
athletes who will participate in the Olympics and the  Paralympic  Games  in
Athens in August and September respectively.

After  the  tendering  process,  the  facilities   and   services   of   the
Universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch were identified  as  suitable.  We
have heard from Free State that they are also involved in  those  facilities
but we have procured the facilities of Pretoria  and  Stellenbosch  for  the
Olympic and Paralympic teams respectively. They  were  identified  as  sites
and that is where our athletes are now.  May  I  just  say  that  the  first
intake of our elite athletes has reacted very positively to the  experiences
they have had in these programmes.

Regarding the inputs made by the hon Jajula and Tselapi, I would  just  like
to say  congratulations  to  the  Eastern  Cape.  I  believe  they  will  be
successful hosts of our games this year, 2004. I  think  KwaZulu-Natal  will
also be preparing to host some of the games in 2006. We wish them well.

May I end off by saying thank you to everyone,  every  hon  member  in  this
august House who prepared so well for their well-prepared inputs. It  was  a
pleasure to listen to them. We are looking forward to working  together  and
to building what this  country  is  in  such  desperate  need  of  -  sports
facilities and good, competent sportspeople  on  the  field.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Chairperson, it is clear that this  debate
is merely a beginning  and  that  we  need  much  more  interaction  on  the
substantive issues relevant to education in order to come  to  agreement  on
the manner in which we should approach our education enterprise.

Allow me to begin where the Deputy Minister ended, namely  by  thanking  all
the MECs and the hon members for their contributions. In particular, I  wish
to thank the MECs who have made the effort to be present here in  Parliament
for the contributions that they have made to our  debate.  Their  action  on
our agreed priorities offers hope for our children and all those who  thirst
for education.

On the range of work that remains to be done, I think I must  refer  to  the
challenge of dealing with issues of violence and abuse of  children  in  our
schools. I agree with hon members who raised this particular issue.  I  will
come back to how we are dealing  with  it.  The  matter  of  gender  equity,
promotion of school integration and nonracism in schools remain  significant
challenges that we must still confront. We have  referred  to  the  need  to
attract more entrants to the profession, and despite Ms Robinson's  comment,
it is an area in which we are taking action. We have intensified efforts  to
attract new students to the teaching and education profession.

We are also looking into  the  impact  of  Aids-related  deaths  on  teacher
supply. We have a study currently  underway  and  we  will  be  receiving  a
report before the end of this year on this study, and I'm  sure  that  we'll
come back to this House on the outcome of that particular review, which  was
initiated by the Education Labour Relations Council in partnership with  the
Department of Education. We look forward to the  lessons  that  will  emerge
from  that  study.  Nevertheless,  we  have  taken  the  issue  of  HIV/Aids
education and action very, very seriously and have a range of programmes  in
our schools that include both  education  towards  prevention,  as  well  as
learning of new values  and  counselling  and  support  for  those  who  are
affected and infected. So, we have done a range of things, and  I'm  pleased
to be able to report that to this House.

We have a number of task  teams.  I  have  already  referred  to  these.  As
reports emerge we will approach the  presiding  officers  to  offer  us  the
opportunity to make statements before the House. Might I also say  in  terms
of the matter of safety in schools, the  hon  Robinson  would  be  aware  of
initiatives such as the Safe Schools Project. She also would  have  read  in
the media recently of our department's partnership with the United  Nations'
Office on Drug Abuse that we just concluded in order to intensify action  in
this area. But the best action is to educate  our  children  against  drugs,
against alcohol and against all forms of abuses and to tell them  that  they
do not have to become infected, they can  remain  free  of  an  HIV-positive
status if they conduct themselves in a manner that is appropriate and  in  a
manner that is safe. So, we can play this role  of  education,  support  and
counselling.

Regarding the comments made by Ms Robinson on the teaching of music  in  our
schools, I have to say that  this  department  and  the  last  10  years  of
democracy did not lead to  a  decline  in  music  education.  It  was  never
present anyway. And in fact, those schools that have such a  programme  have
tended to seek private funding from parents to provide for  access  to  such
programmes. On our own ground we have made  a  great  deal  of  progress.  I
would invite hon members to attend the eisteddfod  of  music  by  our  young
people in this country, where our own choir, the  Tirisano  Choir,  will  be
participating, from 1 to 4 July.

We must also acknowledge the emergence of black opera stars in our  country,
who have taken on the world stage and who have  shown  the  talent  that  we
have. We must also appreciate shows such as Umoja and  Sarafina,  which  are
South African examples of ability in music, art  and  culture.  We  need  to
stop being negative about ourselves and  our  progress  and  development.  A
great deal is being achieved. A great deal is being  done  and  we  do  have
talent in our country.

I do agree though with the hon member that, perhaps at  a  local  level,  we
need to look at what we might do. I do worry that  we  are  rather  slow  at
working to produce  a  classical  guitarist  or  classical  pianist  in  our
communities, and I have begun to toy with the notion of looking  at  whether
we can have locally-based music institutes  that  are  in  partnership  with
local government and education departments so that our children who wish  to
learn to play instruments have a place to go to  acquire  these  skills.  We
should not see it as residing only within the school, but we should  realise
that it is actually a community initiative where the community can share  in
the learning and the enjoyment of music.

I also believe that we must definitely give attention  to  the  problems  of
KwaZulu-Natal, but I do not accept that they should be laid at our  door.  I
believe the  previous  government  in  that  province  did  very  poorly  on
education and their record is now becoming very clear in this regard, and  a
great deal needs to be addressed. Let me say to the  hon  Grinker,  I'm  the
last member of Parliament or Minister to waste money. There is no  boulevard
that is planned by this Department of Education; no costly building, but  we
have engaged in a public-private partnership  with  the  private  sector  to
assist us in building a  building  which  we  would  lease  far  more  cost-
effectively than the current cost of the building that  we  are  renting  in
Pretoria.

I think if you build or seek new buildings in order to save funds  that  you
are currently expending at too high a cost it is a sensible option.  I  have
to say one of the things that I said to the Deputy Minister when  I  entered
the building in  Pretoria,  which   was:  ``We  are  going  to  have  to  do
something about this building, because we're not going to survive  10  years
here. We have our staff spread over three buildings. It is extremely  costly
- we can't have that. So, we are arranging to have one building  which  will
be cost-effective and which will save us money,  rather  than  waste  money.
But there is no boulevard planned, and  I  think  we  shouldn't  misconstrue
what we are doing. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Many members have referred to  the  matter  of  school  fees,  the  cost  of
education, and particularly the exclusion of the poor. I think the  role  of
our school governing bodies in this regard  needs  examination  and  I  hope
that we will be looking at this far more closely. I don't mean by that  that
we eliminate the positive gains that we've made in our  democracy  with  the
democratic and important role that we've given to school  governing  bodies.
But where I think there may be a need for  adjustment  is  that  perhaps  we
have not given the school governing bodies a sufficient developmental  role,
and therefore they see themselves as fiduciary supervisors  who  must  raise
money and exclude people who do not have money. And they sometimes  do  this
very harshly.  This  role  must  be  changed.  The  poor  cannot  be  denied
education, and we've got to address this. There is no way  that  I  will  be
convinced that it must not be addressed. So, certainly,  the  issue  of  the
access of the poor to education will be dealt with.

I think the examples that have been given by colleagues  from  the  Northern
Cape and Gauteng of exempting certain schools, which  address  the  poor  as
quintile in our society, are important strategies that we  should  look  at.
But what is very important, is in addressing the  issue  and  needs  of  the
poor and their financial exclusion, we shouldn't  have  different  types  of
public schools. We've got  to  remember  that  all  public  schools  are  in
receipt of public funds and therefore they must address  the  needs  of  all
the children of our country. We can't have some schools that are  for  those
who can pay, but are public schools, and others are for those who are  poor,
and yet are also public schools. I think these are  issues  that  require  a
great deal of thought and deliberative attention from us. But certainly,  we
will be addressing all of these.

On education and job creation, which members have  referred  to,  I  believe
we've got to  pursue  training  for  job  creation  and  innovation.  I  was
fortunate to attend the Young Designers Award Ceremony  recently,  which  is
run by the Institute  of  Design  in  partnership  with  the  SA  Bureau  of
Standards, and I was amazed at the innovative and creative  ability  of  the
children of our country. That's the kind  of  creativity  that  we  need  to
build. All those children who were finalists in that  designer's  award  are
children who are creating  business  ideas  out  of  their  studies.  That's
entrepreneurship. That's what we must  encourage  -  not  children  who  are
being  trained  to  seek  employment.  These  children  are  thinking  about
creating  jobs,  creating  opportunities,  starting  businesses  and  really
making a significant contribution to our economy.

I would also like  to  say  on  Mpumalanga  and  the  Institute  for  Higher
Learning, I believe that by September this year we  will  be  able  to  make
announcements in that regard.  It  is  not  off  our  radar  screen.  It  is
certainly part of our thinking for this year  and  we  will  be  making  the
appropriate announcements at the right time, but we are  working  to  ensure
that, just like in the Northern Cape, we'll also address  the  institute  at
the Mpumalanga level. We need to ensure that, as  we  proceed  to  implement
all of these, we are not creating a whole lot of structures  that  serve  no
need in our country, and we do it  merely  because  each  province  wants  a
facility. It must make educational sense for us, and therefore,  as  we  set
about defining the character of the institute, I want to be sure that we  do
not duplicate what exists close by in Pietersburg and  elsewhere,  and  that
we actually have  the  institute  as  a  critical  provider  of  educational
programmes for Mpumalanga and all the students in  South  Africa  who  would
want to utilise it. But certainly, the hon Pule, we will make  announcements
in that regard.

I would like to then conclude by saying that I have been very  fortunate  in
receiving very positive accolades from  all  colleagues,  as  well  as  from
members of the public who have written and  called  in.  The  staff  of  the
department has been wonderful to both the Deputy Minister and me.  They,  as
I have said, work in spaces  that  that  are  very  difficult  -  hence  our
building,  and  not  the  boulevard!  We  will  create  a  positive  working
environment for them, as well as for us. I would like to  thank  the  Deputy
Minister for the hard work and comradeship that have characterised the  past
few weeks.

I must say that sport is certainly part of  our  core  curriculum.  I  don't
know why the hon members are saying that our  curriculum  does  not  include
sport. It does. In fact, part of our problem really  is  how  we  implement.
It's having educators to implement. My sense is that maybe  what  we  should
do is to ask  the  national  Department  of  Sport  and  Recreation  in  the
provinces to assist us by persuading the Breyton Paulses to adopt  districts
and schools within districts, and to work with these  schools  to  encourage
sport  performance  and  sport  participation,  so  that  our  children  are
enthused to participate by those who are their heroes and  heroines  in  the
sporting arena. But it is part  of  our  curriculum  and  certainly  we  are
seeking to enhance and increase participation.

I stressed in the debate in  the  National  Assembly  that  we  will  pursue
quality education for all.

Ke kopa gore fa re bona thuto e sa tswelele sentle, re dire gore re  nne  le
lerato mo thutong. Ke batla gore re nne le lerato  le  le  leng  bothito  mo
thutong. Ke re go rona rotlhe, a re tsweleleng pele ka thuto e e  ntle  gore
bana ba rona le bona ba nne  bantle  mo  lefatsheng  le  la  Aforika  Borwa.
(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[I request that if we see education is not progressing well,  we  must  take
an interest in education. We must feel warm love for education.  All  of  us
must continue to get a good education so that  our  children  too  could  be
well off in this country of South Africa.]

Thank you, very much, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

                     ELECTORAL COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms J MASILO: Ke a leboga motlotlegi motlatsa modulasetilo. [Thank  you,  hon
Deputy Chairperson.]

Deputy Chairperson, the select committee, after  considering  the  Electoral
Commission Amendment Bill, B7  of  2004,  and  recognising  the  urgency  of
extending the life of  the  electoral  commissioners,  agreed  to  the  Bill
without amendments. Our agreement to  this  Bill  will  allow  the  National
Assembly  enough  time  to  deal  with  the  nomination   process   of   the
commissioners within the timeframe of three months.

We also wish to thank the incumbent commissioners for  the  outstanding  and
excellent work that they have done in the 2004 general elections, and  we'll
continue  to  support  and  trust  them  to  deliver  free  and  fair  local
government elections in 2005. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now
put the Question and the  Question  is  that  the  Bill  be  agreed  to.  In
accordance  with  Rule  63  I  shall  first  allow  political  parties   the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  Is  there
any party that wish to do so? None.  We  therefore  proceed.  We  shall  now
proceed to the voting. Those in favour, say aye.

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Those against, say no.

HON MEMBERS: No.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think the ayes have it.  The  majority
of members of have voted in favour, in fact all of you. I therefore  declare
the Bill agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.

Bill agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.

The House adjourned at 18:09.
