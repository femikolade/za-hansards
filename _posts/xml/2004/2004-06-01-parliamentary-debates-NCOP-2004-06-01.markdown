                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and disgust that the carcasses  and  bones  of  dead
       animals are being dumped in a field  near  Jeppestown,  Johannesburg,
       causing an unbearable odour;


  (2) further notes that this is an unacceptable  and  unhygienic  practice
       and a health hazard to the communities that live nearby;


  (3) urges the relevant authorities and departments to take the  necessary
       action in order to put an immediate end  to  the  dumping  of  animal
       carcasses in this area; and


  (4) acknowledges the need for law enforcement officials  to  periodically
       patrol the above-mentioned area and bring to book  any  people  found
       dumping animal carcasses.

     SOUTH AFRICA'S SUCCESSFUL BID FOR THE SOCCER WORLD CUP CHAMPIONSHIP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Mr Danny Jordaan  and  the  South  African  Soccer  Bid
       Committee  on  their  success  in  bringing  the   2010   World   Cup
       Championship to South Africa;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  according to some estimates, thousands of  visitors  will  spend
           some R18 billion locally and the championship  could  contribute
           some R25 billion towards South Africa's gross national income;


       (b)  there is also the  potential  of  creating  160  000  employment
           opportunities which are sorely needed; and


       (c)  another R5 billion in taxes should be created  for  the  fiscus;
           and


  (3) recognises that -


       (a)  stadia and transport infrastructure will have to  be  built  and
           upgraded, which will benefit all  South  Africans  in  the  long
           term;


       (b)  cities such as Sydney, Barcelona and Atlanta are  good  examples
           of renewal with regard  to  urban  transport  systems,  sporting
           facilities and housing as a result of hosting  successful  world
           events; and


       (c)  whilst a lot of hard work and planning remains to  be  done,  we
           are proud to be South Africans and look forward to a  successful
           2010 World Cup Championship.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        NATIONAL PARAFFIN SAFETY DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the New National Party by way of  this  motion  without  notice,
           wants to sensitise the Council about the fact that for the first
           time in the history of South Africa,  today,  1  June  2004,  is
           National Paraffin Safety Day;


       (b)  according to the Paraffin Safety Association of Southern  Africa
           (PSA)  the  date  was  determined  in  consultation   with   the
           Department of Health; and


       (c)  one of the biggest causes of infernos  and  destruction  in  our
           informal settlements is unsafe stoves and that according to  the
           PSA the eradication of  such  stoves  has  become  a  matter  of
           national importance; and


  (2) resolves to support the call for safer but more  affordable  paraffin
       stoves.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            TWIN BABIES FOUND AND CARED FOR BY ASHERVILLE FAMILY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) appreciates the sympathy, love and care of Mr Adrian  Reddy  and  his
       family, of Asherville, who have given a  loving  home  to  twin  baby
       girls found by Mr Reddy abandoned in the bush;


  (2) applauds Mr Reddy who -


       (a)  when going to work early in the morning heard  the  cries  of  a
           baby which were coming from the bush at the  corner  of  Stanley
           Copley Drive and Nerina Road; and


       (b)  stopped his car when hearing these cries  and  investigated  the
           area, which led to the discovery of two tiny babies covered with
           rags and lying in a cardboard box;


  (3) acknowledges that out of sympathy he took these baby  girls  home  to
       his mother and wife, Amina, and that both women, filled with motherly
       instincts, sprang into action and the babies  were  bathed,  fed  and
       clothed;


  (4) notes that while the logistics of investigations  are  being  carried
       out by police, the babies are being given tender love and care by  Mr
       Reddy's wife; and


  (5) praises such spirit of goodwill which is being shown  to  the  babies
       and notes that, according to the Sunday Tribune of 16  May  2004,  Mr
       Reddy's wife is keen to adopt the two foundlings, keep and raise them
       by the grace of God; and


  (6) applauds such generosity shown by Mr Reddy's family as a whole.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            WORLD NO-TOBACCO DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  yesterday, 31 May, was World No-Tobacco Day;


       (b)  in terms of a report of the World Health Organisation  the  poor
           are the biggest victims of the tobacco  industry  and  the  poor
           tend to smoke the most - of the estimated  1,3  billion  smokers
           worldwide, 84% live in developing countries; and


       (c)  in South Africa poor households spend about 4%  of  their  total
           expenditure on cigarettes - this is money that could  have  been
           used for food, shelter and education; and


  (2) therefore urges the Minister of Health, the Department of Health  and
       all relevant role-players to work together to make  sure  that  South
       Africa strives to become a healthier society.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        RENEWAL OF CEASEFIRE IN SUDAN
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with delight the decision by the Sudanese  government  and  the
       country's main rebel group to renew their ceasefire;


  (2) acknowledges that such a ceasefire is an  important  requirement  for
       creating the necessary conditions for a comprehensive peace agreement
       to end a war that has  caused  hundreds  of  deaths  and  large-scale
       displacements of people;


  (3) reiterates its support for the efforts of  the  Sudanese   government
       and rebel forces to resolve their conflict to enhance  durable  peace
       and sustainable development for the people of Sudan; and
  (4) believes an intrinsic link exists between peace and  development  and
       in  this  context  underlines  the  importance  of  Nepad  as  a  key
       instrument with which to realise the objective  of  peace,  stability
       and social development across the African continent.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             EASTERN CAPE'S 10-YEAR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D G MKONO: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Eastern Cape government has developed a 10-year growth
       and development plan to deal with continued high levels  of  poverty,
       unemployment and development disparities;


  (2) further notes that the plan outlines key areas of emphasis that  need
       attention and dedication for ``attainment of  the  overall  strategic
       objectives designed to improve and better the lives  of  the  people,
       especially the poorest of the poor"; and


  (3)  welcomes  the  10-year  growth  and  development  plan  as   further
       demonstration of the provincial government's commitment to enter into
       a People's Contract to build a broad front  for  the  eradication  of
       poverty and underdevelopment.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms J MASILO: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that International Children's Day is celebrated today, 1 June;


  (2) notes that the ANC has consistently expressed the view that more than
       any other segment of society, children are most at risk from violence
       and abuse and are particularly affected by the legacy of poverty  and
       underdevelopment in society;


  (3) recognises that the ANC has therefore done much work  since  1994  to
       improve the situation of South Africa's children, trying to intervene
       in the situation of those most at risk and broadening access for  all
       children to health care, education and other opportunities;


  (4) acknowledges that since it came into office in 1994, the ANC has  put
       in place many programmes to translate children's rights into reality;
       and


  (5) believes that all sections  of  society  need  to  work  together  to
       nurture and protect South Africa's children, who remain vulnerable to
       poverty, violence, neglect and disease.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        MEASURES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms S E MABE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

  That the Council -


  (1) recognises the negative impact of corruption in the Public Service on
       the ability of Government to implement and  accelerate  its  delivery
       programme in respect of the provision of housing;


  (2) acknowledges the steps already implemented by our ANC-led  government
       to combat corruption, including the anti-corruption legislation which
       was passed towards the end of last year;


  (3) welcomes the announcement by the Minister of Housing that  a  special
       unit is to be set up to tackle corruption in the housing sector; and


  (4) believes this is  further  confirmation  of  the  commitment  of  the
       current Government to progressively root  out  corruption  to  ensure
       that the people who are provided  with  housing  are  those  who  are
       really in need.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  POLITICAL PRESSURE ON VICE-CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A L MOSEKI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with extreme concern the  political  interference  in  academic
       affairs by the leader of the DA, Tony Leon,  when  he  tried  to  put
       pressure  on  University  of  KwaZulu-Natal   vice-chancellor,   Prof
       Malekgapuru Makgoba, to reappoint an elderly academic whose  contract
       expires next month;
  (2) views in a serious  light  this  ``political  blackmail  through  his
       parliamentary office to gain favours for certain people"; and


  (3) calls on the DA leader to respect the autonomy of our universities to
       make their own decisions about policies and practices, including  the
       appointment of staff.

The  CHAIRPERSON   OF   THE   NCOP:   Order!   Is   there   any   objection?

    AFRICA DAY - PROMOTING PEACE, UNITY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL
                   INTEGRATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Thank you very  much  indeed,  Madam
Chairperson, and let me say how honoured I am to address this House  on  the
important occasion of Africa Day, which took place a few days ago. It is  an
honour for me particularly as this is my maiden  speech  in  this  House  to
address you on this important occasion. [Applause.]

Forty-one years ago, on 25 May 1963, the Organisation of African  Unity  was
born in Addis Ababa. It was formed as a vehicle to work  towards  the  total
liberation of the African people. It was formed at a time when  the  peoples
of Africa were largely governed by  colonial  powers,  when  basic  freedoms
were  denied  to  most  Africans,  when  people  were  constrained  in   the
expression of their own cultural and linguistic heritages  by  the  colonial
and minority powers, and when people's cultures and values were  usurped  by
the colonial powers of Europe.

People of Africa were belittled and controlled by the powers that sought  to
get rich from the bounties of our continent and to  divide  her  people,  to
force them into their own ways and,  through  slavery  and  servitude,  into
second-class citizenship.

The OAU was formed from a common desire to liberate the continent from  this
tyranny and to work tirelessly for equality, justice and  progress  for  all
her people. At that period in time the goal was to achieve the  independence
of the countries of Africa from their colonial masters  and  from  apartheid
and other racist minority regimes.

It is in no small measure due to the efforts of that  organisation  and  its
solidarity with the people  of  South  Africa  that  we  have  achieved  our
freedom here in the most southern state of Africa. In  April  1994  when  we
achieved our freedom, the  goals  of  the  OAU  were  largely  achieved.  To
complete the process we are hopeful that the United Nations  initiatives  in
the Western Sahara will bear fruit in the near future.

Then, on 25 May 2001, the African Union was formally established - 38  years
after the OAU was formed. At this time, Dr  Salim  Ahmed  Salim,  Secretary-
General of the OAU, said:


  This is the day when we celebrate not only the life and  achievements  of
  the  Organisation  of  African  Unity  as  an  institution  but,  equally
  profoundly, it is an occasion  when  we  pay  homage  to  our  collective
  aspirations and joint endeavours as Africans. These have been 38 years of
  holding together as a people, deriving strength in  our  common  identity
  and pursuing the vision of a shared identity.

Today, and for  this  year,  we  have  another  occasion  to  celebrate.  We
celebrate what Dr Salim called the ``holding together as a people'', and  we
celebrate our own tenth anniversary of democracy.

The theme chosen for Africa Day this year  was  Youth  in  Sport  -  and,  I
think, it is particularly relevant that we also  celebrate  the  opportunity
we have won to host the greatest sporting event on earth, the  Soccer  World
Cup tournament. We join the millions of  South  Africans  and  Africans,  as
well as people throughout the world, both young  and  old,  who  on  15  May
celebrated the Fifa announcement that South Africa had earned the  right  to
host the tournament.

Much of the jubilation on that occasion centred  on  the  economic  benefits
that winning the right to host the tournament  will  present  to  us  -  the
issues  of  job   creation,   infrastructural   development,   international
investment and many other benefits that have been  raised  as  opportunities
for us - and  we  will  enjoy  these  benefits  together  with  our  African
neighbours.

Today we can celebrate yet another milestone  -  the  South  African  troops
that are participating in a peacekeeping mission in Burundi will  today  don
the blue caps of the United Nations and will lead the  UN  forces  there.  I
think we can be very proud of our men and women in Burundi and elsewhere  on
the continent. [Applause.]

Our  commitment  to  African   solidarity   through   our   membership   and
participation in the African Union is illustrated in the  way  in  which  we
are working with other countries on the continent in  peacekeeping  missions
such as Burundi, and  also  how  we  are  determined  to  work  together  to
successfully hold the 2010 World Cup. We will all remember  that  two  years
ago the African Union came into being at a ceremony in our own  country,  in
Durban, with South Africa and President Mbeki as its first president at  its
helm.

While the challenges facing the African Union are different to those of  the
OAU, they are underpinned by the same unity of purpose, the bonds  of  unity
and solidarity that characterised the formation  of  the  first  continental
body, the OAU, 41 years ago.

We find ourselves with different challenges in this first part of  the  21st
century. The world today faces the phenomenon of globalisation.  This  is  a
world where billions of rands worth of assets  can  move  between  countries
and between continents at the touch of a button on a  computer,  where  rich
and powerful countries  can  protect  their  own  industries  through  trade
practices which deny access  to  developing  countries,  even  though  those
developing countries produce goods more economically; it is  a  world  where
information and  communication  technology  rule.  We  have  to  face  these
challenges and simultaneously face the huge and tragic consequences  of  our
past - poverty and underdevelopment.

Africa Day is therefore both a  celebration  of  our  past  achievements  as
Africans as well as a time to consider our challenges and the ways in  which
we will overcome them. Key to the founding vision of both the  OAU  and  the
AU is the desire for solidarity, for affirming our common identity  and  the
need for collective action to resolve our continent's problems.

At the launch of the African Union a few years ago, President Mbeki  made  a
call on us as South Africans to build that unity of purpose. He said:
  Our first task is to achieve unity,  solidarity,  cohesion,  co-operation
  among the peoples of Africa and African states. We  must  build  all  the
  institutions  necessary  to  deepen  political,   economic   and   social
  integration of the African continent.  We  must  deepen  the  culture  of
  collective action in Africa and in our relations with  the  rest  of  the
  world.

The African Union thus provides us with an instrument with  which  to  focus
on these political, economic  and  social  aspects  of  the  integration  of
Africa. With the institutions of the African Union, the New Partnership  for
Africa's Development, Nepad, provides the vehicle for action.

The World Cup tournament and our  own  resolve  will  provide  us  with  the
opportunity to fast-track the implementation of Nepad projects. While  Nepad
is a programme of action, we must not lose sight of its primary  objectives,
and I wish to restate them here. They are to eradicate  poverty  in  Africa;
to place African countries, both individually and collectively,  on  a  path
of sustainable growth  and  development;  to  promote  the  empowerment  and
economic integration of women; and  thus  to  halt  the  marginalisation  of
Africa in the globalisation process.

The Nepad plan can be outlined in four main areas.  They  include,  firstly,
creating the conditions for sustainable  development,  including  conditions
of peace and security, democracy and political good governance, as  well  as
economic  and  corporate  governance  initiatives  and  a  subregional   and
regional  approach  to  development;  and  secondly,  focusing  on  sectoral
priorities, which include infrastructure development, bridging  the  digital
divide, energy and transport infrastructure, as  well  as  accessibility  of
water and sanitation.

There is  also  the  area  of  developing  our  human  resources,  including
reversing the so-called  brain  drain.  This  area  will  focus  on  poverty
reduction, bridging the education gap and  health  issues.  Agriculture  and
food  security  is  another  area,  plus  environmental   initiatives,   the
development of cultural resources  and  science  and  technology  platforms,
which are all priority sectors for Nepad. Thirdly,  there  is  the  area  of
mobilising  our  resources,   which   involves   increasing   domestic   and
international  investment,  as  well  as  securing  market  access  for  our
products.  Finally,  there  are  cross-cutting  issues  such  as   capacity-
building.

The Nepad Secretariat has been hard  at  work  since  2001  setting  up  the
mechanisms to deliver on Nepad's programmes. In addition to our own  efforts
as a participating country, the continental Nepad secretariat  is  based  in
South Africa and will continue to be based here.

About a year ago the Heads of State and Government Implementation  committee
of Nepad met in Abuja, Nigeria. Among the  issues  that  were  discussed  at
this meeting was the African Peer Review Mechanism. This,  as  most  of  you
would know, has attracted a lot of attention.  It  is  seen  by  some  as  a
punitive measure, but this is not its purpose. The APRM, as it is known,  is
a voluntary self-assessment process. It is designed  to  allow  for  African
states to assess each other in terms of  the  standards  of  democracy,  and
political, economic and corporate  governance  in  their  countries.  It  is
designed as a corrective measure and an opportunity for  African  states  to
share best practices and to learn from  the  experiences  of  other  African
countries.

The documents relating to this APRM were presented at the Abuja meeting,  to
which  I  referred,  and  accepted,  including  the  objectives,  standards,
criteria and indicators for the mechanisms. To date, 19  states  in  the  AU
have signed the Memorandum of Understanding,  including  South  Africa,  the
Panel of Eminent Persons has been agreed upon and the first  country  to  be
peer-reviewed will be Ghana later this year.  Rwanda,  Kenya  and  Mauritius
will also be reviewed during the course of this  year.  South  Africa,  with
the Presidency as the lead department and the Department of  Public  Service
and Administration as the focal point  department,  is  currently  preparing
for our peer review which will take place early next year.

I give these examples to show how determined Africa  is  about  its  future.
The Nepad process and the APRM are home-grown programmes.  They  embody  the
vision of Africans about their future.  They  are  driven  by  Africans,  in
partnership with the G8 countries  and  other  developed  countries  of  the
world, and they are about how we effect an African Renaissance.

It is my belief that we have one of the most interesting  countries  in  the
world, and we live on a dynamic and  exciting  continent.  On  24  May  last
year, when the President addressed guests at a  banquet  in  honour  of  the
40th anniversary of the founding of the OAU, he read from a letter that  had
been sent to him from an Afrikaner woman. Her name is  Gerda  Muller.  I  do
not know her, and I don't think she is famous. She is just a  South  African
citizen who was moved to write to the President with these powerful words:


  For many people the vision of an African Renaissance seems so  remote  as
  to be almost unreachable. Africa  is  a  continent  ravaged  by  disease,
  crippled by poverty and racked by the  same  wars,  human  cruelties  and
  social injustices that characterise much of present-day human  habitation
  on this planet. It is, however, exactly because  Africa  is  the  darkest
  outpost, the ultimate scapegoat, the blackest and the most foreign of the
  global ``amakwerekwere'' that Africa is uniquely qualified  to  lead  the
  way towards a profoundly new appreciation of life  on  earth:  a  gentler
  one, a more compassionable one, one that rests on a  recognition  of  the
  values of co-operation, service and human dignity. Africa  remembers  the
  injustices heaped upon her in the past, but  people  of  the  stature  of
  Nelson Mandela have shown her that character can be forged from hardship.
  Africa knows there is no one of lesser status to blame  for  her  current
  ills. Nothing will change unless Africa changes, and, by changing, Africa
  will change the rest of humanity.

The letter goes on:


  ... Africa the ``hopeless continent'' is destined to become the  hope  of
  humanity exactly because ``darkest Africa'' most perfectly  embodies  all
  the values that characterise this new spiritual age.


  All the qualities that kept Africa ``dark" in a  world  where  overvalued
  rationalisation and materialism reigned now  favour  her  as  she  slowly
  prepares to move into the limelight of a changed spiritual age, balancing
  on her head the earth wisdom of all she has gathered over  millennia:  an
  awareness of the feminine, an appreciation of the intuitive, and  a  deep
  conviction of the profoundly  spiritual  nature  of  life  on  earth  and
  beyond.


  The darkest continent is destined to become  the  most  enlightened.  The
  last will be first. Little orphan Africa is destined to become the mother
  of a more compassionate human era.

With those words I will leave you to think of what Africa Day means to  each
of us, and how we can all contribute to the vision of  our  former  leaders,
our present-day leaders and the ordinary people of this continent  who  have
brought us this far. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Chairperson, allow  me
first to congratulate the Deputy Minister on her appointment as  the  Deputy
Minister in the Department of Foreign Affairs. And may I say  I  have  great
faith in you, I worked with you. I know you will do a wonderful job there  -
and your maiden speech was wonderful.

This day marks the 41st anniversary of the founding of the  Organisation  of
the African Union, the continental organisation of African  solidarity  that
united and led the African peoples in bitter struggles  against  colonialism
and apartheid.

The OAU has throughout its existence made outstanding achievements of  great
political transcendence  that  have  changed  the  destiny  of  the  African
continent. We therefore, have, several and  profound  reasons  to  celebrate
Africa Day in recognition of these achievements today.

Today, as South Africa celebrates  its  10th  anniversary  of  the  dawn  of
peace, freedom and democracy, it is only proper and fitting that we  express
our humble gratitude on behalf of the millions of our people for the  moral,
political and material support that the people of Africa, through  the  OAU,
afforded us in our hour of need.

Indeed  the  victory  over  apartheid  was  not  only  the  outcome  of  the
sacrifices of the masses of the South African people, but also as  a  result
of the unflinching support of all the African people. For  indeed  apartheid
was an affront against all Africans as it  sought  to  cast  all  of  us  as
subhuman, as President Thabo Mbeki noted:


  The  anti-apartheid  struggle  constituted  a  historic  step  away  from
  centuries of a past during which many  in  the  world  had  accepted  the
  assertion of the subhumanity of the Africans as a self-evident truth.

Today we must recognise and acknowledge the international solidarity  action
by ordinary people of the world in helping to restore  the  dignity  of  our
people. The fact that the people of the world joined us in the  struggle  to
defeat apartheid, the crime against humanity, meant that, at  last,  and  in
action, all humanity had come together to assert the shared humanity of  all
people, regardless of race.

Accordingly, as we celebrate the 41st anniversary of the OAU, we  are  happy
to report to the founding leaders of this historic movement that they,  like
all Africans, must rejoice in the full  knowledge  that,  save  for  western
Sahara, all Africa is indeed free at last. The continent  however  continues
to be plagued by  challenges  of  poverty,  diseases  and  underdevelopment,
spurned by years of slavery, imperialism, colonisation and  neocolonisation,
which continue to condemn millions of African people  to  unbearable  living
conditions.

The transformation of the OAU to the African Union could therefore not  have
come at a better time to tackle these challenges  that  threaten  to  reduce
our peoples to the level of subhumanity. It is  our  belief  that  no  other
formation except the African Union is best placed to undertake  a  programme
of such magnitude. The historical duty therefore is  for  all  Africans,  in
government, business and civil society to  strengthen  and  jealously  guard
our new continental organisation and all its structures.

We remain steadfast in our belief that  the  African  Union  will  give  the
continent the necessary political and economic strength to become  an  equal
partner  to  other  regions  of  the  world  and  a   proactive   actor   in
international relations. The adoption of NEPAD by the African  Union  was  a
fundamental milestone in the history of  our  continent.  Nepad  provides  a
platform for  the  construction  of  a  united,  prosperous  and  harmonious
continent, thus giving  substance  to  the  ideas  and  aspirations  of  the
African people.

One of the most important achievements of our  continental  efforts  is  the
unequivocal statement that the unity of Africa is paramount to  the  success
of African renewal. This is  demonstrated  by  the  formation  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament and its conscious decision to ensure that its  bureau  is
representative of all the regions of the continent. The PAP seeks to  create
a common platform for African people and their grass-roots organisations  to
be more involved in  discussions  and  decision-making  processes  that  are
geared to engaging with continental  challenges.  Parliamentarians  and  the
civil society throughout the  continent  remain  an  important  catalyst  in
promoting a culture of  dialogue,  tolerance  of  differences,  recognition,
mutual help and sharing. They must  through  PAP  seek  to  consolidate  the
vision and aspirations of African people for greater unity,  solidarity  and
cohesion in a larger community, transcending cultural, ideological,  ethnic,
religious and national differences. Key to the PAP challenges would  be  the
protection  of  human  rights,  consolidation  of  democratic  institutions,
popularisation and promotion of good governance throughout the continent.

The official launch of the African  Peace  and  Security  Council  in  Addis
Ababa  on  Tuesday,  25  May  2004,  will  therefore  give  impetus  to  our
commitment to  rid  Africa  of  civil  strife  and  wars  that  continue  to
undermine  our  development.  This  new  organ  must  surely   signify   our
determination and unwavering commitment to peace,  security  and  stability.
Achieving peace  in  the  continent  is  the  necessary  condition  for  the
creation of a conducive climate for sustainable  development.  Our  economic
renewal and prosperity is in part dependent on the success of the Peace  and
Security Council. Indeed,  peace  and  stability  constitute  a  fundamental
prerequisite for the full attainment of the objectives set out in Nepad.  It
is for this reason that we harbour  great  expectations  of  the  Peace  and
Security Council as an efficient tool for the  realisation  of  the  African
agenda for conflict prevention, management and resolution.
Accordingly we must as a country, and as a member of the Peace and  Security
Council, do all we can to discharge our responsibility and mandate,  sparing
neither  strength  nor  effort  in  ensuring  peace  and  stability  on  the
continent. Peace, security and sustainable  development  are  vital  in  the
continental efforts to bring a better life for all Africans.

We will remember that last Sunday in Maputo the heads of state met  in  what
they call a form of the implementation committee, to see the  progress  that
has been achieved in terms of Nepad. That is an achievement on its  own  and
I think it is a wonderful achievement that we have thus far  also  achieved.
And secondly, we understand that George Bush has sent an invitation  to  the
African leaders to attend the G8 summit that will be held in  June.  Amongst
other things that will be discussed, is an attempt to engage each  other  on
the issues of  Africa.  This  is  a  wonderful  achievement  for  which  our
forefathers actually laid the foundation.

The achievements made by the African Union in the  relatively  short  period
of time of its existence, are truly remarkable. In  a  world  that  is  more
integrated and in which borders are permeable to the  flow  of  information,
knowledge, capital and human resources, Africa is challenged  to  take  full
advantage of these realities by designing and implementing  strategies  that
will enable it to mitigate the precious efforts of globalisation.

The journey is, however, still long. We must continue to work  hard  and  do
our best to be found deserving by future generations,  in  the  same  manner
that we have appreciation today for the mentors of African  unity.  Together
we shall succeed. The struggle continues. This is a great day. I  thank  you
all. [Applause.]

Ms B  N  DLULANE:  Chairperson,  let  me  first  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate our hon Comrade Deputy Minister:  ``You  strike  a  woman,  you
strike a rock''. Hon Deputy Minister and hon members,  as  we  are  gathered
here today to give expression to the significance of Africa  Day,  it  would
perhaps also be important that we revisit some of the  events  that  brought
us to our present juncture.

The culmination and celebration of Africa Day can  be  traced  back  to  the
establishment of the then Organisation of African  Unity  on  25  May  1963.
Subsequently, and through the decades that  followed,  the  peoples  of  our
continent yearned for that moment in time when their aspirations to live  in
a peaceful, democratic and prosperous continent would  be  realised.  As  we
are gathered here today in the aftermath of this  historic  day,  they  can,
like us here on the southernmost tip  of  the  continent,  rightly  proclaim
that ``Africa ke nako''.

African  leaders  have  learned  from  their  own  experiences  that  peace,
democracy, good governance, human rights and  sound  economic  policies  and
management  are  preconditions  for  the  realisation  of  these  legitimate
aspirations and sustainable development. It is in this context that the  New
Partnership for Africa's Development, or Nepad, should be seen. It offers  a
framework  and  long-term  vision  of  an  African-owned   and   African-led
development programme. Perhaps, more importantly,  it  differs  in  approach
and strategy from all previous plans and initiatives.

Although long-term funding is envisaged under the initiative, it provides  a
blueprint for poverty eradication in Africa  and  places  countries  on  the
continent, both individually and collectively,  on  a  path  to  sustainable
growth and  development.  It  thus  stops  the  marginalisation  of  Africa,
regarding the globalisation process. Moreover, the promotion of the role  of
women is central to all its objectives.

Some of its goals include the following: to achieve and sustain  an  average
gross domestic product of above 7% per  annum  in  the  next  15  years;  to
ensure that the continent  achieves  the  agreed  international  development
goals which are aimed  at  reducing  the  proportion  of  people  living  in
extreme poverty by half by 2015; to enrol all children of  school-going  age
in primary schools by 2015; to make progress  towards  gender  equality  and
empowering women by eliminating gender disparities in enrolment  in  primary
and secondary education by 2005; to  reduce  maternal  mortality  ratios  by
three-quarters by 2015; to reduce infant and child mortality  by  two-thirds
by 2015 - members may think that 2015 is very far, yet  it  is  unbelievable
that we expect still to be alive in the year 2010 when  we  host  the  World
Cup Soccer. Furthermore, the initiative also aims to provide access for  all
those who need reproductive health care by 2015; and to  implement  national
strategies for sustainable development by 2005 so  as  to  reverse  loss  of
environmental resources by 2015.

These strategies are designed  to  have  the  following  outcomes:  economic
development, growth and  increased  employment;  reduction  in  poverty  and
inequality;   diversification    of    production    activities;    enhanced
international competitiveness; increased exports; and  African  integration.
What is critical in this regard is the extent  to  which  African  countries
are going to pool their resources given the fact that most countries on  the
continent are small, both in terms of population and per capita  income.  In
this respect, Nepad is  also  perfectly  geared  towards  the  provision  of
essential  public  goods  such  as   transport,   energy,   water,   disease
eradication, environmental preservation and capacity. The focus is  also  on
rationalising  the  institutional  framework  for  economic  integration  by
identifying common projects compatible with integrated country and  regional
development programmes, and on the harmonisation of economic and  investment
policies and practices.

In conclusion, it is our sincere  hope  that  Africa  Day  will  create  the
necessary consciousness among the peoples of this continent and their grass-
roots organisations in  order  to  get  more  involved  in  discussions  and
decision-making on the socioeconomic challenges which beset Africa. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr D A WORTH: Madam Chair, Deputy Minister, on behalf of  the  DA,  I  would
like to congratulate the Deputy Minister on  her  appointment  and  for  her
maiden speech in this House. I'm sure that  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  will
make a meaningful contribution to her  department  and  to  the  affairs  of
Africa,

Officially 25 May 2004 was the 41st celebration of what is known  as  Africa
Day. Africa Day was established by  the  then  OAU  on  25  May  1963.  This
specific day provides an occasion for the whole of Africa to  intensify  the
search for solutions to the ongoing  problems  such  as  the  massive  human
rights  violations  in  the  Sudan,  and  the  continuing  tensions  in  the
Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere on this continent.

We must, of course, intensify our efforts individually and  collectively  to
find solutions to  these  problems.  However,  we,  as  Africans  and  South
Africans, can take justifiable pride in the  establishment  of  the  African
Union and the first tentative steps  in  the  creation  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament.

At long last, step by step, Africa is establishing a series of  institutions
to promote peace and security on our continent. Progress has also been  made
in the implementation of Nepad, in order to give priority to areas  such  as
agriculture, infrastructure, environment and  health  -  all  key  areas  in
reducing poverty, promoting social stability and improving  the  quality  of
life.

We have also seen the establishment of the African Peer Review  Mechanism  -
one of Nepad's most important  and  innovative  features  -  which  aims  at
fostering the adoption of good policies and practices leading  to  political
stability, economic growth, accountability, good governance and democracy.

The African Peace and Security Council, PSC, was also launched  recently  in
Ethiopia with much pride and optimism. The PSC has been billed as  a  robust
guarantor of stability in Africa, much like the UN Security  Council.  Peace
and security, after all,  are  the  indispensable  conditions  for  Africa's
socioeconomic development. The principle  of  noninterference  will,  it  is
stated, be replaced by the principle of nonindifference. However,  the  real
test remains our turning the dream into reality.

The cancer of tribalism, ethnicity, racism,  poverty,  HIV/Aids,  corruption
and crime must be eliminated from the face of Africa. Each  African  country
will have to take responsibility in order to  create  conducive  conditions,
honour and adhere to agreements;  and  uphold  respect  for  human  dignity,
human rights and democracy  to  create  peaceful  and  stable  environments.
Dictatorship and despotism must not be allowed to take root.

We must make greater progress in the fight against HIV/Aids which is  taking
away Africa's present and its future. Whilst we  have  made  some  progress,
much remains to be done, and done urgently, to educate and  care  for  those
already infected. We must intensify the campaign against  HIV/Aids  as  well
as the  continued  violent  conflict  in  various  parts  of  Africa,  which
continue  to  hold  back  development  by  destroying  social  and  economic
infrastructure,  diverting  resources  and  tearing  apart  the  social  and
cultural fabric of the affected societies. At the same time, we look to  the
international  community  for  more  support  for  Africa's   efforts.   The
international community must continue to  complement  the  efforts  made  by
Africans themselves through fairer trade, greater aid and  significant  debt
relief.

Southern Africa has a major role to play in the economic upliftment  of  all
its peoples. Imagine if Angola sold its  oil  to  South  Africa  instead  of
America, and we could refine  the  oil  and  supply  Angola  with  fuel  and
rebuild its roads and infrastructure, and in  return  create  jobs  in  both
countries.  Imagine  if  a  mega-power  grid  could  be   established   with
hydroelectricity not only being supplied by the Cahora Bassa  Dam  but  also
fed by cheap hydroelectricity, as envisaged, from the Congo  River.  Imagine
if water could be fed through  pipelines  from  the  Zambezi  River  to  the
Caprivi, in Botswana, then to the  Gauteng  area,  instead  of  90%  of  the
Zambezi's water flowing out to the sea.

We are already seeing the  boundaries  of  our  national  game  parks  being
changed  to  incorporate  much  larger  transnational  parks   which   will,
hopefully, attract far more tourists, let  alone  the  preservation  of  our
wildlife heritage.

Africa is rich in minerals and in its  diversity  of  people.  There  is  no
reason whatsoever why Africa, given the  opportunity,  should  not  succeed.
Let us therefore dedicate  ourselves  to  building  a  stronger,  healthier,
peaceful, and economically vibrant  and  democratic  Africa.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: Hon Chairperson, when I speak today on behalf of the New  NP,
I speak as somebody who has his roots in the Northern  Cape,  in  Africa.  I
speak as somebody who  knows  the  heat,  the  drought,  the  cold  and  the
joyfulness after rain that you experience in the Karoo, in Africa.  I  speak
as somebody who knows the beauty  and  vastness  of  the  Kalahari  and  the
Namaqualand regions of our province - the Northern Cape, in Africa.

But I also speak as somebody who knows the potential  of  South  Africa  and
its people in Africa. Further, I speak as a South African who  realises  and
acknowledges the potential of Africa.

When  we  address  the  issue  of  promoting  peace  and   unity,   economic
development and social integration in Africa,  we  realise  and  acknowledge
that South Africa must, and will, play a meaningful role in this very  noble
idea.

Wanneer ons praat oor vrede en eenheid, is dit ook noodsaaklik dat  ons  van
Afrika besef ons krag lê in ons diversiteit. As mense van  Afrika,  sal  ons
moet besef dat  Afrika  se  toekoms  daarin  lê  dat  ons  moet  strewe  dat
demokrasie nie net 'n modewoord word wat  vyfjaarliks  herhaal  word  om  'n
nuwe regime of regering in plek te plaas nie.
Demokratiese beginsels, die  instandhouding  van  die  onderskeie  lande  se
grondwette, die vryheid van die media en verdraagsaamheid teenoor mekaar  is
ononderhandelbare  werklikhede.   (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[When we talk about peace and unity, it is also essential that  we  who  are
from Africa must realise that our strength lies in our diversity. As  people
of Africa, we will have to realise that Africa's  future  depends  upon  our
efforts to ensure that democracy does not become  just  a  fashionable  word
which is repeated every five years to put a  new  regime  or  government  in
place.

Democratic  principles,  the  maintenance  of  the  constitutions   of   the
respective countries, the freedom of the media and mutual tolerance are non-
negotiable realities.]

When we address this issue, it is important to acknowledge that  initiatives
such as Nepad, and through that, the objectives of the African  Union,  must
be forerunners in breaking new ground in Africa.  When  we  try  to  address
this issue, it is important  to  acknowledge  the  role  that  previous  and
current leaders played and are  playing  to  ensure  that  Africa  does  not
remain a dark and lost continent.

Now is the time  for  Africa  to  show  its  real  potential.  We  have  the
minerals; we have the climate; we have the strategic position; but  most  of
all, we have the people and the will to make Africa a winning continent.  It
is necessary therefore that all political parties, also in this  Parliament,
must play a constructive and meaningful role to ensure that we achieve  this
daunting challenge.

What is happening in Africa or in certain parts of Africa as we  speak  now,
where  bloodshed,  war,  famine  and,  in  the  final  instance,  death  are
realities of the day, must stop. [Time expired.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, hon Minister and colleagues, 25 May is  the  day
South Africa and the African continent celebrate Africa Day.  On  this  day,
in 1963, the Organisation of African Unity was established in  Addis  Ababa,
Ethiopia. Its purpose was to promote the unity  and  solidarity  of  African
states, to defend the sovereignty of all members, to eradicate all forms  of
colonialism and to promote international co-operation and  peace,  with  due
regard for the charter of the United Nations and the  Universal  Declaration
of Human Rights, to mention but a few.

These initiatives of the OAU paved the way for  the  birth  of  the  African
Union, and it was officially launched in Durban on 9 July  2002  to  replace
the OAU. The AU aims, amongst other functions, to  combat  poverty,  famine,
disease and internal strife, and to promote economic progress.

Despite the festivities planned for Africa Day celebrations,  the  following
immediate and pressing problems facing the continent will  be  addressed  as
part of the setting up  of  the  AU  and  Nepad:  the  acceleration  of  the
socioeconomic integration of the region  and  the  continent;  the  role  of
women in the future political history of  the  continent;  the  entrenchment
and spread of democratic  principles;  the  control  of  pandemics  such  as
HIV/Aids  and  malaria  on  the  continent;   disaster   and   environmental
management; and food security.

The  continent's  political  leaders  are   currently   elected   far   more
democratically than in the past, and have realised that  the  liberation  of
the continent from oppression must be given a new impetus.  The  real  cause
for celebration for Africa Day lies in the fact  that  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of  Foreign  Affairs  and
hon members, on behalf of the IFP I just want to echo the sentiments of  the
previous speakers on Africa Day.

I am an African, born and brought up  on  this  continent,  in  a  wonderful
country in Africa, South Africa. I have experienced and enjoyed  both  urban
and rural life; whether bitter or sweet, I know because I'm  an  African  in
Africa.

Today, Africa as a whole enjoys the noble  status  of  recognition  far  and
wide because of the leaders it has produced. I salute these leaders and  the
noble ideals  that  contributed  to  the  promotion  of  unity,  solidarity,
cohesion and co-operation amongst the  peoples  of  Africa.  Halala,  Africa
Day, halala!

Today, we speak of the African Union, Nepad, the Pan-African Parliament  and
so on. The South African Government played a  very  important  role  in  the
formation of these important organs of state.

Mphathisihlalo  ohloniphekileyo  nendlu  yonke,  i-Afrika   iyigugu   lethu,
siyayithanda  futhi  siyaziqhenya  ngokuba  ngama-Afrika.  Ozonda   i-Afrika
nabantu bayo  uzizonda  yena  uqobo  lwakhe.  Izwe  lethu  lihle  likhangisa
ngobuhle balo bemvelo, izintaba, imifula,  amahlathi,  nokunye.  Izwe  lethu
liyinoni  ezivakashini  ezivela  kwamanye  amazwe.  Ukugcwalisa   ukunconywa
kwalolu suku nesikhathi se-Afrika  esiphila  kuyo,  kuyahlabahlosa  ngokuthi
kubuyiswe isithunzi  sama-Afrika  onkana  jikelele.  Ulimi  lwethu,  amasiko
ethu, amagugu ethu emvelo kwenza i-Afrika ihlabahlose futhi ipheleliswe.

Egameni leNkatha yenkululeko yesizwe, ngincoma ukugcina amagugu ethu  esizwe
namasiko ethu amahle kuze kube manje. Ukugqoka isidwaba, ubuhlalu,  ibheshu,
isinene, isigege, nokunye  sikugcinile  ukukhombisa  imvelaphi  yethu  kwaze
kwaba manje. Ukugcina lama siko  kusikhumbuza  ukuthi  singobani,  sivelaphi
nokuthi siyaphi. Sinengcebo enhle kakhulu.

Ngomkhosi  weLembe   KwaZulu-Natal,   sincoma   uMntwana   wakwaPhindangene,
onguNdunankulu wesizwe samaZulu ngokusigcinela  wona.  Namhlanje  iNingizimu
Afrika igubha amasiko ayo ngosuku okuthiwa i-Heritage Day.  Lokhu  kuwuphawu
lwenqubekela phambili. UMongameli wezwe laseNingizimu Afrika  ugcizelele  i-
African Renaissance. Sithi halala Ningizimu Afrika! Halala! (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson and the House in general, Africa is our valuable asset;  we
love it and we proud to be African. One who  hates  Africa  and  its  people
hates oneself. Our country is beautiful and it shows off its natural  beauty
in the mountains, rivers, forests, etc. Our country  is  also  a  centre  of
attraction for tourists from other countries. To make  the  appreciation  of
this day complete and make this the time of  Africa,  a  time  in  which  we
live, it would be good to bring  back  the  dignity  of  all  Africans.  Our
language, our customs, our natural valuable  assets  make  Africa  beautiful
and complete.

In the name of the IFP I commend the way in  which  our  country's  valuable
assets have been preserved and our beautiful customs adhered to  until  now.
Wearing traditional attire has also been adhered to until now  to  show  our
origins. Adhering to these customs reminds us of who we are, where  we  come
from and where we are going. What a rich heritage we have!

About the celebration of iLembe in KwaZulu-Natal, we commend the  Prince  of
kwaPhindangene, who is the Chief of the Zulu nation, for preserving  it  for
us. Today South Africa celebrates its customs on the day  called  ``Heritage
Day''. This is a sign of progress. The President of the  Republic  of  South
Africa  has  put  emphasis  on  the  African  Renaissance.  We  are  saying,
``Congratulations, Africa! Congratulations!'']

What a rich heritage we have!
Sinengcebo enhle kakhulu! [What a rich heritage we have!]

We understand and acknowledge the fact that there are certain  conflicts  in
Africa that are still major impediments to the socioeconomic development  of
the continent as a whole. The African Union and Nepad are our hope and  best
weapons to address these issues effectively.

All fully-fledged Africans are anxiously waiting to host the Fifa World  Cup
in the year 2010. We are all excited and patiently waiting to contribute  to
such an important event. Halala, South Africa, halala! Halala,  Africa  Day,
halala! [Applause.]

Mr  O  M  THETJENG:  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  would  like,  first,  to
congratulate the Deputy Minister, on behalf of the DA, on  his  appointment.
I hope you will do your work in the way that this country expects you to.

We should all celebrate Africa  Day  by  promoting  peace,  unity,  economic
development and social integration for sustainable  development,  first,  as
citizens of this continent and, secondly, as a nation that has gone  through
the process. We are reaping the fruits of such determination.

This  continent  is  endowed  with  rich  natural  resources  and  gigantic,
beautiful landscapes. In the last decade there has been a dawn  of  hope  as
many countries in Africa have begun to embrace good governance,  though  the
pace is very slow.

Sustainable development cannot be achieved  without  genuine  commitment  to
the principles of good governance, as contained within the  New  Partnership
for Africa's Development and the African Union documentation.  In  order  to
display their commitment to these ideals, African countries  must  show  the
necessary resolve to bring about  an  end  to  conflict,  such  as  that  in
Zimbabwe, the Sudan, Burundi and the DRC.

The desire for political solidarity needs to be overcome  by  political  and
economic pragmatism. The challenge in Africa is  to  give  real  meaning  to
these noble principles. All forms of war bring  instability  and  mayhem  in
society. Children become orphans;  economic  development  ceases  to  exist;
and, unity of purpose is compromised - as we  speak,  it  is  reported  that
some parts of the Sudan are continuing to reel from a devastating civil  war
and ethnic cleansing.

Let peace, security and unity return for the sake of humanity. It is  a  no-
win situation or a losing situation for brothers and sisters to engage in  a
war over different political opinions or religious affiliations. We have  to
tolerate each other, as we are not the same  in  many  ways.  The  situation
across the border in Zimbabwe has not improved either, because there are  no
talks taking place, as acknowledged by  president  Robert  Mugabe  recently.
Sustainable economic development and peace and security are  tenets  enjoyed
by countries that practise  true  democracy,  and  there  are  very  few  in
Africa.

There are only 14 countries dubbed  ``the  jewels  of  Africa''.  They  are,
amongst  other  countries,  South  Africa,   Botswana,   Senegal,   Nigeria,
Mauritius, Zambia, Mozambique  and  Benin.  South  Africa  has  achieved  10
consecutive years of positive economic growth.  Botswana  was  ranked  among
the world's most advanced nations in terms of economic freedom in the  World
Report of 2003. She ranked alongside Norway and Japan, and  was  seen  as  a
shining   example   in   Africa.   Mauritius   has    built    sophisticated
telecommunications that have seen strong  economic  growth;  and  Tanzania's
growth rate has increased from 3,3% in 1997  to  6,2%  in  2002.  All  these
countries have achieved these gains by  adhering  to  democratic  norms  and
principles. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Zimbabwe,  with  an
inflation rate of 600%; an unemployment rate of 70%  and  5  million  people
facing starvation.

South Africa's democracy is a shining jewel in Africa and  the  world  over.
How many more countries in Africa will join this  journey?  Apartheid  South
Africa  destabilised  the  continent  in  its  pursuit  of  its  own  myopic
interests.  The  new  democratic  South  Africa's  role  in  the   continent
encourages unique responsibilities,  as  it  is  leading  the  call  for  an
African Renaissance.

South African capital and  expertise,  both  from  the  private  and  public
sectors, can play an important role in the continent, as illustrated by  the
expression of South African investment in Africa. These investments need  to
be made in a way that does not destroy local capacity and  is  sensitive  to
conditions in the local market.

South Africa cannot afford to be an imperialist  power.  We  hope  the  2010
World Cup will help Africa as it will take place in  Africa.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL (Mr V V Z  Windvoël):  Thank  you,  hon
Chair  of  Committees.  May  I  also  echo  the  sentiments   expressed   by
congratulating our Deputy Minister on her appointment to this new position.

It's disturbing that  Mr  Thetjeng  raised  his  controversial  views  about
Africa to which I listened. He thinks Africa ends with Zimbabwe.  Africa  is
composed of 53 countries, excluding the islands. It's just unfortunate  that
you raised whatever you raised after the  hon  Gibson  and  the  hon  Sandra
Botha had left the  gallery.  They  left  immediately  after  Mr  Worth  had
spoken. Maybe they thought that no other  DA  member  was  going  to  speak.
[Laughter.] I hope this  not  a  reflection  of  how  they  undermine  black
members in that political party.

I think that in terms of the spirit of all members who spoke  in  the  House
from across the political spectrum, we were united as one by the  fact  that
25 May is a special day for Africa and for all Africans regardless of  which
party they belong to. We also acknowledge that on this day,  41  years  ago,
31  African  heads  of  state  convened  a  summit  meeting  to  found   the
Organisation of African  Unity  and  they  proclaimed  that  day  as  Africa
Liberation Day. The day, therefore, has its origins in the long  history  of
African people in their quest to  break  free  from  the  yoke  of  European
domination and white supremacy. It is  a  day  on  which  we  emphasise  our
oneness as a people with a common past, a  common  set  of  problems  and  a
common future.

This particular day, therefore, provides a dynamic link  between  the  past,
present and future in terms of which one informs the other. In other  words,
not only do we celebrate the day in  recognition  of  the  contributions  of
past leaders, but we must also use it as an opportunity to  reflect  on  the
road we have travelled together thus far and to map out  our  future  course
as we seek to propel our continent towards its Renaissance.

A key obstacle in the process of the renewal of  Africa  is  Afro-pessimism.
We have to be honest and admit that not all the  significant  political  and
economic changes which have affected Africa  and  been  effected  in  Africa
during the last decade can be defined as  entirely  positive.  For  example,
besides the victory over apartheid which took place in our country in  1994,
we also saw the horror of the genocide in Rwanda during the same year.

Nevertheless, despite the  negative  images  broadcast  by  the  media,  the
continent has shown signs of progress. This  is  why  Afro-pessimism,  which
also prevails  amongst  sections  of  our  own  population,  appears  to  be
inappropriate. Indeed,  it  is  incorrect  to  assume  that  no  significant
progress towards peace and democracy has been made in the last decade.

I would like to reflect briefly on the effects and impact of war in  Africa.
No doubt everyone agrees that war is destructive. It can destroy any of  the
things  that  communities  have  built  up  over  generations.  It  destroys
families and the social  fabric  of  societies,  and  arrests  any  economic
progress. Women and children are  the  most  vulnerable  groups  in  society
during wartime. War leads to extreme poverty and destroys any sense of  hope
and self-esteem within communities. The sense of being able to  provide  for
yourself and the ability to do so are also destroyed.

In any war situation, human rights are  the  first  casualty.  The  rape  of
women takes place with impunity, and  rape  destroys  women  physically  and
psychologically, as we know. The  spread  of  preventable  and  communicable
diseases like HIV/Aids becomes endemic.  In  Africa  it  is  estimated  that
millions and millions of people have died because of  wars;  which  wars  we
must say were  not  only  caused  by  Africans  themselves,  but  were  also
exploited by external forces which had interests in  our  natural  resources
and minerals and thrived in those war situations.  The  social  spending  of
governments decreases during times of war, with defence budgets escalating.

We must, however, speak about the peace and  development  which  are  taking
place on the continent. The resolution and prevention of conflicts  continue
to preoccupy the international community. The UN, as the body  charged  with
the task of preventing conflict and maintaining international peace, has  at
times failed Africa.

Management of a postwar situation is crucial  if  you  are  to  prevent  the
recurrence of war. The same goes for the demobilisation of  soldiers,  which
brings fresh problems for postwar societies. In most cases,  those  soldiers
have no skills other than war survival skills. That's  why  10  years  after
democracy in South Africa we have seen that there  are  those  who  couldn't
survive in a postwar situation and who get caught in neighbouring  countries
in other activities furthering  mercenary  objectives,  which  only  benefit
those people who sent them or paid them and not the Africans and  Africa  as
a whole. We have not heard some of the voices that are critical  when  South
Africa spends its time, effort and money on trying to bring about peace.  We
have not had those people criticising certain mercenaries, but what we  hear
is that South Africa should intervene  and  protect  those  people  who  are
still engaged in the mentality of surviving through war skills.

Peace does not only mean the absence of  conflict,  but  would  also  ensure
that we have a very tranquil and peaceful place on the continent.  Peace  is
thus a fundamental part of humanity. We  also  say  this  in  terms  of  the
education  of  women  in  peacebuilding  efforts  as  this  is  central   to
sustaining the development and empowerment  of  such  women  after  whatever
wars have been engaged in in those countries throughout the continent.

The promotion and protection of  human  rights  and  all  other  fundamental
rights constitute an indispensable strategy for the prevention of  areas  of
conflict. The democratisation process that is sweeping the  continent  needs
the empowerment of women for it to be sustainable,  hence  peace  must  mean
freedom from want and humiliation.  Also,  development  planning  after  war
must involve beneficiaries at all levels.

We saw South Africa playing a destructive role in neighbouring countries  in
the past in that the economies of  our  neighbouring  countries  and  states
were destroyed and the people of those countries  were  forced  to  live  in
fear of the Big Brother who wanted to terrorise them at any time of the  day
or night. South Africa supported rebel movements in Angola  and  Mozambique.
For a number of years the old SA Defence Force  was  stationed  in  southern
Angola until the battle of Cuito Cuanavale made them retreat.

However, in the past 10 years of democracy we have seen  our  Defence  Force
play very noble roles. We saw the Defence Force  in  Mozambique  during  the
floods rescuing people who were subjected to near-death situations. We  have
seen the Defence Force playing peacekeeping roles. I know my time  is  about
to expire, so let me use the two minutes I have left to  commend  our  armed
forces on the peacekeeping roles they are playing throughout the  continent.
Today Africa is turning the tide against poverty, and we are confident  that
Africa  will  remain  a  peaceful  continent  and  prosper.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Hon  members,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the
presence of MBA students in the public gallery. They  are  from  Northumbria
University, north of England, and are on a  study  mission  to  learn  about
South Africa.
To our visitors, I wish to extend a hand of welcome to the National  Council
of Provinces, the equivalent of  your  House  of  Lords.  Welcome  to  South
Africa and to the National Council of Provinces. [Applause.]

THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Ms S C Van der Merwe):  Chairperson,
first of  all,  I  want  to  say  thank  you  very  much  to  everybody  who
participated in this debate, and  to  thank  you  for  your  warm  words  of
welcome to me here. I've certainly enjoyed the afternoon.

I must confess that I find this House extremely disciplined.  [Applause.]  I
have been, as you know, accustomed for eight years to the rough  and  tumble
of the National Assembly and I find this  House  extremely  disciplined.  In
fact, may I go so far as to say that, in  a  way,  it's  a  little  bit  too
disciplined. [Laughter.] Mr  Tlhagale  was  not  even  able  to  finish  his
sentence and I feel I should appeal to the Chair  to  allow  the  member  at
least to finish a sentence before he sits down, provided it's not too  long.
But I would like to read your speech in  the  Hansard;  hopefully  it'll  be
printed in full. Thank you very much, again, for all the contributions.

I think a key factor in the contributions  made  here  today  has  been  the
unity of purpose about what Africa Day means and about what we  plan  to  do
in Africa. The themes that have come out as universal  amongst  all  of  us,
across party lines, have been the necessity for the restoration  of  dignity
of the African people, the unity and  collective  effort  that  we  need  to
engage in in order to achieve  our  goals,  and  that  our  people  are  our
strength. I think that promoting peace  was  another  key  theme  that  came
through in today's debate.

I'd like to say a few words about  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  It  is  an
issue that was raised by a number of members, in  particular  the  hon  M  J
Mahlangu. South Africa is bidding to host  the  Pan-African  Parliament,  as
you'll all be aware. There are a number of activities that will  take  place
in Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Parliament itself,  around
the promotion of our bid to host the Pan-African Parliament in the next  few
weeks; because in the first week of  July,  when  the  AU  General  Assembly
sits, the decision will be  taken  as  to  who  will  host  the  Pan-African
Parliament. The first session of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  has  already
taken place, but the first one of the new host seat will  take  place  later
this year - September I believe it will be.

I'd also like to raise the questions of the Peace and Security Council,  and
war, which were raised quite sharply by some members. I  think  it's  really
important that we acknowledge some of  the  efforts,  for  example,  in  the
Sudan where we need to celebrate the  three  resolutions  that  were  agreed
upon in the past week. That is an  achievement  -  mindful  as  we  are,  of
course, of the difficulties in Darfur. And we wish to  really  say  that  we
need to intensify our effort to reduce the conflict in  that  region,  along
with the African Union.

I think that that is probably the most important thing that has come out  of
this afternoon's discussions - the unity of purpose amongst the  members  of
this House aimed at intensifying our efforts to bring  peace  and  stability
to our continent.

I'd like to end by agreeing with Mrs Vilakazi and saying: Halala Africa  and
halala   South   Africa!   [Applause.]    [Congratulations,    Africa    and
congratulations, South Africa!]

USIHLALO  WOMKHANDLU  KAZWELONKE  WEZIFUNDAZWE:  Ngqongqoshe  ohloniphekile,
siyabonga ngoba ubonile ukuthi le  Ndlu  ihlonipha  kangakanani.  Siyethemba
ukuthi ngokuzayo uyophinda futhi uze kule Ndlu  njengoba  sikuphathe  kahle,
nathi  wasiphatha  kahle.  Siyabonga.  (Translation  of  isiZulu   paragraph
follows.)

[The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We thank you hon Minister  for  realising  how
respectful this House is. We hope you will come back to this House again  as
we have treated you with courtesy and you have reciprocated. We thank  you.]


Debate concluded.

 A PEOPLE'S CONTRACT TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT CHILDREN'S RIGHTS IN THE SECOND
                             DECADE OF DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for discussion)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY:  Thank  you  very  much,  Chair.  I've  been
looking round this room and I see that there are old  faces  and  also  some
new ones. Mzi, how are you? Are you okay? I  think  he  looks  happier  here
than he was in the other House. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] Okay.

Chairperson and hon members, thank you for the  opportunity  to  participate
in this debate on the International Day of the Child.  As  we  celebrate  10
years of democracy and freedom, it is apt today that  we  take  some  stock,
discuss and share opinions with the ultimate aim of  further  ensuring  that
in the 10 years to come we can contribute to the development  of  the  South
African child. This is indeed a case of developing our children to  build  a
healthy nation.

The wide variety of needs and talents of this section of our population  can
and should be brought to bear on our efforts to  advance  as  a  nation  and
deepen our democracy. Children must be protected, nurtured and  assisted  to
become not only beneficiaries of our project to build a truly nonracial  and
nonsexist society, but also active contributors.

This Government received an overwhelming mandate  to  implement  our  vision
and programme. Also,  the  President  reminded  us,  amongst  other  things,
during the state of the nation address and debate during the course of  last
week specifically to:


  ... move our  country  forward  decisively  towards  the  eradication  of
  poverty and underdevelopment in our country, taking  care  to  enhance  a
  process  of  social  cohesion  _  successfully  address   the   important
  challenges  of   persisting   racial   and   gender   inequalities,   the
  disempowerment of our youth and people with disabilities, and proper care
  for children and the elderly ...

In the context of the South African Constitution and the  UN  Convention  on
the Rights of the  Child,  which  the  first  democratically  elected  South
African Parliament ratified in 1995, we set forth and in the past  10  years
passed  legislation  and  developed  policies  to  enhance  the  protection,
welfare and development of children, focusing on the  important  mind  shift
we had to institutionalise to ensure that  children's  rights  are  seen  as
part of our broader human rights culture. I hope that  in  the  debate  that
follows, we  will  pay  very  specific  attention  to  the  whole  issue  of
children's rights being fundamentally human rights.

We have made substantial progress through  the  work  to  ensure  that  more
children have access to the child support grant. You will recall  that  from
a mere 60 000 children that were registered in 1999,  we  now  have  over  4
million children receiving the child support grant, and within two years  we
will add another 3,2  million  children  who  will  be  eligible  for  child
support grants as the upper age limit is raised to children turning 14.

I appeal to members of this House, in terms of the work the NCOP itself  has
to do with respect to what is happening in the provinces, that you  consider
making this one of your priorities. This is so  that  when  you  go  to  the
provinces all of us work  together,  and  with  the  local  authorities,  to
ensure that we register those who are eligible for the child  support  grant
and that they get this grant, because this is not a favour we are doing  for
anybody else. This  is  their  right  in  terms  of  our  own  policies  and
legislation.

We must also increase the levels of awareness  about  children's  rights  as
human rights, both among children and parents - and I know that those of  us
who are parents don't like to tell our  children  about  their  rights,  but
please tell them that they have rights. One right that  they  have  is  that
you have no right to physically violate them. I hope you are going  to  tell
them that and that they can charge you and take  you  to  court  if  you  do
physically violate them. Secondly, children have the right not to be  beaten
up in school either. I know some of our parents want the schools to beat  up
our children; they think that is how  to  instil  discipline,  but  that  is
against the law.

There is also protection of children through a more child-friendly  criminal
justice system, including bail conditions  and  tougher  sentencing  against
those  who  abuse  children,  and  the  introduction  and  establishment  of
children's courts, which are aimed at more effectively dealing  with  -  and
in a child-friendly manner - the crimes perpetuated against children.

Despite our  advances,  efforts  and  commitment,  very  serious  challenges
remain, specifically with regard to ensuring  that  our  current  protection
and social security programmes aimed at children are  placed  in  a  broader
developmental framework. Protection and social security remain an  important
focus, because a significant number  of  our  children  come  from  families
living in poverty - conditions in which social  security  provisions  remain
the only means of income. Thus,  by  default,  these  children  inhabit  the
second economy with all of its devastating consequences.

Our aim should be to break this cycle  of  poverty  with  the  intention  of
catapulting these children into the first economy, or at least to help  them
onto the first step of the ladder leading to the first economy. This can  be
done through approaching children's issues more from  a  preventative  point
of view, rather than from only a protection  and  social  security  one.  In
applying more preventative strategies in the context of  our  human  rights-
based approach, we should consolidate and enhance our activities  under  the
protection and social security measures, but  move  with  haste  to  address
issues proactively.

There is no doubt in my mind that if we are  to  advance  the  wellbeing  of
children, we must have a rigorous monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  to
track the advances in the wellbeing of our children. I think we  should  all
bear in mind that in the state of the nation address, the President, as  you
know, spent a great deal of time stating very clearly what  he  expected  us
to deliver in terms of tight timeframes. I think it is necessary for  us  to
look at all of those and see which are the ones that impact  quite  directly
upon the wellbeing of  our  children.  This  is  so  that  when  we  do  the
monitoring and evaluation - and, presumably, that would be one of the  tasks
that the NCOP itself would be  involved  in  regarding  the  monitoring  and
evaluation of what our provinces and local government are doing  -  we  bear
in mind that the question of the wellbeing of our children is  something  we
should also monitor and evaluate.

In tracking child wellbeing, we must be able to  evaluate  and  monitor  how
such wellbeing advances the developmental goals contained  in  our  national
priorities, in particular to gauge the levels of children living in  poverty
and distress, and to gauge family life and  the  linkages  between  children
and local government  structures.  In  addition  to  these  areas,  we  must
address the preventative issues that will ensure that children  are  at  the
centre of all developmental processes.

There is an urgent need to streamline delivery against our policies and  the
international instruments signed by  South  Africa,  as  well  as  corporate
social  responsibility  towards  children.  We  should  guard  against   the
proliferation of miniature structures for delivery in  terms  of  individual
conventions and international agreements. Rather, we should  strengthen  the
national machinery for advancing children's  rights  to  ensure  accelerated
delivery and the monitoring of such delivery.

Towards this end, we in the Presidency are in the process of rethinking  the
structures, processes and systems of the National Programme  of  Action  for
Children in order  to  ensure  that  there  is  synergy  in  delivery;  more
importantly, that  this  delivery  cuts  across  Government's  developmental
goals. The Office on the Rights of the Child in the Presidency is to play  a
strong co-ordinating role rather than the more campaign-orientated  role  it
has played in the past two years.

The mandate of this Government, clearly, should focus on the  responsibility
of ensuring successful efforts to reduce poverty. If we are to address  this
issue with regard to  children,  we  must  review  our  approach  to  skills
development. In  terms  of  addressing  and  thinking  of  children  as  the
employees and parents of tomorrow, we must empower  them  with  the  choices
and the possibility to be self-sustaining. This can only happen if they  are
exposed to educational systems that stimulate and develop  their  potential;
more specifically, an educational system that exposes them  to  environments
which broaden their choices as adults.

It is in this regard that I believe the  Office  on  the  Rights  of  Child,
together with the relevant government departments, must  begin  to  look  at
science  and  technology  as  a  means  of  assisting  children  to  explore
alternative opportunities for future employment.  There  is  no  reason  why
with proper nurturing we cannot find future  scientists  amongst  our  young
children.

Our vision is one of children as human beings, individuals  and  members  of
the family and community, with rights and responsibilities  that  are  based
on the  Constitution.  We  should  view  their  wellbeing  as  of  paramount
importance to the state.

As you well know, hon members, Child Protection Week culminates  today.  The
main focus has been on advocating the building of  a  people's  contract  to
strengthen families and  restore  values  of  love,  care  and  support  for
children; indeed, to ensure that your child is my child.

Legislation, increasingly, has been used as a tool to realise the rights  of
the child and build practical approaches to  protect  our  children  against
all forms of abuse. The Office on the Rights of the Child has played a  role
in ensuring that issues on the rights of the child remain on the agendas  of
the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.

Now is the time to build and  consolidate  partnerships  with  civil-society
structures working with children to mobilise more  community  resources  for
early childhood activities through the Expanded Public  Works  Programme  so
as to ensure that we convert the mandate of this Government into  meaningful
and measurable programmes for our children.

Let us work together and continue to build a people's  contract  to  promote
and protect children's rights in our second decade of democracy, a  people's
contract that will rightly  ensure  that  we  do  not  only  strengthen  our
measures to protect and look after our children, but, more so, prepare  them
to contribute to the nonracial, nonsexist,  people-centred  society  we  are
building. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D D GAMEDE: Madam Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and  the  Minister  in
the Presidency, although, as the ANC, we have achieved  a  great  deal  over
the last 10 years, we are not content to rest on  our  laurels.  Indeed,  we
were given a new mandate by  virtue  of  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the
electorate, amounting  to  almost  70%  of  the  votes  cast  in  our  third
democratic election, to take the ideals of the ANC forward.

This is not a mandate which we take lightly. In fact, it places upon all  of
our shoulders a collective burden of responsibility, which  recognises  that
the struggle for equity in all spheres of South African society  is  in  its
infancy. And in our endeavours to shoulder these responsibilities,  we  have
set ourselves a number of goals. Most  of  these  goals  have  already  been
outlined  in  our  manifesto,  in  our  conference  statements  and  in  our
statement of 8 January, but I believe that it is necessary to make  a  point
about what we in the ANC envisage regarding the protection of  our  children
through legislation.

In the immediate future, we want to ensure that the  NCOP  Select  Committee
on Social Services and the Portfolio Committee on Social Development  passes
a comprehensive Child Care Bill for which our people have been  waiting  for
too long. We believe that this piece of legislation, once it has been  fine-
tuned,  will  lay  a  solid  foundation  on  which  to   deal   effectively,
sensitively and vigorously with the socioeconomic  challenges  our  children
have to face.

The ANC would also like to see in the next decade, a sharp  decline  in  the
number of children who have been abused, neglected and exploited. For  those
children who find themselves on the wrong side of the law, we would like  to
see that they are protected from hardened criminals and that they  have  not
raped while they are awaiting trail. In fact, we wish that  this  Government
will ensure that every measure is taken on national,  provincial  and  local
government level to protect these and other vulnerable children. The ANC  is
also anxious that there should be, as soon as humanly  possible,  if  not  a
total eradication, then  at  least  a  sharp  reduction  in  the  number  of
children awaiting trial in police cells and prisons.

Already, at community meetings across the country, police members who  speak
often at schools or at Community Policing Forum meetings, relate  with  some
alarm the cries of pain that echo from the cells where children are kept  in
the same holding cells as other prisoners.  When  they  enquire  as  to  the
cause of the pain, they are met with deafening  silence.  The  young  people
are reluctant to report on the criminals  causing  the  pain,  because  they
know that they can expect instant  and  often  violent  retribution  in  the
confines of the prison walls.
Another vital piece of legislation, which the ANC would like to  see  passed
during this third Parliament, is the Child Justice Bill. We hope  that  when
this piece of legislation  is  completed  it  will  at  least  have  as  its
cornerstone procedures that will divert as many children  as  possible  away
from ordinary criminal courts to courts dealing with children's issues in  a
conducive environment  which  affords  them  maximum  safety,  security  and
protection. We also hope that those  who  will  eventually  be  employed  to
operationalise the Child Justice System will have a very firm bias  for  the
needs of the children in their care.

Children with disabilities are one of those  sectors  of  our  society  that
needs to be singled out for our constant attention,  because  a  failure  to
retain this sector as a priority will relegate them to  a  life  of  misery.
According to the Taylor report, which  was  published  in  March  2002,  the
impact of the disability  on  the  lifetime  outcomes  of  children  can  be
extraordinarily  high.  The  report  also  indicates  that   children   with
disabilities tend to have lower school attendance rates, less education  and
other barriers to independent living and engagement with  society.  We  only
have to look in our own backyards for  evidence  of  neglect  and  abuse  of
these children. More often that not, they are ridiculed  and  ostracised  by
their peers and even elders who tend to treat  the  physically  disabled  as
imbeciles.

The extent of neglect and abuse of disabled children, even in  public-funded
institutions for the disabled, often read like horror stories. The ANC  will
never again allow any such intolerable situations to exist  for  any  child,
whether they are disabled or not. Every child  deserves  an  environment  in
which they do no have to struggle  for  survival.  As  parents,  caregivers,
guardians and custodians of children's welfare, we owe it to every child  in
South Africa to build a platform for them to reach  for  the  stars  and  to
attain the highest peaks of their potential. As children  and  young  people
in the struggle, many of us were denied a childhood. We grew up fast in  the
harsh apartheid realities. We had to learn,  almost  as  soon  as  we  could
discern right from wrong, to stand up and fight for our rights,  which  were
sometimes brutally taken from us.

On this day, let us  remember  the  children  of  Iraq  and  Palestine,  the
children of Africa, the children of South Africa and  the  children  of  the
world. In the state of the nation address, hon President Thabo Mbeki said:


  We  have  committed  ourselves  to  successfully  address  the  important
  challenges  of   persisting   racial   and   gender   inequalities,   the
  disempowerment of our youth and people with disabilities, and proper care
  for children and the elderly.

With the collective struggle experience as our guide, we know what  we  have
to do to create a better life for our children at  this  the  start  of  the
second decade of our democracy. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms D ROBINSON: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, ladies and gentlemen,  in  our
children lies the future of our nation. So  I  welcome  the  opportunity  to
speak  on  the  subject  of  protecting  the  rights  of  our  children,  on
International  Children's  Day.  The  hon  Premier  of  the   Western   Cape
demonstrates  good  intentions  with  his  ``home  for  all''  promise,  but
intentions must be matched by  actions.  Government's  actions  are  lacking
when it comes to  some  of  our  most  vulnerable  citizens,  that  is,  our
orphans, children with disability, those who are being abused  and  children
without a future unless the Government steps in and  makes  some  meaningful
changes.

Targets and timeframes for this must be set. Additional  funding  is  needed
for children's homes, which are run by  NGOs  and  churches,  as  the  state
grants only 40-44% of the unit cost per  child.  The  rest  must  be  raised
privately.

The state needs partners, and the churches  and  the  NGOs  are  saving  the
state a lot of money. But these partners must be given more  help  in  doing
the sterling work of caring for children. The  staff  at  children's  homes,
the social workers, caregivers and nurses, are demoralised because they  are
unable to provide the level of service that their professional training  and
the department's minimum standards require them to  give.  Many  more  staff
members are needed to do the monitoring. More doctors are needed to  do  the
supervision, especially with psychiatric  cases,  the  category  into  which
many abused children fall.

Additional staff is needed to prevent  molestation  by  older  children  who
prey on younger ones, particularly at  night.  The  staff  shortages,  as  a
result of the labour laws, are a major obstacle.  Criminal  activities  tend
to creep in where there is insufficient supervision. Many  children's  homes
are facing closure within two years if they do not receive adequate  funding
to provide a quality service.

Hon members, mothers and fathers, tell me, where will these children  go  if
these institutions close? They will end up on the  streets.  No  matter  how
much Cape Town's mayor wishes to clear the streets of homeless  children  by
the end of the year, the problem will only get worse,  especially  with  the
growing number of Aids orphans.

The lack of antibiotics and other drugs at day hospitals and  clinics  is  a
crisis. Last week six-months-old  twins,  who  were  desperately  ill,  were
admitted to a home and were taken to a day  hospital  where  they,  and  the
caregiver,  were  forced  to  wait  for  two  days  before   they   received
medication. And what medication was given to those  babies,  suffering  from
TB? They were given a packet of Panado tablets.

Health, welfare and social services need to work together to ensure that  no
services fall through  the  cracks.  The  overlapping  responsibilities  are
causing enormous problems, and these need to be eliminated. Policy needs  to
be translated into  proper  processes.  Monitoring  and  accountability  are
vital, because the departments cannot work in isolation. Are you aware  that
there are no places of safety for handicapped children? If they need  to  be
removed from an abusive environment, there is nowhere to take them.

I echo the words of Premier Rasool: We need a home for all.  Words  must  be
translated into action for our children. How can we celebrate  a  decade  of
freedom with pomp and ceremony and feasting which cost  millions  of  rands,
but ignore the needs of our children? No doubt you  will  say  that  funding
and resources are the problem. I want to say to you  that  our  country  has
enough money. We just need to prioritise. A country  that  has  R80  million
for freedom celebrations has enough money to fund children's homes  to  give
them freedom from want, today.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his family arrived  in  South  Africa  yesterday.
Our taxpayers will keep them in luxury. His costs could provide a  safe  and
caring home for up to 200 South African children. The greatness of a  nation
is determined by the extent of its  compassion  to  the  weakest  member  of
society. Let us celebrate our 10 years of freedom and our children's  rights
by providing more funding for children's  homes  and  places  of  safety  in
order to provide  refuge  for  our  most  vulnerable  citizens  of  society,
abantwana bethu. Enkosi. ... our children. Thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  today  on
International Children's Day,  we  should  celebrate  children,  acknowledge
their rights and recommit ourselves to the  challenge  of  protecting  them.
Children are our country's greatest resource,  therefore  they  need  to  be
treasured and nurtured. Without  them  we  would  have  no  future  to  look
forward to.

We continue to make progress with regard to  protecting  our  children,  but
there has  also  been  some  failure.  Where  we  have  failed,  I  see  the
opportunity to correct the mistakes and learn from  them.  Every  child  has
the right to grow up in a safe and secure environment. During the  past  few
years there has been increased public awareness with  regard  to  children's
rights. The New NP has always been at the forefront of  this,  not  only  on
specific days like International Children's Day, but throughout the year.

Ons het `n ver pad gekom. Sedert 1994 het die Regering wonderlike  vordering
gemaak om die lot van ons kinders te verbeter. Meer as  'n  miljoen  kinders
ontvang kindertoelae. Die agb Minister  het  nou  'n  syfer  van  4  miljoen
aangehaal. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[We have come a long way. Since  1994  the  Government  has  made  wonderful
progress in improving the lot of our children. Over a million  children  are
receiving children's grants. The hon Minister has just quoted a figure of  4
million.]

Awareness about the rights of  children  has  increased  dramatically.  More
than  one  million  children  have  been  provided  with  food   since   the
introduction of the Food Emergency Scheme in 2002,  children's  courts  have
been build.

Meer as `n miljoen kinders het nou toegang  tot  gratis  onderrig.  [Over  a
million children now have access to free education.]

Last week was the beginning of Child Protection Week.  The  theme  for  this
year is, ``Child protection is everybody's business.'' Child abuse in  South
Africa has reached shocking proportions and these  figures  are  escalating.
Everyone dealing with the victims of child abuse must  be  deeply  committed
to playing their role in trying to eradicate these  crimes,  and  minimising
the trauma to which these children are subjected. Child  abuse  is  a  crime
where the principle of zero tolerance must apply.

Many issues need to be focused on as we celebrate  International  Children's
Day. One of the New NP's main objectives is to ensure  that  all  Government
policies and legislation contribute to the safekeeping of our children.  Let
us not forget the promises we make to our children  today.  Let  us  embrace
them. Therefore, I want to echo the words said by  the  Minister  of  Social
Development:  ``Umntwana  wakho  ngumntwana  wam,  umntwana  wam  ngumntwana
wakho. Your child is my child, my  child  is  your  child.''  I  thank  you.
[Applause.].

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  there  is
indeed a people's contract called the Constitution, and under it we  already
have specified duties towards the children  of  our  nation.  In  the  first
decade of democracy,  we  have  sought  to  turn  these  guarantees  of  the
Constitution into reality. Many great advances were made.

However, on of the eve of the second decade of democracy, we are faced  with
two major challenges regarding our children.  The  first  challenge  is  the
ideal of what should be, and the second is the evil of what must not be.  As
far as what should be, we must  all  acknowledge  that,  despite  the  great
strides taken since  1994,  a  number  of  goals  have  not  been  realised.
Education  is  chief  among  those  things  that  must   receive   immediate
attention. Too many of our children  receive  an  education  that  does  not
empower them to become  active  participants  in  society  when  they  reach
adulthood.

From simple literacy and numeracy to vocational skills, vast numbers of  our
children leave school unable to find  employment.  Whilst  major  effort  is
under way to create more jobs, it would all be useless if  our  children  do
not receive a better, more relevant education.

We must therefore also face the challenges of  what  must  not  be.  Here  I
refer to the continuing and seemingly increasing incidence of  physical  and
sexual abuse of children. We must root out this pervasive evil  and  prevent
our children from being scarred in this fashion.

To conclude, I think we must face these two challenges, ie  what  should  be
and what must not be. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mrs M P THEMBA: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  colleagues,  the
hon member Robinson today is able to stand  up  and  talk  about  children's
rights because of the ANC. She talks, because she  does  not  know  how  the
people of the world helped during our struggle against  apartheid.  Some  of
them had to sacrifice their own lives to see us free.

Twenty five May 2004  saw  the  launch  of  Child  Protection  Week  by  the
Department  of  Social  Development,  and  in  a  statement,  Minister  Zola
Skweyiya raised the  age-old  African  tradition,  as  the  hon  member  has
already said, ``Umntwana  wakho  ngumntwana  wam,  umntwana  wam  ngumntwana
wakho''. Your child is my child, and my child is your child. The  next  time
hon Robinson should quote such words.

Child Protection Week ends today with the celebration of the United  Nations
International Children's Day. I  want  to  believe  that  the  tradition  of
treating everyone's child as one's own is a  tradition  that  was  practised
across the continent of Africa for many generations and not  only  one  that
was confined to South Africa.

However, in recent years, we as South Africans have seen  a  steady  decline
in our African traditions, and a sharp incline in the adoption of the don't-
care attitude so prevalent in western traditions. Because of  our  increased
self-absorption as a society, an  attitude  of  caring  stands  out  like  a
beacon of hope, and the Department of Social Development has over  the  last
decade, despite  the  sometimes  overwhelming  needs  of  the  poor  in  our
society, continued to keep the flame of hope burning.

The most startling example of this continued belief  in  creating  a  better
life for all can be summarised in a paragraph from Minister Skweyiya's full-
page advertisement focusing on child protection, an extract of  which  reads
as follows:


  As individuals and families we cannot go to bed with a clear  conscience,
  knowing that the child next door goes to sleep without a meal. We  cannot
  go bed with a clear conscience, knowing that the child next door goes  to
  school with ragged clothes and no school uniform;  or  knowing  that  the
  child next door is an orphan with no one in the community to take care of
  her and her siblings. Similarly, we cannot and will not stand idle  while
  the child next door is abused and raped. As civil  society,  we  need  to
  work together and build a South Africa fit for children.

The ANC has endeavoured over the last 10 years of democracy to  ensure  that
all our ideals for a better life for all South  Africans  and  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty are carried out by all sectors and all  spheres  of
government. In our efforts to ensure that  this  better  life  of  which  we
speak becomes a reality for our children as well, we included in  our  South
African  Constitution  the  provision  that  the  socioeconomic  rights   of
children, including the rights  to  education,  health,  care  and  support,
become a reality and top priority.

To a large extent, we can safely claim that we have  achieved  a  number  of
our original goals, although we are nowhere near to our ideal. For  example,
this ANC-led Government has managed  to  increase  its  uptake  of  children
registered for the child support grant from a mere 60 000 in  1999  to  over
four million. It is indeed the NCOP's oversight role during  the  provincial
week, hon Minister, to make sure that more  children  are  registered.  Also
during the constituency period, all MPs must ensure that follow-up has  been
done to see that children have  been  registered  and  are  receiving  their
grants.

The  phenomenon  of  children-headed  households,  which  was  not  so  much
reported about pre-1994, has increased  to  a  tremendous  extent  with  the
advent of HIV and Aids. The Department of Social  Development,  once  again,
stepped in to take on  this  additional  responsibility  on  behalf  of  the
Government, and since the introduction  of  the  food  emergency  scheme  in
2002, over one million of these children have been provided with  nutritious
food. Linked with this programme  are  the  home  and  community-based  care
support services, that are now readily accessible to children.
The justice system has not lagged behind when it comes to the protection  of
children's rights. This is especially true when we look  at  the  children's
courts initiative, which was aimed at dealing more  effectively,  and  in  a
child-friendly  manner,  with  the  crimes  perpetrated  against   children.
Closely linked to the children's court initiative is  the  strengthening  of
bail conditions and tougher sentencing against those who abuse children.

We have also recognised that Government cannot deal with the issues  of  the
social and economic welfare of children  in  isolation.  It  is,  therefore,
encouraging to see that strong networks and partnerships  have  been  forged
with NGOs, CBOs and faith-based organisations. The challenge is  to  develop
mechanisms to monitor the efficient use  of  resources  from  Government  by
these structures.

The education of our  children  has  also  presented  a  challenge  to  this
Government. Despite the  free  education  opportunity  that  is  offered  to
children  in  need,  this  matter  is  often  not  adequately  taken  up  by
principals and school governing bodies. We take to heart the  promises  made
in the state of the nation address when the President indicated that by  the
end of this financial year there should be no learner  or  student  learning
under a tree, mud-school or in any other dangerous  conditions  that  expose
learners and teachers to the elements. In addition, he undertook  to  ensure
that all schools would have access to clean water and sanitation.

One  of  the  interesting  developments,  especially  with  regard  to   the
protection of the rights of children in the  media,  is  the  very  vigilant
role  that  the  Broadcasting  Complaints  Commission  and  the  Independent
Communication Authority of South Africa, Icasa,  play  with  regard  to  the
content of the broadcasts.

These two regulatory bodies ensure that there is  a  certain  percentage  of
the  broadcasting  that  takes  on  board  the  needs  of  children  through
children's educational programmes and the like. At the  same  time,  certain
programmes, scheduled especially after nine in the evening, must have  clear
warnings rating the content of the  broadcast,  for  example,  if  there  is
violence, nudity, prejudice, strong language or explicit sexual  content  in
the programmes. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N M  RAJU:  Hon  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Minister  in  the  Presidency,  hon
colleagues:


  I am not yet born; O hear me.
  I am not yet born; please protect me.
  I am not yet born; please save me.
  I am not yet born; please do not forsake me.

This plaintiff cry of an unborn child should not  and  cannot  go  unheeded.
The unpalatable truth is the fact that in recent years the child has  become
the victim of much  abuse,  sexual  harassment  and  general  ill-treatment.
Child labour has been going on unabated for years; child soldiers have  been
harnessed to fight  in  unnecessary,  internecine,  ethnic  cleansing  wars;
there is much child illiteracy around;  and  free  access  to  education  is
still remote for many.

Both the hon Minister and the hon Chief Whip referred to  these  unfortunate
situations that we face as we enter  the  second  decade  of  democracy.  We
cannot celebrate democracy  if  these  disgraceful  conditions  continue  to
exist and disfigure  the  face  of  our  hard-won  democracy.  The  people's
contract must surely be to engage in a winning war against the  poverty  and
disease that afflict our children.

Today is the era of enlightenment and unfettered access to basic  democratic
freedoms and dignity for all our citizens, including our children. But  this
wonderful democracy that  has  blessed  this  nation  has  brought  with  it
greater responsibilities in  caring  for  our  children.  Here,  I  wish  to
congratulate  my  colleague,  Mr  Gamede,   on   his   maiden   speech   for
acknowledging that the 70% mandate that the ANC got in the elections puts  a
great responsibility on their shoulders and they are  going  to  see  to  it
that the responsibilities are fulfilled.

The second decade of democracy has to contend with all  these  problems,  in
addition to the many others. The period from Sunday 30 May to Sunday 6  June
2004 is considered to be Child Protection Week. I asked why only  one  week.
Isn't child protection supposed to be everybody's  business,  every  day  of
the week, every week of the year?

The  hon  Minister  of  Social  Development,  Mr  Skweyiya,  stated  at   an
international conference on child wellbeing that we were not  living  up  to
the  standards  set  by  the  Constitution  regarding   children.   Children
constitute the most vulnerable group  in  contemporary  South  Africa.  Many
other speakers have underlined that fact. There are 18 million  children  in
South Africa under seven years old - this was some  time  last  year.  [Time
expired.]

Rev E ADOLPH: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  colleagues  of
the NCOP,  our  point  of  departure  should  be  section  28(1)(d)  of  the
Constitution in that every child  in  South  Africa  has  the  right  to  be
protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.

We are very grateful and thankful for what the  Government  has  done  since
1994 towards achieving some of these goals. These achievements were  alluded
to by our colleagues, the New NP,  in  which  we  tried  through  ubuntu  to
achieve our goal to care for our children. We  are  also  grateful  for  the
action that Government has  been  taking  in  respect  of  legislation.  The
sexual offences Bill, the Child Justice Bill,  the  Children's  Bill  -  are
exemplary in terms of our achievements.

However, I think now is the time for  us  to  implement  these  policies.  I
think we are challenged at this time, the beginning of the second  phase  of
our new democracy, in terms of a people's contract  to  combat  and  declare
war on women and child abuse. I wonder how many of you sitting here in  this
House realise, women especially, that it is estimated that one out of  three
women will be raped once before they die. That is not  tested;  we  have  to
test that. You also learn that even ...  [Interjections.]  You  didn't  hear
me. I'll repeat that: It is estimated that one out of three  women  will  be
raped at least once in their lifetime. That's why I said that that needs  to
be tested. [Interjections.]

We are all mindful that research results can be verified. Even  three-month-
old babies are raped today. There is a scourge of child abuse, sexual  abuse
and harassment. One rape is too much. I think that we have  to  combine  all
our efforts as a collective to adopt a  holistic  approach  towards  solving
this pandemic of child abuse.

One of the solutions should be that we have a common  approach,  a  holistic
approach. If we combine the effects of HIV/Aids, which is a  pandemic,  with
child abuse in South Africa, we are creating  a  beautiful,  perfect  recipe
for the destruction of our future generation. I ask myself how we  can  then
guarantee our future generation. I am  surprised  that  the  President  knew
that the Premier of the Western Cape did not include this  crisis  of  women
and child abuse in their  100-day  plan  of  action,  which  is  a  priority
according to my understanding.

Therefore, the ID believes that we need to  heal  this  pandemic.  It  is  a
silent murderer. We have to declare war, and each and every child should  be
protected and not be abused. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms H LAMOELA: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon members, 10  years  of  democracy
and South Africa's history is one of failing our children  by  not  fighting
for  their  rights.  The  situation  of  children  in   South   Africa   has
deteriorated in recent years  as  a  result  of  growing  poverty,  economic
restructuring and especially the Aids epidemic.

South African society  should  be  more  sensitive  to  children  and  their
emotional and social needs. It is  indeed  not  easy,  because  parents  are
under tremendous stress in  our  society.  There  is  an  enormous  rate  of
unemployment and poverty, as well as  other  problems.  Often  children  and
their rights are neglected. They are told to be quiet and to shut  up.  They
are not even given the priority they need. However, we all  know  that  poor
parents happen to have the same  dreams  as  any  other  parents  for  their
children. Even organisations focusing  on  children  do  not  have  a  clear
appreciation of children's rights.

The HIV/Aids epidemic has had a disastrous effect on  children's  lives  and
is indeed a growing cause of concern for children's  rights.  Three  hundred
thousand children have already lost their parents to this disease, and  that
was in 2001. The numbers are expected to increase to 2 million in  the  next
decade.

I do not want to embarrass the Government,  but  people  need  to  know  the
figures in order to make proper plans to see where the priorities  are:  50%
of children do not eat properly or regularly; 25% of  children  are  stunted
in their development by up to two years; 70% of  children  live  in  extreme
poverty.

I believe that monitoring child labour is more important  than  ever.  Owing
to the growing HIV/Aids epidemic, more and more children  have  to  work  to
support their families. There are too  many  child-headed  households  where
children are responsible  for  bringing  up  babies,  brothers  and  sisters
because they were left orphaned by Aids. This is reality. I  sincerely  hope
and pray that antiretroviral medicine will be  made  available  soon  seeing
that minors cannot apply for any grants.

The problems of harmful substances are on the  increase,  with  the  age  of
onset being younger and  the  choice  of  drugs  harder.  The  Western  Cape
continues to have the highest arrest rate for children in conflict with  the
law. Children, victims of violence, thus find themselves in very  vulnerable
positions and are  often  the  target  of  secondary  victimisation.  Recent
census information also points to an increase in the rate of disability.

The budget for social assistance grants makes up 85,3% of the  Western  Cape
provincial budget and has increased by 17% in the  2003-04  financial  year,
but are we sure that these moneys are  really  used  for  the  wellbeing  of
those who need it most, especially our children?

Our Cape Town mayor will be  spending  R5  million  on  street  children  to
ensure that they eat, and live protected from danger or crime.  I  sincerely
appreciate this wonderful and  humane  gesture,  but  can  money  buy  love,
caring, belonging, self-motivation and understanding? How much heart can  we
put into R5 million?

A people's contract, which to me  is  our  Constitution,  says  everyone  is
equal and has the right to equal protection. Does this really apply  to  our
children? The lack of resources to enable children to live  in  a  safe  and
crime-free environment should be dealt with. There  must  be  implementation
of legislation  concerning  children  and  securing  the  viability  thereof
should be considered. Government must have the will and finances  to  really
care  for  our  children  by  implementing  workable  forums  to  attend  to
children's needs and safety.

Needless to say, parents in a poverty-stricken  environment  are  themselves
helpless. They rely on the services of various professionals,  such  as  the
police, social workers, community workers, counsellors, etc. Should we  wait
until the child is being sentenced by courts, killed by  pistols  and  raped
and abused by criminals, or dying from hunger and cold before we  grant  him
or her additional support?  The  time  has  come  for  an  interdepartmental
approach at grass-roots level in order for the various role-players to  take
hands and to stop blaming one another  for  the  breakdown  in  the  support
chain for children.

The  Deputy  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  said:  ``The  people  are   our
strength.'' I want to say that our children are our future.  May  God  bless
and keep South Africa's children. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Hon Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of  Provinces,
Minister in the Presidency, hon Dr Pahad and fellow  comrades  and  friends,
like we said in the last year when  we  were  debating  the  critical  issue
about the status of the children of this country, it is  important  that  we
must repeat this as the African National Congress. The point is  that  there
is a history to the conditions under which our children  are  living  today,
and that history was not post 27 April 1994.

And, in South Africa, we have noted in that debate last week that  there  is
a  consensus   emerging   whereby   there   is   beginning   to   emerge   a
depoliticisation across ideological and political  spectrums,  in  terms  of
the social approach to issues that are facing women and  children.  However,
in the interests of democracy, we must allow different opinions  and  views.
But in doing that it is proper as well to locate them in a proper context.

Hon Lamoela was audacious and  confident,  when  she  spoke  about  a  South
Africa that is failing children, and maybe it is important  to  locate  this
South Africa that she is speaking on behalf of. I am  quite  confident  that
90% of the members across the political spectrum in this House  have  spoken
quite genuinely about the real issues and the challenges  that  our  country
is facing in so  far  as  the  conditions  of  the  lives  of  children  are
concerned and not from a  narrow  party-political  point  of  view  that  is
basically antichange and pessimistic in content. And  that  is  exactly  the
line  of  thought  and  the  message  that  the  Democratic   Alliance   has
articulated today to our people. And we must remind  hon  Lamoela  that  the
point of ...

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order. Is it in order  for  a  member  to  attack
another member who was delivering a political maiden speech.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Watson,  that  is  not  a  point  of
order. Any member has the right to react to any speech made  by  any  member
in the House. Continue.

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson and hon members,  the  approach  of  the  ANC  is
informed by 92 years of fighting history. The role  of  the  ANC  is  not  a
boardroom-manufactured role.  Its  vision  is  shaped  and  defined  by  the
experiences of the masses of our people in this country.  And  we  not  only
began  to  realise  this  in  1994  or  today  when  we  became  members  of
Parliament, because we have been  part  and  parcel  of  the  lives  of  our
people. On the basis of that we are calling  on  all  political  parties  to
join today as we celebrate this international day of children, to  genuinely
and frankly appreciate what Government has achieved  to  date  and  also  to
identify the  challenges  and  propose  the  kinds  of  steps  that  we  can
collectively take to address the plight of children in this country.

Chairperson, I must just illustrate some issues to you, to show what I  said
in the past. Maybe I must start by quoting one of the  greatest  leaders  of
Africa that our country  has  ever  produced,  the  late  president  of  the
African National Congress, Comrade Oliver Tambo who once  said:  ``A  nation
that does not value its youth deserves no future.'' That is why the  DA  has
been in Parliament for many years - it was the PFP, it  was  the  Democratic
Party and it is the DA today. It does not have young  people,  because  they
do not value young people, and they do not value children. It  is  only  the
ANC that values young  people  and  children;  and  arising  from  this  hon
Chairperson, we observe the international day of children ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Continue hon member.

Mr T S SETONA: ... and is proud  of  our  first  decade  of  democracy,  and
confident that with each passing day the future of children in  our  country
becomes brighter and brighter. It is therefore  fitting  that  we  begin  by
rising in an unfettered tribute to the people's  movement  for  change,  the
ANC, for  its  92  years  of  uninterrupted  fighting  history  in  uniting,
mobilising and leading all sectors of our society for the  creation  of  the
united, nonracial, democratic and nonsexist society that we seek  to  create
today. It is this society, born on 27 April 1994 after the  first  nonracial
democratic elections, that has provided us with the collective platform  for
dialogue to create a better life for all.

The hon member is living in the past because they used to make  a  noise  in
Parliament  representing  no  one  but  their  jackets.  But  here  we   are
representing the overwhelming masses of the people in this  country  and  we
are  not  apologetic.  We  will  heed  their  voices  and   their   mandate.
Chairperson, 49 years ago on 25 June, the  greatest  ever  assembly  of  the
people converged at  Kliptown  to  shape  the  vision  for  a  postapartheid
society  resulting  in  the  adoption  of  the  Freedom  Charter  under  the
leadership of the African National Congress.

Ms Lamoela must listen - it was the  African  National  Congress,  way  back
before 1994. In that people's congress, our people proclaimed amongst  other
things, and I quote: ``The doors of learning and culture shall be  opened.''
Under this proclamation they further called, and I quote:


  The aim of education shall be to teach the youth to love their people and
  their culture, to honour human brotherhood, liberty and peace.  Education
  shall be free, compulsory, universal and equal for all  children.  Higher
  education and technical training shall be opened  to  all,  by  means  of
  state allowances and scholarships awarded on the basis of merit.

Certainly Chairperson, no amount  of  bloody  force  unleashed  against  our
people over decades could corrode these noble visions in  the  mind  of  our
people. Our people were inspired to fight, and some died in pursuit of  this
noble vision.
Chairperson, 1992 also witnessed another watershed on the policy front  when
the African National Congress adopted the ready-to-govern  document.  It  is
in this document that the ANC reaffirmed and further elaborated  the  ideals
and  principles  of  the  Freedom  Charter.  Today,  ten  years  after   our
democracy, we are proud to proclaim - and I want to emphasise  this  -  that
there has been no other time in the history of our country where the  rights
of our children have received greater affirmation than under the  leadership
of the ANC.

Ours is not a welfarist  approach  to  child  development  -  that  is  only
limited  to  the  provision  of  welfare  grants  -  but   a   qualitatively
developmental  approach  that  takes  into  account  the  totality  of   the
development needs of a child. It is in this regard that the  rights  of  the
child occupies the centre stage  of  the  provisions  of  our  Constitution,
which is a supreme law of the land thus obliging,  in  no  uncertain  terms,
all organs of state to fulfil, protect and promote the rights  of  children.
That Constitution is informed by the Freedom Charter - the  Freedom  Charter
written by the leadership of Oliver Tambo and Duma Nokwe, not by Tony Leon.

And we are happy that our people today across the  party-political  spectrum
are beginning to accept that vision. And it is not only the  vision  of  the
ANC, but it is beginning to be embraced by all the people of  this  country.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER IN  THE  PRESIDENCY:  Chairperson,  I  suppose  I  should  feel
privileged because both of you have now entered the House. You are  welcome.
First of all, let me  thank  all  the  speakers  who  participated  in  this
debate. There were many very interesting things  that  were  said  -  and  a
special welcome to those who have made their  maiden  speeches.  Maybe  they
will move you to the front seats if you make  more  speeches  like  that!  I
would like to thank Mr Gamede for saying something that I should  have  said
and I did  not,  namely  that  children  with  disabilities  must  remain  a
priority for us. I think that is quite clearly very important.

Mr Raju, I am glad you are back. I am also very glad to  note  that  in  the
intervening period you have actually become a poet.  I  am  very  glad  that
that has happened. Mr Raju put an important point when he asked why we  just
put one week aside. It is going to happen again and  again.  This  month  is
the month of the youth; 16 June is coming and 9 August  is  coming  when  we
will celebrate National Woman's Day.

Later in the year we will have 16 Days of  No  Violence  Against  Women  and
Children. It is not because we say that it is only during this  period  that
we must do certain things, but it is to utilise these  weeks  or  particular
days as part of  a  process  of  raising  the  level  of  consciousness  and
understanding of our people around these issues. So one agrees this  has  to
be done every day of the week, but we should also  utilise  this  particular
period so that we can focus the attention of our country and our  people  on
these particular issues.

If I may, with your permission, Chairperson, deal a little bit with what  Ms
Robinson said. I presume she  is  from  Cape  Town,  or  the  Western  Cape,
because the whole speech  is  about  what  Mr  Rasool  said.  We  have  nine
provinces so you might  next  time  consider  what  is  happening  in  other
provinces too. I thought the speech started well and I think all of  us  can
agree that we need to seek to find more ways and the means to  empower  NGOs
and other service providers so that they can do even better  than  they  are
doing already. What I did not understand  was  why  there  should  be  staff
shortages because of our labour laws. That I do not understand.

I want to come to something Ms Themba did touch on. It is a serious  mistake
to think that you can equate what  we  must  do  with  respect  to  our  own
international obligations and say that we should then not  carry  out  these
international obligations and responsibilities because  the  money  that  we
would spend on that, can be better  used  for  something  else.  It  is  too
narrow and parochial an outlook, and it would be helpful if the DA begins  a
much wider assessment of what is happening in South Africa, the  region  and
the world. You will better understand why we have to do certain things,  and
what we have to do as part  of  our  own  responsibilities  to  developments
outside our own bodies.

The question of relating it to  Aristide  is  a  new  one  for  your  party,
because up to now your complaint was that we should not let  him  come  here
because he is not a democrat. Now you are saying: ``Do not let him  come  in
because we could spend the money supporting the NGOs.''  The  point  of  the
matter is that we are offering Mr. Aristide  a  temporary  home  until  such
time that he is able to return to Haiti under conditions which  will  enable
him to live and work there.
Secondly, in our own discussions as to whether or not to offer  Mr  Aristide
a temporary home, we did not suck this from our thumb.  We  were  responding
to specific requests from multilateral  institutions.  You  must  understand
that the request came from the Caricom countries -  which,  if  you  do  not
know, are the countries of the Caribbean. They then  requested  the  African
Union, which in turn requested South Africa.

We also discussed this matter with both the United  States  of  America  and
France with respect to this request, so let us not keep on embarrassing  Mr.
Aristide. He is here, he is our guest, let us treat him as a guest  and  let
us allow him to at least live, as much as he possibly can,  a  normal  life.
For those of us who lived in exile for a long time I can tell you  that  the
pain of exile is very, very difficult to deal  with.  I  am  quite  sure  Mr
Aristide would prefer to be in Haiti rather than to eat up  money  that  you
think should go somewhere else. Then to say that he would be kept in  luxury
- well, I do not know if you think we must send him to a shack in Langa?  We
will discuss that matter with you. [Laughter.]

Then, Ms Lamoela, if I may just return  to  some  of  the  issues  that  you
raised, I fully agree that all of us, at all times, need to  be  permanently
sensitive to the needs of  our  children.  But  to  say  or  to  claim  that
children's  rights  are  neglected  demonstrates  a  very  serious  lack  of
understanding of what has happened over the last ten years. I  do  not  know
where you have been living, but if you have been living in South Africa  ...
[Interjections.] No, let me finish  -  you  would  know  that  never,  never
before in the history of this country have the rights of children  been  put
into a constitution. We have taken on an  obligation  in  our  Constitution.
You cannot stand here and say that we have neglected those rights  over  the
last ten years.

You and everybody else who live here know that the bulk  of  support  grants
went to Whites and then Coloureds and Indians.  Africans  were  not  getting
child support grants. We changed that and then we  had  to  say  to  Whites,
Coloureds and Indians: ``You are going to get less, because more people  are
going to get grants.'' How can you stand here and say that nothing has  been
done?

If you think that the entire issue of child abuse is a post-1994  phenomena,
then I think you need to re-examine your own political outlook. So  we  have
to deal with these issues of child abuse, child rape and child neglect  very
seriously because it is in all our  interests  that  the  children  we  want
should grow up in an environment in which they will  become  good  citizens.
But it does not help, it does not help to try  and  party-politicise  it  so
that in the end you do not know what  you  are  talking  about.  I  want  to
repeat here that we face many challenges. There are many issues we  have  to
deal with and  there  are  many,  many  of  our  children  who  do  live  in
conditions of poverty that we have to deal with. And  we  should  deal  with
this thing I think as ... Chief, you must be careful, you are going  to  get
a backache if you bend over too much when you are speaking. [Laughter.]

Let us take this thing out of our party-political stand. It is  a  political
issue; but if we party-politicise a thing then we are not going to  do  what
we have to do to defend our children, and that is going to be my  appeal  to
you.

With respect to antiretrovirals, I presume at some  point  the  Minister  of
Health will come. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: She is coming.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: She is coming. Well, I think you might  then
debate the matter here. Do not speak as if we do not have a policy on  it  -
we do. Do not speak as if we have not made decisions with  regard  to  that.
Do not make an assumption that anteritrovirals on their  own  are  going  to
deal with the issue of HIV/Aids -it is not. It is not a  cure.  I  hope  you
know that. There is at the moment no cure. But when the Minister  of  Health
comes, she might not be as nice as I am by the way ... [Laughter.]  ...  but
then engage with her on this whole issue of anteritrovirals.

Of course, I do not know where you get your  statistics  from,  but  70%  of
children do not live in extreme poverty in South Africa.  Wherever  you  got
it from, it is wrong. And if your DA party did the  research  for  you,  ask
them to go and do better research for  you.  If  we  get  involved  in  this
statistical battle it is a waste of time because we  all  agree  that  there
are too many of our  children  who  live  in  poverty  and  we  need  to  do
something to get them out of that of poverty trap. But in order to do  this,
we need to look and see  where,  in  which  particular  areas,  the  biggest
problems are. And so you might find, Ms  Robinson,  that  with  the  limited
resources at our disposal we might not have money for the NGOs that work  in
Cape Town, because we might have to go and support CVOs that work  in  rural
areas and do not have anything at all. But this is a matter that we have  to
discuss and come to a common understanding of what we need to do.

In conclusion, Chairperson, a number of issues were raised and I agree  with
all of them across  the  party-political  spectrum.  Around  the  issues  of
children in custody, children awaiting trial  and  why  children  are  still
imprisoned in the same places as other hardened criminals  -  now  it  would
seem to me a perfectly legitimate issue. But do not tell  them  I  told  you
so. Invite the Minister of Correctional  Services  and  say  that  the  NCOP
would like to discuss a very  serious  matter  with  him  -  again,  cutting
across the party-political theme - and discuss this  issue  of  children  in
custody  so  that  you  can  actually  engage  with  the  Minister  directly
concerned with this area. I know he is as concerned  as  anybody  else.  And
then it would seem to me that  when  you  do  your  provincial  visits,  you
should then be able to visit prisons in all nine provinces and let us get  a
better idea as the NCOP of that problem we are talking about. We  should  do
so, not because we want to then invite the media so that  it  can  come  and
take nice pictures of us walking through  these  prisons,  but  because  you
fundamentally want to deal with the question that our  children  should  not
be incarcerated with adults in prisons. Well, we now call them  correctional
facilities and we always use nice English words. That would be my appeal.

I think it is a perfectly legitimate exercise to engage  with  the  relevant
Minister and say what do we do, acting together, working  together  to  deal
with this serious problem and question that we face, so that we do not  come
back next year and have the same debate again about what we should do  about
children in custody. I think that would be my  second  suggestion  that  you
might want to consider. My last suggestion would be to Mrs Qikani  from  the
UDM. She asked about what should be and what should not be. Can  I  ask  you
to read a book by Lenin called What is to be  done?  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, hon Minister and thank  you  to  all  the
members. I also want to add my voice to say thank you  to  all  of  you  who
made your maiden speeches today. I think it was  well  done  for  the  first
time you took up the platform and debated in this chamber.  Thank  you  very
much, all of you.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 16:42.
