                MEMBERS' STATEMENTS ANC VS DA CAMPAIGN SPEECH

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr  S  ABRAM  (ANC):  Madam   Speaker,   a   parliamentary   conference   on
multilingualism was held on Monday this week. Political parties such as  the
DA, the FF Plus and the NA, which purport to speak up for  language  rights,
were conspicuous by their absence, thus betraying their diminishing  numbers
of supporters. South Africa needs  a  people's  contract,  and  the  ANC-led
Government has proved that it can  do  best  for  all  South  Africans.  The
choice on April 14 is between the ANC, which has delivered and can  deliver,
and the opposition parties, which are of nuisance value and irrelevant.

The ANC-led Government  has  made  tremendous  strides  towards  building  a
single nation united in diversity, whilst other parties, and especially  the
DA, are contributing to the polarisation  of  the  people  in  our  country.
[Applause.] Down with the DA! [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Down!

The SPEAKER: Order! Order! Order!

                   LEVEL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SKILLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Madam Speaker, thank you very much. Contrary to  the  last
speaker's statement, may I say that yesterday's HSRC  report,  which  showed
that only 37% of South Africa's  400 000  school-leavers  find  jobs,  is  a
shocking indictment of the ANC-led Government's job creation  and  education
policies. The appalling level of science  skills  among  matriculants,  with
fewer than 30% passing mathematics, means that only  9%  of  South  Africans
are qualified in science and technology, far lower than any  other  emerging
market and far below our main competitors for foreign  investment,  such  as
Brazil and China.

The Government's education policy has been epitomised  by  inefficiency  and
underspending. The dummying down of the  matriculation  curriculum  and  the
failure to instil entrepreneurial skills in learners has only added  to  the
8 million unemployment queues. To address the unemployment  crisis,  the  DA
calls for a new focus  on  job  creation  and  education  within  the  three
spheres defined by the HSRC, and  for  a  strategic  effort  to  drastically
increase the  number  of  learners  studying  and  passing  mathematics  and
science at school. South Africa deserves better. Thank you. [Applause.]

            PATIENTS REFUSED TREATMENT IN WESTERN CAPE HOSPITALS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L K JOUBERT (IFP): Madam Speaker, hospitals are meant to be places  which
people can rely on and turn to in times of medical emergency.  When  you  go
to a hospital you at least expect to be assisted. The last thing you  expect
is to be refused admission.

Recently, in two separate incidents at different hospitals  in  the  Western
Cape, people who were refused medical attention on religious  grounds  died.
The loss of life is always sad, but it is a totally  unacceptable  situation
when people working in a hospital who are  supposed  to  help  patients  and
save lives simply do nothing. We cannot allow a situation to  develop  where
people are refused medical attention and  are  left  to  die.  We  urge  the
Minister and the department to investigate such allegations thoroughly  when
they occur, and take action against the culprits.
             CO-OPERATION BETWEEN SA AND SWITZERLAND IN BURUNDI

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC  is  heartened  by
the news of the planned extensive  co-operation  between  South  Africa  and
Switzerland, aimed at the social integration of women and child soldiers  in
Burundi. During the civil war that plagued Burundi for more than  a  decade,
women and child soldiers, most  of  whom  were  kidnapped,  formed  a  large
number of rebel troops. This  initiative  seeks  to  include  the  issue  of
skills  development  to  ensure  that  those  rehabilitated   are   properly
integrated into society.

It is in the light of this that the envisaged  co-operation  will  not  only
help to heal the deep-seated scars  of  wars,  but  will  also  promote  the
objective of a better life for all.  The  ANC  commends  the  government  of
Switzerland and  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  on  this  humane  and
responsible endeavour.

Sithi ibuyile iAfrika [We say Africa is back]. [Applause.]

                        THEUNS BOTHA'S RACIST REMARKS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Madam Speaker, actions speak  louder  than  words.
That was something the DA was hoping to achieve by launching their  election
manifesto in Soweto, in an attempt to gain black  support  and  to  convince
the voters that the DA is nonracial. Once again, the DA's true white  colour
shone through in the form of Mr Theuns Botha's racist  remarks  with  regard
to the premiership of the Western Cape.

Mr Botha has used the DA's swartgevaar tactics  by  warning  people  against
another party that might put up a black candidate for Premier. Not  only  is
Mr Botha fuelling racial  conflict,  but  he  is  also  conveying  the  DA's
message that only certain race groups are acceptable  as  potential  Premier
candidates. If the DA  places  such  great  emphasis  on  skin  colour  when
deciding on potential Premier candidates, can we assume  that  they  are  of
the opinion that skin colour is also important in terms of  the  Presidency?
If so, does the DA have a problem with our black President?

Mr Botha's remarks are concrete proof that the DA is  becoming  more  right-
wing, and that the liberal elements  of  nonracialism  within  the  DA  will
disappear. The New NP strongly condemns and rejects Mr Botha's  remarks  and
the DA's swartgevaar campaign, and we call on the voters to do the  same.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

                        UNEMPLOYMENT AND JOB CREATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): Madam Speaker, the UDM notes with dismay  the  latest
report by the HSRC that at least 51% of school-leavers every year  join  the
ranks of the unemployed. This translates into millions of  unemployed  young
people over the past 10 years.
One third of all unemployed people are younger than 24 years  of  age.  This
is a disaster of monumental proportions.  Vast  numbers  of  the  generation
that needs to build and grow this country further in future are  locked  out
of the economy. This is a socioeconomic timebomb that we ignore at  our  own
peril.

These millions will struggle to care for themselves and their children,  and
thus the cycle of poverty is entrenched generation after generation.  It  is
crucial that Government places much greater emphasis  on  job  creation  and
skills development.

This is also a serious indictment of  Government's  economic  policies  that
have destroyed a million jobs in the past year,  and  that  have  failed  to
grow the economy enough to absorb new entrants into the  labour  market.  It
is time to acknowledge that Government must do much more when  it  comes  to
job  creation,  because  unemployment  undermines  the   people's   freedom.
[Interjections.]

            HIV AND AIDS CARE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT PROGRAMME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M M MALUMISE (ANC): Madam Speaker, on Tuesday  the  Portfolio  Committee
on Health received a detailed  briefing  by  the  Department  of  Health  on
comprehensive HIV and Aids care management and  a  treatment  programme  for
South Africa. We would like to express our gratitude to  the  Department  of
Health for their technical and administrative  support  in  the  process  of
developing and implementing this excellent plan.

This programme is a  massive  undertaking  that  will  overhaul  our  health
system completely. It includes the development of provincial  implementation
plans and resource and training centres to  ensure  high  quality  treatment
and care for people infected  with  HIV  and  Aids.  It  also  involves  the
procurement and production of medicines at the lowest  prices  and  includes
measures to increase capacity and security for the distribution of drugs.
Provision is made for the establishment of a robust system  to  monitor  the
efficacy of drugs, resistance patterns, improvements and  co-ordination  and
patient information systems. Human resource needs are also addressed in  the
plan to ensure that services are  delivered  where  they  are  most  needed.
Budgeting requirements are set out for the  next  five  years,  as  well  as
communications strategies for health providers  and  the  public,  including
what to expect from the proposed treatment programme.

We urge all South Africans to support  the  Department  of  Health  and  our
Government as they implement this programme. This programme is  yet  another
example of the ANC-led Government's commitment to  improve  the  quality  of
life of our people. The ANC has established a  people's  contract  with  all
South Africans, nothing less than a better life for all. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Are you rising on a point of order?

An HON MEMBER: Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]
The SPEAKER:  Order!  I  will  call  on  the  DA  when  it  is  their  turn.
[Interjections.] Order!

                POLICY REGARDING STAFF AT PREPRIMARY SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Madam Speaker, I am not  going  to  touch  on  the  "Swart
gevaar", but on the "Asmal gevaar". [Laughter.]

Die  NA  wil  langs  hierdie   weg   die   situasie   met   betrekking   tot
personeelvoorsiening aan preprimêre skole onder die aandag van die  Minister
van Onderwys bring. Die voortbestaan van  talle  preprimêre  skole,  wat  'n
reuse bydrae lewer in die opvoeding van kleuters, word tans op  groot  skaal
bedreig  deur   die   beleid   van   provinsiale   onderwysdepartemente   om
personeelvoorsiening by sulke skole te staak.

Etlike sodanige gevalle, veral  in  Gauteng  en  Mpumalanga,  is  onder  die
aandag van die NA gebring. In een geval in Mpumalanga word  10  uit  die  12
personeellede deur die ouers besoldig en twee deur  die  departement.  Hulle
het nou 'n nul staat van die departement ontvang, wat hierdie twee poste  in
gedrang bring.

Die wyse waarop dit geskied is onbillik en onprofessioneel,  aangesien  kort
kennisgewings   en   selfs   summiere   staking    van    salarisvoorsiening
vooruitbeplanning onmoontlik maak. Hierdie beleid is  kortsigtig,  aangesien
dit tot gevolg het dat die bestaande  fasiliteite  onderbenut  gelaat  word.
Dit  is  ook  diskriminerend  teenoor  veral  vroue  wat  op  dié  wyse  die
geleentheid ontneem word om sonder kommer oor hul  kinders  die  arbeidsmark
te betree.

Die NA verneem graag van die Minister  wat  die  amptelike  beleid  van  die
Regering is met betrekking tot preprimêre skole,  waarom  bestaande  dienste
afgeskaal word en wat die ratio agter die  Regering  se  kortsigtige  beleid
is. Die NA  sal  die  aangeleentheid  verder  persoonlik  met  die  Minister
opneem. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In this way the NA  wants  to  bring  the  situation  with  regard  to  the
provision of staff to preprimary schools to the attention  of  the  Minister
of Education. The continued existence  of  many  preprimary  schools,  which
make a massive contribution in educating pre-schoolers, is at present  being
seriously threatened by the policy of provincial  education  departments  to
discontinue providing staff at such schools.

Several such cases, especially in Gauteng and Mpumalanga, have been  brought
to the attention of the NA. In one case in Mpumalanga 10  of  the  12  staff
members are being remunerated by the parents  and  two  by  the  department.
They have now been informed by the department that henceforth no staff  will
be provided for, which means that  the  continued  existence  of  these  two
posts is threatened.

The way in which this is being done is unfair and unprofessional,  as  short
notice  and  even  the  immediate  discontinuation  of  salaries   make   it
impossible to plan in advance. This policy is short-sighted, as  it  results
in  the  existing  facilities  being  left   underutilised.   It   is   also
discriminatory especially against women who  in  this  way  are  denied  the
opportunity  to  enter  the  labour  market  without  worrying  about  their
children.

The NA would like the Minister to tell us what the official  policy  of  the
Government is with regard to preprimary schools, why existing  services  are
being scaled down and what the rationale is behind the  Government's  short-
sighted policy is. The NA will discuss the matter further with the  Minister
in person. I thank you.]

[Mr L M KGWELE (ANC): On Monday 23 February 2004 the  Minister  of  Housing,
the hon Bridget Mabandla, the MEC  for  Local  Government,  Development  and
Housing, the hon Darkey Africa, and councillors of  the  Madibeng  Municipal
Council allocated 3 321 houses to  the  residents  of  Letlhabile,  Oukasie,
Damonsville and Mothutlung. These houses are part of  the  8  593  susidised
houses worth R80 million which were given to Madibeng residents by the  ANC-
led Government, to help our people who have suffered at  the  hands  of  the
apartheid regime.

It is only the ANC that can restore the dignity and respect that our  people
deserve. We are grateful for the  achievements  of  the  Madibeng  Municipal
Council and the residents, including  75-year-old  Mrs  Anna  Motshabi,  who
received the keys to her own house for the first time in her life.

If you vote for the ANC in the coming elections, which will be  held  on  14
April, you  will  be  empowering  us  to  work  hard  for  you  in  fighting
unemployment and poverty, as  well  as  to  continue  with  our  development
programme and reach out to all the people in all areas.  Our  experience  in
Government gives us hope  that  together  we  will  conquer  the  challenges
facing us. [Applause.]]

                              VICTIMS OF CRIME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr I J PRETORIUS (DA): Ja, ek was so  'n  bietjie  entoesiasties,  Speaker.
Die waarheid is, mense is siek  en  sat  daarvoor  om  besteel,  verkrag  en
vermoor te word. Vanoggend het mnr Tony Leon en  die  DA  geluister  na  die
hartseerverhale van mevroue Jacobs en  Lanie  van  Mitchell's  Plein.  Hulle
geliefdes is vermoor en verkrag.

Maar wat doen die Regering wanneer  ons  oor  hulle  probleme  praat?  Hulle
snoer die monde van polisiewoordvoerders  en  beskuldig  die  opposisie  van
swart gevaar-politiek. Skande op skande. Pleks daarvan  dat  miljoene  rande
oorsee spandeer word op militêre sendings, sal die DA sorg dat daardie  geld
hier by die huis aangewend word. Ons sal sorg dra dat daar genoeg  opgeleide
en toegeruste poliesiebeamptes op straat is om die misdadigers vas  te  trek
en ons sal die regstelsel opknap sodat die slagoffers  van  misdaad  nie  in
die steek gelaat word nie, want mevrou Lanie verdien  beter,  mevrou  Jacobs
verdien beter, Mitchell's Plein verdien beter.  Suid-Afrika  verdien  beter!
Stem DA. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS (DA): Yes, I was a little bit enthusiastic,  Speaker.  The
truth is that  people  are  sick  and  tired  of  being  robbed,  raped  and
murdered. This morning Mr Tony Leon and the DA listened to the  sad  stories
of Mrs Jacobs and Mrs Lanie of  Mitchell's  Plein.  Their  loved  ones  were
raped and murdered.

But what does the Government do when we  talk  about  their  problems?  They
silence the police spokesmen and accuse the opposition of  ``swart  gevaar''
politics. Shame upon  shame.  Instead  of  millions  of  rands  being  spent
overseas on military missions the DA will see  to  it  that  that  money  is
utilised here at home. We shall see to it that there are enough trained  and
equipped police officers on the streets to apprehend the  criminals  and  we
shall upgrade the judicial system so that the victims of crime are not  left
in the lurch,  because  Mrs  Lanie  deserves  better,  Mrs  Jacobs  deserves
better, Mitchell's Plein deserves  better.  South  Africa  deserves  better!
Vote DA. [Applause.]]

                 CONDITIONS IN MOHALE CITY ON THE WEST RAND

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N D NGCENGWANE (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker. To  many  South  Africans
... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members. Please proceed.

Ms N D NGCENGWANE (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker. To many  South  Africans,
10 years of democracy means improved quality of life, and a better life  for
all, which impacts on health, education and environmental issues  and  above
all  infrastructure  development,  which  includes  water  and   sanitation,
housing etc. But unfortunately, for some people in the rural and farm  areas
of Mohale City on the West Rand, life has not changed even  after  10  years
of democracy.

The main challenge facing Mohale City is the  establishment  of  sustainable
rural settlements for rural communities of this area. Many  people  live  on
privately owned land where they are  working  as  farm  labourers.  In  some
cases, the landowner denies the occupiers basic services, for  instance  the
water supply is disconnected. Some farm owners increase  rentals  so  as  to
make it impossible for the occupiers to pay  and,  as  a  result,  they  are
evicted and become landless. In some  cases  the  homeless  are  allowed  to
occupy old, filthy pigsties and stables and are charged exorbitant rentals.

The  local  council  of  Mohale  City  is  fully  prepared  to  address  the
imbalances of the  past  by  specifically  targeting  the  rural  areas  for
development by building agri-villages, but there  is  a  lot  of  resistance
from the farm owners. Farmworkers are also human  beings  and  they  do  not
deserve to be treated like that.  Forward  with  the  people's  contract  to
create work and fight poverty. Forward! [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                     MR LEON AND THE DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  In  South  Africa,  we  are
faced with challenges such as crime,  HIV/Aids,  poverty,  unemployment  and
racism, matters that require our urgent attention, and issues that can  only
be dealt with effectively  through  a  combined  effort  from  all  relevant
parties. [Interjections.]

When a country is faced with such challenges, one would  expect  the  Leader
of the Official Opposition to set  aside  political  differences,  to  unite
opposition parties and to approach Government and offer assistance in  order
to overcome these challenges, because these challenges  do  not  distinguish
between supporters of the New NP, ANC, IFP, DA and other political  parties.
They affect all South Africans.

But what does the Leader of the Official Opposition do?  He  creates  chaos.
We have all come to know the DA's motto: What is bad for  South  Africa,  is
good for the DA. We have two choices. We  can  choose  to  say:  It  is  the
Government's problem, they must fix it. Or we can choose to be part  of  the
solution and say: We will fix it. The New NP has made  its  choice,  because
we believe in the future of  South  Africa  and  under  the  leadership  and
guidance of our leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, we will  continue  to  play
an active role in facing South Africa's challenges  and  be  part  of  South
Africa's future.

The Leader of the  Official  Opposition  does  not  deserve  a  third  term.
Therefore we call on the voters and the DA: Give  the  hon  Leon  the  boot.
South Africa deserves better. We  need  real  leaders  who  can  pull  their
weight. I thank you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members. We still have  a  few  hours  before
your campaigns start  in  the  streets.  Hon  members,  we  have  three  ...
[Interjections.] Order, hon members. We have  three  slots  which  have  not
been filled. So I will now give them to the ANC, the DA and the ANC, in  the
order in which they have arisen.

                  ADJOURNMENT OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TOMORROW

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L J MODISENYANE (ANC): Madam Speaker, tomorrow, 27  February  2004,  this
House, the National Assembly, will rise to  conclude  the  business  of  the
second term of a free and democratic South Africa. In so  doing,  the  House
will also be concluding the work of our first decade of liberation.

We, the ANC, wish all parties success in their election campaigns. We bid  a
most respectful farewell to those of us who will not  be  returning  and  we
wish them and their families all the best. We know we  speak  on  behalf  of
everyone in this House when we convey our thanks, and love, to the  Speaker,
the Deputy Speaker, the  chairperson  and  the  deputy  chairperson  of  the
House. We thank the Presidency, Ministers and Deputy Ministers and  we  say:
Let us all combine our efforts to create work and push  back  the  frontiers
of poverty. The ANC salutes you all. [Applause.]

             NEW NP NO LONGER RELEVANT IN SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam Speaker, the House  listened  with  interest  to
the hon Mr Durand making his farewell speech  in  the  House.[Laughter.]  He
referred to the fact that if  we  are  going  to  have  solutions  in  South
Africa, what is needed is for all relevant parties to pull together.

I want to say that that excludes the New  NP  because  they  are  no  longer
relevant in South Africa. You do not have to believe me, all you had  to  do
was watch e-tv which conducted a poll after the hon Durand's leader, Mr  Van
Schalkwyk, appeared on television and all the viewers had to vote. You  will
not be surprised to hear that  he  got  a  30%  favourable  rating  and  70%
negative rating. [Applause.] After watching Mr  Van  Schalkwyk  talking  for
half an hour, 70% of the viewers rejected him.

In contrast, when the DA had the opportunity  of  addressing  South  Africa,
the viewers voted 87% in favour  of  the  DA.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]
What is really important in South Africa  is  that  we  come  up  with  real
alternatives. People want solutions to the problems  of  joblessness,  crime
and Aids.

That party that has just talked, has no solutions and the ANC also does  not
because the President told us that no new policies or  new  initiatives  are
necessary. What he is saying is: steady on, we will just carry  on  the  way
we have done for the last 10 years. If he does  that  we  will  fail.  South
Africa deserves better. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                          VIOLENCE IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr B A D MARTINS (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC  is  deeply  angered  by  the
continued murder of our members  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  Last  Saturday,  Sifiso
Msomi passed away after having been attacked and shot at by  five  men,  two
of whom were identified as IFP activists.

Over the last few months,  our  people  in  KwaZulu-Natal  have  experienced
several political attacks similarly resulting in loss  of  life  and  dozens
being injured. We reject this violent and barbaric political approach as  an
unacceptable relic of the colonial  apartheid  legacy,  reflecting  careless
contempt for human rights and utter disregard for the inestimable  value  of
human life.

The ANC calls on all political parties to respect their own  commitments  to
peaceful elections and freedom. We further call on the SAPS to  act  swiftly
to bring to book those criminals responsible for death and mayhem.  The  ANC
expresses its  heartfelt  condolences  to  the  Msomi  family  and  friends.
[Applause.]

                   LEVEL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SKILLS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, there are two distinct  statements
here. For the first time in 10 years, I regret to say, I have to treat  with
absolute contempt the intervention made. I regret this  very  much.  Hon  Mr
Lowe has all the subtlety and the care of a speed  bump  in  his  blustering
manner. I have read the report of the  HSRC.  The  trouble  that  they  have
three spokespersons on education is that one does not know  what  the  other
does in the DA.

Let me start off by saying that yesterday  I  explained  that  international
comparisons are invalid because they do not take the specific  factors  into
account. In our case, the specific factor is the extraordinary  legacy  left
behind. In 10 years' time, I will show what we have done. A  pipsqueak  like
hon Mr Lee from Port Elizabeth ...  [Interjections.]  They  are  pipsqueaks!
[Interjections.]
Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam  Speaker,  somebody  with  the  stature  of  the  hon
Minister should not go around calling other members pipsqueaks.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, that is not a point of  order.  To
be a pipsqueak has nothing to do with stature and size, it has  to  do  with
mental capacity. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] The first point is that  there
is no proper basis for international comparisons. Secondly,  let  me  remind
the hon Lowe, he says that we are dummying down the matric  curriculum,  the
same curriculum you have had in existence in  South  Africa  for  50  years.
There was no dummying down; that is why  I  say  that  we  will  treat  with
contempt the extraordinary errors of judgement and of facts.

The second point is that they want to create, you may say, a character.  You
are a music hall character with chorus girls behind you to support  you.  We
have them here. We have new job creation now. We have 80 000 people  in  our
learnership programmes; 80 000 people we are trying  to  get  in.  Secondly,
the whole skills levy takes time.  There  are  no  dramatic  changes  it  is
bringing about. [Interjections.]

Thirdly, the very things they sought to steal from us in the  education  for
liberation, we are doing now. The matric examination, ad  nauseam,  will  no
longer be an academic examination. For 50 years we have had  that.  None  of
them, and I looked at the  Hansard,  ever,  in  the  last  30  or  40  years
condemned the fact that apprenticeships were not open to  Africans  in  this
country. I cannot find anything in the Hansard. You  should  be  ashamed  of
yourselves that you come from that background. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

May I say, therefore, that obviously there is a large element of  aggravated
behaviour in education. We are not  responsible  for  the  large  layers  of
ignorance because we are trying to develop the intermediate  skills  and  we
are trying to make the skills in higher education relevant for our needs.

These are all things that are in the process of  being  completed  now.  The
higher education reform is something that no other country has been able  to
do to the extent that we have. So, the DA must now realise that  you  cannot
play to galleries of your own making. I think it is  important  to  remember
that there is a strategic effort being made which they asked for.  You  have
heard of 30 000 teachers who have now been trained in mathematics. You  have
heard of the 103 schools that  will  be  concentrating  on  mathematics  and
science.

These are matters that are being attended to and completed now and  that  is
why you see the results of that education on a long-term basis.

The next question ...

The SPEAKER: No, hon Minister, you have used four minutes  on  dealing  with
the first ...

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, you should have warned  me  before
I finished the first one, I regret to say.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, you started by telling me  that  there  were  two
interventions. So, you had four minutes and your time is  up.  I  regret  to
say that.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I will talk to you outside.

                              VICTIMS OF CRIME

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Hon Speaker, sometimes my heart  bleeds
when I look at liberals in the DA like the hon  Colin  Eglin.  This  happens
because the story of the DA, as it was told,  amongst  others,  by  the  hon
Martha Olckers, is of a party that is moving very swiftly to  the  right.  I
don't know therefore what they are doing. I know that the  English  language
says it is empty barrels that make the most noise, but when it is a sack  of
potatoes that makes the biggest noise, I am flabbergasted.

Just the other day, the Film and Publications Amendment Bill  served  before
this House and was opposed by the DA. Now that the Bill discusses an  issue,
namely child pornography, that has been proved to be directly linked to  the
issue of rape. But they opposed it and they come before this House now as  a
pious group and they are talking about  a  purely  operational  matter  that
relates to policing,  which  has  nothing  to  do  with  our  policies.  The
policies are quite clear. Everybody knows what our attitude is to the  abuse
of women and children. They know that all the police officers we have,  have
a mandate to safeguard the interest of our people across the board. We  have
a particular programme that deals with the abuse of women and children.

Those  who  oppose  progressive  legislation  like   this   particular   one
pertaining to child pornography - legislation that  those  children  in  the
gallery deserve to have in this country - but who then come here  and  speak
as if they are opposed to rape, indicate  that  there  is  something  wrong.
Thank you very much.
             CO-OPERATION BETWEEN SA AND SWITZERLAND IN BURUNDI

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would  like  to  add  a
rejoinder to  the  statement  by  the  hon  Motubatse  in  relation  to  the
developments in Burundi. I wish to remind hon members and our  country  that
when we were at the head of the contingent of the nations of  our  continent
who went into Burundi to assist in the peace process there, it was in  order
to make sure that we put a stop to the war. We wanted to  create  conditions
that would make it possible for  the  United  Nations  to  get  in  and,  of
course, create conditions under which the people of Burundi  could  live  in
peace.

So far, we have advanced to the extent that  the  majority  of  the  warring
parties have signed. But there is a major outstanding  need  which  will  be
addressed by the agreement between ourselves  and  the  Swiss.  It  is  that
young Burundi combatants that are returning from the disarmament  camps  are
finding themselves without resources and without  support  to  resume  their
lives in a free and peaceful country.

Indeed we are  faced  with  conditions  in  which  there  can  be  no  human
security, unless efforts, such as the one between ourselves and  the  Swiss,
take effect. We do need to create conditions there before we come  back,  if
peace is to be sustainable. We  need  to  create  conditions  in  which  the
retraining of young people will arm them with skills that  will  allow  them
to live  without  killing  anybody.  We  need  that  kind  of  support  from
increasing numbers of  nations  so  that  we  can  walk  away  from  Burundi
satisfied that there will be no recurrence, no flaring up  of  the  tensions
again.

I therefore add my voice to that of the hon  Motubatse  on  the  efforts  of
both Switzerland and the Republic of South Africa. I  think  our  Parliament
and our nation can take pride in the fact that we went out  there.  We  have
now created conditions in which the international community,  in  increasing
numbers, can support the total and longlasting stabilisation of  Burundi.  I
thank you.
                      DEBATE ON PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President,  hon  members,  ladies
and gentlemen, the inauguration of the Pan-African Parliament, which  is  to
take place on 18 March 2004, represents a  quantum  leap  in  the  long  and
arduous history of  our  continent.  I  would  like,  therefore,  with  your
indulgence, Speaker, to take everybody present here today further  down  the
road much travelled already.

Our journey can be traced back to the Abuja  Treaty,  which  was  signed  by
African leaders in Abuja, Nigeria, in June 1991, and which came  into  force
in May 1994. After the Abuja Treaty, the  fourth  extraordinary  session  of
the heads of state and  government  held  in  Sirte,  Libya,  from  8  to  9
September 1999, adopted the  Sirte  Declaration.  Among  other  things,  the
Sirte Declaration called for the speedy establishment of the institutions  -
including  the  Pan-African  Parliament  -  provided  for  in   the   treaty
establishing the African Economic Community that was signed in Abuja.

A subsequent meeting was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 17 to 21  April
2000. It was convened by the Secretary-General of the OAU,  Dr  Salim  Ahmed
Salim,  and  was  composed  of  legal  experts  and   parliamentarians   who
considered a draft treaty that paved the way for the  establishment  of  the
African Union and the draft protocol of the treaty establishing the  African
Economic  Community  relating  to  the  Pan-African   Parliament.   At   the
subsequent 36th ordinary session of the  assembly  of  heads  of  state  and
government of the OAU in Lome, Togo,  the  draft  Constitutive  Act  of  the
African Union and the Pan-African Parliament was approved.

During the period 5 to  17  November  2000,  about  191  delegates  from  41
African countries, comprising Speakers, Deputy Speakers,  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers, ambassadors  representing  member  states  of  the  OAU,  clerks,
parliamentary staff  and  officials  from  the  Ministries  responsible  for
foreign affairs, assembled in Pretoria  to  attend  this  historic  meeting.
This gathering was the first of its kind to be  organised  specifically  for
parliamentarians from member states of the OAU since its founding  37  years
ago.

During that gathering delegates expressed support for the  establishment  of
the Pan-African Parliament as a way of involving the African people  in  the
ongoing process of political and social integration on the  continent.  They
were, therefore, prepared to chart the way forward by determining  the  type
of Pan-African Parliament that would enjoy the  support  and  confidence  of
the African people, and not an elitist parliament.

The need for the establishment and existence  of  a  Pan-African  Parliament
cannot be overemphasised. Article 2, clause 2 of the  protocol  states  that
the Pan-African Parliament shall represent all the peoples of  Africa.  This
will enable them to have a common platform where they can  air  their  views
and be involved in discussions and decision-making about  the  problems  and
challenges facing the continent.

They will have a say in how they  are  governed,  and  how  they  should  be
governed. Also, they will have a say in the development and  integration  of
the continent within the framework of the  African  Union.  The  Pan-African
Parliament will facilitate  and  monitor  effective  implementation  of  the
policies and objectives of the African Union. Thus, among  other  tasks,  it
will promote peace, security and stability. It  will  strengthen  solidarity
and build a sense of common destiny among the peoples of Africa.

During  the  first  five  years,  the  Pan-African  Parliament  will  assume
consultative and advisory powers. This will be an experimental period.  But,
ultimately, the Pan-African Parliament will be a full legislative  body.  It
will work closely with parliaments of regional  economic  communities,  such
as SADC in our case, and also national parliaments of  member  states,  such
as our national parliament. This will  ensure  participation  at  grassroots
level in  the  laws  affecting  their  future.  The  establishment  of  this
continental body, once operational, will indeed be a giant step forward.
Allow me to shed some light on the form and scope of  procedures  that  will
guide and underpin proceedings  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  It  shall
adopt its own rules of procedure, on the basis of a two-thirds  majority  of
all its members.

Regarding the presidency of the Pan-African Parliament, it shall  elect,  at
its first  sitting,  by  secret  ballot,  from  among  its  members  and  in
accordance  with  its  rules  of  procedure,  a  president  and  four   vice
presidents representing the five regions,  that  is  Southern  Africa,  West
Africa, Central Africa, North Africa and East Africa.

In this Pan-African Parliament, the term  "President"  can  be  compared  to
"Speaker", in our case, and the term "Vice President"  can  be  compared  to
the rest of the presiding officers in our Parliament.

It is important to note that women shall, at least in terms of the  protocol
to the treaty establishing the African Economic Community  relating  to  the
Pan-African Parliament, have at least one seat among  the  officers  of  the
Pan-African Parliament. The election shall,  in  each  case,  be  by  simple
majority of the members present and voting.

The terms of office of the  president  and  the  vice  president  shall  run
concurrently with the national parliament, or the deliberative organs  which
elect or designate them. At its first sitting, before  proceeding  with  any
other matter, the Pan-African Parliamentarians shall take an oath or make  a
solemn declaration. It shall meet in  ordinary  session  at  least  twice  a
year, within a period to be determined  in  the  rules  of  procedure.  Each
ordinary session may last up to one month.

During recess, after  people  out  there  had  learnt  that  Parliament  had
elected five delegates that would represent South Africa  in  Ethiopia,  the
people who know me and had heard my name being mentioned were  saying:  "Oh!
We see! So now you are going out to Africa. You will no  longer  be  one  of
us." I'm just stating this point because many people  think  that  the  five
delegates will  be  seated  permanently  in  Addis  Ababa.  It  is  not  so.
Parliament will sit  at  certain  times  and  only  for  a  limited  period.
Otherwise, they will be here in the country most of the time.

Furthermore, the  operations  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  are  clearly
defined. The protocol provides for an annual budget,  which  constitutes  an
integral part of the regular budget, and shall  be  drawn  up  by  the  Pan-
African Parliament in accordance with the financial  rules  and  regulations
of the OAU, and shall be approved by the Assembly, until such  time  as  the
Pan-African Parliament shall start to exercise legislative powers.

Moreover,  the  protocol  has  dealt  with  the  vexing  language   question
admirably. The official  languages  will  be  Arabic,  French,  English  and
Portuguese. Where possible, African languages will also be accommodated.

Up to now, the planning and preparatory work have  been  carried  out  by  a
steering committee and its substructures. One of  the  substructures  was  a
technical team, consisting of representatives  that  were  seconded  by  the
national parliaments to prepare rules for the inaugural and  first  sessions
of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  South  Africa  was  represented  in  this
structure by Mr K Mansura from our Parliament and  by  Prof  Shadrack  Gutto
from the Centre for African Renaissance Studies.

These draft rules have now been adopted by the steering committee  and  will
be considered  further  by  the  Pan-African  Parliament  during  its  first
sitting. Also, a draft programme and procedures for  the  inaugural  session
have been drawn up. Proceedings are essentially similar  to  those  we  have
seen in our national Parliament,  for  example  the  proceedings  that  took
place when our first democratically elected Parliament was set  up  in  1994
and for the second Parliament in 1999.

The inaugural  session  will  be  presided  over  by  President  Chisano  of
Mozambique in his capacity as the current Chairperson of  the  AU.  This  is
quite significant in the sense that he is the  Chairperson  of  the  African
Union and therefore he is the person who  is  fit  to  inaugurate  the  Pan-
African Parliament. He will administer the swearing-in of members  who  will
either take an oath or make a solemn declaration.

After the swearing-in is concluded, the election of  the  President  of  the
Pan-African Parliament will follow. The election will be  by  secret  ballot
and, as in any such election, spoilt ballot papers will be discarded by  the
returning officer. However, I want to assure the members of this House  that
the South African delegation will make sure that there are no  spoilt  votes
from it.

The president having been duly elected will take an oath or  make  a  solemn
declaration and will be asked to take a chair. This part  of  the  programme
also accommodates  an  address  by  the  President  of  Ethiopia,  the  host
country; by President Chisano, the chairperson of the session; by the  newly
elected Pan-African Parliament president;  and  there  will  be  a  vote  of
thanks by one of the Pan-African Parliament members.  I  think  we  can  see
here that there are a lot of similarities between what happens here  in  our
Parliament and what will happen in Addis Ababa. That is an  indication  also
of the contribution that has been made by the African  Union  Working  Group
of this Parliament, in other words by South Africa.

The first session of the Pan-African Parliament will then continue and  will
be presided over by its new president. This session will adopt rules,  elect
the four vice presidents, constitute the  bureau,  adopt  the  programme  of
work, and constitute  the  three  proposed  committees,  namely  the  rules,
budget and credentials committees.

The election of the four vice presidents will ensure that at least one  will
be a woman. Thus, the ballot paper for  the  vice  presidents  ensures  that
this is achieved by having two lists. On one ballot paper there will be  two
lists, one with the names of women nominees only, and  the  other  with  the
names of all the nominees, men and women. Every member is compelled to  vote
on both lists. If no cross is made on the women's list - on the  women  only
list - such a ballot  paper  will  be  deemed  spoilt.  We've  ensured  that
everybody votes for women.

Should no women be elected on the second list, then the woman with the  most
votes on the first list will replace a man coming from the same region.  The
president and the four vice presidents constitute the bureau.

In his state of the nation address to Parliament in  2001,  President  Mbeki
appealed to Parliament to be involved  in  matters  of  the  African  Union.
Consequently, in February 2002 Parliament established the Working  Group  on
the African Union, which has since carried out its  tasks  consistently  and
has brought us to the stage at which we are today, that is at which  we  are
ready to send a democratically and procedurally elected delegation to  Addis
Ababa. We know some people are complaining  about  the  composition  of  the
delegation because they got themselves out of that delegation;  it  was  not
Parliament. But as far as this Parliament is concerned, the procedures  were
correct and the elections were democratic.
The Working Group on the African Union together with  its  support  staff  -
the group that was chaired by the Speaker - is to be  congratulated  on  the
sterling work it has done over the past two years. What now remains  is  for
the next Parliament to consider recommendations made by  the  working  group
in its eighth report, and, as amended, in its tenth report.

We  know  that  both  reports  were  adopted  by  this  House.  One  of  the
recommendations made by  the  working  group  was  for  this  Parliament  to
consider establishing a joint committee to  process  and  deal  with  issues
emanating from the African Union and from the  Pan-African  Parliament.  The
committee would then be able to table reports to Parliament. This  committee
could also be a forum to discuss with the executive its engagement with  the
African Union. I think this recommendation, if implemented, could  form  the
basis of - and be encouragement by - this Parliament for  the  work  of  the
five delegates who are now going to take over all work  in  connection  with
the Pan-African Parliament.

The inauguration of the Pan-African Parliament  is  taking  place  during  a
significant year for South Africa, 2004 being an election year and the  year
in which the people of this country are celebrating 10  years  of  democracy
and the great achievements of the democratic Government led by the ANC.

I have no doubt in my mind that on 14 April South  Africans  will  vote  the
ANC back into power to  ensure  that  ...  [Applause.]  ...  the  democratic
process already  begun  is  strengthened,  not  only  in  South  Africa  but
throughout Africa, throughout  our  continent.  This  will  ensure  that  we
participate in the African Union, in Nepad and also, as I've  already  said,
in the Pan-African Parliament.

I'm sure that even the DA will be in a position to support the five  members
of the delegation in their  work  throughout  their  period  of  office.  Of
course, our own period of office is a very short one. It will end  with  the
end of the life of this Parliament, but, as we  know,  the  next  Parliament
that will come into power after the elections will therefore have  the  duty
of electing, once again, five members that will represent  South  Africa  in
the Pan-African Parliament. The membership of  members  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament exists as long as that particular parliament  is  in  power,  but
once that particular parliament has been dissolved then  the  membership  of
the five delegates also ceases. Madam  Speaker,  with  these  few  words,  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, it would appear  that  2004  is  likely  to  be
another extremely important and busy  year  for  the  African  Union.  Three
important organs of the union, the Peace and Security Council,  the  African
Court  of  Justice  and  the  Pan-African  Parliament,  are  due  to   start
functioning.

In addition the Peer Review Mechanism of Nepad has already started its  work
with Rwanda, the first country to come under review  procedure.  In  respect
of each of these organs, a lot of preparatory work has been done,  but  more
preparatory work still has to be done and substructures have to  be  put  in
place. For instance, as far as  the  Peer  Review  Mechanism  is  concerned,
substantial preparatory work has been done, but a decision has still  to  be
made by the AU as to what organ or authority within the AU will  action  the
recommendations in the report of the Peer  Review  Mechanism  on  follow  up
intervention.

In respect of the African Court of Justice, decisions still have to be  made
on how or to what extent the jurisdiction of the court will  be  allowed  to
intrude on the constitutional sovereignty of individual states.  In  respect
of the Peace and Security Council, a finalisation of the protocol still  has
to take place as well as the setting up of rapid deployment units on both  a
country and regional basis.

In respect of the Pan-African Parliament, much  preparatory  work  has  been
done. I believe the Pan-African Parliament  owes  a  debt  of  gratitude  to
Speaker Ginwala, who has chaired its steering committee for the  past  year.
No doubt there will still be some birth pains when the  PAP  meets  for  the
first time in a couple of weeks  time.  Not  least  of  these  will  be  the
practical application of Article 4.3 of the protocol, which states that  the
representation of each member state much reflect the diversity of  political
opinions in each national  parliament  or  deliberative  organ.  Within  the
various parliaments there may be differences of opinion on  the  application
of this provision, as indeed there is in our  Parliament.  However,  let  me
say that the  final  decision  on  this  matter  lies  not  with  individual
parliaments, but with the PAP's credentials committee. It  alone  will  have
to decide whether or not  the  protocol  has  been  complied  with  by  each
individual state. So we will await  the  certification  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament's credentials committee.

Another question that will have to be resolved in relation  to  PAP  is  the
significant difference between the boundaries of the regions  of  Africa  as
determined by the AU and the boundaries  of  the  regional  economic  units,
such as SADC and ECOWAS, which are already functioning  as  viable  economic
and developmental units. May I just mention that  in  the  Southern  African
region, in terms of the AU there are 10 states and in terms  of  SADC  there
are 14 states. Somehow or other this is going to  have  to  be  resolved  in
relation to PAP or some other organ. Another thorny question is going to  be
the location of PAP. I know South Africa has put in a bid  -  I  don't  know
whether it's a financial or a moral one. I  believe  other  states  will  be
competing for that as well.

And then as far as the AU is concerned, there are still one or  two  overall
question marks that will have to be erased. To what extent is the  continent
of Africa manageable as an integrated economic entity?  Do  the  leaders  of
Africa, with their diverse views and at  times  competing  priorities,  have
the collective will to put the lofty principles of the AU into practice?  Is
there the will in Africa at leadership level to make the AU work?

I hope that the answer to both these questions proves to be, yes. I  believe
that all of us in this House want the AU to succeed,  for  if  it  succeeds,
there is hope of Africa succeeding  and  with  this  the  prospect  of  real
progress for the millions of our people who live on our  continent.  In  the
success we hope for, the PAP can play a very important  supplementary  role.
It can do so by monitoring the activities of the various  organs,  including
the council of the AU. It can do so by advising, as it  is  entitled  to  in
terms of the protocol. It can do so by backing up the other organs  in  many
ways. It can do so by promoting unity  amongst  diversity  in  Africa.  Most
important of all, it can do so by speaking up, not for the  governments  and
not for the countries, but for the people of Africa.

And so we of the DA and of this House I believe as  a  whole  wish  the  PAP
well. We will observe its  activities  and  we  are  going  to  monitor  its
progress with great interest.

As this is the last occasion  when  members  of  the  House  will  have  the
privilege of listening to me and I have the privilege of addressing them,  I
would crave your latitude and your indulgence when I  make  a  few  personal
comments. As I said, this is the last speech  I  am  making  in  Parliament.
Some 46 years have elapsed since as a nervous backbencher I  made  my  first
speech in 1958. Yes, you'll say, Eglin you've been around  a  long  time.  I
was elected in 1958 and in 1961,  with  11  of  my  colleagues  in  the  old
Progressive Party, I was voted out of Parliament by the white  voters.  They
resented the fact that we  were  saying  that  racism  was  wrong  and  that
apartheid had to go. They resented the fact that we  said  sooner  or  later
the representatives of all the people of South Africa must negotiate  a  new
nonracial and democratic constitution.

I was re-elected in 1975 and I've been here ever  since.  But  it  might  be
interesting for members to know that I fought  in  the  last  11  successive
general elections. I have served during the terms  of  office  of  the  last
seven presidents and prime ministers, from Strydom through  to  Verwoerd  to
Vorster to Botha to De Klerk to Mandela and Mbeki. And you might think  that
constitutions  last  forever.  I  have  served  in  Parliament  under   five
different  constitutions  -   the   union   constitution,   the   republican
constitution, the tricameral constitution, the interim constitution and  now
the final democratic constitution.

I have taken part in many bruising political debates. I've  shared  the  joy
of victory at times and at times  I  have  savoured  the  disappointment  of
defeat. I leave Parliament with a kaleidoscope  of  memories,  but  I  shall
leave with no regrets. You might ask  me,  what  was  your  most  satisfying
moment and undoubtedly it was 9 May when this Parliament  endorsed  our  new
democratic constitution after, many of you will recall, a very hectic  night
of 8 May when we sat right through the  night  trying  to  reach  the  final
compromises. [Applause.]

And to me to have had the privilege of taking  part  in  the  constitutional
process was satisfying in itself. But I realised when the  constitution  was
adopted, that the close on  40  years  of  my  opposition  to  the  National
Party's policy of apartheid and authoritarianism had not been in vain.  That
was the cherry on top. Like many of you I have enjoyed my 10  years  in  the
new democratic Parliament. It is very different  from  the  old  parliament,
although we still meet oddly  enough  in  the  same  large  chamber.  It  is
fundamentally different  in  its  composition,  both  of  race  and  gender.
[Applause.] It is fundamentally different  in  the  procedures  through  the
development of the committee system. It is different in the  sense  that  it
is less concerned about ideology than the old parliament was and  much  more
concerned about people. [Applause.]

There is, however, a worrying similarity in  the  sense  of  the  increasing
dominance of the executive over Parliament and its members. I  believe  that
good governance requires that members of Parliament, irrespective  of  their
party-political  affiliations,  unite  in  ensuring  that  the   rights   of
Parliament are  protected,  both  to  the  letter  and  the  spirit  of  the
Constitution. If I am disappointed about anything in this House, it  is  the
fact that although there are very many well-prepared speeches,  some  of  us
read them out with very little passion.

There have been very few real debates. There  is  very  little  constructive
interaction across the floor of this House on matters of  vital  concern  to
the people. On occasion, when the debates started  looking  like  they  were
getting underway, speakers on the podium were greeted by a barrage of  noisy
and intolerant interjections.

I believe that Parliament in the next session will be  much  better  and  it
will enjoy more esteem amongst the members  of  the  public,  if  in  future
there  are  fewer  speeches  and  more  debates  and  less  noise  and  more
tolerance. [Applause.] I must conclude by saying I want  to  thank  all  the
members who have enriched  my  experience  as  an  MP.  To  the  members  of
Parliament and to the members of staff go, in general, my thanks  for  their
courtesy and friendship. Of course I wish you all a peaceful election.

I will participate, but watch with interest. And of course  to  the  members
of my own party, I trust that  you  will  return  to  this  House  in  great
numbers to play a constructive role in  strengthening  multiparty  democracy
and ensuring that good governance prevails in South Africa. I  have  another
hope and that is that  in  the  next  Parliament  there  will  be  a  common
recognition that the underlying threat to our democratic order, lies not  so
much in personalities or parties or party politics, but in the existence  in
our country of pervasive poverty, rising unemployment and  the  widening  of
the gap between the rich and the poor. I believe  in  these  three  elements
the risk is there and in these three elements is the challenge  for  all  of
you who are coming back next session.

I want to thank you once again. I wish you well - I  say  `sterkte'.  I  say
hamba kahle. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I just want  to  note  that  I  think  most  of  us  are  quite
intrigued by a vision of you as a nervous new member, hon Eglin! I  am  sure
all members will join me in wishing you well  over  the  long  years  ahead,
with time to write, so that we may share your kaleidoscope of memories.

We look forward to seeing you in the gallery. We know you will  be  with  us
in spirit, but we want you here in person as well. [Applause.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Madam Speaker, hon colleagues,  my  party  was  given  seven
minutes to speak on this topic. We have  decided  that  I  will  take  three
minutes and my colleague, the  hon  Mrs  Mbuyazi,  will  use  four  minutes.
Within those three minutes I particularly want to use  this  opportunity  to
thank this House for selecting us to go and be part  of  such  an  important
historical event. By selecting us, we have been  given  a  tremendous  trust
and confidence. When I think back on the whole  of  my  life,  I  could  not
think of a better honour than being part of  the  continent,  attempting  to
build itself, to put itself together and determine its  future  together.  I
want to say: Thank you very much. [Applause.]

We have been very lucky also that in South Africa we have had  a  democracy,
and that we are well  aware  of  women's  participation  in  the  democratic
process. [Applause.] We are taking those two things  with  us  to  this  new
parliament. We are taking these things proudly,  because  we  feel  that  at
home, these things operate truly and in a good spirit. Some of us  have  had
the opportunity of being invited by women in  Africa,  who  wanted  to  know
what muti or charm we as African women have had over the men, which  enabled
African women in this country in  particular  to  be  part  of  the  various
levels and positions in the country. [Applause.]

In this I was lucky to share this experience with Lulu Xingwana and we  used
to return from these trips and report to women in general. As  a  result  we
as the Women's Parliamentary Caucus were the first on the continent to  have
that. Ultimately more parliaments wanted to be part of this and in  the  end
now we can speak of the SADC Parliamentary Caucus.

So we go to this august meeting on 16 March  feeling  very  proud  and  very
strong. We have a leader, who has had  the  experience  of  serving  as  our
Speaker, and who has been part of the steering committee  right  through  in
the development of the AU Pan-African Parliament. The ad hoc  committee  has
always been briefed on  this  and  so  we  have  gathered  already  what  my
colleague,  hon  Njobe,  was  talking  about,  in  these  ad  hoc  committee
meetings. We are proud that we go there as a  team  of  five,  two  men  and
three women. [Applause.] Already we are setting an example.

We are also proud that it has been agreed that whatever the  form  and  size
of the body that would form the leadership, there must be at least  a  woman
representative. We are hoping that it may happen that  through  our  efforts
and other people's efforts in the Southern region, we might be able to  have
more than just one woman in the leadership of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.
So, again, I want to repeat myself and say: We are aware that being part  of
a foundation something is able to grow because its foundation is strong.  If
a house or whatever is formed does not have a strong foundation  right  from
the beginning, it will crumble. Again, thank you very  much  for  giving  us
this opportunity through a  very  unusual  democratic  process.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS:  Madam Speaker, the hon Colin Eglin  expressed  the  wish
that his party would return to this House in greater  numbers.  All  that  I
want to say to that is:  wishful  thinking.  The  hon  Eglin  was  named  by
Leadership Magazine as the parliamentarian of the century. In  my  view,  it
is a well-deserved nomination and allow me to salute a  parliamentarian  par
excellence, who served his country well over many years. [Applause.]

I do not wish to participate in a debate as to whether or not  the  Official
Opposition should have been included in the South African delegation to  the
Pan-African Parliament. Suffice it  to  say,  the  protocol  to  the  treaty
establishing the Pan-African Parliament  is  quite  clear  on  this  matter.
Article 4.3 says:


  The representation of each member state must  reflect  the  diversity  of
  political opinions in each national parliament.

It does  not  specify  "the  official  opposition"  and  the  South  African
delegation does reflect diverse political opinions. [Applause.]


  Allow me a few remarks on articles 2 and 6 of the protocol.  Article  2.3
  says:


  The ultimate aim of the Pan-African Parliament shall be to evolve into an
  institution whose members are elected by universal adult suffrage.

I think the idea of an election, based on universal adult  suffrage,  should
be revisited for the following reasons: In order to ensure that  Pan-African
Parliamentarians shall represent all the peoples of Africa as  envisaged  in
article 2.2, there should be the closest  possible  link  between  the  Pan-
African Parliament and the national parliaments, but should the  Pan-African
Parliament be elected on the basis of universal  suffrage,  one  creates  an
institution which has virtually no links at all with national parliaments.

It may even happen that the majority of members  elected  on  the  basis  of
universal suffrage may have opposite political opinions to  those  of  their
peers in the national parliaments, as currently  often  happens  in  the  EU
Parliament. This will undoubtedly create an untenable  situation.  The  best
way therefore to ensure that Pan-African parliamentarians represent all  the
peoples of Africa, is that  they  should  be  elected  by  their  respective
national parliaments, as the protocol currently provides for.

The concept of the closest possible link between the Pan-African  Parliament
and the national parliaments is supported by the provisions of  article  5.3
of the protocol which says:


  The term of a member of the Pan-African Parliament shall run concurrently
  with his or her term in the national parliament.

Article 6 is also problematic. It says:


  The  Pan-African  parliamentarians  shall  vote  in  their  personal  and
  independent capacity.

I have a slightly different interpretation of this article. It  could  never
have been the intention of the authors of the protocol that the  Pan-African
parliamentarians  should  discard  the  mandates  of  their  parliaments  as
represented  by  majority  parties  when  they  vote  in   the   Pan-African
Parliament. In my view, this article should  be  read  in  conjunction  with
article 4.3. That article provides for a diversity of political opinions  in
each  delegation.  To  vote  in  their  personal  and  independent  capacity
therefore means that  minorities  in  a  delegation  need  not  support  the
majority, but that they can vote independently as mandated by  the  policies
of their respective parties. If the aforesaid interpretation is wrong  then,
in my view, this article needs to be amended in future.

I need clarity on the  issue  whether  parliaments,  which  have  failed  to
deposit  the  instrument  of  ratification,  should   participate   in   the
forthcoming meeting of the Pan-African Parliament.  I  would  argue  against
it.

Speaker,  volgens  die  Abujaverdrag,  in  terme  waarvan   die   Pan-Afrika
Parlement gekonstituteer word, sou die PAP die laaste stap  gewees  het  van
ses fases wat oor `n tydperk van 34 jaar strek.  [Tyd verstreke.]  [Speaker,
according to the Abuja Treaty in terms of which the  Pan-African  Parliament
was constituted, the PAP would have been the last step in a  series  of  six
phases stretching over a period of 34 years. [Time expired.]]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs,
I wish to express our sincere appreciation of the  contribution  the  hon  C
Eglin made in that committee. We shall always treasure your wisdom. You  are
no doubt the product of the old school of labourers,  which  has  played  no
small part in shaping this democracy. We wish you Godspeed. [Applause.]

The African Union has been launched and it is therefore  a  reality.  It  is
the realisation of a dream, a vision, by the African luminaries of the  last
two centuries. These are  Marcus  Garvey,  George  Padmore  Williams,  Kwame
Nkrumah, Julius  Nyerere,  Nelson  Mandela,  Walter  Sisulu,  Oliver  Tambo,
Robert Sobukwe, Samora  Machel  -  the  list  is  endless.  These  stalwarts
conceptualised and defined  the  doctrine  of  Pan  Africanism,  formulated,
strove and inspired others to struggle and sacrifice for the  redemption  of
the African continent. Many paid the supreme price  in  their  endeavour  to
restore national self-determination and dignity.

It has been a long and arduous crusade to shed  the  shackles  of  physical,
mental and spiritual bondage of centuries of slavery  and  colonialism.  The
savage  experience  of  slave  trade  and  colonialism   has   scarred   and
traumatised  several  generations  of  Africans.  They  have  destroyed  the
African social, cultural and spiritual fabric.  They  dehumanised  both  the
victims  and  perpetrators  alike,  and  thus  handed  down  to   succeeding
generations, of the oppressor and the oppressed, an  abnormal  and  perverse
legacy.

This scourge pervades  the  entire  continent.  It  has  brought  widespread
poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and lack of skills. This  is  the  face
of underdevelopment, which the African Union, through  its  vehicle,  Nepad,
is confronting.

Africans have rallied to  the  clarion  call  of  the  African  Renaissance,
spearheaded by the President of the ANC and  the  Government,  Thabo  Mbeki,
and his comrades-in-arms in  Senegal,  Algeria,  Nigeria  and  others.  This
African awakening, the African revival is about rolling back the scourge  of
poverty with  its  grim  face.  It  is  about  development  of  the  African
continental economy in a manner that reaches the roots  in  the  city  slums
and the rural backwaters. It is about the eradication  of  the  multiplicity
of diseases that plague and retard our continent.

We are challenged to provide quality education and skills to the  multitudes
from whom these have been withheld. We are called  upon  to  provide  decent
shelter, water and energy,  and  to  remove  the  squalid  settlements  that
disfigure our beautiful landscape.

The ANC has played a pivotal  role  in  the  conceptualisation,  definition,
shaping and establishment of the African Union, Nepad and other organs.  The
shuttle diplomacy of the presidency and the Department  of  Foreign  Affairs
continues to underscore the ANC's conviction that South  African  cannot  be
an island, isolated from the rest of the continent.

Such an insular  perspective  fails  to  recognise  that  whatever  relative
prosperity we enjoy in South Africa would be submerged in a  deluge  of  the
poverty bordering our frontiers. In order to achieve the noble goals of  the
pioneers of this millennium initiative, in which  our  ANC  leaders  feature
prominently, the New Partnership for Africa's Development  was  established,
even before the African Union  was  launched.  Nepad  is  the  programme  of
action of the  African  Union,  whose  primary  objective  is  the  economic
development and therefore the social, cultural and spiritual  upliftment  of
the African people.

This vision envisages  a  partnership  between  the  African  underdeveloped
communities and the  developed  first  world  economies  of  the  North.  We
believe that it is in the mutual interest of both  parties  to  engage  with
sincerity and commitment in the task of the economic, social  and  political
transformation of the continent.

We are, of course, aware that the globalised economy is structurally  flawed
as a historical consequence of deliberate imperial policies,  which  created
vibrant  metropolitan  core  economies,  which   were   sustained   by   the
exploitation of indigenous colonial resources with little or  no  regard  to
the developmental needs of these peripheral economies.

Thus we have two worlds, of the very rich and the very poor, separated by  a
yawning chasm. This dichotomy translates into the emerging  former  colonial
economies where wealth is concentrated in a few  hands  in  the  metropolis,
while the vast majority of the  masses  are  marginalised  in  the  poverty-
stricken countryside and informal settlements.

This history is bound to put obstacles in the way of  finding  common  cause
and a meaningful commitment to an egalitarian symbiotic partnership  between
the North and the South and in our domestic situation. However, all  is  not
lost.  Whatever  the  difficulties,  real  politics  dictates  that   Africa
seriously engages the rich. We must persuade, pressure, cajole  and  bargain
against all odds. We cannot do this with any chance of success as a  divided
global sector. Strong bonds must bind the continent together and  create  an
environment  for   a   thriving   intra-African   economic   and   political
interaction.

This must extend to South-South trade and  investment  that  transcends  the
traditional North-South corridors of spheres of influence. This  has  become
very urgent in the wake of recent oil discoveries in Africa, which could  be
the source of a latter day scramble for this much coveted resource.

We are encouraged by the emerging détente between Brazil,  India  and  South
Africa in the wake of the Cancun Conference. It is hoped that this could  be
a gravitational point around which an axis  of  the  just  could  rally  and
contribute to a progressive realignment and balance of forces.

The Pan-African Parliament is due to be launched on 18  to  20  March  2004,
with 35 states having ratified the protocol to the treaty  establishing  the
African Economic Community relating to the Pan-African Parliament. PAP  will
liaise with regional economic blocs, as well  as  national  parliamentarians
of the AU. Initially  this  parliament  will  have  no  legislative  powers,
although this is visualised in the future. These  are  the  first  tentative
steps in the political and economic integration process in Africa.  This  is
vital for the building of a viable continent that  can  wield  a  reasonable
clout in the engagement with the developed North.

It must be stressed that the PAP is meant to devolve  to  the  grass  roots,
whose concerns it is charged to address. It  should  never  be  an  elitist,
esoteric talk shop. Much progress has been made in bringing investment  into
South Africa since 1994, notwithstanding the lack of a spectacular  economic
growth rate. Our Government has concluded numerous bilateral trade  treaties
and conventions with countries in Africa, Europe,  the  Americas  and  Asia-
Pacific.

The Department of Foreign Affairs is stepping up the opening  of  diplomatic
missions in Africa in line with our national policy guidelines in favour  of
a robust afrocentric involvement on the continent. The Presidency, the  DFA,
the DTI and the Department of Defence, in particular, are visible in  Africa
in political and trade  interaction  as  well  as  in  conflict  prevention,
management and resolution. Strides have been taken in the  establishment  of
some of the organs of the AU out of the envisaged total of 18.

These are: the Assembly as the supreme organ. The Assembly  is  composed  of
the heads of state or their duly accredited  representatives.  The  Assembly
meets at least once a year in ordinary session  although  it  will  meet  in
extraordinary session at the request of any member state and approval  by  a
two-thirds majority of member states.  Decisions  are  taken  by  consensus,
failing which, by a two-thirds  majority  of  member  states.  Decisions  of
procedural matters will be taken by a simple majority.

The Executive Council is a meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs or  other
Ministers delegated to discharge the responsibility of dealing with the  AU.
This body makes recommendations to the Assembly.

The  Permanent   Representative   Committee   is   composed   of   permanent
representatives and other plenipotentiaries to the Union. They work  closely
with the Commission. They are involved in their nomination and  appointment.
This organ feeds into the Executive Council.

As stated above, the protocol establishing the  Pan-African  Parliament  has
already been ratified by  a  sufficient  number  of  member  signatories  to
enable it to be launched on 18 to 20 March 2004.

The protocol relating  to  the  establishment  of  the  Peace  and  Security
Council of the African Union has been ratified. This is a  key  organ  as  a
body responsible for conflict prevention,  management  and  resolution.  The
ANC-led Government has charted a noteworthy course in putting out  fires  in
several turbulent spots on the continent, for example the DRC, Burundi,  the
Indian Ocean Rim, West Africa, etc. We are keeping  a  close  watch  on  the
peace process and progress in Sudan. It is also a matter  of  grave  concern
to read about the recent massacre in Uganda,  which  is  attributed  to  the
Lord's Resistance Movement.

Members of the Commission are  appointed  by  the  Permanent  Representative
Committee, and this is the organ  responsible  for  the  administrative  and
secretarial functions of the Pan-African Parliament.
The vision of the AU is that of a developed, prosperous, healthy, happy  and
creative continent, capable  of  shaping  its  own  destiny  unhindered  and
unfettered. We look ahead to a time when we shall have  sovereign  economies
optimally utilising our bountiful resources as we choose for the benefit  of
the broad masses of our people. We are committed to the realisation of  this
vision. Only the ANC can lead South Africa to victory in this quest.

Let us  rally  behind  the  movement  of  the  people  -  the  architect  of
decolonisation and self-determination. We acknowledge the  challenges  of  a
globalised world. We are very mindful of the dangers of  unipolar  hegemony.
As a continent we will stand together  and  make  our  contribution  to  the
restructuring of multilateral institutions and the  shaping  of  a  new  and
better world order. I Afrika! Mayibuye! [Africa! Let it be restored  to  its
owners!] [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Deputy Speaker,  I  will  address  myself  to  what  I
perceive, from the Constitutive Act of the African Union  and  the  protocol
establishing the Pan-African Parliament,  to  be  the  vision  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament. In my view the  vision,  as  can  be  gleaned  from  the
protocol, is to  ensure  representation  of  African  peoples  by  universal
suffrage directly to the Pan-African Parliament.

The current provisions therefore in the protocol, in  my  view,  are  not  a
legal  requirement,  and  should  be  seen  as  transitional   as   far   as
representation in the Pan-African Parliament is concerned.  Although  it  is
desirable  that  delegates  to  the   Pan-African   Parliament   should   be
accountable to the national parliaments, it's quite clear  from  my  reading
of the protocol that they are free to exercise their conscience. In my  view
the mischief that the protocol seeks to prevent is  a  situation  which  may
arise, and does arise in some countries, where the  delegates  are  dictated
to in those countries by their executive. That  is  why  the  protocol  says
representation in the Pan-African Parliament  is  not  compatible  with  the
executive function.

Therefore it's quite clear, in  my  view,  that  the  protocol  envisages  a
situation in the future in which  Africa  shall  have  a  united  states  of
Africa, as we see the developments in Europe towards the  centralisation  of
power and now the discussion to have a European Union president. It's  quite
clear, in  my  view,  that  this  is  the  direction  that  the  Pan-African
Parliament  will  take  in  future,  because  how  else  can   you   explain
representation  by  universal  suffrage  if  what   is   foreseen   is   not
centralisation of executive power? It's quite clear that that is  where  the
emphasis will lie in future.

Therefore I disagree with  my  colleague  from  the  New  NP  that  what  is
foreseen in the protocol is to ensure  that  delegates  are  accountable  to
their political parties. On the contrary; what is emphasised,  in  my  view,
is the accountability of the delegates to the Pan-African Parliament to  the
people who elected them by universal suffrage.

When it comes to the delegation that we have, I want to  thank  the  working
group of the African Union for the work that has been done,  the  leadership
that has been shown and  the  delegates  that  have  been  elected  by  this
Parliament. I agree with the previous speakers that the  protocol,  strictly
speaking, does not require a particular representation with  regard  to  the
sizes of opposition parties, but the diversity of political  opinion.  Also,
we must agree that it would have been desirable that the largest  opposition
should have had representation, but sadly this is not a  legal  requirement.
Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members  of  this  House,  the
inauguration of the Pan-African Parliament  is  fast  approaching.  It  will
indeed  be  an  auspicious  occasion  that  all  of   us   will   celebrate.
Symbolically, it is a tangible manifestation  of  the  growing  independence
and unity of Africa. As a continent, we are increasingly  demonstrating  our
commitment to democracy and our ability to  govern  ourselves.  Practically,
the Pan-African Parliament creates a forum for  communication  between  this
House and other African Parliaments, and will hopefully lead to greater  co-
operation on fundamental issues that face all of us.

Our experience as an established but still young Parliament can add much  to
the growth and development of the Pan-African  Parliament.  The  members  on
whom the honour and duty falls to represent South Africa in the  Pan-African
Parliament must embrace this  opportunity  with  enthusiasm  and  dedication
because they have to represent the best of what this House has to  offer  to
the continent. We cannot settle for mediocrity  because  that  would  be  to
doom the Pan-African Parliament to the status of a glorified talk shop.

The citizens of our country and, of course, our continent deserve  our  best
talent and expertise. To the members who have been elected to represent  the
South African Parliament at the Pan-African  Parliament,  we  have  this  to
say: "You have our unwavering support as a nation and we are sure  you  will
do us proud. We wish you Godspeed in your onerous task." I thank you.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, first of all, on behalf of the NA,  I  want
to thank the hon Colin Eglin for the contribution  he  has  made  over  more
than half a century in different Parliaments in  South  Africa.  This  place
will be poorer without the aristocratic figure of Colin  Eglin.  His  wisdom
and experience will be missed. The NA wishes him all the blessings with  his
new career and his young wife. We salute a respected figure who made a  huge
contribution and who has been a parliamentarian par excellence. Hamba  kahle
[Go well].

The NA supports the  founding  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  on  certain
conditions.  First  of  all,  it  must  not  mean  Pan-Africanism   in   the
ideological sense of the word. It must really be an institution  that  looks
after the interests of all the peoples of this  continent,  and  also  those
who arrived here 400 years and less ago.

Tweedens,  dat  die  selfstandigheid  en  die   onafhanklikheid   van   elke
deelnemende staat erken sal word. In die verband steun die NA die  standpunt
van die agb Boy Geldenhuys, naamlik dat die parlemente van die  verskillende
state die samestellende dele van die Pan-Afrika Parlement sal  wees  en  dat
daar nie `n nuwe liggaam van individue bo-oor die bestaande jurisdiksie  van
state gestig sal word nie.

Derdens, dat die Parlement die lesse van die ou OAE ter harte sal  neem,  en
nie ideologiesgedrewe sal wees nie, maar ontwikkelingsgedrewe.  Hiervoor  is
nodig  dat,  vierdens,  die  portuurtoesigmeganisme  effektief   sal   wees.
Lidmaatskap moet nie outomaties wees nie, maar moet  onderskraag  word  deur
gesonde demokrasie en skoon administrasies. Vyfdens, dat  spesifieke  aandag
gegee sal word aan die regte van veral minderheidsgemeenskappe van Afrika.

In die verband wil ek graag wys op `n resolusie tydens die Wêreldberaad  vir
Volhoubare Ontwikkeling, naamlik dat kulturele  sekuriteit  `n  voorvereiste
is vir volhoubare ontwikkeling. In die laaste plek steun die NA  Suid-Afrika
se bod vir hierdie parlement, en ons hoop dat dit net so suksesvol sal  wees
soos die 2010 sokkerbod. Alles van die beste vir die  Pan-Afrika  Parlement.
Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Secondly, that the autonomy and independence of every  participating  state
will be recognised. In this regard the NA supports the view of the  hon  Boy
Geldenhuys, namely  that  the  parliaments  of  the  various  states  should
comprise the components of the Pan-African Parliament and that  a  new  body
of individuals should  not  be  established  over  and  above  the  existing
jurisdiction of states.

Thirdly, that the parliament should take to heart the lessons of the  former
OAU, and should not be ideologically  driven,  but  development-driven.  For
this reason it is necessary that, fourthly, the peer group review  mechanism
should be effective.  Membership should not  be  automatic,  but  should  be
supported by  sound  democracy  and  clean  administrations.  Fifthly,  that
specific attention will be  given  to  the  rights  of  especially  minority
communities in Africa.

In this regard I would like to point  out  a  resolution  during  the  World
Summit on Sustainable  Development,  namely  that  cultural  security  is  a
prerequisite for sustainable development.  Lastly,  the  NA  supports  South
Africa's bid for this parliament, and we  hope  that  it  will  be  just  as
successful as the 2010 soccer bid.  Everything  of  the  best  to  the  Pan-
African Parliament. I thank you.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, it  gives  me  pleasure  to
participate in this debate when the  preparations  are  under  way  for  the
inaugural session of the Pan-African Parliament in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia,
next month. Members will take the oath in the  four  official  languages  of
the African Union namely French, English, Arabic  and  Portuguese.  We  also
want to welcome the decision  of  the  steering  committee  to  allow  three
observers to the inaugural session.

The IFP would also like to congratulate the South African delegation to  the
PAP, Dr Frene Ginwala, Mr Mahlangu of the NCOP, Mrs Njobe, B Geldenhuys  and
Prof  Ngubane.  May  I  also  give  them  a  piece  of  advice  for  nothing
njengomakoti eya kogana [as is given to a bride before she is married  off].
You are not going there as individuals but you are going there to  represent
us and also to represent this Parliament, your parties  and  the  people  on
the ground.

May I also take this opportunity to look into the vision of the PAP.  It  is
to  promote  good  governance,  transparency  and  accountability;   promote
democratic  principles;  strengthen  African   democracy;   facilitate   co-
operation and development on the African continent; promote peace,  security
and stability; and, ensure full participation of  all  African  peoples  and
organisations in the development of Africa.

We hope that the Pan-African Parliament will also  have  strong  links  with
the   regional   parliaments,   national   parliaments    and    grass-roots
organisations. The Pan-African Parliament will be a forum where  the  voices
of the people can be heard. Article  17  of  the  Constitutive  Act  of  the
African  Union  stipulates  that  the  Pan-African   Parliament   shall   be
established in order to ensure full participation of African  peoples.  This
will deepen democracy and address the aspiration  of  the  African  peoples.
The interest of the people should be prioritised.

Civil society's participation in the accountability mechanism  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament is very important. This will enable  parliamentarians  to
engage with  communities  in  order  to  ascertain  the  problems  that  the
communities  are  experiencing.  The  Pan-African  Parliament  should   also
consider the issue of instability within national parliaments as this  could
hamper its functioning.

There are also other issues that are facing the continent that  need  to  be
addressed by the PAP, such as reducing poverty in Africa,  budgeting  issues
and HIV/Aids.  Nepad  is  also  aimed  at  promoting  democracy,  peace  and
development in the continent. These include reducing  the  poverty  gap  and
attaining sustainable economic growth.

One of the roles the Pan-African Parliament could play in  relation  to  the
Peer Review Mechanism would be to provide members with the tools to  measure
performance in their own countries as part of the oversight  function.  This
would also promote greater unity and solidarity  between  African  countries
and the people of Africa.

The Peer Review is a product of Nepad and the first of its  kind.  The  Peer
Review Mechanism is voluntary. So it  means  that  those  members  who  will
serve on the PAP will try and find measures to popularise  the  Peer  Review
Mechanism.

Lastly,  I  would  just  like  to  touch  on  mandates,  accountability  and
reporting. We know that article 6 of  the  protocol  states  that  the  Pan-
African parliamentarians shall vote in their personal capacity,  as  one  of
our colleagues has rightly said. However, we will appeal  to  our  delegates
to keep in mind that the PAP represents  respective  parliaments.  For  this
reason, they should be accountable for the position they take  in  the  PAP.
Remember to come back to us, to this Parliament  and  to  your  parties  for
your mandates.

The IFP wishes all our delegation well in the  first  inaugural  session  of
the PAP in Addis Ababa next month. Thank you. [Applause.]

speech follows.)

Mrs S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President,  let  me
start by saying that the ANC was not mistaken when it said,  "Africa's  time
has come! The sun has risen, let us enjoy it while  we  still  can".  I  say
this because when we said that  this  was  Africa's  century,  we  were  not
dreaming; it was because our actions pointed to that.

Yesterday Mr Jeff Radebe showed us a booklet,  which  shows  the  good  work
done by his department to make sure that reconciliation and  development  of
Africa are  no  longer  a  dream,  but  a  reality.  In  short,  under  this
department, they were able to install telecommunications  in  Lesotho;  they
were able to help with the electricity in Malawi, Angola  and  Namibia,  and
to clean and safeguard the storage of gas in Botswana.

This is only the beginning; much is still going to  be  done,  because  this
was done by one institution only, namely Eskom. We have not  yet  looked  at
other projects that all departments of government want to do this  year.  We
thank the leadership of Mr Radebe for the good work that he has done.
Today here in South Africa we have neighbouring countries. We  have  started
to do well for them, unlike our predecessors. You will all remember that  in
the past our neighbouring countries did not have peace because of our  South
African government. It was against good things, against the  development  of
Africans, and ensured that those countries remained poor by  punishing  them
through segregatory policies.

I say this in an effort to indicate that what used to  happen  in  the  past
will no longer happen. We accept and welcome our neighbours. As the ANC,  we
work together with neighbouring countries to make sure  that  the  lives  of
all people are bettered, and that there is development in the SADC region.

The needs of all people in the world  are  the  same;  regardless  of  one's
colour, or regardless of whether one is ugly  or  beautiful.  The  right  to
elect the government and to belong to any political party is  one  of  them.
The right to get support from one's government for children to  be  able  to
go to school; to get treatment when one feels sick and  to  get  employment,
is what all people need. All people want to be  free  and  to  be  happy  in
their  own  countries,  without  fear,  and  to  have  peace  in  their  own
countries. This is a right for all our people. And this is what the  African
Union stands for.

In July 2002 we saw this baby being born in Durban. Today we say  this  baby
has grown. Hence it is nursed; and hence Parliament has  to  carry  out  its
responsibilities. When we look at this Parliament, we realise that it  plays
a very important role, and it has to  know  that  all  African  people  work
together and that they support each other.

We also realise that it is  very  important  to  safeguard  and  defend  our
neighbouring  countries,  not  forgetting   to   respect   our   boundaries.
Development and proper governance are what we  need  on  our  continent.  We
believe that this Parliament will make sure that all  that  is  implemented.
We know that our laws are not the same, but members who  have  been  elected
to Parliament will make sure that our laws as different countries agree,  so
that we can be able to work together and be on the same level.

Secondly, we will try our best as members of Parliament to  make  sure  that
our community plays a role in governance. We have elected  members,  as  the
Parliament of South Africa. Now what we have to do is  to  support  them  so
that they will be able to do their job properly.

In conclusion, I would like to thank Madam Speaker and Madam Deputy  Speaker
for the good job that they have done so far. They supported us,  and  showed
us the way during our term. I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  opposition
parties for their good work and for the way they worked well  with  us  when
we were holding these deliberations in preparation for this Parliament,  and
in enabling us to accept the agreements that we reached.

I would like to thank Mr Eglin for his contribution. In Sepedi  there  is  a
saying that parents should teach their children what they know so that  they
will be able to survive once the parents die. That is what I will  ask  from
Mr Eglin because the vast knowledge that he showed  during  our  discussions
is what Democratic Alliance members could learn from him. I also  thank  him
for his realisation that a political party should  build  instead  of  being
destructive.

I also thank Professor Ngubane for her work and for what  she  said,  namely
that what is  left  for  them  is  that  when  they  work  together  in  the
Parliament of South Africa they will be able to show  other  countries  that
women can also lead and develop a country.

I thank Mr Geldenhuys and hope that what he contributed will  also  be  used
when we discuss this issue again, when we  can  make  better  use  of  these
ideas of establishing the African Union.

I also thank other speakers for what they said, especially  Advocate  Madasa
and Mr Aucamp. In Africa we do not care about the number of  representatives
in Parliament, but what is important  is  that  if  you  treat  people  with
respect, they will also do that in return. [Applause.] I believe that if  we
are on good terms here in Parliament, we will be able to be  an  example  to
Africa through the way we treat  each  other  as  South  Africans.  We  need
peace,  and  we  love  peace.  We  want  to  go  forward.  Africa  is  back!
[Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

     CONSIDERATION OF ELEVENTH REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON AFRICAN UNION

There was no debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:
  That the report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

           NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SECOND AMENDMENT BILL
                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,
Deputy President and hon members, today Parliament will be passing the  last
of a long list  of  pieces  of  environmental  legislation  that  Parliament
considered over the past 10 years.  I  must  say  that  having  passed  this
legislation, I am completely satisfied in my own mind that  this  Parliament
has been true to our Bill of Rights, which requires the  protection  of  the
environment and which grants citizens  the  right  to  a  clean  and  decent
environment, and  future  generations  the  right  to  inherit  a  protected
environment. In a short space of 10 years, we are now  a  country  that  has
environmental legislation that is more advanced than that of many of what  I
refer to as "advanced democracies".

The piece of legislation before the House  today  deals  with  environmental
impact assessments. This is a matter that was first dealt with in 1989  with
the  passing  of  the  Environment  Conservation  Act.  However,   the   EIA
provisions  were  never  implemented.  It  was  only  in   1997,   when   my
predecessor, the then Minister for Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  hon
Pallo Jordan, passed the EIA regulations that this became law.

Over the past six years a very,  very  large  number  of  developments  were
subjected  to  environmental  impact  assessments  -  all  sorts  of  local,
provincial and national developments.  An  environmental  impact  assessment
basically requires assessment as to whether the impact that any  development
has on  the  environment  is  justified,  taking  into  account  social  and
economic needs and the need to protect the environment.

In every case provinces and national Government  implemented  this,  I  must
say, with a great deal of diligence. But, of course, in  many  ways  it  was
experimental. What we found was that after a number of years  of  practising
the EIA regime, a need  arose  for  us  to  tweak  and  improve  the  system
somewhat.  Just  to  give  you  an  example:  If  a  cellphone  provider  is
constructing a cellphone mast on the top of Table Mountain and  another  one
in the centre of the city, do both jobs require exactly  the  same  kind  of
environmental requirements?

The  law,  as  it  stands  now,  requires  rigorous   environmental   impact
assessments for both, and obviously this  does  not  make  sense.  What  the
amendment now does is that it allows for a situation in which,  for  certain
categories of development, EIA requirements may  apply  only  in  particular
geographical areas but not in others. It also provides for a  more  detailed
list of  EIAs  and  different  categories  of  EIAs  that  may  have  to  be
conducted. Some developments may need a more detailed  EIA  and  others  may
require a less detailed EIA.

One of the challenges we found was that provinces end  up  with    thousands
and thousands of EIA applications. Often provinces do not have the  capacity
to process these in good time or to process them adequately.  Therefore  the
Bill now provides and allows for cost recovery, that is the  developer  that
is applying for EIA permission could be charged a certain level  of  fee  in
order to allow for  provinces,  in  particular,  to  be  able  to  fund  the
capacity that is needed to process these EIAs.

Of course, one of the things that has happened over the past  six  years  is
that a  whole  category  of  environmental  practitioners  or  environmental
professionals has emerged in this country, that is people who  do  the  EIAs
for developers. This profession has never  been  properly  regulated.  There
hasn't been registration or certification of EIA  practitioners,  and  often
developers have found fly-by-night people who do not  give  them  value  for
money and provide them with a proper service.

For the first time now, it will be possible for environmental  practitioners
to become more professional because there  will  now  be  certification  and
registration of practitioners. This will also allow Government to  introduce
proper transformation measures.  Many  of  the  environmental  practitioners
that we have now come from the white community and we do not  have  an  even
spread across the racial groups in South Africa.

Finally, this piece of legislation provides for  various  kinds  of  penalty
procedures  for  dealing  with  contraventions  of   the   regulations   and
legislation.

I want to thank the hon Gwen Mahlangu and the  portfolio  committee  members
for having done a  great  deal  of  hard  work  to  process  this  piece  of
legislation and various other pieces of legislation.  I  should  also  thank
the Leader of Government Business for having  allowed  for  this  and  other
pieces of legislation to be  introduced,  even  at  this  eleventh  hour  in
Parliament.

In fact, there are two important pieces of legislation that, thanks  to  the
suspension of certain Rules by Parliament, are still on the  table.  One  is
the National Environmental Management: Air Quality  Bill  that  has  already
been processed by the National Council  of  Provinces.  The  new  Parliament
will continue processing legislation from where the portfolio committee  has
left off at this point in time. The  portfolio  committee  conducted  public
hearings and it was quite clear that certain improvements  to  the  National
Environmental Management: Air Quality Bill were necessary.

There  is  also  the  National  Environmental  Management:  Protected  Areas
Amendment Bill, which is before Parliament. Of course, it won't be  possible
to deal with  it  by  tomorrow  morning,  Deputy  President.  The  portfolio
committee has decided that that Bill will stand over. So I  want  to  really
express my gratitude. I think that only a few people know the extent of  the
hard work that this portfolio committee has put in. And I must  say  to  hon
Colin Eglin, that where he talks about executive dominance,  in  my  case  I
think it has been portfolio  committee  dominance.  They  change  everything
that I bring to them. Thank you, very much. [Applause.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I want to  dedicate  my
speech to the late ANC Whip of this committee  -  the  late  Comrade  Ntombi
Shope. The late Comrade Ntombi was committed and dedicated to her work.  Her
contribution to our freedom will be missed. She still had so many plans  for
her country. She led with the same  commitment  as  she  did  as  a  student
activist, as a UDF leader and Federation of South African Women organiser.

Robala ka kagiso moeteledipele. Re tsamaya mo motlhaleng wa gago.  [Legofi.]
[Rest  in  peace,  our  leader.  We  are  following   in   your   footsteps.
[Applause.]]

At his inauguration in Pretoria, almost  10  years  ago,  President  Mandela
said:


  Today all of us do by our presence here, and by our celebration in  other
  parts of our country and the world, confer  glory  and  hope  to  newborn
  liberty. Out of the experience of an extraordinary  human  disaster  that
  lasted too long, must be born a society of which  all  humanity  will  be
  proud. Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an  actual
  South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief  in  justice,
  strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul  and  sustain
  all our hopes for a glorious life for all.

Indeed Comrade Rholihlahla Mandela the tide has turned and  the  future  for
all South Africans is brighter today than ever  before.  Commenting  on  the
extraordinary story of South Africa, President Mbeki, amongst  other  things
said:


  As we campaign  for  the  democratic  renewal  of  our  mandate  and  the
  consolidation of a people's contract, we must continue to tell the  truth
  about yesterday, today and tomorrow in a fair  and  balanced  way  as  we
  pursue our quest to build a better life for all.

Yes, we must tell the truth. We must mention that today we boast  of  having
the third cleanest tap water in the world. We must tell the  truth  that  we
are proud of having the world's most  progressive  democratic  Constitution.
We are the world's fastest growing tourism destination. We  are  the  second
largest exporter of fruit in the world. We boast  of  having  403  protected
areas. Today we have two environmental  courts,  one  in  Hermanus  and  the
other one, launched two days ago, in Port Elizabeth.  [Applause.]  The  list
is long, ladies and gentlemen. Long live the ANC-led Government!

Indeed no one can deny the fact that the environment was  hardly  a  concern
for Government before  1994.  Conservation,  specifically  nature  reserves,
received attention, but the importance of broader environmental  issues  was
never focused on. South Africa's Constitution is  widely  acclaimed  as  the
finest liberal democratic Constitution in the world. The  right  to  a  safe
and  harmless  environment  is  enshrined  in  this  Constitution.  This  is
something no one would have dreamt of before the democratic dispensation.

It became very clear that  to  give  proper  meaning  and  effectiveness  to
section 24, we had to do away with backward environmental legislation.  That
is why we changed so many things. This legislation was  viewed  at  best  as
being incomplete, ineffective and  fragmented.  It  was  in  1995  that  the
consultative national environmental policy process  was  launched.  For  the
first time, South Africans came forward with ideas on how  to  preserve  the
environment for generations to come. It was barely a  year  since  democracy
was ushered in, yet the nation was called upon to exercise their  democratic
rights to speak out on issues affecting them.

To this day, this policy development process is regarded  as  being  one  of
the most participatory national  policy  development  processes  experienced
both locally and internationally. The end result of the workshop,  seminars,
hearings and debates to  this  consultative  process  led  to  the  National
Environmental Management Act, that we are  amending  today.  Before  we  can
measure how far we have come in the first 10 years of freedom in building  a
safe and healthy environment, we must acknowledge where we started and  what
we inherited.

A quick story about how South Africa was targeted as a  dumping  ground  for
world toxic waste may be a good way of setting  the  scene.  In  the  1980s,
various industries in South Africa were either considering  or  implementing
plans to import large quantities  of  toxic  waste  into  South  Africa.  An
example is the vast stockpiles of extremely toxic mercury in Cato  Ridge  in
KwaZulu-Natal by Thor Chemicals. Workers were poisoned and  the  surrounding
areas contaminated. Other companies wanted to build massive incinerators  on
the West Coast, where they planned to burn thousands  of  tons  of  imported
toxic waste nobody else in the world wanted.

Many South African patriots were not  going  to  let  our  country  and  its
people become the world's dumping ground. With  the  support  of  the  anti-
apartheid  movement's  public  protest  against  toxic   waste   importation
mounting, perhaps also sensing the winds of political change, the  apartheid
regime in 1990 publicly announced the banning of all  toxic  waste  imports.
This story is but one example of  the  environmental  injustices  meted  out
against the South African people by various industries and parastatals  with
the tacit or even explicit support of the apartheid government.

Today we say, gone are the days when South Africans  would  be  poisoned  by
pollution without recourse. Not only do we have  good  legislation,  but  we
now also guarantee implementation and enforcement for the  first  time.  The
department now has specialised regulatory  service  provision,  including  a
well-resourced and highly skilled enforcement unit  -  the  so-called  Green
Scorpions.

In 1997, the EIA  regulations  were  passed  in  terms  of  the  Environment
Conservation Act of 1989. These regulations  required  environmental  impact
assessments for listed activities. These regulations have  been  implemented
for six years. During this period, we have built on experience, to  such  an
extent that we are now able to identify  the  problem  areas  and  fine-tune
them to ensure that we enter the next 10 years of  freedom  with  confidence
that we are doing well at  ensuring  compliance  with  the  constitutionally
entrenched environmental rights.

As a responsible member of the global community, South Africa is  an  active
party to numerous multilateral  environmental  agreements  and  conventions,
dealing with pollution and waste. As such, South  Africa  has  been  at  the
forefront of efforts to protect our ozone  layer,  working  to  prevent  the
dumping of toxic waste on the poor or powerless, working to mitigate  global
climate change and removing persistent organic pollutants from  society.  As
we celebrate our achievements in a decade of transformation -  one  that  is
restoring the dignity of all South Africans, particularly black people -  we
are proud to do so, using our resources sustainably.  This  earth,  lent  to
us, must be preserved for generations and generations to come.

Let me thank members of the portfolio committee. It has  been  a  very  good
period that I spent with you - a period where I learnt a lot and was in  the
driving seat  to  members  who  are  experienced  academics  but  who,  with
patience, allowed me to lead them. I want to  single  out  two  members  who
won't be with us in the portfolio  committee  and  Parliament.  Firstly,  Mr
Moorcroft. I have never seen a person coming from the opposition putting  so
much effort into working with the ruling party  putting  the  nation  before
everything else. I want us to give him a big hand. [Applause.]

I also want to thank a young man who is leaving us,  a  trade  unionist,  an
organiser, a man who helped organise the franchise  action  council.  He  is
one of the  principal  founders  of  the  South  African  Coloured  People's
Congress and one of the treason trialists jailed in 1960  during  the  state
of emergency. He was jailed again in 1961 for helping to  organise  the  May
1957 stay-at-home strike. He fled the country like all other  good  men  and
women did when pressure was on them. While in  exile,  he  served  as  chief
representative of the ANC for Western Europe: a disciplinarian,  a  believer
in close supervision, a comrade who is loved and respected by many,  a  true
patriot of his country, a mentor, a father, a comrade and a friend.  He  now
wishes to be excused from active politics. He has done  a  very,  very  good
job. He has run a very good race and he did that with excellence - and  that
person is Reggie September. [Applause.]

Uncle Reg, you know that we have not disappointed our people. We were  there
for them. We listened and made  necessary  interventions  on  their  behalf.
Above  all,  we  dealt  with  the  department  and  Ministry  that  saw  our
intervention for what it was and not as interference.

Ours is a success story. And I am proud to be associated with this  success.
I would have mentioned if Wilhelm said he was leaving.  I  met  him  at  the
last portfolio committee meeting. He told me that he is still  so  energetic
and that he still wants to serve Parliament.  But  if  he  has  changed  his
mind, I would like to wish him well also. So I am very sorry that I did  not
hear about it. I hope that you still want to come and serve. The  experience
that you have gathered over the years would help the new Parliament as  soon
as it is constituted. I want to take a moment, Minister,  to  say  that  you
did what you could do. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Madam Deputy Speaker, I should like to thank the hon  Gwen
for her very generous tribute to me. Coming from you, Gwen, that was  praise
indeed. Thank you.

The Bill before us seeks to bring the  regulation  of  environmental  impact
assessments and related management tools under the control of  the  National
Environmental Management Act or Nema,  rather  than  under  the  Environment
Conservation Act where such regulations currently reside.

The rationale behind this change can be found in Chapter 5  of  Nema,  which
establishes a new framework for environmental  impact  management.  It  then
follows that the entire responsibility for EIAs fits  more  comfortably  and
logically in  Nema.  This  change  has  also  provided  the  opportunity  to
introduce  long-needed  amendments,  providing   a   range   of   necessary,
integrated management tools.

In addition, the  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for,  firstly,  the  listing  of
activities that require an  environmental  authorisation;  it  provides  for
offences when listed activities are undertaken without, or in  contradiction
to,  authorisation;  it  requires  the  registration  of   associations   of
environmental assessment practitioners; and, it requires cost  recovery  for
services delivered by competent authorities.

The DA welcomes this attempt to make the regulation and functioning of  EIAs
more effective, and we support the Bill. For some time now, there  has  been
a growing realisation that EIAs have not been functioning as  well  as  they
should. This  has  been  illustrated  by  the  growing  number  of  scandals
involving the building of golfing estates and  other  similar  multimillion-
rand developments in environmentally  sensitive  areas.  These  developments
have been  vigorously  opposed  by  environmentalists,  but,  despite  their
justifiable objections, the developments have gone ahead regardless.

There is a strong suspicion that there is a  sleaze  factor  at  work  which
involves not only corrupt  politicians,  but  also  compliant  EIA  agencies
which are either unwilling or unable to operate  effectively.  It  is  hoped
that these amendments will go a long way towards  improving  the  situation,
hence our support for the measures.

As the hon Gwen mentioned, after having served as  a  member  of  Parliament
for 22 years I shall not be returning to the new  Parliament.  So,  this  is
then my swan song. There was an ancient belief that swans sang  before  they
died. Hence, the expression which is applied to the situations such  as  the
one I now find myself in. I'm also aware of  another  related  saying  which
goes something like this: "Swans sing before they die - 'twere no bad  thing
should certain persons die before they sing." I  hope  that  that  does  not
apply to me.

Madam Speaker, then allow me please to say some thank  yous  before  I  step
down. Being a member of Parliament is a huge privilege and  I  have  enjoyed
my years in this place immensely. What I have enjoyed more than anything  is
the friendship and camaraderie, which I have experienced from colleagues  in
all parties in this honourable House. My thanks go to all hon  members  with
whom I have had dealings. My particular thanks go to the hon  Minister  who,
regretfully, is also leaving us.

In the past this Ministry was all too often regarded as a bit of a joke  and
a pasture where good old boys could be rewarded and put out to  graze.  You,
Mr Minister, changed all that, and I congratulate  you  on  the  success  of
your term of office. [Applause.] I  do  not  know,  Mr  Minister,  what  new
pasture you will be grazing in when you leave Parliament, but I  trust  that
it will be green and pleasant.

To the chairperson of our portfolio committee, the  hon  Gwen  Mahlangu,  my
thanks go to you for the exemplary way you have  conducted  the  affairs  of
the committee. Our meetings were a joy to attend, because we  did  our  work
and we did it properly in a very pleasant atmosphere. My thanks  go  to  you
and to all members of the committee. [Applause.]

Lastly, and most importantly, to my own leader and  members  of  my  caucus,
thank you for your unwavering support and  friendship.  This  was  the  best
caucus it has ever been my privilege to serve in. I wish you luck and  every
success in the new Parliament. You deserve it;  South  Africa  deserves  it.
May your labours be blessed. Ungadinwa nangomso. [Keep it up.] [Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, the IFP  rises  in  support
of the National Environmental Management  Second  Amendment  Bill.  I  would
like to begin my speech with a proverb, which goes  like  this:  We  do  not
inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it  from  our  children.  How
true that is. So we have to constantly remind  ourselves  of  this  and  the
special environmental attributes of our country. In  other  words,  we  need
the amendment to Nema to enable effective implementation.
At the core of the  Bill  is  the  streamlining  of  the  EIA  process,  the
registration of environmental assessment practitioners and cost recovery.

I  would  like  to  highlight  the  fact  that  the  right   to   meaningful
participation is  contained  in  Chapter  1,  section  2.  This  allows  for
dialogue with  the  communities  who  very  often  don't  know  about  their
environmental rights and environmental justice. There is just  one  concern,
which is that of monitoring. Too often  monitoring  has  simply  become  lip
service. So, hon Minister, if we are serious about monitoring, then  it  has
to be done. It has to be done.

I would like to go back to the proverb I referred to at the beginning of  my
speech  -  we  have  borrowed  the  land  from  our  children.  Terms   like
"sustainable development"  and  "environmentally  productive  economy"  will
simply be words if we don't enforce and implement our policies.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank  our  hon  Minister  for  his
excellent leadership and for steering the department forward.  We  wish  you
well in your endeavours and my advice, Mr Minister, is to go  with  a  green
heart wherever you go and to enjoy the green pastures.

I would also like to acknowledge the  role  that  has  been  played  by  our
chairperson, Ms Gwen Mahlangu. She has been extremely  competent.  We  thank
her for the sterling work she has done.

The IFP supports the Bill. There is no greater challenge than  adding  value
to our EIA process. There is no doubt that  this  Bill  will  definitely  do
just that. I thank you. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Sekela-Somlomo namalungu  ale  Ndlu  ihloniphekileyo,  thina
maXhosa asibuthandi ubukhwange. Ngoko ke andinakumosha mazwi  am,  ndiphinde
okuthethwe nguMphathiswa nangusihlalo wale komiti.

Ewe, kambe  nto  kaMoorcroft  ndiyabulela.  Ndibulela  nokuteketa  isiXhosa.
Kakade usuk' emaXhoseni. Andazi ukuba kutheni ube  ulahleka  uthetha  ezinye
iilwimi. [Kwahlekwa.]  Enkosi,  mntakwethu,  sisebenzisene  kakuhle  kakhulu
kule minyaka. Uze uhambe ke uye  ebantwini.  Ungayi  kwabakokwenu  qha,  uye
ebantwini. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Ndifuna kwatanci ukubamba ngazibini kuMphathiswa wesebe eli,  into  kaMoosa,
uValli,   ndithi   kuye:    Amaqobokazana    angalal'    endleleni    yazini
kunyembelekile. Oko ndikutsho egameni lekomiti le  yethu  yesebe,  ngendlela
ubudlelwane  bethu  obebuncuthu  mazangwanga  ngayo   ngalo   lonke   ixesha
lentsebenziswano nokusebenza phakathi kwethu naye, neofisi yakhe nesebe  eli
liphela. Maz' enethole, nto kaMoosa!

Egameni lekomiti, nakubeni  ndingathunywanga,  mandilitsolise  ndithi  kuwe,
ubusisiquququ, umabizwasabele kuzo zonke iindawo ebezifuna iingcebiso  zakho
kwezendalo nokhenketho.  Akukho  mntu  ungakwaziyo  kweli,  ubonakala  mihla
nezolo koomabonakude.

Kumnandi ke Sihlalo,  namalungu  ale  Ndlu  ahloniphekileyo,  ukuba  ndazise
kwasentloko ukuba kulaa  komiti  yethu  yezeNdalo  noKhenketho  senze  ukuba
indalo  ibe  ngumhlobo   womntu   wonke,   nokuba   ungowaliphi   na   iqela
lezopolitiko. Yiyo loo nto kuyo yonke imiba  yokusebenza  kwethu  bekungekho
mpikiswano nakruthakruthano. Indalo ingqonge thina sonke. Bekungekho  calulo
ngokweqela lezopolitiko.  Kananjalo,  abakhenkethi  abeza  kuMzantsi  Afrika
abezi kwiqela elithile kuphela labemi beli. Beza kubo bonke abantu beli.

Kwakhona, malungu ahloniphekileyo, sikhahlela  ngazo  zozibini  kuMphathiswa
weSebe  lezeNdalo  noKhenketho  ngokuletsheza  okombane  ukusebenza   athobe
izibilini,  amavalo  namaxhala,  nehayi-hayi  kuluntu  lwamaMpondo  asempuma
kwiMpuma   Koloni   ngethuba   beluphantsi   kwesithwakumbe   sokugunyaziswa
kwenkampani   yase-Australia   ukuba   imbe   umgodi    weTitanium    kwelo.
Ibikukhathaza le nto, mntakaMoorcroft. Ngenxa  yokuba  uRhulumente  lo  neli
Sebe lezeNdalo  noKhenketho  benobugqi  bamanyange  ekusebenziseni  umthetho
ebesisandul' ukuwuphumeza kule Palamente, usebenzise wona ke uMphathiswa  lo
ukubhengeza loo  mmandla  njengokhuselekileyo,  kwaba  ngolo  hlobo  indalo,
abantu nezilwanyana ziyakhuseleka.

Ukusekwa  komgodi   weTitanium   kwelamaMpondo,   malungu   ahloniphekileyo,
ngaphandle kwamathandabuzo bekuza kuyitshitshisa tu  indalo  kulaa  mmandla,
kwaye nabantu balapho bebeyibona inobuzaza le nto  kodwa  bebotshwe  izandla
neenyawo  ngento   abanokuyenza.   Ngaphandle   kwamathandabuzo,   amaMpondo
ayakhahlela ngesi senzo. Nathi ngokunjalo sizeka mzekweni. Yiba  nomfanekiso
wovuyo namatshamba kubantu ababesele bequle  baligangatha  belinde  loo  ma-
Australia  ebeze  kunyiba  ubutyebi  babo.  Yiyo   loo   nto   ke,   malungu
ahloniphekileyo, sinecandelo 24(2)(a) ukuya  ku-(d)  kulo  Mthetho  uYilwayo
uphantsi kwengqwalasela  ngoku,  apho  kwenziwa  isibonelelo  sokugunyaziswa
kwayo yonke imisebenzi yokusingqongileyo ekufuneka  yenziwe.  Esi  sisixhobo
sokuncedisa abahlali ukuba bayiqonde yaye bayibone njengomhlobo indalo.

Kula  macandelo  kukwakho  nogxininiso  kwintsebenzo  efezekileyo   njengoko
iligunya  elifezekisiweyo  kuphela  elinakho   ukunika   ugunyaziso   lwaloo
misebenzi okanye emakwenziwe.  Kanti  njengoRhulumente  wesininzi,  asivulli
nje zibhuqe okanye ngelinye icala sibe nguzwilakhe. Inkongo iphinde  yavulwa
yokuba  xa  unganeliswanga  sisigqibo  esenziwe  ligunya   eli,   walathiswe
kwabangentla onokubhena kubo.

Lo Mthetho uYilwayo ukhuthaza abantu bakuthi ukuba  bakuthobele  okuqulethwe
kuwo.  Kungoko  onke  amagatya  alo  Mthetho  uYilwayo  elungiselelwe  bona.
Kwakhona,    unezibonelelo    ezibuhlungu    zolohlwayo    oluqatha    kwabo
bangooDingezweni  abenza  unothanda  bechasene  nezibonelelo  zalo   Mthetho
uYilwayo wakube umiselwe njongomthetho.

Njengoko sisiya kunyulo, sinethemba lokuba ugalelebhayini  uza  kubaqokelela
aqulathe zonke  iindidi  zabantu,  kuquka  amagqirha  namagqwirha.  Masiyeni
ebantwini, mawethu, sikhangele  ukuba  bathini  na  ngesithe  sakwenza  kule
minyaka ilishumi sinabo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  speech
follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Deputy Speaker and the honorable members of this House,  we
Xhosa people do not like repetition. Therefore I will  not  waste  my  words
and repeat what the Minister and the  chairperson  of  this  committee  have
already said.

By the way, Mr Moorcroft, I must thank  you.  Thanks  for  trying  to  speak
isiXhosa. You  are  from  a  Xhosa-speaking  community  anyway.   I  do  not
understand why you have to bother  yourself  by  speaking  other  languages.
[Laughter.] Thanks my brother, we have worked very well together during  all
these years. Now you should go to the people, not only your  relatives,  but
also to all the other people. [Applause.]

I want firstly to thank the Minister of this department, Mr Valli Moosa,  to
whom I say: He deserves a round of applause. That I say  on  behalf  of  our
portfolio committee, about how beautiful our working relationship  has  been
with his office and himself including the whole department. Mr Moosa,  thank
you very much.

On behalf of the portfolio committee, even though they did  not  ask  me  to
say that, you have been a very diligent person, you  were  always  there  to
give advice on nature and  tourism  issues.  Everybody  knows  you  in  this
country, since you are always on TV.

It is my pleasure then, Chairperson, and  the  members  of  this  House,  to
announce that, through our Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs  and
Tourism, we have managed to make nature everybody's  friend,  regardless  of
your party-political affiliation. That is why while we were  working,  there
were no arguments and quarrels. The environment surrounds all. There was  no
discrimination about political affiliation. And because  when  the  tourists
come to visit South Africa, they do not only come  to  a  certain  group  of
people. They come to all the people of this country.

Again, hon  members,  we  sincerely  thank  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism for working tirelessly and managing  to  calm  down  the
Mpondo community of the  Eastern  Cape  who  were  otherwise  panicking  and
worried, when a certain Australian company was  authorised  to  establish  a
titanium mine  there.  This  obviously  was  troubling  you,  Mr  Moorcroft.
Because  the  Government  together  with  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism are excellent in implementing  the  law  that  was  just
passed by this Parliament, this is the law that was used by the Minister  to
declare this area safe and that is  how  the  environment,  people  and  the
animals were protected.
The establishment of a titanium  mine  in  Phondoland,  hon  members,  would
definitely destroy the environment in that area; even  the  community  there
anticipated this, could  not  do  anything.  Therefore,  without  doubt  the
Mpondo people are thankful  about  this  gesture.  We  would  also  like  to
express our gratitude.

You can imagine the joy and happiness among those who were  initially  angry
and ready to fight those Australians who were feared to have come  to  steal
their wealth. That is why now we have section 24(2)(a) to (d)  in  this  new
Bill of which part is going to authorise and  cater  for  all  environmental
projects that need to be done. This is an instrument that  will  assist  the
communities to understand and see the environment once again as a friend.

In these sections there is also emphasis on  complete  commitment  to  work,
since it is only through official mandate that those projects could be  run.
Furthermore as the democratic Government,  we  are  neither  submissive  nor
autocratic. You are always welcome to complain  about  your  dissatisfaction
about decisions taken, to the ultimate authorities that  you  can  lodge  it
with.

This Bill encourages our people to abide by its contents. That  is  why  all
clauses of this Bill are specially drafted  for  them.   There  are  serious
sections within it, which prescribe severe punishment for the  transgressors
and those who deliberately disobey its contents, after it is passed as law.

As we approach elections, we hope that  the  ANC  will  collect  everybody's
vote including witchdoctors, witches and wizards. Let us go  to  the  people
and listen to what they have  to  say  about  us  in  the  last  ten  years.
[Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Thank  you  very  much,
Prof Mbadi. Thanks once again to the portfolio  committee  and  the  parties
that have once again supported this Bill. I don't know what's  happening  to
this  portfolio  committee,  because  I  too  will  not  be   returning   to
Parliament. However, this is not because, as it has been said in the  media,
I am retiring. I have absolutely no intention whatsoever of retiring.

I have been an active member of the ANC for  a  very,  very  long  time.  In
fact, it is interesting that I am  stepping  down  from  Parliament  on  the
occasion of the tenth anniversary of  the  democratic  republic  because  my
very first act of active participation in the struggle was on  the  occasion
of the tenth anniversary of the apartheid republic,  in  1971.  I  was  then
truly green, a high school boy. They told us to raise the apartheid flag  at
every school, and assemble and sing  the  apartheid  anthem,  Die  Stem.  Of
course, in many of the schools all hell broke loose. As  I  said,  that  was
really my first act of active participation.

I'm not retiring, because the process of  change  in  this  country  is  one
which takes place from many, many vantage points, and that's the reason  the
ANC talks about "a people's contract for change". Parliament  is  one  arena
of change. Parliament is one arena in which development  cadres  and  change
agents are based.  But  Parliament  on  its  own  cannot  change  everything
without the active participation of people from all walks of life.

Out there in the sporting fields, religious leaders,  people  in  the  rural
communities, young people, students, the judiciary and,  of  course,  people
in the private sector - everybody has a role to play  if  we  are  truly  to
change this country, and I am not retiring from that. I will remain a  loyal
member of the ANC. That's my life, and that will remain my life.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

think we are passing the amendments and not the Bill as a whole.  These  are
bits of legislation that  have  come  back  from  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. If we're going to vote on the Bill, some of these amendments  the

they come back from the NCOP.  Could  you  just  clarify  that,  please,  Mr
Chairman?

2.     Report  of  the  Portfolio  Committee   on   Finance   on   Financial
     Administration of Parliament, dated 26 February 2004:


         With reference  to  the  resolution  passed  by  the  House  on  23
         September 2003, namely that  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance
         "consider  the  subject  of   the   financial   administration   of
         Parliament with a view to  introducing  a  bill  dealing  with  the
         matter, in accordance  with  the  Assembly  Rules",  the  Committee
         wishes to report as follows:


              Due to the Committee's heavy legislative workload  during  the
              fourth quarter of 2003 and the  first  quarter  of  2004,  the
              Committee was unable to give due consideration to this matter.
              The Committee therefore wishes to recommend to the House  that
              this  matter  stands  over  for  consideration  by   the   new
              Parliament.


     Report to be considered.
