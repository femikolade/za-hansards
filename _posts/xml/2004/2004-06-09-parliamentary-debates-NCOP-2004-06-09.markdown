                              NOTICE OF MOTION

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!  Hon  members,  please  note  that  your
voting cards must be inserted into the screens before you,  so  that  we  do
not have a difficulty  when  you  speak  for  the  operators  to  open  your
microphones. [Interjections.] You don't  have  voting  cards?  You  will  be
issued with voting  cards,  hon  members,  so  that  we  do  not  delay  the
proceedings.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great shock that senior officials  of  the  public  safety
       system have been found to be ``moonlighting'' in order to  make  ends
       meet on their salaries;


  (2) further notes that this came to light after Pretoria  policemen  were
       shot in a robbery while moonlighting as security guards last month;


  (3) acknowledges that this type of conduct is unacceptable and should not
       be allowed to continue; and


  (4) urges the relevant authorities and officials to  take  the  necessary
       steps in order to stamp out this practice and ensure that it does not
       become a common practice.

               CONGRATULATIONS TO BAFANA BAFANA AND ERNIE ELS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the South African National  Soccer  Team,  Bafana  Bafana,
       under new coach Stuart Baxter, defeated Cape  Verde Islands 2-1 in  a
       pulsating but disappointing match  on Saturday, 5 June 2004;


  (2) also notes that the  South  African  golfer  Ernie  Els,  the   ``Big
       Easy'', regained the world No 2 spot, ousting the  Fijian Vijay Singh
       in the process, when he won a prestigious match in the USA during the
       weekend;


  (3) congratulates both Bafana Bafana  and  Ernie  Els  on  their  winning
       performances by which they brought much joy to  the   sports-mad  and
       win-hungry South African nation; and


  (4) further notes that the South  African  Rugby  Springboks,  under  new
       coach Jake White and captain John Smit, have a wonderful  opportunity
       this Saturday to redeem themselves  by conquering the Irish team, the
       Six Nations Champions,  thus  emulating  the  performances  of  their
       compatriots, Bafana Bafana and the irrepressible Ernie Els.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 26 - Agriculture and Vote No 30 - Land Affairs:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! May I take this opportunity  to  welcome
the hon Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs, Minister Didiza. You  are
welcome in this august House, the National Council of Provinces. I  am  sure
this is your maiden speech in this third Parliament.

The MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson. I hope, given that this is my maiden  speech,  the  Chairperson
will be very lenient when it comes to  time,  and  take  into  consideration
that the two debates  have  two  departments  and  individual  budgets,  and
therefore twenty minutes might not  have  been  very  fair.  Nonetheless,  I
welcome the time given by you, Chair.

Madam Chairperson, hon  members  of  the  NCOP,  Members  of  the  Executive
Councils responsible for Agriculture present here  today,  directors-general
and senior officials from the Departments of Land Affairs  and  Agriculture,
Chief Land Claims Commissioner and the regional land  claims  commissioners,
as well as our provincial directors of land  affairs  present  here,  ladies
and gentlemen, as we come  to  our  second  decade  of  freedom,  we  remain
conscious of our responsibility as public representatives.

The April general election has once again affirmed the ANC as  the  people's
party, which is capable of changing their socioeconomic conditions  for  the
better, thereby dealing with the issues of poverty and  underdevelopment  in
our country.

As the representatives of the ANC,  I  want  to  make  the  commitment  that
indeed we will do whatever it takes  to  deliver  on  the  people's  mandate
received in these elections. We will work  diligently  to  ensure  that  the
contract we have entered into with our people in creating work and  fighting
poverty and underdevelopment is achieved.

In the past weeks both departments briefed the select committee on  how  the
previous year's budget was spent. Strategic  plans  for  2004-05  were  also
tabled that took into consideration some of the  adjustments  received  from
our electorate, as articulated in the state of the  nation  address  by  the
President in the National Assembly.

Our ten-year review has highlighted the achievements of the first decade  of
democracy. It  is  important  to  capture  a  few  of  these  without  being
elaborate. The policies of the democratic Government in the  areas  of  land
and agriculture have resulted in a situation where we have changed the  land
ownership patterns in our country and  given  dignity  to  the  majority  of
those who were historically disenfranchised and hope  that  the  possibility
for a better life is real.

It is in part through the processes of land reform that we  have  been  able
to create a new  class  of  producers  that  have  started  to  reflect  the
demographics of our country, thereby  moving  closer  to  deracialising  our
agricultural sector and our country's economy.

It is also true that as we introduce new participants, we  have  also  dealt
with other subtle discriminations,  such  as  gender  stereotyping,  in  our
society. Women have never been regarded as  farmers,  let  alone  successful
ones. Hon members, for us change has meant building something new.  We  have
in the first decade of freedom  ensured  that  even  established  commercial
producers of our country undergo change in order to become more  competitive
in the domestic and international arena.

In reflecting on some of our successes, it is necessary to  acknowledge  the
role that has been played by provincial governments  and  municipalities  in
ensuring that we can resolve some of the immediate challenges that we  face,
such as poverty. The  support  given  to  municipalities  on  the  commonage
programme  has  meant  that  the  local  government  sphere  can  assist  to
alleviate poverty in their immediate communities by giving  them  access  to
land which they can utilise to supplement their income or  even  subsist  on
it.

The Department of  Agriculture's  Integrated  Food  Security  and  Nutrition
Programme, which has become a social  cluster  priority,  has  been  and  is
aimed at ensuring that we  can  intervene  to  assist  those  who  are  food
insecure, either as a result of natural disasters or any other form of  risk
that has a negative impact on them, including poverty.

It  is  humbling  to  note  that  the  initiatives  undertaken  by   various
municipalities in  the  country  on  matters  of  food  security  have  been
growing. I wish to acknowledge the Nelson  Mandela  Metro  Ploughing  Fields
Project and the Oliver Tambo district,  amongst  other  things,  which  have
worked with the provincial governments and the private sector in  initiating
and promoting urban and communal gardens. This was in order to  assist  poor
and vulnerable communities  produce  food  for  themselves,  while  creating
possibilities for income generation at local level.

Some of the success stories in this regard  are  the  initiatives  taken  in
partnership with provincial departments of agriculture. We have  distributed
production support packages to 37 000 households out of our  50  000  target
that we set for ourselves. We have started,  for  example,  in  the  Limpopo
province to provide poor people with day-old  chicks,  point-of-lay  pullets
and  young  lactating  cows  which,  in  various  combinations,   form   the
agricultural starter pack. These, in turn, produce milk, eggs and  meat  and
in some cases even surplus production, which  enables  people  to  sell  and
obtain income.

In the Eastern Cape  the  Mass  Food  Production  Programme  has  meant  the
consolidation  of  homestead  fields  into  one  big  unit,  for  which  the
Government has provided fencing and contributed to  certain  infrastructure,
such as more irrigation and mechanisation input. The Xoshindlala  initiative
of KwaZulu-Natal has also created the possibility for many  poor  people  to
produce for themselves and thereby deal with issues of food  insecurity.  As
part of our ongoing partnership with civil society and the  private  sector,
we have supported some community groups  involved  in  backyard  gardens  in
Khayelitsha, Guguletu and Nyanga who, through support in the form of  seeds,
have been able to supplement their income while feeding themselves.

Some of these interventions are  an  indication  of  what  our  programmatic
intervention can do to improve the livelihoods  of  our  people.  They  also
create a possibility  for  creating  employment  and  a  meaningful  way  of
attacking poverty. We all know that hunger is one manifestation of  poverty.
We have taken stock of our achievements in the  past  decade,  and  this  is
well  documented  in  our  10-year  review  publication.  It  is,   however,
important to note that the same 10-year review highlighted  some  challenges
that we still face in our land and agrarian reform. These arise out  of  our
own assessment of the impact of our policies and programmes.  For  instance,
for a number of years the land reform budget has been on  the  increase,  in
particular the restitution programme. This has created possibilities for  us
to settle as many as 48  000  claims  in  the  country,  with  a  number  of
hectares of land being delivered to communities.

Of note is the nature of the claims that we have  settled,  particularly  in
the rural areas. Some of these comprise agricultural land,  where  you  have
agricultural enterprises that are viable.  In  certain  areas,  such  as  in
KwaZulu-Natal, there are conservation areas as well as forestry  and  mining
areas. We are conscious of the  challenge  that  this  settlement  posed  to
sustainable development. In response to this the  commission  has  tried  to
ensure that the  necessary  support  after  settlement  is  given  to  these
communities. As we move forward with  this  programme  we  remain  aware  of
these ongoing challenges, and we all agree that if we have  to  succeed  co-
ordination is critical.

The other programmes of land reform,  such  as  redistribution  and  tenure,
have also moved abreast. As you may all  be  aware,  the  reduction  of  the
project cycle has been with us for some  time  now.  In  the  last  term  of
office, if I may say so in this House, there was concern  about  the  length
of time it took to settle claims or even land redistribution programmes.  We
have sought to reduce this.
Government has continued to contribute to  land  reform,  not  only  through
financial resources received out of our budget, but also  with  assets  from
the land that is held by the state. To date,  772  626  hectares  have  been
delivered in terms of the State Land Disposal Programme. These  achievements
reflect  the  commitment  that  Government  has  made  through  our  budget.
However, this  budget  increase  on  land  delivery  has  not  been  matched
adequately  by  the  agricultural   budget,   posing   a   threat   to   the
sustainability of agricultural programmes, as highlighted  in  the  case  of
land  restitution  and  LRAD  specifically.  I'm  sure  hon  members   here,
particularly those who sit in the provincial legislatures,  will  know  that
this is one of the concerns that  the  Departments  of  agriculture  in  the
provinces have raised.

At the same time the weakness of co-ordination  has  been  noted  among  the
various spheres of government and within departments. As representatives  of
provinces in this House, one of the areas we may need to look  into  is  the
extent to which  the  public  land  held  by  municipalities  and  provinces
enables us to change the settlement  patterns  of  our  country.  Obviously,
provinces and municipalities cannot be expected to  address  this  challenge
of the integration of cities alone. This will need  an  integrated  approach
among the various spheres of  government.  Also,  with  little  public  land
assets available, such as land within the  municipalities,  I  think  it  is
possible to ensure that the policy and legislative choices that we  make  at
provincial level and in municipalities  contribute  to  the  integration  of
cities in a meaningful way, so that, indeed, the cost of transport  for  our
rural poor and our urban poor does not become  enormous  because  they  stay
far away from their places of work.

While the challenge of integration is a matter we must  continually  engage,
you will recall that  it  was  in  the  year  2000  that  we  started  in  a
meaningful way to co-ordinate on a project basis, particularly in  the  area
of restitution. Today we can talk with pride when we look at  Payneville  in
Springs,  Gauteng;  the  Port  Elizabeth  Land  and  Community   Restoration
Association; and District Six here in the Western Cape  in  terms  of  which
the housing development programmes are just  some  examples  that  show  the
benefits  of  working  together.  It  is  also  interesting  to  note   that
provincial departments of agriculture, with the limited resources that  they
have, have been able to identify  young  people  in  the  communities  where
restitution has been undertaken and given them bursaries to study,  so  that
they can come back and contribute to the agricultural enterprises that  have
been delivered through restitution in particular.

Land and agrarian reform, as we all  know,  is  a  journey.  Many  strategic
decisions and technical moves have to be made at every  point  in  order  to
succeed. Through the presidential working group an agricultural sector  plan
was developed. This sector plan outlines specific areas  that  all  partners
have committed themselves  to  if  we  are  to  have  a  united,  prosperous
agricultural sector in our country. This, in my view, is already a  people's
contract. This vision  has  given  a  framework  for  collaboration  between
Government on the one hand, and the agricultural unions, on the other.
The strategic plan for the Department of Agriculture, which has been  tabled
in this House in accordance with set Rules, serves as the framework for  the
consideration of Budget Vote 26 which we are debating today.  This  plan  is
derived from a deep understanding of the concerns  and  aspirations  of  the
diverse client base of the Department of Agriculture. It responds, also,  to
the call of action to a people's contract made by the ANC  in  its  election
manifesto.

In the past 10 years of democracy we've put in place a vision of  unity  and
prosperity for this sector that is embraced  by  the  key  stakeholders.  It
creates a policy environment that seeks to boldly enhance participation  and
equity   in   the   agricultural   sector,   enhance   competitiveness   and
profitability  along  the  total  agricultural   chain,   and   ensure   the
sustainable  management  and  use  of  the  scarce  and   precious   natural
agricultural resources, so that, indeed, we  can  start  to  see  successful
black farmers and black agricultural  processors  starting  to  reflect  the
demographics of our country.
The strategic plan for Land Affairs, on the other hand, gives us  a  clearer
picture of what the priorities are  in  the  coming  year.  This  plan  also
accommodates the timeframes for  the  completion  of  restitution.  It  also
takes into consideration the need for focusing  on  the  resolution  of  the
labour tenants' claim, which sadly affects the majority of our  rural,  poor
communities on commercial farms. To this end the  department  has  committed
itself to settle about 10 000 labour-tenants' claims this year in the  areas
of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. The challenge facing us in  the  coming  10
years is to ensure that there is support to land reform beneficiaries  in  a
manner  that  enables  communities  and  individuals  to  use  their  assets
effectively.

Before the end of the previous term this  House  passed  the  Communal  Land
Rights Bill. An implementation plan  is  being  developed  working  together
with the Department of Provincial and  Local  Government.  The  first  phase
will include the land inquiry process supported by  surveying  these  pieces
of land, setting  up  administrative  structures  and  putting  in  place  a
training programme for such  structures  and  communities.  This  will  help
communities to understand how the legislation will be implemented  and  what
the roles of the respective stakeholders are.

Between June 2003 and March  2004  we  have  settled  1  655  black  farmers
through LRAD. Our  experience  of  implementing  LRAD  and  the  restitution
programme over the past 10 years makes it clear that it  is  not  sufficient
to provide prospective farmers with access to land  without  also  providing
government support for production inputs and technical advisory services.

It is on this basis that if  you  see  this  year's  budget  of  agriculture
giving  R210  million  towards  the   comprehensive   agricultural   support
programme, it includes the provision for conditional grants as a  supplement
to budgets of provincial departments of agriculture to improve and  increase
farmer support services. I wish to inform hon members that as Ministers  and
members of the executive council of agriculture we met last year and  agreed
on priorities that we need to fund through this  allocation.  We  have  also
agreed that we are going to have task teams that clearly look at  where  the
money is going to land.

This allocation this financial year will be made  available  to  individuals
and or groups for purposes of  erecting  fences,  iidiphu  [dipping  baths],
infrastructure support for the handling and marketing of  livestock  at  the
same time through the link programme for food security  within  the  context
of the integrated food and nutrition security programme. We shall also  work
with  the  provinces  and  other  national  departments   such   as   Social
Development to ensure the availability of  agricultural  starter  packs  for
poor people.

We already have had success stories in Limpopo where what  the  benefits  of
these starter packs can bring to the poor people are best expressed  in  the
words of one woman who  had  received  18  point-of-lay  chickens.  She  was
speaking to MEC Motsoaledi, when she said:  ``Mphathiswa  wePhondo  sihluthi
ngamaqanda.  Siyawatya  yaye  siyawathengisa  amanye.  Iinkukhu  zakho  nazo
sezizele amantshontsho amaninzi. Ndikulindile ukuba uze  kuthatha  eyakho.''
[Kwaqhwatywa.] [Hon minister of the province, we have a full  complement  of
eggs. We eat and also sell some of them.  Your  chickens  have  hatched  and
there are  a  lot  of  chicks  now.  You  should  come  and  collect  yours.
[Applause.]]

As part of  Government-wide  initiatives  for  creating  work  opportunities
through the Expanded Public Works Programme, we shall  continue  to  support
our land care projects. This year we have committed  R72  million  which  is
targeted at  closing  dongas,  clearing  bush  and  introducing  new  water-
harvesting systems technologies to support poor black  farmers.  Communities
who will be  given  priority  this  year  are  communities  in  Sterkspruit,
Nongoma, the former Transkei and Ciskei and  within  the  rural  development
nodes. We will endeavour to  use  labour  intensive  methods  even  on  this
infrastructure  that   will   be   developed   through   the   comprehensive
agricultural support allocation.

The President in  his  state  of  the  nation  address  announced  that  the
department would have an Agri-BEE framework out for public comment in  July.
I am pleased to confirm that the work is on track to meet this deadline.  In
support of the President's call for closer partnership  between  the  public
and private sectors to develop action plans to help realise the vision of  a
united and prosperous agricultural sector,  South  Africa's  cotton  growers
joined  by  their  input  suppliers,  output  processors  and  the  national
Department of Agriculture, developed a  strategic  plan  for  South  African
cotton growers. We have already moved from  strategy  to  implementation  of
the cotton strategy. Black farmers,  some  of  whom  were  assisted  through
LRAD, are now being assisted to grow cotton on 9 000  ha  of  land  in  four
provinces.

We further welcome the target set  by  the  established  sugar  industry  to
ensure the redistribution of at least 78 000 ha of sugar-producing  land  to
black farmers by 2015 as part of their  contribution  to  the  30%  national
target of redistribution of agricultural  land.  In  KwaZulu-Natal  we  have
already committed, through the land reform budget, R6  million  towards  the
first phase of this programme. I am very pleased that the progress that  has
been  made  by  other  commodity  sectors  in  ensuring  that  they  develop
strategies to contribute towards equity in the agricultural sector in  these
specific industries such as the ostrich industry, the stock owners  and  the
wheat industry,  has  actually  gone  ahead.  It  is  necessary  for  us  to
appreciate that there are still some of  the  industries  that  are  lagging
behind and we hope that they will learn a lesson from  others.  But  through
the Agri-BEE  none  of  the  agricultural  industries  will  run  away  from
transformation; ensuring that  indeed  we  can  build  a  united  prosperous
agricultural sector in the agriculture industry.

I wish to say in this coming  year  there  are  specific  things  concerning
which we make the commitment to you as members that we  will  do.  We  shall
work vigorously to continue the implementation of land reform  and  ensuring
that we can conclude our restitution programme by 2005. We  want  to  ensure
that our land reform programme is in alignment with the  roll  out  of  CASP
and in partnership with the agricultural sector.  The  impact  of  our  land
reform programme must translate into  equity  and  economic  growth  in  the
agricultural sector.

A comprehensive plan for the completion  of  the  remainder  of  restitution
claims would be presented to the forum of the Minmec by the  first  week  of
July this year. Within two months we shall take to Cabinet and  make  public
our agricultural biotechnology policy that is also intended to  add  to  the
scope of opportunity that exists  for  entrepreneurship  and  improving  the
competitiveness of the agricultural sector.

Through the ARC we shall develop a pilot  technology  incubator  system  for
cut flowers by 31 January 2005, which will be used to develop  resource-poor
farmers in rural communities. We shall further train  39  scientists  by  31
December  2004  in  research  for  development  methods  for   resource-poor
farmers. As indicated in the past the financing of agricultural research  is
as much our concern as it is yours. In the next month our  first  intake  of
interns will be completing their time with the  Department  of  Agriculture.
It is interesting to note that out of the 94 interns we took in  last  year,
22 have already found permanent jobs. [Applause.] This year we are going  to
continue with an intake of 152 interns by August. Our experience  points  to
a need to continue this programme of internship and also  to  encourage  all
our partners in the private and the nongovernmental sectors to take  up  the
challenge of exposing our youth  to  their  work  environment.  Through  the
special bursary scheme for surveying, geomatics and  cartography,  57  young
students from the historically disadvantaged communities have  been  awarded
bursaries. During this current year 75 students have been awarded  bursaries
at specific universities.

The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the delivery  of  a  number
of critical regulatory and control  services  aimed  at  ensuring  that  the
country is disease-free with respect to both animal and plant diseases,  and
that we can certify and give the appropriate  assurance  to  facilitate  the
exports of our agricultural produce.
This year we shall be presenting our food  safety  and  traceability  policy
and implementing improved animal disease control measures.  I  am  therefore
pleased to announce that after extensive discussions and  negotiations  with
the SA Police Service and the Airports Company of South Africa  we  are  now
ready to launch a new inspection service at our  ports  of  entry.  We  will
start at the Johannesburg International Airport  by  August  this  year  and
roll out to the other 76 land, sea and airport entries. I hope  hon  members
here are not going to wish to cross to  their  neighbours  in  Swaziland  or
Lesotho with live animals or even meat without  getting  an  export  permit,
because whether you're an MP or not, you shall be arrested. [Laughter.]

The President in his state of the nation  address  announced  that  we  will
establish the agricultural credit scheme in the  Department  of  Agriculture
to provide capital for this sector,  and  that  R1  billion  is  immediately
available to start the agricultural credit scheme. In  August  this  year  I
will make a further announcement on the scheme that we hope  will  stimulate
greater access and  participation  in  the  broadening  of  rural  financial
markets.

Our work  programme  for  this  year  does  indicate  the  need  for  closer
alignment between these  two  departments  whose  budgets  we  are  debating
today. If our land and agrarian reform is to succeed we need to ensure  that
joint planning occurs at an early stage. Our approach to work  as  a  Public
Service will need take into consideration the commitment that our  President
and Government have made to the people of our  country.  Indeed  Batho  Pele
must be a living motto for all us. I  therefore  believe  that  if  we  work
together in a people's contract  with  communities  we  can  indeed  make  a
better life for our people a reality. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, as you are  well  aware,  we  have
combined the two Budget Votes  of  two  departments  here,  namely  that  of
Agriculture and Water Affairs and we only have one speakers'  list.  I  will
therefore ask the secretary to read the second order of  the  day  to  allow
the next department to make a presentation.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy Debate)

Vote No 34 - Water Affairs and Forestry

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Minister Sonjica you are welcomed also  and
you are welcome to this House, as I  have  indicated  to  the  Minister  for
Agriculture. This is your maiden speech in this House  and  we  welcome  you
for that.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND  FORESTRY:  Chairperson  of  the  National
Council of Provinces, let me first do the right thing and  congratulate  you
on your new appointment as a chairperson of this very important  House,  the
National Council of Provinces. Malibongwe igama  lamakhosikazi.  [Praise  be
to the name of the women.] By now  our  approach  in  the  third  democratic
Parliament should be clear. It is down to work. So today we  must  focus  on
those priorities, which the President identified in his state of the  nation
address: safe water for a million people for  this  current  year;  hygienic
and acceptable sanitation  for  three  thousand  households,  including  the
eradication of the bucket-system; and the general focus on helping to  build
the second economy to sustain and improve the quality of  life  of  all  our
people.

The Constitution places great emphasis on co-operative governance, so it  is
appropriate that we meet today to discuss the Budget  Votes  of  Agriculture
and Land Affairs, as well as Water Affairs and Forestry. There  is  a  close
interdependence between these  portfolios  as  already  alluded  to  by  the
Minister which all contribute to a better life for all South  Africans.  And
here in the NCOP, the guardian of the provinces, I will focus my  review  on
those functions that are relevant to the provinces. One area where  we  have
a shared  responsibility  is  forestry,  particularly  with  regard  to  the
administration of indigenous forests; and secondly there  is  the  issue  of
the local government.
Municipalities are responsible for water supply and sanitation  services  as
well as for waste disposal sites  and  other  activities  that  cause  water
pollution and  must  be  properly  managed.  Also  of  common  interest  are
education and health where we must ensure  that  schools  and  clinics  have
proper water supplies and sanitation.  Finally,  water  availability  limits
economic and social development  in  many  parts  of  our  country  just  as
environmental conditions determine  whether  forestry  is  viable.  We  must
ensure that provincial growth and development strategies  are  informed  and
supported by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. During this  year
we will continue to ensure that the department's activities are closely  co-
ordinated with provincial growth and development strategies. That,  finally,
did not mean that I was concluding, it was just that part of my speech  that
I was concluding.

With regard to the issue of forestry, the department has made good  progress
in transferring government's commercial plantations to  private  management,
while retaining the ownership of the land for the people.  Of  the  140  000
hectares which we managed in 1994, over 100 000 ha have been transferred  to
more appropriate management agencies with a social plan that we have put  in
place for the  affected  workers  in  conjunction  with  the  Department  of
Labour.

In the year 2004-05 we will see major advances in the restructuring  of  the
remaining  plantations  into  the  hands  of  the  communities   and   small
businesses with the  focus  on  black  economic  empowerment  and  community
participation. This is in line with the President's determination  to  focus
our attention on what he called the second economy,  the  economy  in  which
many poor South Africans find themselves, particularly in the  rural  areas.
Although only small percentage of South Africa's land area is  suitable  for
commercial forestry, there is still some potential for further  development.
So I am pleased that forestry has been  recognised  as  a  priority  in  the
provincial growth and development strategy  of  the  Limpopo  Province,  for
example.

In the Eastern Cape some  progress  has  been  made  to  expand  small-scale
timber growing but the process, according to my own observation,  is  moving
a bit slowly. As this is a very urgent matter for me I have  instructed  the
department to put a coherent plan in place within the next three  months  to
address  the  obstacles  that  are  hindering  our  objective  of  expanding
forestry in this area by at least 60 000 ha. The transfer of  the  remaining
smaller plantations  has  been  delayed  in  some  areas  by  land-ownership
considerations. A successful land restitution  claim  in  northern  KwaZulu-
Natal has now identified the parties with which the Government must work  to
determine the future of the 26 000 ha forests of Mbazwane and  Manzengwenya,
as well as the Mbazwane saw  mill.  Since  we  cannot  proceed  without  the
agreement of these parties, I cannot set a timeframe  for  the  finalisation
of this restructuring. But again I will have a plan for the process to  take
this forward within three months. I have earned myself a name - I  am  being
called the Minister of timeframes and I only hope that  we  will  really  be
sticking to the timeframes.

A key objective has been to  ensure  that  local  communities  benefit  from
forestry activities. Following the restructuring of  plantation  forests  in
the Eastern Cape  and  KwaZulu-Natal  the  management  consortia  have  been
paying lease rentals for the use of land. The R40 million currently held  in
trust will be paid to the communities concerned as soon  as  they  establish
structures that get the  benefits  to  the  right  people.  With  indigenous
forests our policy is to delegate or  assign  management  responsibility  to
appropriate agencies and we are making good progress with  the  transfer  of
forests to  the  South  African  National  Parks  and  other  agencies.  The
delegation to said parks of the management  of  97  000  ha  of  the  Knysna
Forest, the jewel of  South  Africa's  indigenous  forests,  is  practically
finalised and will be  given  as  soon  as  outstanding  labour  issues  are
resolved.

In the Western Cape the department is negotiating with Western  Cape  Nature
Conservation to take responsibility for 761 900 ha of  mountain  areas  west
of the Touws River which are managed  under  forest  legislation  for  other
conservation purposes. In the Eastern Cape we are negotiating to assign  413
000 ha of natural forest to the province. And in Mpumalanga we  are  working
with the Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  the  provincial
Department of Agriculture Conservation and Environment  and  the  Mpumalanga
Parks  Board  to  assign  15  600  ha  of  natural  forests  and  commercial
plantations to the proposed Blyde Canyon National Park.  Evaluation  of  the
socioeconomic impact and consultation with stakeholders has already begun.

Given forestry's importance for rural development, I was concerned to  learn
that during the  past  year  the  forestry  industry,  with  the  department
included, suffered serious fire damage with 30 176  ha  of  plantation  area
destroyed and 4,5 million tons of wood  lost.  The  financial  loss  in  the
plantation was R695,7 million and the cost to the economy  through  loss  of
production of pulp and related wood product industry was around R3  billion.
The costs for just fire- fighting  and  replanting  are  estimated  at  R227
million. The department is working with forestry in South Africa to find  an
administratively simple way to  waive  water-use  charges  for  those  areas
affected by the fires. More generally, I should add,  we  are  also  working
with the industry to ensure that water-use charges are set in a  transparent
way and in terms of the legislated principles. The forest industry  makes  a
vital contribution to rural development and has worked  very  positively  to
ensure that it operates in  a  sustainable  manner  and  our  department  is
committed to helping it to continue and indeed, to expand.

Last year's  drought  highlighted  the  importance  of  managing  our  water
wisely. And I hope that we are taking note of this particular issue  because
in 50 to 60 years' time this country will  be  a  semidesert.  Farmers  were
practically and badly affected and restrictions on irrigation are  still  in
effect in some areas of the country,  notably  the  Komati  River  basin  in
Mpumalanga.

In line with Government's approach to the second economy water  restrictions
were not applied uniformly, because newly established farmers are less  able
to cope when the water supply is reduced by drought. Commercial farmers,  on
the other hand, on the Komati, and everywhere else, but I  am  referring  to
the Komati and lower Komati, had their water allocation restricted  by  65%.
But for emerging farmers we were more  lenient.  The  restriction  was  only
40%. I am appreciative of the disciplined way in which organised  commercial
agriculture respond to the challenges  of  drought  and  their  co-operation
with the department is most appreciated.

The drought emphasises the need to continue to  invest  in  water  security.
So, as the President announced in January 2003, construction  of  phase  one
of the Olifants River Development Project has begun to  meet  the  immediate
needs of the Limpopo Province's rapidly expanding platinum  mines,  as  well
as ensuring supplies for municipal and agricultural users.

Just this morning Cabinet agreed that phase two of the project should  be  a
dam  on  the  Steelpoort  River.  The  cost  of  building  the  dam  and  of
transmission pipelines are estimated at over R3  000  million.  It  will  be
financed  mainly  through  the  contributions  from  economic  water  users,
although water for social needs as well as the planning and  initial  design
of the dam will be funded by Government.

Aside from boosting the  local  economy,  the  project  will  also  help  my
department's in-house  design  and  construction  team  to  train  the  next
generation of water resource engineers. We are also busy recruiting, as  the
Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs has also  indicated.  An  approach
to achieve  economic  empowerment  and  poverty  alleviation  through  water
resource development has been taken in the  Western  Cape,  where  the  R550
million contract to build the Berg River Dam  was  awarded  last  week.  The
contractors include over 30% black ownership, and 80% of the workforce  will
come from the local community. Again, the water users will fund the  project
through  loans  raised  by   the   Trans-Caledon   tunnel   authority.   Its
construction,  therefore,  does  not  appear  on  the  department's  budget,
although the planning and oversight activities are  funded  from  the  Water
Resource Management Programme.

Following concerns about water quality in Mafikeng in North  West  Province,
I made an enquiry and I was assured that the service provider complies  with
the standards as required by Government. This further assures us that  there
is no reason for us to panic.

We  have  to  give  financial  assistance  to  resource-poor  farmers.  This
demonstrates the extent to which our water  resource  management  activities
are designed to support the development of the second economy. Elsewhere  we
continue  to  create  opportunities  for  the  establishment  of   so-called
resource-poor farmers on irrigation schemes, giving them  access  to  water.
In order to focus our efforts  on  the  needs  of  newly  established  black
farmers we will continue to restructure the remaining  21  Government  water
schemes, so that the commercial farmers concerned  can  take  responsibility
for their funding and operation.

Operation and maintenance functions have already  been  transferred  to  the
Orange Ridge, Vaalharts, Boegoeberg, Kakamas and the  Lower  Olifants  water
user associations. Although  in  Boegoeberg,  Kakamas  and  Lower  Olifants,
staff members are still seconded, pending the outcome of  negotiations  with
the unions and  the  finalisation  of  contracts  to  regulate  the  ongoing
maintenance of state-owned infrastructure.

During 2004-05 we will  initiate  negotiations  to  transfer  operation  and
maintenance of the Sand, Wit and Orange Rivers and Van der Kloof  canals  to
government water schemes.

The department also contributes to poverty alleviation through  the  Working
for Water Programme - a flagship of the Expanded Public Works Programme.  In
2004-05 we will clear 109 500 ha, and we will do  follow-up  maintenance  on
615 200 hectares, contributing to  the  productive  use  of  scarce  natural
resources and protecting our diversity. More than 10  000  person  years  of
employment will be created and accredited training  will  be  given  to  all
project workers to empower them with useful workplace skills.

As already indicated, the President has set out this year's goals for  water
services. These goals must be achieved. If we  are  to  reach  our  goal  of
eradicating the water supply backlog by 2008, and the sanitation backlog  by
2010, we will have to move very fast. Members of the  NCOP  will  know  that
the way we tackle water supply  and  sanitation  delivery  is  changing.  In
keeping with our commitment to  bring  development  closer  to  our  people,
funds for water and sanitation  have  been  consolidated  in  the  municipal
infrastructure grant.  From  July  municipalities  will  receive  the  money
directly on their budgets  from  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government. Some funds remain in my department's  budget  to  enable  us  to
complete projects which we have already  started,  particularly  those  that
cross municipal boundaries, such as the Hockessin waterworks,  which  supply
half a million people in Limpopo and Mpumalanga.  In  future,  however,  the
job of provincial and national departments will be  to  help  municipalities
to plan in order to spend the money effectively on projects  that  meet  the
needs of our people to achieve our water supply and sanitation goals.

We will be working closely with the national Minister  and  with  provincial
Ministers for local government to monitor and support the municipalities  to
ensure that they use the funding provided for this purpose effectively.  The
department's strong links with civil society will be  strengthened  to  give
us more eyes and ears on the ground to help in this regard. There should  be
more than enough money for us to reach the targets as set out for  2004  and
2005. This year Government will be giving R4,6 billion to  local  government
to invest in infrastructure  to  provide  basic  services.  At  least  R2,35
billion, 52% of this, should  be  used  to  address  the  water  supply  and
sanitation backlogs. This is in  addition  to  the  funds  provided  by  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to our committed projects, as  well
as housing grants in terms of which at least 180 000 new houses  with  basic
services will be built during the course of the year.
A particular challenge for the  department  as  sector  leader  will  be  to
promote  the  delivery  of  safe,  affordable  and  sustainable   sanitation
services. The health impact of inadequate sanitation, be it from the  bucket
system, overflowing sewage, badly maintained water-borne systems, or  simply
the absence of any  sanitation  system,  is  taking  a  heavy  toll  on  the
productivity, health and wellbeing of our people.  I  will  be  giving  more
details on how we propose to address the particular challenges of  providing
sanitation in our urban townships and informal settlements  when  I  present
my budget to the National Assembly next week.

What I must mention here is the challenge of ensuring that  the  disgraceful
situation, which sees many of our schools without water and  sanitation,  is
dealt with as a matter of urgency. In  terms  of  our  strategic  framework,
approved by Cabinet last year, the first responsibility for addressing  this
challenge lies with provincial departments of education and health,  working
with the Department of Public Works. Some funds  are  already  available  to
them for this particular purpose. But if we are to succeed, we will have  to
treat this as an emergency or an urgent project.

I propose to meet with my national and provincial  colleagues  to  work  out
joint strategies to reach the targets set by the President.  I  also  intend
to raise the matter at the President's co-ordinating council meeting  on  21
June, because I indeed think that this is  a  very  urgent  matter.  I  will
propose  programmes  to  be  implemented  under  the   leadership   of   our
department, as well as that  of  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government and the other two mentioned, Health and Education, where we  will
look at the management skills that we have,  so  that  we  can  be  able  to
deliver on this very important matter.

While talking on  sanitation,  I  must  mention  that  one  of  the  biggest
challenges in protecting our scarce water resources is the  need  for  local
government to manage  and  upgrade  their  municipal  waste-water  treatment
works. If they do not, poorly treated wastewater will  be  dumped  into  our
rivers and  the  quality  of  our  rivers  will  deteriorate,  with  further
negative impact on other water users downstream. I am often asked why  I  do
not prosecute municipalities that contravene pollution control  regulations.
My reply is simply that this  would  run  contrary  to  the  spirit  of  co-
operative governance. Although where there is gross  negligence,  or  wilful
disregard of the law, I will not hesitate to act. I  am  just  worried  that
some of the people that I might arrest may be my colleagues! [Laughter.]

We still need a developmental approach, and we will  support  municipalities
and help them to build the capacity to do their jobs. Where  this  does  not
have the desired effect, a strategy will be developed to ensure  that  local
government meets its statutory obligation to manage activities  that  impact
on water quality. Further announcements will be made in this  regard  during
the current financial year.

In  conclusion,  I  wish  to  inform  the  House   that   with   regard   to
transformation we are on course as a department.  All  the  necessary  tools
are in place. We are aware that transformation is a  process,  and  our  own
transformation programme as a department is a  contribution  to  the  bigger
agenda of creating a caring society. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE:  Chairperson,  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
Minister of Water  Affairs  And  Forestry,  departmental  directors-general,
MECs present, special delegates,  colleagues  and  hon  members,  the  three
Votes before this House are extremely important. Therefore we approach  this
debate through the eye of the people's contract we have  entered  into  with
the people of South Africa.

In the new political dispensation after 1994, South Africa was divided  into
9 provinces, each with it's own department of  agriculture.  The  Department
of Agriculture is still the central body overseeing national  interests.  As
mentioned earlier, the land question in South Africa is strongly  linked  to
agricultural development in the provinces.  Qualitatively,  settlements  are
characterised by linking restitution and the restoration with development.

In the rural areas a strong emphasis is placed on agricultural  development.
Major qualitative and quantitative  strides  have  been  made  in  advancing
restitution delivery. By March 2000, 3 916 claims were settled. By  the  end
of September 2000, 6 525 claims were settled in  favour  of  the  claimants.
The total number of claim forms resolved is 6 740. A breakdown of  finalised
claims for 2000 per province  is  available.  The  role  of  agriculture  in
reducing poverty and increasing food security depends, to  a  large  extent,
on  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  within  the  subsectors   of
agriculture.

In  the  commercial  subsector  various  past  and  current  policies   have
influenced the total structure of agriculture;  and  the  intensity  of  its
production, input  and  output  industries,  capital  subsidies,  guaranteed
prices and import protection contributed to larger  farms  and  therefore  a
decline in the number of farm families. The policies  of  cheap  credit  and
tax write-offs, favoured more capital equipment in agriculture,  leading  to
huge  losses  in  agricultural  jobs  during  the  1970s  and   the   1980s.
Agriculture, particularly food security, remains the critical component  for
our rural economy and therefore recovery support measures  are  required  to
ensure sustainability.  To  this  end,  comprehensive  agricultural  support
programmes  have  been  launched  to  enhance  the  provision   of   support
tentatively to LRAD for the financial year. About R 200 million will  go  to
on-farm and off-farm infrastructure.

Regarding the issue of budgetary  measures,  the  total  expenditure  trends
increased steadily between 2000-2001  and  the  2003-2004  financial  years,
rising from R 723, 3 billion. The total  expenditure  is  expected  to  grow
over the next three years, rising to R 1, 6 billion in 2006-2007, an  annual
average increase over the 7 year period of 14,5 %. Expenditure  between  the
2001-2002  and  2003-2004  financial  years  has  been  increased   by   the
allocation of R255 million for flood relief over the three  years  following
the floods of 1999-2000. In addition, a once-off allocation of R150  million
was made in 2003-2004 for agricultural  disaster  management,  boosting  the
department budget for this  year  in  the  farmer  support  and  development
programme.

In three months the modalities of the agricultural  credit  scheme  will  be
announced and be capitalised  with  R1  billion  which  has  been  collected
through the Agricultural Management Act.  The  Agri-BEE  framework  will  be
published for public comment by July 2004. This  process  is  going  through
consultation with agricultural industries and it is in the capable hands  of
the department and the Minister.

Agriculture has great potential to assist in the fight to alleviate  poverty
in  the  rural  areas.  Given  the  apartheid  legacy,  the   expansion   of
agricultural opportunities to poor rural communities is  closely  linked  to
access to land and water. Redressing the past imbalances in  land  ownership
must be balanced against the need to sustain  the  predominantly  commercial
farming sector, so that the agricultural sector can continue to supply  food
to  the  consumer  at   reasonable   prices   and   remain   internationally
competitive.

The vision of the Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  in  attaining
socioeconomic rights for the citizens of South Africa states the  following:



  We have a vision of a democratic, people-centred nation  working  towards
  human rights, social justice, equality and prosperity for all. We have  a
  vision of a society in which all our people enjoy the benefits  of  clean
  water and hygienic sanitation services. We have a vision of  water  being
  used carefully and productively for economic activities which promote the
  growth, development and prosperity of the nation. We have a vision  of  a
  land in which our natural forests and plantations are managed in the best
  interests of all. We have a vision of a people who understand and protect
  our national resources  so  as  to  make  them  ecologically  stable  and
  safeguard them for current and future generations. We have a vision of  a
  department that serves the public  loyally,  meets  its  responsibilities
  with energy and compassion and acts as a link in the chain of  integrated
  and  environmentally  sustainable  development.   We   have   vision   of
  development and co-operation throughout our region; of playing  our  part
  in the African Renaissance.

We will ensure that in the next five years all  households  will  have  easy
access  to  clean  running  water.  By  December  this  year,  through   our
programmes, we will provide clean and potable water  to  the  ten  millionth
South African since 1994.  During  the  current  year,  more  than  300  000
households will be provided with basic sanitation.

There is another aspect that the select committee requested me to  highlight
in this debate, namely the issue of aquaculture. Aquaculture may be  defined
simply as farming with fish and other aquatic organisms.  ``Fish''  is  used
here  generically  to  include  all  farmed  aquatic  organisms.  Land-based
systems are commonly integrated with agriculture by stocking  fish  in  rice
fields and ponds. Water-based systems  involve  stocking  fish  directly  in
enclosures or attaching them to substrates in water bodies such  as  rivers,
lakes, reservoirs or bays. Water-based systems may provide  an  entry  point
for landless people and poor fishermen to farm with fish. Rural  aquaculture
implies low-cost production with extensive and  semi-extensive  technologies
most appropriate for the limited resource base of small  -scale  households.
It  is  based  on  natural  food  for  fish  such  as  plankton,  which   is
occasionally fertilised and/or supplemented by other  feed.  Fertiliser  and
feed may be derived from on-farm products, at least in the initial stage  of
intensification.


  What are the direct benefits of aquaculture? It  provides  food  of  high
  nutritional value, especially for vulnerable groups such as pregnant  and
  lactating women,  infants  and  preschool  children.  It  provides  ``own
  enterprising'' employment including for women and children  and  provides
  an income through the sale of relatively high value produce.

The indirect benefits include the increased availability of  fish  in  local
rural and urban  markets  which  may  bring  prices  down.  Furthermore,  it
provides employment on larger  farms,  in  seed  supplies  networks,  market
chains and manufacture/repair  functions.  The  benefits  from  common  pool
resources, particularly to  the  landless,  through  cage  culture  are  the
creation of a culture of molluscs and seaweeds  and  enhanced  fisheries  in
communal  water  bodies.  Furthermore,  there   will   be   increased   farm
sustainability through the construction of ponds, which also serve as small-
scale  on-farm  reservoirs;  and  rice/fish  culture  as  a   component   of
integrated pest management.

South African aquaculture production, though limited in its contribution  to
Africa's and global production, has shown a significant  increase  over  the
past decade. The total production and value has increased from  3  000  tons
in 1997 to 4 100 tons in 1998, to 5 800 tons in 1999 to  4  030  tons  in  2
000. The decline in quantity and value from 1999 to 2 000  has  to  do  with
the exclusion of the Namibian oyster and mussel production  from  the  South
African  statistics  as  from  the  year  2000.  The  total  South   African
production has increased by 31% in weight, and 35% in  value  from  1998  to
2000. [Time expired.]

Mr M MAMASE (Eastern Cape):  Madam  Chairperson,  may  I  say  I  hope  that
protocol is  observed  in  order  that  I  do  not  lose  any  time.  Having
considered the themes under which the Budget  Vote  for  the  Department  of
Agriculture  is  debated,  let  me  begin  by  saying  that  the  Integrated
Framework for Economic Development has provided the  Eastern  Cape  with  an
opportunity   to   provide   farmers   with   the   necessary   agricultural
infrastructure for growth and development.

Our province is  divided  into  six  agri-ecological  zones  with  different
potentials. The maize triangle in the Transkei  is  determined  by  rainfall
patterns, biodiversity and soil fertility. In  this  area  we  introduced  a
programme  called  massive  food  production.  This   agri-ecological   zone
produces maize and beans.

Last year we invested an amount of R50 million in the  production  of  maize
and beans. A conditional grant to assist farmers with  R2  300  per  hectare
was meant for the purchase of fertiliser, seed and lime. Farmers planted  17
000 hectares of maize, and on these hectares 44 000 tons have been  produced
at the value of R105 million at market price.

Having realised this tonnage, we took cognisance that there is a  dire  need
for storage facilities. We were also confronted by the fact that this  maize
could not be harvested by hand. The growth of this maize and beans  was  not
only excellent, but was unexpected, as this kind  of  production  was  never
realised by farmers before. The investment in this programme, together  with
mechanisation, is R150 million in this current year.

Because  of  the  level  of  production  a  mechanisation  scheme  has  been
introduced which is meant for the entrepreneurial development of farmers  in
this particular region. A four-row combine harvester has been bought  for  a
co-operative in this area. The entrepreneurial development  for  a  business
organisation is constituted for men and women trained  in  farming  for  the
development and agricultural production  in  the  Lusikisiki-Port  St  Johns
area.

The black economic empowerment group is responsible  for  farming,  business
development and employment creation in order to reverse  poverty.  They  are
also responsible for buying mechanisation  equipment.  This  agri-ecological
zone stretches from Maluti,  Ramotlakwana,  eNgcobo,  Idutywa,  Gatyana  and
Bizana and farmers in these areas are at work. To us as  government  of  the
Eastern Cape, on the first  year  of  the  roll-out  of  this  massive  food
production, it is clear that by 2009 poverty in this area will be  something
of the past.

With regard to the Integrated Food Security Programme, we realise  that  for
a better meaning and a better sense  to  poor  communities,  this  programme
must  be  called  ``Siyazondla''.  In  this  current  year  the   provincial
government has invested  R20  million  in  the  Siyazondla  programme.  This
programme commenced last year, and it assisted each and every family in  the
deep rural areas of Transkei and elsewhere. It is underpinned by  a  women's
organisation referred to as Wad, Women in Agricultural Development. In  some
quarters it is referred to as homestead production.

We are currently developing six nurseries to supply seedlings in  the  needy
areas, and we have been joined by Standard  Bank  in  developing  an  animal
multipurpose centre where an animal  clinic,  a  shearing  shed,  a  storage
facility and the offices of the animal health technician and scientist  have
been developed.  A  typical  example  of  this  facility  is  now  found  in
Ngqamakhwe.

On the basis of the integrated livestock and crop development  strategy,  we
are producing bonsmara and nguni bulls from our Bathurst  research  station,
and with the assistance of the University of Fort Hare  they  have  produced
heifers.  Tomorrow,  hon  members,  could  you  please  join   me   in   the
distribution of these bulls and heifers to the agri-ecological zone where  a
huge carrying  capacity  has  been  found?  [Applause.]  The  cost  of  this
production was R9 million and, in this current year  we  have  allocated  R8
million for this programme to continue.
Concerning the ram and wool  production  scheme,  in  partnership  with  the
National Wool Growers Association the  provincial  government  is  investing
R4,5 million in the NWGA to produce the best dohne merinos, rams  and  ewes.
This is a five-year programme, and it has been running for three years  now,
with an investment of R4,5 million every year. Four thousand rams  and  3000
ewes have been distributed to the  villages  of  Transkei  and  Ciskei.  The
intention of this programme is to change the quality  of  wool,  and  it  is
meant for rural areas in this province. There is a  significant  improvement
in the areas such as Idutywa, Hlomendlini, Uluzi and Maluti and, of  course,
Sterkspruit and Allanwaters are champions in wool and meat production.

This wool production movement is second to nothing to wool  farmers  in  the
province. We have even changed the Angora goat wool to fine wool.  If  there
are possible investors in this House, you must  come  to  the  Eastern  Cape
province and invest in fine wool production not later than December 2005.

With the financial assistance of the Volkswagen Foundation,  the  government
of the Eastern Cape bought cashmere goats  in  Australia.  With  researchers
from Wolwehoek we were able to turn  goat  wool  into  cashmere.  With  this
partnership, the centre for scientific  industrial  research  and  organised
farmer community in  Maluti,  we  are  now  running  a  cashmere  production
centre, with a market in Italy. We invested R3 million for further  research
and development of cashmere production centres in the province.  Communities
are now rallied around this cashmere production, because  the  Eastern  Cape
owns 50% of goats in South Africa.

With regard to pineapple production, may I, with your permission hon  Chair,
invite this House to a pineapple expansion programme tomorrow  in  the  area
of Peddie at half-past-nine  and  two  o'clock  in  the  afternoon  for  the
distribution of bowls in the Putu area in Peddie.

If one  looks  at  the  Provincial  Growth  and  Development  Plan  and  the
Presidential state of the nation address, as well as  the  sector  strategy,
it must be argued that poverty and unemployment are the key  ingredients  in
our policies, and the government of the hon Nosimo Balindlela  is  investing
money in poultry farming and dairy production. We have been joined  by  four
companies, with an investment of R40 million, and the provincial  government
is only investing R10 million. It will be converted into  a  percentage  for
shareholding and land provision. This means that the village  would  have  a
majority share in this farming opportunity in Port St Johns.

In the development of roses in Longmore the government has  invested  R2,  6
million in infrastructure. This entails irrigation, a nursery,  fencing  and
the further extension of this development. It is  with  pleasure  that  this
House notes that our province has been given R38 million by the Minister  of
Agriculture for a  comprehensive  agricultural  support  programme  for  the
development of stock dams, irrigation,  windmills,  boreholes  and  fencing.
Thank you very much for your time. [Applause.]

Mr D A WORTH: Madam Chair, hon Ministers present here this afternoon,  first
of all, thank you for your kind words; they are much  appreciated.  I  would
also like to congratulate the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry on  her
maiden speech in this House this afternoon. It is towards the water  affairs
section of the department that I now direct my speech.

Whilst it appears that a country such as South Africa with  its  large  dams
and lakes will never have a serious shortage  of  water,  the  experts  warn
that if we do not use water sparingly the time will come that South  Africa,
like other places in Africa, will  experience  a  critical  shortage.  South
Africans will have to wake up to the fact that the country does not have  an
unlimited supply of water. A water-saving culture must be encouraged and  we
should not  wait  for  a  crisis  before  implementing  savings.  Inadequate
plumbing and pipelines such as in Soweto and elsewhere have led  to  wastage
of scarce water.

Prepaid water meters have been designed to provide the basic amount free  of
charge. This is to ensure that even the poorest of the poor  are  guaranteed
clean water. Contamination of the country's water resources caused by  large
factories and industries as well as the country's inhabitants is  the  order
of the day, and the survival struggle is in progress in the  many  scattered
settlements, in rural areas,  where  cholera  is  one  of  the  most  common
sicknesses as  a  result  of  drinking  contaminated  water.  Attempts  are,
however, being made to change the lives of millions of people  who  have  to
carry water in containers for household  purposes  over  long  distances  or
even in donkey-drawn carts.

Water is a very emotional subject in the country such as  ours  where  there
are often water shortages. We cannot live without water and it must be  used
and managed well. A balance must be obtained between the water needs of  the
poor and those of industry, which provides the necessary  job  opportunities
and development. Cross-subsidisation of water tariffs must, for example,  be
very well  thought-out  as  expensive  water  will  affect  input  costs  to
industry, which in turn means lower  job  creation.  People  living  in  the
rural areas are totally dependent on a healthy water supply and it is  these
people who  can  least  afford  any  loss  or  contamination  of  the  water
resources.

The Minister has stated that all South Africans will have access  to  proper
sanitation by 2008, and the President has stated that within five years  all
households will have easy access to clean running water.  In  terms  of  the
Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant  Programme,  local  governments   will   be
responsible for the implementation of water and  sanitation  infrastructural
development as from 1 April this year. Municipalities will  be  expected  to
use the increased funding from the grant to achieve the Government's  goals.
The  first  priority  must  be  to  help   local   government   fulfil   its
responsibility to  deliver  quality  water  services  by  implementing  cost
recovery for services rendered and working  towards  a  more  effective  and
efficient use of water.

One of the biggest challenges is  the  eradication  of  the  bucket  system.
However, there are difficulties in providing water to communities living  in
areas where there are hilltops and valleys as the cost  of  providing  piped
water is very high and  not  very  cost-effective.  Dry  sanitation  toilets
could possibly be utilised in such areas as they  are  more  effective  than
the bucket system. In  view  of  diseases  such  as  cholera  and  HIV/Aids,
sanitation must receive urgent  attention.  HIV-positive  mothers  who  feed
their babies on formula milk are totally dependent on clean  water.  Without
sanitation we cannot develop healthy children nor have  productive  mothers.
Water is life; sanitation is human dignity.

The  Government's  biggest  and  probably  most  successful   Public   Works
programme has been the Working for Water  and  Working  on  Fire  programme.
This programme employs individuals from disadvantaged groups such as  single
parents, the disabled and youth.  This  programme  seeks  to  improve  South
Africa's precious water supplies  by  removing  invasive,  alien  vegetation
from the various catchment areas in  all  nine  provinces,  and  alleviating
poverty and social deprivation in the  process.  In  South  Africa  invasive
plants have been identified as the single biggest threat to  this  country's
spectacular biological diversity, and the  fastest  growing  threat  to  the
country's water security. The invasive plants also use some 7% of  the  mean
annual run-off.

Some vegetation has been identified as  emerging  serious  invasive  plants.
These include  the  notorious  pompom  weed  in  the  grasslands,  which  is
poisonous to livestock and could destroy agricultural production.  The  weed
is found in Gauteng and it won't be long before it gets to  the  Free  State
and the Eastern  Cape.  Working  for  Water  currently  provides  employment
opportunities for up to 18 000 people in more  than  300  clearing  projects
throughout South Africa. The budgeted  expenditure  is  in  excess  of  R500
million.

Whilst two-thirds of our planet Earth consists  of  water,  very  little  of
this is drinkable water. We will always have droughts, which prejudice  food
security and  can  affect  industry  and  electricity  generation.  We  must
conserve our water resources and manage them well, otherwise the verse  from
the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner will apply - ``Water, water,  every  where,
nor any drop to drink''. I thank you.

Mnr  F  ADAMS:  Mnr  die  Adjunkvoorsitter,  Ministers  en  lede,  ek   voel
geïnspireer deur die magdom geleenthede in landbou wat 'n wesenlike  verskil
kan maak aan die lewens van ons mense. Landbou is na my mening die  ruggraat
van landelike ontwikkeling. Die NNP glo dat landbou 'n kritieke  element  in
die Suid-Afrikaanse samelewing is.

Alhoewel daar groot waardering is  vir  die  werk  wat  die  Regering  doen,
geniet dit nie die erkenning wat dit behoort te ontvang nie.  Daar  moet  'n
groter bewustheid wees dat ons landboubedryf voedselsekuriteit  bied  op  'n
kontinent wat herhaaldelik by die internasionale gemeenskap  om  voedselhulp
smeek. Landbou se vermoë om voedsel te  voorsien  en  'n  rol  te  speel  om
maatskaplike onrus te verhoed wat in voedselarm lewens voorkom, behoort  ook
groter erkenning te kry.

Landbou moet  veral  in  landelike  gebiede  welvaart  skep  omdat  dit  die
grootste werkskepper  in  landelike  gebiede  is.  Dit  moet  'n  beduidende
maatskaplike rol speel om landelike gebiede lewensvatbaar  te  maak.  Verder
moet landbou 'n beduidende bydrae lewer tot uitvoer en  die  verkryging  van
buitelandse valuta. Die landbou het verder die taak om  gelyke  toegang  tot
deelname  in  die  landbou  te   bewerkstellig   en   volhoubare   landelike
ontwikkeling  te  stimuleer;  om  alle  produsente  se  mededingendheid   op
plaaslike sowel as nasionale en internasionale gebiede  te  verhoog,  en  om
die kosbare hulpbronne tot ons beskikking volhoubaar te benut en  te  bewaar
vir die geslagte ná ons.

Grondbesit  verteenwoordig  vir  baie  mense   'n   koloniale   nalatenskap.
Ongelukkig vind daar soms voorvalle op  plase  plaas  wat  die  hele  bedryf
skade  berokken  en  in  die  langtermyn  'n  invloed  het  op   buitelandse
beleggings in ons landbou-ondernemings. Die landboubedryf is  afhanklik  van
'n landbouvriendelike beleidsraamwerk; goeie en  effektiewe  infrastruktuur;
'n vervoer-,  krag-  en  watervoorsieningsnetwerk;  'n  belastingbeleid  wat
entrepreneurskap bevorder; tariefbeskerming wanneer ander lande  op  direkte
of indirekte wyse aan hulle  landbouers  'n  onregverdige  voordeel  probeer
gee; en 'n landelike omgewing waarin  plaasgemeenskappe  en  eiendom  veilig
is.

Die steeds  hoë  voorkoms  van  plaasmoorde  en  -aanvalle  vereis  dat  die
veiligheid   van   landbougemeenskappe   volgehoue   prioriteitsaandag   van
georganiseerde landbou moet ontvang. As ons  in  Suid-Afrika  suksesvol  wil
wees, moet die landbou suksesvol wees, en dan  moet  alle  sektore  van  die
landbou hul ongekwalifiseerd daartoe verbind om 'n verskil te wil  maak.  Ek
het geen twyfel nie dat ons reeds daardie  verbintenis  het,  en  dat  Suid-
Afrikaners in 'n vennootskap staan wat vir  álle  Suid-Afrikaners  voordelig
is. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Deputy Chairperson, Ministers and members, I feel  inspired  by
the myriad  of  opportunities  in  agriculture  that  can  make  a  material
difference in the lives of our people. In  my  opinion  agriculture  is  the
backbone of rural development.  The  NNP  believes  that  agriculture  is  a
critically important element in South African society.

Although there is great appreciation for the work that the Government  does,
it does not enjoy the recognition that it should. There has to be a  greater
awareness  that  our  agricultural  industry  offers  food  security  on   a
continent  that  repeatedly  begs  for  food  aid  from  the   international
community. Agriculture's ability to provide food  and  to  play  a  role  in
preventing social unrest, which is prevalent in food- scarce  lives,  should
receive greater recognition.

Agriculture must create prosperity, particularly in rural areas  because  it
is the largest creator of jobs in rural areas. It must  play  a  significant
role  in  making  rural  areas  viable.  Furthermore,   agriculture   should
contribute  significantly  to  exports  and  the  procurement   of   foreign
currency. Agriculture has the further task of establishing  equal  entry  to
participation in agriculture and  stimulating  sustainable  development;  to
increase the competitiveness of all producers in national and  international
spheres, and to use the valuable resources available to us in a  sustainable
manner and to preserve it for future generations.

Land ownership represents a colonial legacy to  many  people.  Unfortunately
certain incidents take place on farms that harm the whole industry and  have
an influence on foreign investment in our agricultural  enterprises  in  the
long term. The agricultural  industry  is  dependent  on  an  agriculturally
friendly policy framework; sound and effective infrastructure; a  transport,
power   and   water   supply   network;   a   tax   policy   that   promotes
entrepreneurship; tariff protection when other countries try to  give  their
own farmers an unfair advantage in a direct or indirect manner; and a  rural
environment in which farming communities and property are safe.
The still high prevalence of farm murders and  farm  attacks  requires  that
the agricultural communities  should  receive  constant  priority  attention
from organised agriculture. If we in South Africa  wish  to  be  successful,
agriculture must be successful, and then all the agricultural  sectors  must
commit themselves unconditionally to making a difference. I  have  no  doubt
that we have that commitment already, and that South  Africans  are  engaged
in a partnership that is to the benefit  of  all  South  Africans.  I  thank
you.]

Mr  J  J  DOWRY  (Western  Cape):  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister   for
Agriculture and Land Affairs, hon Minister of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
MECs and ...

... agb lede, die Nasionale Landboustrategie wat  aan  die  begin  van  2002
deur die  President  onderteken  is,  spel  die  nasionale  perspektief  uit
waarheen landbou oor  die  mediumtermyn  op  pad  is.  Die  departement  van
landbou in die Wes-Kaap is terdeë bewus van die uitdagings  wat  landbou  in
die gesig staar en ons besef dat die kwessie van grondhervorming met  al  sy
fasette die hoogste prioriteit moet geniet. Dit  is  egter  noodsaaklik  dat
alle programme binne die landbousektor die nodige aandag sal kry  ten  einde
te voldoen aan  die  vereistes  wat  deur  die  strategiese  planne  wat  op
nasionale sowel as op provinsiale vlak gestel is. (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[... hon members, the national strategy for agriculture that was  signed  by
the President at the beginning of 2002 spells out the  national  perspective
as to where agriculture is heading in the  medium  term.  The  Western  Cape
department of agriculture is thoroughly aware of the challenges  agriculture
is facing and we realise that the matter of land reform with all its  facets
must enjoy top priority. It  is,  however,  essential  that  all  programmes
within the agricultural sector receive the necessary attention in  order  to
comply with the  requirements  set  out  by  the  strategic  plans  on  both
national and provincial levels.]

Chairperson, in order to  keep  in  step  with  the  national  strategy  for
agriculture and to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  day,  the  Western  Cape
department of agriculture transformed itself in such a way that  it  is  now
ready for the challenges  that  lie  ahead.  To  tie  in  with  the  uniform
structure  as  set  out  by  the  National  Treasury,  the  department   has
transformed itself from five directorates into  an  organisation  consisting
of six programmes, and these are: sustainable  resource  management;  farmer
support  and  development;  veterinary  services;  technology  research  and
development;  and  agricultural  economics   and   structured   agricultural
training.

The President, as well as the Minister for Agriculture and  the  Premier  of
the Western Cape, emphasised the importance of delivery. Our  department  in
the Western Cape has taken up this challenge and will embark  on  a  journey
to make the Western Cape a home for all its people.

In die gees  van  Ikapa  Elihlumayo  het  die  departement  vir  hom  sekere
meetbare doelwitte gestel om binne die eerste 100 dae van die nuwe  regering
in die Wes-Kaap reeds `n verskil te maak om die lewensomstandighede van  die
mense van die Wes-Kaap nie net in die korttermyn nie,  maar  ook  volhoubaar
oor die medium- en langtermyne te verbeter. Ek wil graag vir u `n  paar  van
hierdie doelwitte uitlig. Die eerste een is die daarstelling van  `n  groei-
en  ontwikkelingstrategie  vir   landbou.   Die   departement   landbou   in
samewerking met alle rolspelers in die  provinsie  sal  binne  die  volgende
drie  maande   die   knelpunte   wat   tydens   ons   onlangse   spitsberaad
geïdentifiseer is, ondersoek om `n omvattende strategie saam  te  stel.  Die
eerste byeenkoms het onlangs met groot sukses plaasgevind.  Hier  is  sekere
knelpunte  geïdentifiseer,  naamlik  grondhervorming  en  swart   ekonomiese
bemagtiging, voedselveiligheid en  -sekuriteit  en  mededingendheid  van  en
markte vir ons boere. Landbou sal ook sy bydrae lewer  tot  die  formulering
van `n ekonomiese strategie vir die provinsie.

En  dan  is  daar  `n  strategie  ter  verbetering  van  verhoudinge  tussen
plaaswerkers  en  kommersiële  boere.  `n  Strategie  sal   ontwikkel   word
waarvolgens die stremminge in die verhouding tussen  plaaswerkers  en  boere
op onder andere ministeriële vlak  aangespreek  sal  word.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the spirit  of  Ikapa  Elihlumayo  the  department  set  itself  certain
measurable  objectives  already  within  the  first  100  days  of  the  new
government  in  the  Western  Cape  to  make  a  difference  in  the  living
conditions of the people of the Western Cape, not only in  the  short  term,
but also to improve it sustainably over the medium and long  term.  I  would
like to highlight a few of these objectives. Firstly, there is the  creation
of a growth and development strategy  for  agriculture.  The  department  of
agriculture, in co-operation with all  the  role-players  in  the  province,
will  within  the  following  three  months  investigate   the   bottlenecks
identified during the  recent  summit  conference  in  order  to  compile  a
comprehensive  strategy.  The  first  meeting  held  recently  was  a  great
success. Here certain problem areas were identified, namely land reform  and
black economic empowerment, food safety and security and competitiveness  of
and markets for our farmers. Agriculture will also make its contribution  to
formulating an economic strategy for the province.

And then there is a strategy for the improvement  of  relationships  between
farmworkers and commercial farmers. A strategy will be  developed  according
to which  the  constraints  on  the  relationship  between  farmworkers  and
farmers will, inter alia, be addressed at ministerial level.]

According to the World Organisation  for  Animal  Health,  South  Africa  is
allowed to export lamb meat to Europe  from  areas  free  of  foot-and-mouth
disease. However, until now the European Union did not  accept  bone-in-meat
as a result of their fear of  this  disease.  The  Western  Cape  department
submitted a presentation to the national department  to  enable  us  all  to
appeal against  the  decision  at  the  World  Trade  Organisation  and  the
European Union, that they were wrong in banning exports from  South  Africa.
The Karoo has now been identified as  a  locality  from  where  bone-in-lamb
meat would be exported on a  trial  basis.  We  have  already  registered  a
couple of farms and strict conditions have been set for  the  management  of
the farms. The farms are  mainly  in  the  Beaufort-West  and  Prins  Albert
areas. Sheep will be slaughtered at  the  new  Swellendam  export  abattoir.
This export initiative will bring more jobs to this area and the economy  of
the region will benefit from it.

En dan `n kliënte-opname; die departement landbou het `n omvattende kliënte-
opname onderneem om sy dienslewering behoefte-gedrewe te hou en  in  voeling
te kom met die persepsies van sy  kliënte.  Hierdie  opname  sal  binne  die
volgende drie maande voltooi  en  geïnterpreteer  word  en  die  uitslae  in
strategiese  aksies  omskryf  word  om  geïdentifiseerde  behoeftes  aan  te
spreek.  Die  departement  is  toegewyd  tot  uitnemendheid  in  terme   van
dienslewering. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[And then a  client  survey;  the  department  of  agriculture  undertook  a
comprehensive client survey to keep its service delivery  needs  driven  and
to get in touch with the perceptions of its clients.  This  survey  will  be
completed and interpreted within the next three months and the results  will
be defined in strategic actions to address identified needs. The  department
is dedicated to excellence in terms of service delivery.]

A database of all LRAD projects  connected  to  the  geographic  information
system will be  completed  in  three  months'  time.  Information  regarding
location, availability of water, quality of soil, etc, will  be  identified.
The value of the database is that when a  market  is  found  for  a  certain
product, the database will indicate where  beneficiaries  of  LRAD  will  be
best able to produce this product.

Deputy Chair, members, as indicated earlier, in an  effort  to  address  the
injustices of the past the programme on land reform  and  transformation  is
of the highest priority. But it is also important  that  we  develop  a  new
breed of farmers that will be equipped to become sustainable, in  an  effort
to create new jobs  and  contribute  to  the  provincial  economy.  In  this
regard,  the  Directorate:  Farmer  Settlement   and   the   Subdirectorate:
Extension  amalgamated  to  form  the  farmers'  support   and   development
programme. In essence, this means that the priority of the Western  Cape  is
realised in that the complete package required by farmers is now  housed  in
one  programme  and  also  underpins  the  philosophy  and   principles   of
agricultural development.

But what does this mean? Firstly, the focus  and  mandate  has  changed.  It
means provision for the extension, support and facilitation of training  for
farmers,   with   special   emphasis   on   developing   emerging   farmers,
implementation of land reform programmes and agricultural rural  development
projects. The mandate manifests itself in five subprogrammes, and these  are
Farmer  Settlement   Facilities,   Training   and   Co-ordination   of   the
implementation of the  LRAD  programme,  including  the  administration  and
management of disposable land, the agricultural  infrastructure  scheme  and
the disposal of agricultural state land.

The subprogramme Farmer Support Services  provides  extension  and  advisory
services and  facilitates  training  of  commercial  and  emerging  farmers,
including the co-ordination of  rural  agricultural  projects,  as  well  as
facilitating organisational  development  and  capacity-building  of  farmer
groups. The subprogramme Food Security co-ordinates and  implements  various
food security projects, as highlighted and adopted in  the  Integrated  Food
Security Strategy of South Africa.

The subprogramme ``Casedra'' reflects  the  undertaking  by  the  provincial
government, through a shareholders' compact agreement, to maintain the  core
institutional capacity of the organisation and to deliver services  such  as
rural development projects and support  to  LRAD  projects.  The  farmworker
development project is currently being established and it is  foreseen  that
the challenges of delivery of services to  this  vulnerable  group  will  be
based on agricultural interventions and co-ordination of social needs.

Land reform forms a crucial part of the overall programme's priorities.  The
land reform subprogramme, Integrated Food Security and  Nutrition  Programme
as well as the Transformation of Certain Rural Areas Act  will  dictate  the
development agenda of this programme quite a lot.  In  addition,  the  Urban
Renewal Strategy and the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development  Programme
will also demand budgetary allocations and, therefore, services.

The support to build strong farmers' organisations at  district  level  must
be expanded to enhance service delivery and improve the overall  performance
of the programme. Agricultural development  is  the  overall  priority.  The
Farmer Support and Development Programme encompasses the  broad  development
agenda of the  department  of  agriculture,  meaning  that  the  design  and
implementation  are  predominantly  for  supporting  black  farmers  in  the
Western Cape province, but does not  exclude  the  commercial  sector.  This
support to beneficiaries ranges from land reform to institutional  capacity-
building. Given  that  the  predominant  need  for  the  development  of  an
equitable and diverse agricultural sector has been identified,  80%  of  the
budget  will  be  utilised  to  build  the  capacity   of   the   historical
disadvantaged communities and individuals.  The  commercial  sector  employs
more than 200  000  people,  and  therefore,  20%  of  the  budget  will  be
allocated to support this sector.

Ten slotte wil ek namens die Wes-Kaap die Minister bedank vir  die  rol  wat
sy en haar departement speel om `n klimaat te skep waarin landbou  in  Suid-
Afrika kan gedy. Ek wil weer eens die Minister verseker dat die Wes-Kaap  se
departement ten volle ingekoop het in die strategiese plan  vir  landbou  in
Suid-Afrika. Elke  amptenaar  van  ons  departement  in  die  Wes-Kaap  werk
daagliks met toewyding en ywer aan die kontrak om armoede te  verlig  en  `n
tuiste te skep vir al ons mense. Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion, on behalf of the Western Cape, I would  like  to  thank  the
Minister for the role she and her  department  are  playing  in  creating  a
climate in which agriculture can prosper. I would once again  like  to  give
the Minister the assurance that the  Western  Cape's  department  has  fully
bought into the strategic plan for agriculture in South Africa. Daily  every
official of our department in the Western Cape  works  with  dedication  and
diligence on the contract to alleviate poverty and create  a  home  for  all
our people. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

Mr J O  TLHAGALE:  Hon  Chair,  hon  Ministers  present  here,  hon  special
delegates from the various provinces of our country and my  hon  colleagues,
agriculture is an important sector of the country's economy in terms of  its
impact on  job  creation,  rural  development,  food  security  and  foreign
exchange.  Although  commercial  farming  plays  a  dominant   role,   small
subsistence and emerging  farming  is  also  important  for  its  impact  on
poverty alleviation and job creation in the rural areas.

In the North West province, which is predominantly rural, it  is  critically
important to exploit this industry to  its  maximum  potential.  The  recent
announcement by the President of the re-establishment  of  the  agricultural
credit board is to the emerging farmers a dream come true.

In respect of land restitution it  is  gratifying  to  report  that  several
communities in  the  province  have  regained  their  ancestral  land.  Land
redistribution in the province is also progressing at  a  satisfactory  pace
and both have the support of many South Africans across the  racial  divide.
These achievements allay the fears of many farmers who are now beginning  to
believe that the problem of our northern  neighbour  will  not  be  repeated
here as promised by the President on  several  occasions.  I  will  be  less
honest if I do not, at this stage, applaud the hon Minister for  Agriculture
and Land Affairs for the able manner in which she too,  is  circumnavigating
this agricultural ship for the good of all residents of this country.

However, our farmers need to realise that this opportunity is very rare  and
will not repeat itself. The best option at their disposal is  to  work  that
land to its maximum potential.  It  is  disheartening  to  see,  in  certain
circumstances, highly productive land neglected and  not  utilised  for  the
benefit of the  owner  as  well  as  of  the  community  at  large.  In  the
Ramatlabama area near Mafikeng, some 18 farms that  were  allocated  to  the
farmers by the previous homeland government for various  reasons  for  which
my time allocation does not allow me to  discuss,  have  collapsed  and  are
presently lying wasted.

These farmers owe rent and other inputs. Getting these farmers out  of  this
quagmire is not a simple task. However, the general feeling  or  thought  is
for the consolidation of all their debts, adding them to the purchase  price
and offering the farms to them to buy. The UCDP supports  the  Budget  Vote.

Ms B N DLULANE: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson.

Oomama abangabaphathiswa siyababulisa kule Ndlu yesibini, ngakumbi  lo  mama
ungu-"timeframe''  igama  lakhe  elitsha.  Siyabulela  ukuba  siphinde  sibe
noomama abasikhokelayo. [We welcome  the  women  Ministers  in  this  second
House, especially that  woman  whose  new  name  is  ``Timeframe''.  We  are
grateful for the fact that we have women who lead us.]
Chairperson, my speech today is on an issue that is very close to my  heart,
which is land. I come from poor rural areas and I  know  the  importance  of
land for survival of people in the areas, especially the poor women who  are
left behind by their husbands who have joined other migrant workers  in  the
cities so that they can provide for their families.

Winning the elections by an overwhelming  majority  shows  that  people  are
happy with the achievements of  the  ANC-led  Government  so  far.  It  also
confirms the trust that people have in Government to  deliver.  As  our  hon
President said in his state of the nation address  -  now  is  the  time  to
deliver.  As  an  NCOP  committee,  we  have  in  judge  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs over this term on its delivery of land  to  the
masses.

Ndiyazi ukuba bakho abantu abagxeka isebe eli besithi  abakawuboni  umahluko
kumsebenzi  walo.  Abu  bantu  ngabantu  abathanda  nje   ukugxeka   nalapho
kungafunekiyo,   nabantu   abangafuni   zinto   zintle,   njenge-DA   le   -
njengesiqhelo ke phofu. [We know that  there  are  people  who  are  cynical
about the department, saying they have not  yet  seen  it  making  progress.
They are criticising destructively and are against progress, just  like  the
DA that always does that.]

Let me state categorically that  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs, despite the challenges it faced, has achieved a lot  over  the  10-
year period of our democracy, with its land reform  programmes,  to  address
the imbalances of the past through accelerating land delivery to  the  poor.
Since 1994 about 3,2 million hectares of land have been delivered under  the
three components of the Land Reform Programme. More than 700  00  households
have benefited from that land.

Siyabona,  sisiva  kwaye  sifunda   rhoqo   koomabonakude,   koonomathotholo
nakumaphephandaba ngabantu  bethu  abathi  impilo  yabo  yaphucuka  ngakumbi
bakufumana umhlaba wokulima okanye indawo yokuhlala. Utata uTlhagale  ugqiba
kutsho  ngoku.  Ukuba  ndinokuzikhankanya  zonke  ezo   zinto,   asingekwazi
ukugoduka namhlanje. Umzekelo  omhle  ulapha  ebumelwaneni,  iDistrict  Six.
Abantu  ababefudula  behlala  apho  baza  basuswa   ngolunya   nonyhamnyheko
ngurhulumente wocalucalulo, bayabuyela. (Translation of  isiXhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[We see on TV, read in the newspapers  and  hear  on  the  radio  about  the
improvement in  the  living  conditions  of  our  people,  especially  after
getting their own places to stay or land to cultivate. Mr Tlhagale has  just
confirmed that now. If I can list all  of  those  things,  we  would  listen
forever. A good example is just around the  corner,  in  the  neighbourhood,
District Six. The people who were forcibly removed by the  apartheid  regime
are now being returned.]

Progress has been made and maintained  with  regard  to  the  redistribution
programme,  particularly  where   land   redistribution   for   agricultural
development is concerned, through which  a  large  number  of  beneficiaries
have obtained land for agricultural purposes.  To  date  the  redistribution
programme has delivered 1,8 million hectares  of  land  out  of  an  overall
total of 3,2 million hectares delivered through all the programmes over  the
10-year period of our democracy. That exceeds the target the department  set
for itself. Congratulations, hon Minister, through your department.

Given the progress made so far, I am  confident  that  the  department  will
meet the target set by the President to redistribute 30% of  land  available
for agriculture among previously disadvantaged  citizens  by  2015.  Let  me
just mention one of the  success  stories  of  the  programme,  the  Nkomazi
Project. The 241 LRAD grant beneficiaries were able to make  gross  earnings
of about  R100  000  through  the  Nkomazi  Project,  which  exceeded  their
expectations by a big margin. We thank you again for that.

In terms of the programme of land restitution, a  total  of  48  825  claims
were settled by the end of March this year, with 122 292  households  having
benefited from 810 292 hectares of land. The Land Claims Commission  has  22
000 outstanding claims to settle by December 2005. I am sure we are  capable
of doing that.

In the past year there was more focus on  the  rural  areas  and  this  will
continue. Over the 12 months that ended on 31  March  2004,  the  number  of
rural  claims  settled  included  claims  at  Guba  near  Queenstown,  Thaba
Batswana in the Free State - I have a problem pronouncing  the  name,  which
means that I must learn this language, Sesotho or whatever language  it  is.
I need somebody to teach me, any volunteers - There  is  also  Berglands  in
the Northern Cape, Rooiplan in Limpopo  and  kwaBhayi  in  kwaZulu-Natal.  I
cannot mention all of them because the list is very long.

The criticism by the  DA  and  conservative  white  farmers  that  the  land
restitution programme will compromise food  security  is  unfounded  and  is
made by those who want to maintain the status quo.  There  is  a  number  of
success stories of beneficiaries of land restitution, such as sugar  farmers
in kwaZulu-Natal.

Tata  uTlhagale,  ugqiba  kutsho.  Siyayingqina  le  nto  ubuyithetha.   [Mr
Thlagale, you have just said it. We concur with you.]
It is a great pleasure to acknowledge the fact that  the  number  of  claims
settled this year surpasses the total of 36 488 in March  2003  by  33%.  At
this pace the Land Claims Commission is on the right track  to  meeting  the
target  for  2005  to  have  all  claims  settled.  However,  the  challenge
confronting the Land Claims Commission on this  particular  matter  is  that
the budget allocated to it is not enough. When  you  were  briefing  us  you
told us that you needed to meet this target set for  2005,  but  I  did  not
hear you, hon Minister, plead with us in this House that we must  appeal  to
the relevant authorities for this  budget  allocation  to  be  increased  in
order to be able to meet this target. I understand that for  this  year  the
money allocated to land restitution is the largest and  constitutes  52%  of
the total budget of the department.

Furthermore, the budget for the land restitution programme has increased  to
R933 million this financial year and will increase further by  R1,2  billion
in the next financial year. Although there has been a  significant  increase
in the budget for restitution, it is  not  enough.  According  to  the  Land
Claims Commission, it needs about R13 billion and additional staff of  about
500 to be  able  to  finalise  all  the  claims  by  2005.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms N NAHARA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, let me add my voice  to  those  of
my other colleagues who have spoken before me  by  congratulating  both  our
Ministers who have made the presentations to us today on water  affairs  and
agriculture.

When one talks about agriculture and land  affairs,  one  is  reminded  that
these are some of the difficult things we have experienced in this  country.
Bringing back land to the people has not been an easy thing to  do  in  this
country. I want to  add  my  voice  to  those  of  my  colleagues  who  have
elaborated on the issue of  land  restitution  and  all  the  other  related
issues. In KZN we are part of the people who stand here proud today and  say
that we have black farmers in  our  province.  We  have  female  farmers,  a
phenomenon that never existed before. Some of us grew up  knowing  that  the
farm is a man's business and that it  is  for  the  white  person.  However,
today we are proud to say  that  if  you  go  and  visit  KZN  you  will  be
surprised to see how females can do farming and how they can produce.

In supporting this Budget Vote of Minister Didiza for agriculture  and  land
affairs, I also want to commend her on the  manner  in  which  she  and  her
department have been co-ordinating the work between  the  province  and  her
department. We have had  quite  difficult  issues  to  clear,  such  as  the
settlement of Mbangweni and Manzengwenya.  These  were  the  most  difficult
settlements to do, but we are happy to say that  these  were  settled  in  a
manner that was least expected, without any problems. The  same  applied  to
the settlement in Vryheid whereby our former Premier, Mr Mtshali,  also  got
his title deed to his former home or a home he had lost before.

However, one of the cases that one would like to  comment  on  is  when  the
Bhanya farm was handed over to some farm tenants, people who  never  thought
that one day they would have a home that they could call their  own,  people
who would never have thought that  they  could  be  human  beings  equal  to
others, like all of us in this House. The handing over of  the  Bhanya  farm
to those people has been one of the most interesting and  best  achievements
that we can talk about in KZN.

I want to assure the  Minister  here  that  in  KZN  last  week  I  had  the
portfolio committee sitting. Despite the  fact  that  our  Budget  has  been
reduced, we all agreed that Mama Didiza is there and she  will  always  help
us. To people in KZN there is nothing more important than the land  and  the
farming that we are hoping to realise for them. Of great importance is  also
the programmes that we are looking  forward  to,  for  example,  the  farmer
support and development programme, the empowerment of the  small  sugar-cane
growers who are mainly black people, and the empowerment  of  small  farmers
who are also among rural people. We are looking at this  as  an  achievement
that will take us forward, whereby we will also address unemployment in  the
country.

Chair, I have noticed that there is an easy way in  your  House  to  tell  a
person to shut up by clapping hands, but before that happens, I  would  like
to come back to the Minister of Water Affairs and say: Mama, I  am  inviting
you  to  visit  Mhlabuyalingana.  I  was  happy  when   you   talked   about
Manzengwenya and Mbazwana, but I would like you to  visit  these  areas  and
see what kind of water people are drinking. The  councillors  had  boreholes
erected for us, but that water is no different from that which you  can  get
from any stream in the street. Therefore, we  are  looking  forward  to  you
also, Madam Minister, to come and help us out. The area of  Mhlabuyalingana,
or District 27, is one of the potential areas that,  as  the  government  of
KwaZulu-Natal, we are hoping to make the best tourist destination.  However,
the hon Mr Gwanya will tell you that when he goes to Mhlabuyalingana he  has
to go pass Jozini and carry bottles  of  water.  We  would  really  like  to
overcome that one so that we can address unemployment, which I am  doing  by
promoting tourism. We support the budget. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The easiest way of getting you  to  keep
quiet or finish your speech, all of you, is a one-minute  workshop.  I  will
switch off your microphone from here and you can  hear  that  your  time  is
finished and just round off the sentence and sit down otherwise we  will  be
forced to say, ``keep quiet and sit down''.

Dr F VAN HEERDEN: In my previous  political  life  I  was  in  the  National
Assembly and we used to refer then to the Senate, as it was then known,  and
the NCOP, as it is now known, as the Other Place or ``Die Ander Plek''.

Ek wil nou ook verwys na die Nasionale Vergadering, as  ek  hier  praat,  as
die Ander Plek. [I also want to refer to the National Assembly now,  when  I
speak here, as the Other Place.]

In yesterday's debate the FF Plus did not take part. It was  not  necessary.
Let me briefly say why.

In vanoggend se Die Burger is daar `n duidelike berig wat sê Didiza  is  bly
dat die ANC en die DA hier hande vat. [In this morning's Die  Burger,  there
is a clear article stating that Didiza is glad  that  the  ANC  and  DA  are
taking hands here.]
I am going to quote from this report and then revert back to the  FF  Plus's
election manifesto, and you will see why it was not  necessary  for  the  FF
Plus to have been there.

In hierdie berig, onder andere, pleit dr Manie  Schoeman  van  die  ANC  vir
ingryping in opleiding en landbounavorsing. Hy sê ook  dat  dit  noodsaaklik
is dat Suid-Afrikaanse boere deur opleiding en navorsing bemagtig moet  word
om met die regte tegnologie bestuur, variëteit en  teling  by  te  hou.  Mnr
Maans Nel van die DA versoek dat die boere se positiewe gesindheid  ingestel
word om grondhervorming te maak werk. Die samevatting is dat die DA  en  die
ANC se toesprake hul steun vir ordelike grondhervorming,  die  herinstelling
van die Landboukredietraad  en  groter  aandag  aan  die  landbou  navorsing
uitgespreek het.

Wat  die  VF  Plus  se  verkiesingsmanifes  aanbetref,  hier   volg   enkele
aanhalings daaruit: ``Die VF Plus  erken  die  strategiese  waarde  van  die
landbou as voedselprodusent en werkverskaffer  in  Suid-Afrika.''  Dit  gaan
verder om te sê dat, ``... daarom is die VF Plus gekant teen  die  inperking
van  fondse  vir  die  Landbounavorsingsraad  en  sal  ons  ons  beywer  vir
genoegsame finansiële ondersteuning vir landbounavorsing en  ander  terreine
waar finansiële steun vanaf die staat noodsaaklik is''. Dit word  gesê  hier
in die berigte van gister se debat dat dit nie nodig was nie.  Trouens,  die
ANC en die DA het geargumenteer wat die VF Plus alreeds gesê het en wat  die
VF Plus ook ondersteun.

`n Verdere aspek is dat die grondkwessie as `n prioriteit beskou word om  `n
soortgelyke situasie as in Zimbabwe te vermy. Ons is steeds van  mening  dat
daar genoeg grond vir herverdeling beskikbaar is en dat die  administratiewe
gesloer opgeskort moet word. Die VF Plus se  standpunt  is  dat  onbruikbare
staatsgrond  dadelik  aangewend  moet  word  vir  herverdeling  en  dat  die
beginsel van  vrywillige  verkoper  en  vrywillige  koper  moet  geld.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In this article, Dr Manie Schoeman of the ANC is pleading, inter alia,  for
intervention in training and agricultural research. He also says that it  is
necessary that South African farmers must be empowered through training  and
research in order to stay abreast  of  the  correct  technology  management,
variety and breeding. Mr Maans Nel of the  DA  requests  that  the  farmers'
positive disposition be utilised to make land reform work.

The summary of this is that the speeches of the DA  and  the  ANC  expressed
their  support  for  orderly  land  reform,   the   reinstitution   of   the
Agricultural  Credit  Board  and  greater  attention  to   be   devoted   to
agricultural research.

As far as the election manifesto of the FF Plus is  concerned,  here  are  a
few quotes from it:


  The FF Plus  recognises  the  strategic  value  of  agriculture  as  food
  producer and job creator in South Africa.

It further states that -


  ... therefore the FF Plus is opposed to the curtailment of funds for  the
  Agricultural Research Council and we will strive for sufficient financial
  support for  agricultural  research  and  other  fields  where  financial
  support from the state is imperative.

It is being said here in the articles on yesterday's  debate  that  this  is
not necessary. As a matter of fact, the ANC and the  DA  were  arguing  what
the FF Plus has said before and what the FF Plus is also supporting.

Another aspect is that the land question should be seen  as  a  priority  in
order to prevent a similar situation to that in Zimbabwe. We  are  still  of
the opinion that enough  land  is  available  for  redistribution  and  that
administrative dawdling must be stopped. The view of the  FF  Plus  is  that
unused state land must be made available for  land  reform  immediately  and
that the principle of willing seller,  willing  buyer  should  apply.  [Time

Cllr I HLEKO (Salga): Deputy Chairperson,  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry, Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs, members  of  the  NCOP,
comrades and friends, the SA Local Government Association's objective is  to
assist municipalities in delivering services  in  an  equitable,  affordable
and  sustainable  manner.  We  applaud  President  Mbeki's  instruction   to
Government that all households must have access to clean  running  water  by
2009; that more  than  300  000  households  must  be  provided  with  basic
sanitation during this financial year;  that  by  the  end  of  the  2004-05
financial year all schools must have access to clean water  and  sanitation;
and that a review of the equitable share  allocation  and  local  government
resources be completed within six months. Salga recognises that not all  our
people are  benefiting  from  Government  policies  as  a  result  of  local
governments' track record in service  delivery.  We  therefore  welcome  the
focus on the functioning and resources of local government.

We recognise that many municipalities need  to  improve  the  efficiency  of
their water and sanitation services. It is time to ensure  that  our  people
get the services to which they are constitutionally entitled.  The  decrease
in the water and sanitation services component in the  department's  2004-05
budget reflects the transfer  of  infrastructure  and  the  operational  and
maintenance costs of water and sanitation services to local  government,  as
contained in  the  municipal  infrastructure  grant,  the  capacity-building
grant and the equitable share. As at this financial year,  the  delivery  of
water and sanitation  services  to  our  people  will  rest  solely  on  the
shoulders of local government.

The increases in budget also reflect the  envisaged  establishment  of  CMAs
and the transfer of water schemes to  local  government.  But,  in  reality,
this is a debate on whether our people, especially the poorest of the  poor,
will get access to water and  sanitation  services.  This  is  a  debate  on
whether  the  budget  allocations  for  support  to  local   government   in
delivering water and sanitation services are  sufficient.  The  delivery  of
basic water and services will reach the 10 million mark this year, with  the
complete eradication of the backlog in the water  services  by  2008  -  far
ahead of the UN millennium target of 2015. Sadly, progress in  the  delivery
of sanitation services has been much slower.

In terms of sanitation, Salga wishes to highlight three critical areas.  The
first area is that  the  country  cannot  have  a  one-size-fits-all  policy
regarding the appropriate level of sanitation delivery in urban,  peri-urban
and rural areas. While we accept that in rural areas  a  VIP  is  often  the
most cost-effective form of service delivery, the same cannot  be  said  for
urban  and  peri-urban  areas.  Urban  and  peri-urban  areas  are   densely
populated  and,  in  most  instances,  were  given  access   to   waterborne
sanitation prior to 1994. Politically persuading residents  in  these  areas
to accept VIPs is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Delivering  VIPs  in
these  areas  then  centres  on  an  economic  argument.  Salga  urges   the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to rethink its  position  that  the
delivery of VIPs is the appropriate  level  of  sanitation  for  all  areas,
because we are saying it cannot be the same in all areas.

Equally important is that the White  Paper  on  Basic  Household  Sanitation
offers municipalities limited guidance on the practicalities  of  delivering
affordable basic sanitation services to households with low incomes in  more
densely settled areas. Secondly, grants given  to  local  government,  until
the introduction of the municipal infrastructure grant did not fund zinc  or
steel top structures. Therefore most toilets being built in terms  of  rural
sanitation programmes will not be movable.

A long-term perspective is needed if we are to avoid  a  landscape  littered
with derelict, unusable toilets. Current  approaches  tend  to  focus  on  a
permanent top structure with  the  decision  about  how  to  empty  the  pit
postponed to a later date. In many areas, dislodging is simply not  feasible
for reasons of health, safety, access, cost and so  on.  So,  these  toilets
will probably have to be taken apart when the pit is full. Urgent  attention
must be given to using different materials or designs, which allow  the  top
structure to be movable when dislodging is not a realistic option.

Thirdly, the current situation is  that  too  many  rural  schools  have  no
toilets at all. The majority have too few toilets or  not  enough  that  are
usable and safe. This impacts on the quality  of  the  learning  environment
and poses health problems for the broader community. Sanitation  in  schools
is the responsibility of the provincial department of  education,  with  the
municipality's responsibility for water and sanitation  services  ending  at
the boundary of the school property. As  a  result  of  the  extent  of  the
school's infrastructure  backlog,  the  department  of  education  does  not
prioritise water and sanitation ahead  of  any  other  infrastructure  need.
Thus,  sanitation  is  only  addressed  in  the   context   of   the   broad
rehabilitation and refurbishment of a  school,  or  when  a  new  school  is
built. This can lead to lengthy delays in addressing school sanitation.

Should the municipality  infrastructure  grant  make  provision  for  school
water and sanitation infrastructure where a municipality is willing to  take
this on? That is the question we are posing. In the context of the scale  of
the sanitation backlog, Salga has concerns that the department's  increasing
focus on the establishment of catchment management agencies may  affect  the
level of support to  local  government,  especially  at  a  time  when  that
support will be critical  to  local  government's  capacity  to  fulfil  its
obligation to deliver water and sanitation services to all our people.  With
the exception of our concerns expressed here today  and  last  week  in  the
National Assembly's Portfolio  Committee  on  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
Salga supports the department's budget for 2004-05. Thank you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, I  endorse
every word my colleague Ms Nahara said on KwaZulu-Natal. Agriculture is  one
of the  most  important  components  of  a  country's  economy.  Agriculture
impacts on job creation, rural development, food security, foreign  exchange
and other livelihood related issues. In our country our historical past  has
witnessed  a  polarisation  between  the  haves  and  the   have-nots   into
categories of commercial farmers  and  subsistence  farmers.  Today  we  are
pleased to have mechanisms in place to address those very imbalances.

The R200 million intended to support the resettlement of farmers is  a  move
in the right direction in that the need for  agricultural  capacity-building
is taken into account. The R60 million earmarked for land  care  is  further
encouragement in terms of the enlistment of agriculture in this country.  In
the province of KwaZulu-Natal, many thousands of hectares of state land  lay
fallow for many  years  owing  to  the  incompetency  of  the  national  and
provincial governments. We are pleased that there has been a  delegation  of
powers  from  the  national  Department   of   Agriculture   to   provincial
governments to enable them to identify prospective  farmers  and  to  either
lease  or  dispose  of  such  land,  which  will  result  in  the  immediate
utilisation of land which has lain fallow for many years.

One of the grave concerns is the price structure of state land,  and  it  is
therefore our submission that state land particularly not  be  subjected  to
market-related  prices,  but  that  we   consider   what   the   subsistence
agricultural community can afford. Of economic importance  is  the  intended
agricultural credit scheme, which we welcome. Here, again,  our  concern  is
the interest factor - whether there should be  a  special  dispensation  for
different levels of the farming community. The present Land  Bank  rates  do
not contribute to or encourage the farming community. In  order  to  venture
into agriculture, we should introduce  policies  and  institutionalise  food
production and farmer support systems. We need to defeat the  past  and  our
painful history. We need to give hope to our people. We  must  be  decisive,
innovative, careful and determined to move forward.

Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo, izwe nomhlaba  yimpilo  yomuntu  wonke  futhi  kuzo
zonke izizwe. KwaZulu-Natal la ngivela khona siphila ngawo, uyimpilo  yethu.

paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, land and soil is everyone's life  and  this  is  the  case
across nations. In KwaZulu-Natal, where I come from, we live on it,  and  it
is our life. Many people do not have  any  support  system  other  than  the
soil. The land and the soil produce crops, fruit, flowers,  plants,  forests
and the other things we need.

What the hon Minister can do to help the needy people  is  to  provide  them
with seeds and other resources. She can also help those who  need  knowledge
by providing them with proper agricultural skills so that they can  preserve
the soil instead of causing soil erosion.

The hon Minister of  the  department  can  help  those  who  need  water  by
interacting with the Minister of Water Affairs so that  they  could  acquire
skills to preserve  water  during  the  rainy  season.  In  her  speech  she
mentioned that due to the shortage of water, the  country  would  soon  turn
into a desert.

Hon Chairperson and the House, may I thank you on  behalf  of  my  province,
KwaZulu-Natal. Although I have not congratulated my sisters, I have  already
said  that  I  supported  the   speaker   who   represented   KwaZulu-Natal.
Congratulations, girls, and keep up the good work. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr N MACK: Deputy Chairperson and protocol  observers,  allow  me  to  thank
both hon Ministers for, in the short  time  I  have  been  here,  they  have
inspired me. This is my maiden speech, but I am  making  it  from  the  side
that is rapidly becoming an endangered male species.

It is an honour that I humbly accepted to participate in  this  budget  vote
debate.  I  thank  my  organisation,  the  African  National  Congress,  for
affording me this opportunity. It is with African pride and solidarity  that
I  stand  here  to  represent  a  newly  liberated  Western  Cape  Province.
[Applause.] The South African Bill of Rights enshrined in  the  Constitution
makes provision for legally enforceable economic and social rights, such  as
the right to education, health care, clean  water  and  sanitation  and  the
right to a clean environment. The 1997  White  Paper  on  Water  Policy  for
South Africa and the National Water  Act,  Act  36  of  1998  entrusted  our
Government with the  responsibility  of  being  the  trustee  of  our  water
resources.

South  Africa  is  a  water-scarce  country  with   an   erratic   rainfall.
Accordingly,  water  is  transported  over  long  distances  from  areas  of
relative abundance to areas  of  increasing  demand.  There  are  still  6,2
million people whose source of water is more  than  200  metres  away.  This
service needs to improve urgently to be in line with the Reconstruction  and
Development Programme standards so that we can bring it to a minimum of  200
metres and preferably  into  the  homes  of  people.  Affordable  water  and
sanitation must be provided to the people of South Africa.  The  free  basic
water  policy  was  launched  in  July  2001  and  by  June  2003,  78%   of
municipalities were implementing this policy providing more than 27  million
people with free basic water services.

Nonetheless, I am aware that certain municipalities do  not  abide  by  this
policy  and  I  want  to  agree  with  the  Reverend  that  most  of   these
municipalities are those who do not share our vision. We  must  educate  our
people on how to use their legally enforceable right. To eradicate  backlogs
with  regard  to  access  to  water  and  sanitation  by   2008   and   2010
respectively, future funding to this extent is expected to increase  through
the Municipal Infrastructure Grant. Schedule 4 of the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa, Act 108  of  1996  vests  the  responsibility  for
water supply systems and domestic waste-water and sewage disposal  in  local
government.

However, national Government has a constitutional responsibility to  support
and strengthen the capacity of municipalities to manage their  own  affairs.
It  also  has  the  authority  to  see  to  the  effective  performance   by
municipalities of their functions as matters listed in Schedule 4 and  5  of
the Constitution. Therefore, the principle that funds must  follow  function
is key to success. The World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  held  in
South Africa in August 2002 and the Third World Water Forum  held  in  Japan
in  March  2003  portray  South  Africa  as  being  held  in   high   regard
internationally. This is based on the country's reputation  for  sustainable
use of forest resources, our groundbreaking  approaches  to  water  resource
use and protection and for making the right to water a reality for  millions
who did not have it before 1994. South Africa's leadership  role  in  Africa
continues  through  the  agencies  of  the  Southern   African   Development
Community and the New Partnership for Africa's Development  -  Nepad.  These
co-operative efforts have produced practical results such as the  completion
of the Magalies Dam, Phase 1B of the Lesotho Highlands  Water  Project,  the
signing of a water-sharing agreement for the Inkomati River  by  Mozambique,
Swaziland and South Africa.

The past few years have shown a number of achievements in the management  of
water resources in South Africa and the  implementation  of  the  nationally
acclaimed National Water Act, Act 36 of 1998. Key achievements, among  other
things, include  the  development  of  conservation  and  demand  management
strategies for the industrial, agricultural and domestic sectors;  promoting
water conservation and  integrated  water  resource  management;  developing
learning resources and  support  material;  launching  the  Woman  in  Water
awards  and  integrating  water  related  issues   in   the   outcomes-based
curriculum. Other  achievements  are  formal  networking,  consultation  and
communication strategies;  the  pilot  cholera  education  project  and  the
continued participation  in  the  United  Nations-HABITAT  Co-ordinator  for
Water for African Cities Programme at various levels. There are  more,  from
registering  significant  abstract  users  of  raw  water  to   the   proper
management of scarce water resources and the  implementation  of  a  pricing
strategy as promulgated in 1998.

As I come from a semidesert region, the Central Karoo in Beaufort  West,  we
really appreciated the 20 000 job opportunities that were  created  for  the
Working for Water Programme. It is a labour  initiative  to  clear  invasive
alien plants and it focuses on the most marginalised, that is the poor,  the
rural communities, women, disabled persons and those living with HIV/Aids.
Forestry South Africa has developed one of the largest  planted  forests  in
the  world.  Furthermore,   collectively   the   forestry   sector   employs
approximately 151 000 people of whom 60 000 are full time and  are  employed
in the primary sector,  while  the  rest  are  employed  in  the  processing
industries.

In response to managing the forestry sector in South Africa  the  Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry is  pursuing  a  reform  programme  that  will
eventually foresee the Government leasing all state  owned  forest  land  to
the private sector operators. We totally agree, but I must  warn  that  when
we transfer we must be very careful and watch for companies fronting,  which
is something that is rearing its ugly head in many companies.

The department will thus move from the  management  of  plantations  towards
promoting, regulating and developing the forestry industry. There  are  some
achievements in forestry and no one can tell me that our Government has  not
done  well  in  these  ten  years  of  democracy.   Progress   in   forestry
restructuring reached a milestone with the closure of the  forestry  trading
account at the start of the financial year. The following  example  I  would
like  to  mention  is  one  of  the  highlights  of  progress  made  in  the
restructuring  of  the  state  forest  assets,  namely  sustainable   forest
management. A number of hectares of the state  forest  were  sold  to  black
empowerment companies representing  communities  living  near  those  forest
plantations. The decision by Government to restructure its forestry  assets,
not only those managed by the Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry  but
also those managed by the SA Forestry Company Limited,  SAFCOL,  has  had  a
marked impact on the companies since 2001. [Time expired.]

Ms M MABE: Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  Ministers  and
Deputy Ministers present, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, Vision 2014  of
the ANC manifesto states that the focus should be on:


  ... the measures that can and will set our country on the road to  faster
  realisation of the ideals of our Constitution - a free South Africa  that
  truly belongs to all who live in it, a South Africa whose wealth is  used
  to improve the quality of life of all citizens, and a South  Africa  that
  works with humanity, to build a better Africa and a better world.

It is in this spirit that  the  province  will  focus  all  its  efforts  on
growing the economy to better the lives of all our  people.  The  quest  for
accelerated economic growth and job creation, accompanied  by  an  equitable
fair distribution of the benefits, serves as an  overall  objective  of  the
Free State province. I  will  briefly  touch  on  challenges  faced  by  the
province, and they are: land reform, financial support and the role  of  the
Land Bank, farmer settlement and support, and agri-processing.

Land and property rights remain a highly contentious area in  South  Africa.
It is well known that systematic  dispossession,  forced  removals  and  the
implementation of various discriminatory land laws under apartheid had  left
a legacy of highly skewed patterns of property  relations,  favouring  white
ownership in South Africa. The unquestionable  need  to  address  this  gave
rise to the various land reform provisions in the  Constitution.  We,  as  a
province, strongly believe that there is an urgent need  for  communal  land
reform. However, reform in this area will affect just 13%  of  the  land  in
South Africa, most of which is currently state owned.

Therefore  it  cannot  by  itself  provide  a  solution  either  to   severe
overcrowding that is prevalent in communal  areas,  or  the  highly  unequal
distribution of land. Land  reform  is  central  to  the  success  of  South
Africa's political and economic transformation. Land  represents  the  basis
of economic activity in a community, and is a vital resource to  sustainable
livelihood. The alienation of people from  their  land  was  a  central  and
recurring theme in South Africa's  history  of  segregation  and  apartheid.
Dispossession cut  the  majority  of  South  Africans  off  from  access  to
independent  livelihoods,  forcing  them  into  overcrowded  reserves,   and
leaving them with few survival options other than selling their labour.

The fundamental challenge for  a  democratic  South  Africa  is  to  restore
people's access to productive resources, including land,  thereby  enhancing
their social and economic security  and  self-reliance.  For  the  equitable
distribution of land and security  of  tenure,  and  essential  to  justice,
reconciliation and transformation, there is a need  for  the  government  of
the day to ensure provision and access to production  and  income-generating
assets  such  as  land  and  credit.  This  addresses  the  key,  underlying
structural basis of poverty and inequality in South Africa.

Consequently, our Government believes that the  primary  objectives  of  the
state land policy should be to confirm and strengthen  the  existing  tenure
rights of people living on communally owned land, that is,  to  redistribute
land equitably and increasing  people's  access  to  land,  particularly  in
rural areas, in order to address historical legacies  of  dispossession  and
overcrowding; to safeguard the tenure rights of women and other groups  that
have typically had the least access to land; to enable those with access  to
land to use it productively, beneficially and in a sustainable  manner;  and
to restore the community's control over their own lives and  development  by
allowing them to  participate  in  decision-making  about  land  allocation,
tenure and use.

These then constitute benchmarks against which we must assess  the  Communal
Land Rights Bill. In the South African context the Free State  produces  33%
of the national maize crop, 51% of the sorghum crop, and 32%  of  the  wheat
produce in the country. It is  the  second  largest  producer  of  sunflower
seed, groundnuts and dry beans. Furthermore, a substantial  portion  of  the
country's potato production is also produced in this province. Twenty  three
percent of the national  wool  clip  and  18%  of  all  dairy  products  are
produced in the Free State. Hence the fact that the Free State occupies  the
position of being South Africa's bread-basket.

The Free State's agricultural production consists of  54%  field  crop,  12%
horticultural products and 34% animal and animal products. Research  reveals
that we need to grow, in order  to  add  value  to  existing  products,  and
expand in order to enter into the  new  agri-industrial  base  of  the  Free
State, since most agricultural  products  leave  the  province  unprocessed.
Considering the current low prices for maize and wheat together with  global
market trends, it is a strategic  decision  to  expand  the  agri-industrial
base into new segments, namely, organic produce,  natural  medicines,  herbs
and spices, essential oils, cosmetics and cut flowers.

Skills development is our Government's priority. It is also one of  the  key
strategies for poverty alleviation  through  implementation  of  internships
and learnerships. Our Government's National Skills Development Strategy  has
laid down a clear vision and objectives  for  us:  ``skills  for  productive
citizenship for all''.

May I say that in our endeavour  to  reach  the  objectives  for  the  above
strategy,  the  province  has  initiated  programmes  in  line  with   these
objectives. We have enrolled 100 learners in ABET programmes. As  we  speak,
16 learners are already undergoing  experimental  training  on  agricultural
line-function programmes at length, and 24 more interns  will  be  recruited
by July 2004 to bring the total  figure  to  40.  In  partnership  with  the
primary agriculture and public service Seta, the province is  preparing  the
workplace for rolling out learnerships before  the  end  of  this  financial
year.

The province has, for the first time this year, budgeted  R2,7  million  for
skills development. With increased funding we can do better,  especially  on
internships and  learnerships  on  special  programmes.  The  low  level  of
participation by women and youth in the  formal  economy,  as  either  small
business owners or entrepreneurs, has for a long time been recognised  as  a
problem in the province. It is important to  recognise  the  important  role
that women and the youth play, and can play, in growing the economy  and  in
creating jobs.

Greater participation by women and youth in the  economy  is  important  for
Government as it forms part of our commitment to transform  the  Free  State
economy. We will  strive  not  only  to  balance  gender  representation  in
management, but to ensure that the voice of women, youth  and  the  disabled
does not go unheard. The province is  enhancing  women  development  through
programmes like the Female Farmer of the Year competition, where  women  are
encouraged to take part in farming business.

On the rationalisation of the economy, according  to  the  Freedom  Charter,
``.... the national wealth of our country, the mineral  wealth  beneath  the
soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the  ownership
of the people as a whole''. Black economic empowerment is an  area  that  is
of importance to the province and to the future success of  the  Free  State
economy. It is imperative for us to implement BEE as it is necessary for  us
to transform our economy. It is not something that we have to apologise  for
as it makes economic sense to have black economic empowerment and  grow  the
number of people who participate in our economy. It is therefore  a  subject
that cannot be divorced from  economic  growth,  job  creation  and  greater
equality in our country, and should  be  embraced  by  all  South  Africans.
Black economics empowerment should not  only  be  seen  in  the  context  of
transforming existing sectors, rather it should be seen as  the  empowerment
of black people through the  creation  of  new  enterprises  in  a  new  and
existing sector.

Black economic empowerment is therefore not only about the legislation  that
was signed by the President earlier this year, rather it is about the  whole
approach as to how the Government is managing the economy  and  creating  an
enabling environment for businesses. We  will  support  black  business  and
expose those companies that use black  people  as  fronts.  The  Broad-Based
Black Economic Empowerment Act and its accompanying strategy  document  have
highlighted several deficiencies  in  the  Preferential  Procurement  Policy
Framework Act, in relation to Government empowerment objectives.

The Department of Agriculture in  the  Free  State  is  in  the  process  of
reviewing the regulations with a view  to  introducing  changes  to  systems
that should become effective during the next three months of  its  financial
year. [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Agb Adjunkvoorsitter,  Ministers,  LURs  en  kollegas,  die
hele kwessie van grondhervorming is 'n baie emosionele saak en moet dus  met
groot omsigtigheid hanteer word. Indien grondhervorming polarisering in  die
land veroorsaak, sal daar geen wenners wees nie en sal  dit  oneindig  skade
berokken.

Die beste voorbeeld  van  hoe  grondhervorming  nie  moet  geskied  nie,  is
natuurlik Zimbabwe. Die negatiewe gevolge van  grondhervorming  in  Zimbabwe
het nie net die landbou  benadeel  nie,  maar  het  die  hele  ekonomie  van
Zimbabwe vernietig. Ek is vol vertroue  dat  daar  oorgenoeg  kundigheid  en
welwillendheid in die land is sodat dit  nooit  in  Suid-Afrika  kan  gebeur
nie. Dit is insiggewend dat wanneer ons as 'n land  gekonfronteer  word  met
'n groot uitdaging, en wanneer ons almal saamwerk, ons  groot  suksesse  kan
behaal.

Die demokratisering  van  Suid-Afrika,  die  skryf  van  die  Grondwet,  die
aanbied  van  die  Rugby-wêreldbeker,  die   Wêreldberaad   oor   Volhoubare
Ontwikkeling en  nou  weer  die  sokkerbod  is  enkele  voorbeelde  van  hoe
suksesvol ons wel kan wees. Ek glo dat almal in die land ten gunste  is  van
grondhervorming en van die DA se kant sal ons alles in ons  vermoë  doen  om
te sorg dat grondhervorming suksesvol deurgevoer word. Ons as politici  moet
sorg dat grondhervorming uit die party-politieke arena geneem word,  en  die
sukses van die projek moet 'n nasionale doelstelling word.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Hon Deputy Chairperson,  Ministers,  MECs  and  colleagues,
the whole question regarding land reform  is  a  very  emotional  issue  and
should therefore be  handled  with  great  circumspection.  If  land  reform
causes polarisation in the country, there will be no  winners  and  it  will
cause endless damage.

The best example of how land reform should not take place  is  Zimbabwe,  of
course. The negative results  of  land  restitution  in  Zimbabwe  not  only
detrimentally affected agriculture, but  also  destroyed  Zimbabwe's  entire
economy. I am confident  that  there  is  more  than  enough  expertise  and
goodwill in the country so that this for this could never  happen  in  South
Africa. It is illuminating that when we as a country are confronted  with  a
major challenge, and when  we  all  work  together,  we  can  achieve  great
successes.

The democratisation of South Africa, the writing of  the  Constitution,  the
hosting of the Rugby World Cup, the World Summit on Sustainable  Development
and now again the soccer bid are but a few examples  of  how  successful  we
can actually be. I believe that everyone in the  country  is  in  favour  of
land reform and on the part of the DA we will do everything in our power  to
ensure that land reform takes place successfully.  We  as  politicians  must
ensure that land reform is taken out of the party-political  arena  and  the
success of the project must become a national objective.]

Chairman,  if  we  fail  with  our  land  reform  initiative,  the  investor
community will pick up the negative signals and respond by simply  investing
elsewhere. This is true for local investors as well as  for  investors  from
abroad. The lack of investment in South Africa is the main reason we  cannot
get our growth rate higher than 3%. We will never reach a 6% growth rate  if
investors remain unsure of a stable  South  Africa.  It  is  thus  extremely
important that our land reform initiatives strengthen investor confidence.

As far as agriculture as  a  business  venture  is  concerned,  there  is  a
perception that it is easy to make a living off the land.  The  contrary  is
actually true. It is in  fact  very  difficult  to  make  a  profit  out  of
farming. Farmers often joke amongst themselves by saying that  if  you  want
to make a small fortune out of farming, you  must  just  start  with  a  big
fortune.

South Africa has a proud record of agricultural successes, and this  we  owe
mainly to the following: the new crop of farmers entering  the  market  from
the 1960s came from an agricultural background; most  new  farmers  had  the
advantage that the family had land and access to capital to  buy  more  land
was fairly easy; the Land Bank was active and the lack of capital was not  a
major problem at all.
Secondly, there were many agricultural schools as well as  highly  effective
agricultural colleges situated throughout South  Africa.  Many  new  farmers
also had ample opportunity to  obtain  university  degrees  in  agriculture.
Added to this is  a  competent  Government  structure  to  give  advice  and
guidance to all farmers, new and old. The co-operative system of  marketing,
with all its negative aspects, made it easy to market products and  to  plan
with a degree of certainty. It  is  absolutely  necessary  to  substantially
assist our new farmers to guarantee success.

If our black empowerment  strategy  focuses  only  on  getting  as  many  as
possible black farmers onto land, our land reform initiative will fail.  Our
main aim must be to have as many successful farmers,  sustaining  themselves
and their families, making profits, employing workers  and  expanding  their
farms. Helping people to get small-holdings which have no  chance  of  being
sustainable is exactly what we must not  do.  This  route  will  bring  more
unemployment and more poverty.

Kenya is  a  prime  example  of  this.  The  successful  farmers  are  doing
extremely well, and the Kenyans with small, unproductive  plots  are  poorer
now than ever before. To be successful our main focus must be  on  training.
Each new farmer must have the expertise to know exactly what to do and  what
to avoid. Where possible,  partnerships  with  existing  successful  farmers
must be promoted and supported. Support resources must be readily  available
and effective.

In a strategic overview the department states that in the past  seven  years
considerable funds have been directed  at  providing  funds  for  access  to
land, but farmer support and advisory services have not  kept  pace.  It  is
hoped that the budget will rectify this imbalance. Lastly, Mr  Chairman,  we
must create the right climate for making land reform  a  national  priority.
Up till now the land reform process has  gone  well  and  with  19  000  new
farmers on the land, the DA wishes them well. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnu  M  A  MZIZI:  Sihlalo,  angiqale  ngenze   njena.   Ngizwile   ukhuluma
ngabaxolisayo, abangaphumelelanga. Nami ngiqhamuka  esifundeni  saseGauteng,
angizanga  ukuxolisa  kodwa  angikubeke  lokhu  Sihlalo   ukuthi   siqhamuka
ezindaweni  ezahlukene,  singamaqembu  angafani  kodwa   siyizingane   sonke
zaseGauteng. Ngakho-ke uma indluinkulu ingaphumelelanga,  kwamukele  sihlalo
ukuthi  kungezizathu  ezizozwakala  uma  bengezanga,  ngoba  bayazi   ukuthi
sibaningi ngapha  bebengayithumela  nenkulumo  abebefisa  ukuthi  siyethule.
Ngakho-ke kwemukele ukungabikho kwabo akungengokudelela. Siyabonga  sihlalo.
[Uhleko.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, let me start by doing this. I heard you  talking
about those who apologised for not attending. I am  also  from  the  Gauteng
province, and although I am not here to apologise, I must say,  Chair,  that
we are from different places, and we are different parties, but we  are  all
children of Gauteng. Therefore, if the members of the royal family  did  not
attend, accept that there are valid reasons for  their  absence.  They  know
that there are many of us here; they  could  have  asked  us  to  deliver  a
speech on their behalf. Therefore accept that their  nonattendance  was  not
as  a  result  of  their  being  contemptuous.   Thank   you,   Chairperson.
[Laughter.]]

Chairperson, the Votes before us are very important to blacks,  to  say  the
least. For many  years  agriculture  was  something  unimportant  after  the
dispossession of land during the years of apartheid. This created  a  vacuum
insofar as the interest of blacks studying agriculture  was  concerned.  Now
that the new Government has restored land to the  dispossessed,  agriculture
will play a very important role in both rural and  urban  communities.  When
we talk about poverty eradication, we say to people  that  communities  must
use land to plant and produce commodities for end use and export.

Angikubeke  lokhu  kuNgqongqoshe.  Ngqongqoshe  angazi  ngoba   naku   nithi
niyabaqeqesha abantu ninayo nemifundaze, angikaze  ngizwe,  engikholwa  nawe
nje impela uyazi, abantu basuka  emalokishini  nasemadeolobheni  bathi  siya
emaNtaliyaneni siyofuna imifino khona. Azoba khona nini lawo mathuba  okuthi
abantu  nabo  sithi  uma  siya  laphaya  emaphandleni   sifike   benemifino,
amaklabishi nokunye, badayise babe nezimakethe zemifino.  Akukenzeki  lokhu,
angazi noma Ngqongqoshe singamavila yini noma kwenzekani kodwa  ngiyakunxusa
ukuthi lokhu ukukubheke ngeso elibanzi ukuze sikwazi empeleni ukuthi  kesibe
nabo abantu abakhiqizayo ngoba angazi ukuthi  siyithatha  kanjani  le  ndaba
yemifino. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Let me put this to the Minister. Minister, I do not know, because  you  say
you train people and you have bursaries that I have never heard of and  -  I
believe you are also aware of that - people from the townships  and  suburbs
are saying they are going to MaNtaliyane to get green vegetables.  When  are
the opportunities going to be available to the people from the  rural  areas
to have green vegetables, cabbages and other things  to  sell  and  to  have
vegetable markets? This has not  yet  happened.  Minister,  I  am  not  sure
whether we are lazy or what is happening, but I am pleading with you to  pay
attention to this so that we may have people growing vegetables,  because  I
do not know how we are to deal with the question of green vegetables. ]

Coming to land affairs, this is a very thorny issue. Land  is  very  scarce.
Even the very little that is made available to black  communities  does  not
add up to much. The lack of skills is a problem. The  Government  will  have
to work very hard to address the issue of  scholarships  in  order  to  send
some of our youngsters to study both agriculture and the  use  of  soil,  so
that when land is made  available  it  will  not  be  regarded  for  grazing
purposes only. People must be aware that land needs  to  be  protected  from
many things. In short, there is much to be learnt about land.

Nalapha Ngqongqoshe mangiphinde ngize  kuwe.  Kunesimo  esingabukeki  kahle.
Yebo,  umhlaba  asisenawo  emadolobheni   ngoba   bayasuka   emakhaya   baye
emadolobheni ngenxa yokuthi amakhosi ashiywe ngaphandle kulezi zimo. Ngakho-
ke   silahlekelwa   ngokuningi,   siyogcina   sesiyisizwe   esingenabukhosi,
sesingamalulwane,  amahhuwa,  amaqanda  angachamuseli.  Ngakho-ke  singacela
kuwe ngoba siyazi  ukuthi  niyaxoxisana  namakhosi  ukuthi  asondele  akwazi
ukuthi nawo abambe iqhaza  ngoba  phela  asifuni  ukuthi  kuthiwe  sesibuswa
ngomasipala.  Yiyona-ke  leyo  nto  esethusa  kakhulu  ngoba  uma  kulahleka
ubukhosi iyalahleka indlela. Azibuye emasisweni. Ngingabeka  umzekelo  lapha
Ngqongqoshe othi inkosi  yakwaKekana,  ngikholwa  uyazi,  sengifike  kaningi
ehhovisi layo umhlaba wawuthathwe yizifikanamithwalo zawugcina lowo  mhlaba.
Uma  sezibuya  emasisweni,  iNkosi  uKekana  usalala.  Izingane   nabazukulu
mabadle phela izithelo zeNkosi uKekana kuthi umhlaba waseHammanskraal  ubuye
uye  kwaKekana  ukuze  nabo   banethezeke.   Empeleni   amakhosi   ayakhala,
Ngqongqoshe, sengathi ungawelekelela ukuze izwe libuye sibuse.  Nezinkomo-ke

isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Here again, Minister, let me address you. There is a situation that is  not
admirable. Indeed, we no longer have enough land in towns as  people  prefer
urban areas to rural areas, because traditional leaders are left out.  As  a
result we lose a lot, we will end up  being  a  nation  without  traditional
leadership, we have become like bats. We therefore ask you, because we  know
that you talk to the amakhosi, to ask them to come closer and take part,  as
we do not want to be said to be ruled by  the  municipalities.  It  is  this
thing that frightens us the most, because if chieftainship is lost, we  will
also lose our way. Let us go back to our cultures. I  can  cite  an  example
here with iNkosi from the Kekana  tribe  who  had  his  land  taken  by  the
foreigners, and they kept that land, which I believe you  know  about.  When
we go back to our culturesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. iNkosi Kekana  has  passed  away,  but  his
children and grandchildren must get the fruits  of  iNkosi  Kekana  and  the
land in Hammanskraal must go back to the Kekanas so that they also  live  in
comfort. In fact, Minister, amakhosi are complaining, can you help  them  so
that the land may be restored. Then there will be prosperity  in  the  land.

Nkk  M  N  OLIPHANT:  Sihlalo,   boNgqongqoshe   abahloniphekile   namalungu
ahloniphekile, kafushane  nje,  ngaphambi  kokuthi  ngiqale  inkulumo  yami,
ngizothanda ukucebisa umama uVilakazi ukuthi  mhlawumbe  ukuba  ubeyingxenye
yomhlangano ngesikhathi  uMnyango  wezoLimo  nezoMhlaba  usicobelela  ulwazi
ngethemba  ukuthi  ubengeke  abe  nale  nkinga  anayo.  Ngingancoma   ukuthi
ngelinye ilanga athi hulukuqu uma ngabe sinomhlangano neminyango  ukuze  abe
nalo ulwazi. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, just briefly,  before  I  begin
my speech, I would like to advise Mrs Vilakazi that perhaps if she had  been
part of the meeting when the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs
gave us the information, I believe she wouldn't have this problem.  I  would
recommend that some day when we have meetings with  departments  she  should
come along so that she can obtain information.]

I want to draw the attention of hon members Van Heerden and Le Roux  to  the
fact that since the Native Land Act of 1913 stated that the rights  to  own,
rent and even sharecrop land  in  South  Africa  depended  upon  a  person's
racial classification, millions of  Africans  were  forced  to  leave  their
ancestral  land  and  resettle  in  what  quickly  became  overcrowded   and
environmentally degraded reserves of cheap migrant  labour  for  white-owned
farms and mines. Black people lost even the right to purchase  land  in  the
reserves  and  were  obliged  to  utilise  land   administered   by   tribal
authorities, which was approved by the government.

I believe that members of the FF Plus, who were previously CP  members,  and
those members of the DP, who were also PFP, did not oppose  that  Land  Act.
Here we are, debating the Agriculture  budget  in  South  Africa,  yet  they
speak about Zimbabwe. We  are  not  debating  a  budget  of  Zimbabwe  here.
[Interjections.] I want to inform the hon Le Roux that I  am  not  sure  how
the lives of the people were at that time. Were they emotional or  not  when
the land was distributed, as the hon Le Roux is emotional today?

On 26 June 1955, the Congress of the People adopted the Freedom Charter.  In
that congress a declaration was made which stated that restrictions of  land
ownership on a racial basis shall be ended; and that all the land  shall  be
divided among those who work it to banish famine and land  hunger.  This  is
what the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs is doing now.

By increasing the Agriculture budget the Government will be  in  a  position
to create more jobs and at the same time contribute to economic  growth.  As
we speak, Land Affairs has a land  redistribution  programme  that  provides
poor people with land for residential and productive purposes  in  order  to
improve their  livelihoods.  The  programme  not  only  assists  subsistence
farmers, but also aims at settling black emerging and commercial farmers  by
providing previously disadvantaged communities with access to land. This  is
specifically for agricultural purposes as well as to improve  the  nutrition
and incomes of the rural poor who want to farm on any scale.

During the apartheid era some farmers used to  pay  their  workers  part  of
their salaries in alcohol. It was called the  ``tot  system''.  After  1994,
the ANC-led Government called on  business  people,  including  farmers,  to
improve the lives of their workers. One farmer heard that call  and  he  sat
down with his workers and said: ``I need your help. Run the farm for me  and
make a championship wine, and I will reward you once  that  has  happened.''
In May 1996 his wine was crowned a South African champion. In  May  1997  he
called his  farmworkers  and  said:  ``I  will  give  you  9,5  hectares  of
vineyards. The land should be used for agricultural purposes. If you do  not
want it, I will buy it back from you. If you do grow grapes, you can use  my
farming equipment for three years. If you decide to make wine,  you  can  do
so in my cellar.'' I am not sure whether Le  Roux  or  Van  Heerden  can  do
that.

This meant that, working together, we could make a  difference  and  give  a
positive impact in a sense that  contributes  towards  poverty  alleviation,
black  economic  empowerment,  nation-building  and  moral  regeneration.  A
declaration made by the Congress of the People in  1955  said,  ``the  state
shall help the peasants with implements, seed, tractors  and  dams  to  save
the soil and assist the tillers''.

Sikubonile-ke  lokhu  KwaZulu-Natal  kwenzeka   lapho   umnyango   wezolimo,
ngaphansi kukamhlonishwa uMakhaye,  unikeza  izimbewu  kubalimi  abasafufusa
kanye nogandaganda ngenhloso yokubasiza. [We have witnessed  this  happening
in KwaZulu-Natal,  where  the  department  of  agriculture,  under  the  hon
Makhaye, gave out seeds and tractors to emerging farmers to help them.]

Through the Land Affairs budget, the Government assisted  these  workers  in
farming their communal property and  they  started  to  grow  grapes.  After
their harvest their first bottle sold like a dream. For these  workers  this
was a dream come true.  This  example  of  these  workers  proves  that  the
freedom we have won enables us to choose our own destiny and, in  so  doing,
take our development into our own hands.

We, as the ANC-led Government, have proved our commitment  in  pushing  back
the  frontiers  of  poverty.  The  farmworkers  shifted  from  poverty   and
alcoholism to successful wine making. Agriculture has a great  potential  to
assist in the fight to alleviate poverty in rural areas.

Given the apartheid legacy, the expansion of agricultural  opportunities  to
poor, rural communities is closely linked to access to land and  water.  Hon
Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs,  the  hon  Mr  Tlhagale  confirmed
that there is no other political party that  can  help  our  communities  in
terms of sustainable development, except the ANC. Hon Minister,  as  members
of the ANC you make us  proud  for  guiding  the  department  in  the  right
direction, and we are on the right track. This  confirms  that  the  ANC-led
Government is the government of the  people,  by  the  people  and  for  the
people. South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black or white. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF WATER  AFFAIRS  AND  FORESTRY:  Chairperson,  let  me  first
express appreciation to all the members who participated in  my  debate  and
who made invaluable contributions. Let me  preface  my  responses  by  first
reporting - I think it will also be the first time  that  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs will be hearing this  -  that  in  Maputo  last
week, agriculture took centre stage as an  answer  to  Africa's  problem  of
poverty and food shortage. Water for agriculture - that  can  ensure  growth
and sustainability in this area was also very central in  all  the  debates.
This illustrates the importance and the interdependence of both  agriculture
and water.

Having said that, let me first respond to the issue raised  by  Rev  Moatshe
in  the  context  of  ``we  have  a  vision''.  He  said   something   about
aquaculture, and I want to say that we have a vision, as the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry, to support aquaculture.  But  we  will  have  to
investigate this matter: the possibilities for  fish  farming,  as  well  as
protecting the quality of water, so that we can be able  to  use  water  for
that  purpose.  Surely  we  will  have  to  collaborate  with  the  relevant
departments: Agriculture and Land Affairs,  and  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism.

On the issues raised by Mr Worth I want to acknowledge that it's  true  that
our country is water-stressed. That is why as a department we  thought  that
we needed to come up with a comprehensive approach to  address  the  problem
of water shortage, and to that end we will be  coming  up  with  a  national
water resource strategy, which we will be publishing  within  three  months.
In it we will outline how South Africa should  participate  in  the  use  of
water effectively, and how we should protect and develop our water.  I  also
noted the comment that he made about the need for us to design  tariffs  and
cross-subsidies carefully. I think this is very, very  important.  But  most
importantly, we need to ensure that those people who can afford to  pay  for
water do so; and as for those who cannot afford to pay, we as  a  Government
must ensure that they exercise their right to  have  clean,  potable  water,
even if they are poor. I think the present policy, the  Free  Basic  Minimum
Policy, seeks to do just that.

The hon Nahara reported on the quality of water in Mhlabuyalingana.  I  will
request our office in KZN to investigate this matter, and they  will  report
to us in due course, but I think I am also identifying  it  as  one  of  the
priority areas. As I will be visiting the provinces,  I  will  include  that
area so that I can visit it and see for myself what the situation is like.

Councillor Hleko, I think it is proper and correct for you to say that  this
debate is about whether we have enough money to  support  local  government,
especially for the delivery of basic services. I think and  I  believe  that
we do have enough money to support local governments, particularly with  the
help of donor funding. The  EU  has  already  contributed  the  considerable
amount of R600 million for 2003-04, and  we  are  looking  at  getting  R400
million for 2004-05 towards the water services project, under the  programme
that we call Masibambane [Let  us  hold  hands],  so  I  think  there  is  a
considerable amount, isilungu sinjalo [as one says in English].

We agree with Councillor Hleko that there are  challenges  in  the  area  of
sanitation. I would take time if I were to really elaborate  on  the  issues
that have raised, but it may be of importance to highlight  that  there  has
been fragmentation in delivery in this particular area. The function  itself
was divided amongst six departments, and we have done well as  a  department
to ensure that activities and efforts are  co-ordinated  amongst  all  these
departments. On the question of water-borne toilets  replacing  the  bucket-
system, the matter is under discussion between the Ministries of  Provincial
and Local Government and Water Affairs and Forestry, and in  due  course  we
will be making an announcement on this particular issue.

Lastly, I would like to say to Mr Mack that it is correct  that  apart  from
the 4,5 million people who still have no access to safe water, and  whom  we
are prioritising, there are six million other people whose access  to  water
does not meet the RDP standards.  We  will  be  addressing  this  particular
problem, and surely by the time we reach our  targets,  the  situation  will
have been reversed. We will be encouraging and monitoring the Department  of
Provincial  and  Local  Government  to  give  priority  to  addressing  this
particular backlog, as well  as  working  with  them  and  the  treasury  to
increase the funds available for water and sanitation, and I want  to  lobby
the Minister for Land Affairs and Agriculture on this matter.  In  this  way
we hope to help  our  people  climb  the  water  and  sanitation  ladder  of
steadily improving levels of service.

On the question of capacity, we are working together with the Department  of
Provincial and Local Government to ensure that, as we are  transferring  the
functions from Water Affairs to local governments, we are also  transferring
some of the skills to them so that the question of capacity is attended  to.
I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you very  much,  Deputy
Chair. Before I respond to the issues, perhaps  it's  necessary  for  me  to
thank the House for having put this debate in a cluster form. I know in  one
way they were trying to respond to the work that  the  select  committee  of
this House does in relation to the oversight work  of  the  Ministries  that
were debating the budget today. It also points to clear areas  of  alignment
that we need to continuously work on between  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
and  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs.  As   the   Minister   was   speaking,
particularly on how she and her department are going to try to work with  us
in providing water - with regard to  small-scale  farmers  -  I  said  that,
indeed, this is one of the areas of alignment.

I also want to say that some areas of alignment  could  be  in  Working  for
Water as well as Landcare, because these programmes are about improving  and
safeguarding the quality of land. Bab'uMzizi said we need to ensure that  we
look after our land. So as part of our ongoing programmes we have done  just
that and we are going to continue.  And,  maybe  one  day  we  must  have  a
workshop for this House so that even the hon members themselves  would  know
their responsibility in terms of water and land management.

It is also my view that, probably, one of the other areas where we  can  co-
ordinate - working as this cluster and with the select  committee  -  is  to
see to what  extent  a  number  of  our  beneficiaries,  through  LRAD  land
redistribution, restitution, as well as in the communal areas, can  actually
use  the  Landcare  and  Working  for  Water  programmes  to   improve   and
rehabilitate the land that have gone back to the people.

The other matter, obviously, is  efficient  water  use.  Apart  from  making
water available for agricultural purposes,  I  think  the  select  committee
itself,  working  with  the  two  departments,  can  have   some   campaign,
particularly at communication level, to  increase  general  awareness  among
our  people  and  all  other  land  users  about  the  importance  of  water
conservation. That goes  for  issues  of  biodiversity  management,  working
together with the Ministries of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,  as  well
as Water Affairs and Forestry.

Mphathisihlalo, mangibonge kumalungu ale Ndlu athe  athatha  inxaxheba  kulo
msitho wanamhlanje.  Mangibonge  ikakhulukazi  oogxa  bam,  ii-MEC  eziphuma
emaphondweni, ndixolisele nezinye kuba namhlanje njengokuba sisazi,  izindlu
zamaphondo kakhulukazieburhulumenteni ziye  zibe  neentlanganiso  zamabhunga
alawulayo ngolu suku. Loo nto yenza ukuba bangakwazi  ukuba  kho.  Kambe  ke
nizivele ngokwenu ukuba amaphondo esebenzisana  nathi  singundlunkulu,  enza
ntoni  ukugweba   indlala   kunye   nokukhulisa   ezoqoqosho   kweli   lizwe
ngakwezolimo. Iya kuba ntle  ngenye  imini  into  yokuba  mhlawumbi  intetho
yohlahlo-lwabiwo-mali siyenze ngosuku olungonguwo uLwesithathu  ukuze  bonke
abameli bamaphondo  kwezolimo  bakwazi  ukuzithethela  betyebisela  le  Ndlu
ngabakwenzayo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, let me thank the hon members of this House  for  participating
in today's debate. A special thanks to my  colleagues  the  MEC's  from  the
provinces. I want to apologise on behalf of the  others  who  could  not  be
here today, as we are all aware that on this  day,  provincial  legislatures
hold their caucus meetings in their respective constituencies. That  is  way
they are not here. By the way, you have heard what  the  provinces,  working
together with us the national Government, are  doing  to  alleviate  poverty
and develop the economy through Agriculture in this country. It would  be  a
great idea if we could one  day  consider  doing  the  budget  speech  on  a
weekday other than Wednesday, so that  all  the  provincial  representatives
for agriculture could come and speak for themselves,  and  tell  this  House
about what they are doing.]

It  was  very  interesting  to  hear  the  member  of  the  FF   Plus,   who
unfortunately  is  not  here,  outlining  why  they  didn't  participate  in
yesterday's debate in the National Assembly. I think all  of  us  could  see
that the member hadn't prepared.  It  means  they  were  not  even  prepared
yesterday. He tried to use  the  manifesto,  which  basically  did  not  say
anything. I wouldn't want to waste my time, but clearly it is necessary  for
us to look at how far parties such as the FF Plus have committed  themselves
to land reform. Because when you look at the statements that come from  some
of their members, it is clear that they are not yet committed.

Mphatsi  Sihlalo,  angibonge  kubabe  Mzizi.   Angitsi   nje   babe   Mzizi,
siyasebentisana nemakhosi babe.  Sisebentisana  futsi  ngendlela  yekwekutsi

(Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[I thank you, Mr Mzizi. Let me tell you, Mr Mzizi, that we do work  hand  in
hand with the traditional leaders.  We  work  so  well  that  there  are  no
problems. I mentioned in my speech that we will be working  in  Nongoma  and
other places, solving the issue of  land  disposal.  I  must  say  that  the
request came from the traditional  leaders.  Mr  Mamase  has  presented  the
programmes that they have embarked  on,  like  food  mass  production;  they
undertake these, working together with the traditional leaders.  I  can  say
that in these 10 years, our relationship with the  traditional  leaders  has
deepened, it is very good and there are no problems with  the  collaboration
between the traditional leaders and the municipality. Maybe  we  should  not
bind ourselves to things that we used to say  in  the  past,  so  that  when
there are changes we are too scared to say that things  are  working.  There
should be no problem between working for elected representatives  and  those
that are traditional. As for us, we as ANC understand that correctly and  it
does not disturb us. We will do this working together with  the  traditional
leaders, and we also worked together with them in respect  of  changing  the
legislation about state land that must be given back to the people. We  also
gave them the power to control the land, working together  with  the  people
who own it. By telling you that, we want to let you  know  that  traditional
leaders have been part of the changes. Traditional  leaders  stated  by  the
people will not have a problem, because they know what their duty is.

Coming back to you, Mrs Vilakazi, let me say that maybe at the time, in  the
past years, the person in power, not Mr Makhaya, did  not  do  what  we  had
agreed upon because the policy concerning Power of Attorney  on  State  Land
Disposal was passed in the past two years. But as you say, I have also  seen
for myself that it is because we are  going  back  and  forth.  I  will  not
mention my family surname - we are going round in circles. In  KwaZulu-Natal
we have been going round in circles, it was not known  when  were  going  to
settle these farmers. That is why we say that we will look into  this  issue
of giving provinces power concerning land disposal,  if  it  is  progressing
well in all provinces. If there is a problem somewhere, we will  help  those
people.

Ms Dlulane, I thank you, my sister-in-law. You  spoke  so  well  about  this
issue pertaining to the land, which touches you. Of course, if you  look  at
Mpumalanga, Komati and some places in the Eastern Cape,  where  people  have
been given land through the LRAD, it is evident that when people  are  given
power and the tools to utilise, they can farm the land. I  also  thank  you,
Ms Nahara. I thank  you  for  our  working  together  in  the  KwaZulu-Natal
province. As chairperson of the committee, you and your committee  know  how
to give guidelines. When there are problems, especially pertaining to  land,
you don't refuse and say that you have no power  to  control,  but  you  are
able to solve those problems; like you say, this has enabled  us  to  settle
the claims in that area peacefully.

I want to tell you, Mr Tlhagale, that I have heard you, but the  problem  of
the debt cannot be solved by saying that  we  should  consolidate.  We  have
been consolidating all the time. We have  to  find  out  where  the  problem
lies. Another problem is  the  way  the  apartheid  government  used  to  do
things, even when they saw that a person could not farm,  but  because  they
knew that that particular person would vote for them, they  would  give  him
money, while he could not even use it properly. I do not want to  go  deeply
into that, the two of us can talk about it later.  What  Mrs  Vilakazi  also
touched on is that maybe when we sell the land, we should not sell it  at  a
market-related price. I  want  to  say  that,  as  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, when you look at the price at which we are selling the state  land,
it is far below the market price. The question we should be asking  is:  how
can we help the people financially, as the President has mentioned that  the
Agricultural Credit Scheme is another way that will  help  the  people  who,
when going to the banks, are refused help, or tell them  that  they  do  not
have appropriate capacity.

Mr Moatshe,  let  me  thank  you  for  giving  us  courage.  Concerning  the
aquaculture, my Reverend, we are going on with it, even if we say there  are
no guidelines yet. When we look into the Special Food Security Programme  in
Limpopo, working together with the university there, they have  built  water
tanks so that they can breed fish for food. It is not  as  if  all  that  is
needed is to dig a hole, fill it with water and then put in the fish.  There
are ways of doing this. But the problem we should solve, as Ms  Sonjica  has
mentioned, is how we do it in this programme. We must  formulate  guidelines
or a policy for co-operation between  these  departments  so  that  when  we
encourage the breeding of fish, we do not pollute the water that the  people
drink. And we know how to help the people and what the role  of  capitalists
is, as you know, from when we spoke to you and the  committee  in  the  past
years. There are problems in that those who want to make money, want  us  to
do things in a certain way, they do not want to  find  out  how  many  other
ways there are and that people should be able to get food. We will  continue
working with you and the departments that I have mentioned, to conclude  the
issue of aquaculture because  there  are  many  factors  that  include  many
departments, but that  does  not  mean  we  have  not  understood;  we  have
understood you.

When we told the members of this House that we  will  talk  even  today,  we
promised them that we will bring you some seeds. As  you  walk  out  of  the
door, you will see some small boxes with seeds; we want you  to  plant  them
at your homes. You must be the first ones to experience how it  is  to  work
with land. When I come back to this debate next year, I want to see  carrots
and spinach on your tables, so that I can see how many of you are  lazy  and
how many are not! Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, Order! Thank  you  very  much  to
both Ministers for replying to the debate. It would seem as if the  Minister
for Agriculture and Land Affairs knew what I was going to say at the end  of
the debate. It's actually we who want to say to both  of  you:  ``Thank  you
for allowing us to cluster you''. I will tell you  the  reason  why  we  did
this.

It is not mainly because of the pressure of time  that  we  have,  but  it's
also that this Council's vision, in the third  Parliament,  is  to  do  more
regarding the provinces because we link directly to the  provinces.  And  we
are very happy and pleased  that  when  Ministers  come  to  this  House  it
encourages their MECs to be here - where possible. Because we are  going  to
do much work with them on the ground and with the  committees  down  in  the
provinces, by looking at those problems which  have  been  outlined  by  the
department and assisting with the delivery on the  ground,  so  we  want  to
thank you very much for agreeing that we cluster you.

But, more importantly, it  has  also  enlightened  us,  as  members  of  the
Council, with regard to areas of alignment  that  the  Ministers  have  been
talking about. It is critical, because when we go down there to do our  work
in the provinces we will know exactly what we are going to do. And, we  know
that when we go there we will be in a position to assist and come back  here
to debate the issues, and also advise the  Ministers  correctly.  Therefore,
we wish to thank you very much.
May I  also  thank  you,  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  in
particular, for setting a very good tone for us  today  by  using  different
languages in this Chamber. That  is  very  important.  You  are  aware  that
Parliament has now passed the language policy. We are spending  millions  of
rands  on  developing  interpretation  skills,   employing   personnel   and
developing the equipment to do so, but also to speak to our people  directly
in our constituencies.

Let us use these languages. South Africa is very rich  in  languages  -  the
diversity of languages. Let's use them and not be afraid. I  wish  to  thank
all of you who participated in this debate.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:22.
