             WELCOMING ADDRESS TO PRESIDENT ABDUL KALAM OF INDIA


The SPEAKER: Hon members, Mr President, we are honoured to have amongst us
today His Excellency President Abdul Kalam of the Republic of India, whom
we have invited to address this Joint Sitting of Parliament on the occasion
of his visit to South Africa.

May I take this opportunity to welcome you to Parliament, Mr President. I
now call on the hon R J Tau to introduce His Excellency the President of
the Republic of India. [Applause.]

Mr R J TAU: His Excellency the President of the Republic of South Africa,
Thabo Mbeki, His Excellency the President of the Republic of India, Mr
Abdul Kalam, Deputy President - if he is present - presiding officers of
both Houses, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, deputy presiding officers,
members of the diplomatic corps, hon members of the National Assembly and
those of the National Council of Provinces, distinguished guests, it is an
honour bestowed upon me to extend a word of welcome to His Excellency Dr
Abdul Kalam, the President of India, and his esteemed delegation.

His Excellency Dr Kalam visits our country at a time when our people are
celebrating Heritage Month. During this time we take stock and acknowledge
the important role the rich heritage of our country can, and continues to,
play in promoting peace and prosperity, not only in our country but also
amongst our brothers and sisters throughout the continent. His Excellency
is visiting our country at a time when African leaders from various African
states will descend upon the shores of our country for the historic opening
of the Pan-African Parliament.

Through his interest and dedication to the development of science and
technology, Dr Kalam contributed immensely to the transformation of India’s
science and technology infrastructure, resulting in the first indigenous
satellite launch vehicle which successfully propelled the Rohini satellite
into near-earth orbit in July 1980, making India an exclusive member of the
space club.

With two decades of mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr Kalam made it
his responsibility to develop indigenous guided missiles for the Defence
Research and Development Organisation as a chief executive of the
integrated guided missile development programme. He gave thrust to self-
reliance in defence systems by ensuring the progress of multiple
development tasks and mission projects such as combat aircraft.

With the help of 500 experts in this field of science and technology, and
as a chairperson of the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment
Council, he pioneered Technology Vision 2020, whose fundamental objective
is to draw up a road map for the transformation of India from its present
status as a developing nation to being a developed nation.

Dr Kalam is one of the most distinguished scientists of India, with the
unique honour of having received honorary doctorates from 30 universities
and institutions. [Applause.] He has been awarded coveted civilian awards
such as, amongst others, Padma Bhushan in 1981 and Padma Vibhushan in 1990.
He further went on to receive the highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna, in
1997. [Applause.] He is also a recipient of several other awards and is a
fellow of many professional institutions. He became the 11th President of
India on 25 July 2002.

As an academic, a writer and a scientist, Dr Abdul Kalam joins this House
at a time when we, as a country, also have Vision 2014, just six years
short of India’s Vision 2020. Key, if not central, to our vision is to
fight poverty, unemployment, malnutrition and diseases in order to achieve
economic growth in particular, and with greater emphasis on the areas of
science and technology. We hope your contribution today will greatly assist
in this regard.

As we welcome you to this Parliament, it is important to note that your
visit is quite historic in that you are the first head of state to visit
this House after our third democratic national elections. It is further
historic because, as a country, we acknowledge the role India played in our
struggle for a nonracial and nonsexist democratic society.

We note with great respect the role the people of India played under the
leadership of great people such as former President Nehru in mobilising the
entire world in favour of a campaign for the isolation of the then racist
South Africa, and his call for the enfranchisement of the African people
and blacks in general in our country.

Having been the first country to call for the isolation of the racist
regime, you are again the first to witness the changing of apartheid
symbols in this Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. Just on your
arrival, yesterday, we unveiled the people’s mace. [Applause.] This is a
mace that symbolises our past and serves as a reflection of the diverse
heritage of our country during this strategic month.

Historically, India is an important reference point when it comes to a
nonviolent and peaceful challenge to a political order that thrives through
the oppression of ordinary people. Indeed, India’s contribution to peace
and prosperity throughout the world is well documented.

Your Excellency President Kalam, India will always occupy a special place
in the history of the world regarding the nonviolent and peaceful struggles
your country has waged against injustice perpetuated by former colonial
masters.

With your permission, Madam Speaker, may I assure Dr Kalam of a warm
reception in South Africa and, further, confirm that, in the good hands of
our President, you will enjoy your stay in South Africa. Dr Kalam, you are
welcome. [Applause.]


             ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF INDIA, DR A P J ABDUL KALAM


HIS EXCELLENCY Dr A P J ABDUL KALAM:  Good  evening,  friends.  Hon  Speaker
Madam Baleka Mbete, hon Chairperson of the  National  Council  of  Provinces
Madam Joyce Kgoali, His Excellency the President of South  Africa  Dr  Thabo
Mbeki, hon Ministers, hon members of Parliament and distinguished guests,  I
visited Robben Island earlier today. This island really inspired  me  as  to
how powerful the freedom struggle was from that island. So I  greet  all  of
you, dear members of the South  African  Parliament.  You  have  such  great
leaders and I extend my greetings to all of you. [Applause.]

I am glad to know that you have Vision 2014; we have Vision  2020.  Both  of
us can ask what the common mission is that  we  have.  We  have  one  common
enemy, and that enemy is poverty. In your vision of  South  Africa  and  our
vision of India we finally defeat the enemy, as you defeated  the  apartheid
system. [Applause.]

Friends, I am honoured and privileged to have this  opportunity  to  address
this joint sitting of the  Parliament  of  South  Africa,  representing  the
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.  Let  me  begin  by
conveying to you the fraternal greetings of the government of India and  the
people of India on this occasion. For me, it is a  matter  of  the  greatest
satisfaction that I speak to you today in the very year  in  which  you  are
celebrating your decade of freedom and democracy in South Africa, and  I  am
conscious that through you I speak to all the people  of  South  Africa,  of
whom you are the democratically elected representatives.

I would like to congratulate South Africa on the  peaceful  conduct  of  the
third general elections and the smooth transition  to  the  new  government.
The Indian parliament also had its 14th Lok Sabha  elections  a  few  months
back in which 387 million votes were cast out of  an  eligible  675  million
voters. It was also  the  first  time  in  the  world,  in  such  a  massive
election, that electronic voting machines were successfully used.

The two new governments can work together for  the  common  benefit  of  the
citizens of both nations, nation-building, on  continuity  by  devising  new
methods of working together. Our civilisational heritage and  value  systems
will stand us in good stead as we move forward into  the  future.  I  assure
you that we in India share your feelings and thoughts as close  friends.  As
ancient civilisations, we both are endowed with a wide variety  of  cultural
and ethnic diversity.

I have great pleasure in informing you that I  am  bringing  along  with  me
special greetings to the parliamentarians of South Africa from  both  houses
of the  Indian  parliament.  My  parliament  has  also  extended  a  cordial
invitation to a South African parliamentary delegation  to  visit  India.  I
wholeheartedly join them in their sentiments.

The origin of human civilisation was in Africa. All the other  civilisations
have evolved from this civilisation. This country is rich  in  its  cultural
and civilisational heritage. It has multiple  languages  and  varied  ethnic
cultures. India also has a long history of civilisational  heritage  with  a
multiplicity of languages, religions and ancient cultures.

Here, I would like to tell you, hon members, that last  week  I  received  a
visitor from the United States, a professor from a university. He asked  me:
“Mr President, what is the core competence of India?” I told him: “The  core
competence of India is that it is a democracy with  a  billion  people  with
varied languages, varied religions  and  varied  cultures  that  have  given
leadership. So, our core competence is leadership of  a  billion  democratic
people”.  [Applause.] Thank you.

India  also  has  a  long  history  of  civilisational   heritage   with   a
multiplicity of languages, religions and ancient cultures,  as  I  told  you
just now. We attained freedom after a long drawn-out period  of  subjugation
and nonviolent resistance. Of course, we went  through  200  years  and  you
went through 340 years of that.

We have been attempting to keep our  cultural  heritage  intact  all  along.
Currently, the common enemies of both our nations are poverty  and  disease.
Our  countries  also  have  some  outstanding  islands  of   excellence   in
technology and industry. Our task is to  network  these  islands  to  spread
prosperity for all citizens. This is the soil from which the father  of  our
nation, Mahatma Gandhi, started and initiated the  Ahimsa  Dharma  movement,
which he later took to India.

This soil gave birth to Nelson Mandela, who provided the leadership for  the
realisation of freedom for South Africa and who shines as a beacon  for  the
world. One can list more such connectivities. Thus we  have  many  important
areas,  which  form  a  national  bond  between  our  two   nations.   These
characteristics make us natural allies.

Throughout recorded history, India has always been friendly to  all  nations
and we are happy to be counted among the friends of South  Africa.  We  have
never, at any time in our past, invaded other countries or used  destructive
force to achieve any end. The hallmark of  India  throughout  the  ages  has
been: “All places are our native places and all people our relatives.”

This has been deeply ingrained in the social and  political  life  of  India
for thousands of years. The India-Brazil-South Africa – Ibsa  -Forum  signed
among the three nations, which connects Asia, South America and  Africa,  is
a valuable tool to further shape our friendship for the development  of  our
nations. The India-South Africa friendship and  partnership  is  crucial  to
this forum as you are nearer to us  geographically.   Sometimes  the  Indian
Ocean connects us.

With regard to working together, I am thankful for the privilege of  sharing
with you and the people of South Africa, whom you represent, our  experience
in our efforts to develop the nation  socially  and  economically  over  the
past 50 years. I do so in a spirit of understanding that we may  learn  from
each other and strengthen  our  resolve  to  move  all  nations  to  greater
prosperity and happiness, and freedom from  insecurity  in  years  to  come.
Perhaps as we do so, we shall realise that we have so much  in  common  that
we shall wonder why we have not moved much closer together much earlier.

Both our nations are free, independent states  in  an  increasingly  complex
and  interdependent  world,  where  the  values  of  friendship  and  mutual
assistance are of paramount importance. Now that our banners of freedom  are
unfurled, through the sacrifice of our  political  leaders  and  people,  we
should contribute towards happiness and peace in the world.

I would like to share our experiences with you. India is now striving to  be
a developed nation by 2020. The first vision, of course, for the nation  was
achieving independence from alien rule. We gained our Independence in  1947.
The independence movement generated various leaders in diverse  fields  like
politics,  the  judiciary,  science  and  technology,  industry,  the  arts,
literature and philosophy.

After independence, improvements also took place in many areas like  health,
literacy and agriculture, in strategic  areas,  and  in  certain  small  and
large-scale industries. For example,  our  life  expectancy,  which  was  32
years at the time of independence, has gone up to 61 years,  thanks  to  the
health care and sanitation systems we have in place.  No  doubt,  much  more
needs to be done. So, too, our achievements in  other  sectors  are  equally
impressive.

However, in spite of these achievements, even after 50 years we are  counted
among the developing countries, as you are. We have many challenges.  Nearly
260 million people still live below the poverty line in India and they  have
to join the mainstream of the good life. Literacy of 100%, health  for  all,
enhanced industrial  and  agricultural  productivity  and  a  sustained  GDP
growth rate of 10% are some of  our  targets.  Hence,  we  need  the  second
vision for the nation to become a developed country.

I  see  from  the  speeches  of  leaders  and  the  works  of   many   other
intellectuals that South Africa also has the passion and urge  to  become  a
developed nation at the earliest time. You have a higher per  capita  income
than India. I would like to learn more of your vision and thoughts, as  they
will enrich us. I will share with you  some  of  our  own  thoughts  on  our
future.

In order to realise a developed India by 2020,  five  key  areas  have  been
identified for integrated action. The first  key  area  is  agriculture  and
food processing - with a target of  400  million  tons  per  annum  of  food
grains as well as others with different targets and  agricultural  products.
Agriculture, with the second green  revolution,  and  agro  food  processing
will bring food security  and  prosperity  to  rural  people  and  speed  up
economic growth.

The second area of importance is education  and  health  care  -  aiming  to
increase  the  employment  potential,  leading  to   social   security   and
population control. That is one of our major targets.

The  third  area  is  infrastructure  development,  including  reliable  and
quality electric power for all parts of the country, which is vital for  all
the core sectors.

The fourth key area is information and communication technology, one of  our
core competencies. It can help industry and commerce, promote  education  in
remote areas, create massive employment and provide health  care  to  remote
areas.

The  fifth  area  of  importance  is  critical  technologies  and  strategic
industries: progress in nuclear, space, ocean, defence  and  other  frontier
technologies  will  provide  sustained  growth  and  self-reliance  for  the
nation.

Friends, here I would like to  communicate  that  in  1998  India  became  a
nuclear weapons state with a missile system. In 1998 all the  anger  of  the
developed world was pushed  onto  India:  we  got  economic  and  technology
sanctions. But we stood, only because of food security.  We  were  producing
food, sufficient food – 200 million tons per year, and this is something  we
can also export. That saved us from oil sanctions. So listen well, you  will
learn. Of course, you also have gone through similar situations.

These five areas are closely interrelated and lead  to  national,  food  and
economic security. A strong partnership among the research  and  development
academy, industry, business and the community as  a  whole  with  government
departments and  agencies  will  be  essential  to  accomplish  the  vision.
Foreign investors and partners, too, have an important role to play.

While I have shared with you India’s vision of a developed  nation  by  2020
and its development plan, I am sure we can learn  from  your  vision  -  the
unity of thoughts for the development of South Africa. It  is  only  natural
that the two countries should strive to synergise  their  development  goals
and policies. This creates the strong possibility that by 2020, or  earlier,
both nations could acquire the capabilities to assist each other and  others
as well.

With the emergence of a knowledge society, it is all the more important
that friendly countries like us share our experience and core strengths to
speed up our own growth. This partnership in the development of our nations
would be a model for other developing and developed nations.

South Africa is globally recognised as a leading supplier of a variety of
minerals and mineral products that are exported to many countries. Nature
has given you some of the largest and richest minerals. These include gold,
platinum group elements, coal and diamonds. Surat, in India, is a major
diamond processing centre and jewellery manufacturing centre. There is
perhaps scope for working in the area of diamond processing which will
enable further value addition to the diamonds mined in South Africa for
sale in the international market.

With modern mining and extraction of valuable elements becoming more
complex, there will be other areas where joint work is possible. Time-bound
missions and new joint initiatives will provide integrated solutions for
transforming nations into developed countries. Application of science and
technology plays a great role in this process of transformation. Both our
nations have developed core competence in agriculture, manufacturing,
mining, aviation, software products and pharmaceutical products.

In addition to natural resources, we have biodiversity and the large
energetic and talented human capital. We both can share these strengths.
Value addition to agricultural, manufacturing and services sectors, using
core competence of the nation will enhance the wealth-generation capacity
of the nation. After generation of value-added competitive products, we can
have a common marketing philosophy and jointly bid for international
products to bring synergy between the two nations.

A nation has to be alert and sensitive to the changes that take place to
the technological fabric of the world, and prepare itself for the arrival
of newer challenges in the horizon well in advance. Those nations which
capture technologies before they become large-scale commercial operations,
win the race. We believe that nanotechnology will give us an opportunity.
If we take appropriate and timely action, we can become one of the
important technological nations in the world. In 2004, the world market for
nanomaterials, nanotools, nanodevices, nanostructures and nanobiotechnology
put together is expected to be over $100 million.

Nanobiomedical sensors will play a major role in glucose detection and
endoscopic implants. Drug delivery systems and other emerging developments
will revolutionise health care to a large extent. Molecular switches and
circuits, along with nanocells, will pave the way for the next generation
of computers. Ultra-dense computer memory, coupled with excellent
electrical performance will give society low-power, low-cost, nano-size and
yet faster assemblies. Work on these areas would need highly skilled human
capital. Active collaboration between our two nations will enable us to
generate the required technical manpower for our development task.

Both India and South Africa are blessed with over 50% of their populations
being below the age of 25. This is a great strength for our nations. We can
convert this human capital into knowledge capital to harness their energy
for transforming our nations into developed nations. This transformation
can take place by providing competitive goods and services to the
international market.

How do we transform our youth into knowledge capital? This is a big
question. We need to have a multipronged approach in order to upgrade the
basic education, technical education and higher education levels of all the
youth in both our nations; infuse technology and create value-added
products using our national core competence and natural resources; promote
national and international markets; and, above all, create linkages between
education, industry, research and development and the economic systems.

We need a strategy for promoting the education level of the entire
population in a phased manner. In the first phase, we need to increase the
number of youth who complete high school education. Simultaneously, we have
to increase the percentage of youth who undergo vocational training and
diploma-level education on professional subjects.

Parallel to that, we have to enhance the number of youth completing
university education in professional, science, management, commerce and
arts courses. Students who are above high-school level can be trained to
move up the value-chain level through skill enhancement by knowledge-based
training to meet the global competition in the service sector,
manufacturing sector and agricultural sector.

India and South Africa can become partners with each other and share
knowledge in improving the level of education of our primary to secondary
education. The partnership can be in the form of exchange of teachers,
professors, and work towards providing a universal tele-education model and
quality content for students living in remote areas. The tele-education
model is ready for approval. We also need to impart entrepreneurship
training to our youth to make them entrepreneurs who can take challenges
and risks to bring prosperity to the nations. We need to create enabling
environments to encourage risk-taking by our youth.

Regarding the health-care mission, various parts of the world are getting
affected by HIV/Aids in addition to other communicable diseases in poorer
sections of society. In addition, most bacteria of traditional communicable
diseases are becoming resistant to earlier established medicines. It is
time that the national and international agencies join together to mount a
concerted programme in eliminating these dreaded diseases from the planet
earth.

This can be a global mission with international agencies, WHO and both of
our countries as partners. India has already ventured into the field of an
anti-Aids vaccine and it is at the stage of undergoing various tests.
Fortunately, the African strand of the HIV virus and the Indian strand are
the same. So whatever we do and whatever you do we can integrate it and
solve the problem of this dreaded disease.

We are also mounting programmes to eradicate the new forms of earlier
communicable diseases such as TB, waterborne and vector-borne diseases.
Certainly, we both can join together and progress the development faster.
Another area of co-operation and research is on stem cells for
cardiovascular, diabetic and eye ailments. This stem cell research has
tremendous scope that I have witnessed in some of the medical research
centres, for example how a blind eye can recover its sight, and how heart
muscles which have not functioned properly can function again through stem
cells. I have witnessed that in some of our hospitals and research centres.
So stem cell research is another area where both our countries can work
together.

I would like to share with you a unique development issue for India. Nearly
700 million people live in the rural areas in 600,000 villages. Though most
of them have strengths of natural resources and skills, they are poorly
connected and, therefore, their economies stagnate in comparison to towns,
cities and metropolises. How do we solve this problem?

We studied various aspects. We found that connectivity of village complexes
and providing economic opportunities to all segments of our people are our
priority. We have taken measures to bridge the rural–urban divide, generate
employment and enhance rural prosperity by addressing the essential needs
of the villages such as water, power, roads, sanitation, health care,
education and employment generation.

The integrated methods, which will bring prosperity to rural India are: the
physical connectivity of the village clusters through quality roads and
transport; electronic connectivity through tele-education with high-
bandwidth fibre optic cables reaching the rural areas from urban cities and
through Internet kiosks; knowledge connectivity through education,
vocational training for farmers, artisans and craftsmen; and
entrepreneurship programmes and economic connectivity through starting
enterprises with the help of banks, microcredit and marketing of products.

I am sure that the problems of electronic connectivity and the choice of
the right technology at the right time are common between India and South
Africa. Both the nations can embark upon missions to create indigenous
technology and complementary strengths so that all our networks should run
with our own hardware and software. When the hon President of South Africa,
Madam Speaker and the first lady visited India, we discussed providing
urban-rural needs. Both of them have a lot of interest. I am sure that we
are also going to discuss this further today because we need to put our
plans into action.

To prevent migration of the workforce from rural to urban areas, employment
generation in rural areas should focus on teaching entrepreneurship in
educational institutions and providing the necessary investment environment
for sustainable self-employment instead of looking for employment in the
central and state government. This is a problem for your country and my
country. When people graduate, most of them believe that government has
jobs. But, we need people who can generate jobs. That’s why I say that
entrepreneurship should be taught in universities as part of their courses
in science, technology or commerce.

The integrated chain of connectivities - physical, electronic, knowledge
and economic - in a time-bound manner, along with venture capital funding,
will generate large-scale employment for our people in rural areas, thus
leading to rural prosperity. It would appear from generic considerations of
economics and technology that this model may be applicable for some areas
of South Africa and we would be delighted to share our experiences with
you.

Friends, before I conclude, I want to share something with you. I have
developed a law of development for science and technologies. I was studying
the development patterns and the dynamics of connectivity between nations,
especially in trade and business. As you all know, the world has a few
developed countries and many developing countries. What are the dynamics
between them and what connects them? Developed countries have to market
their products in a competitive way to different countries to remain as
developed countries. Developing countries, such as India and South Africa,
desire to be transformed into developed countries. They too have to market
their products in other countries in a competitive way.

Competitiveness has three dimensions: quality of the product, cost
effectiveness and supply in time. Indeed, this dynamic of competitiveness
in marketing of products by developing and developed countries determines
the law of development. We have to see our integrated missions for national
development in this light. Such missions are first centrally driven or
government controlled. They have to have a large component of private
sector participation and involvement of the community.

In conclusion, I have discussed economics, development, technology,
business and education. I have touched upon the commonalities of our
civilisation heritage. I wish to share some more ideals on the same issue.
Righteousness of the heart of the human being leads to a perfect life of an
enlightened citizen. This is beautifully explained by Confucius in ascent
and descent phases of human life. The famous philosopher stated, and I
quote:

      People who desire to have a clear moral harmony in the world would
      first order their national life; those who desire to order their
      national life would first regulate their home life; those who desire
      to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal
      lives; those who desire to cultivate their personal lives and set
      their heart to righteousness, would first make their wills sincere;
      those who desire to make their wills sincere would first arrive at
      understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge
      of things. When the knowledge of things is gained, then understanding
      is reached; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere;
      when the will is sincere, then the heart is righteous; when the heart
      is righteous, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal
      life is cultivated, then the home life is regulated; when the home
      life is regulated, then the national life is orderly; when the
      national life is orderly, then the world is at peace. From the emperor
      down to the common man, the cultivation of the righteous life is the
      foundation for all.


What a beautiful environment I have witnessed today at the South African
Parliament. [Applause.] We, the people of India, are willing to walk with
you - a long walk to freedom from poverty. [Applause].

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr President. It is now my pleasure to call on the
hon Direko to propose a vote of thanks. [Applause.]
Ms I W DIREKO: Madam Speaker of the National Assembly, Madam Chairperson of
the National Council of Provinces, President Thabo Mbeki, President of the
Republic of South Africa, His Excellency Dr Abdul Kalam, President of the
Republic of India, distinguished guests, hon members, on behalf of the
Parliament of South Africa I wish to thank His Excellency Dr Kalam, the
President of India, and his esteemed delegation for having graced our
Parliament through this important visit.

Your visit will further strengthen the friendship, the companionship and
the solidarity between South Africa and India. Your physical presence
amongst us in South Africa is an added consolidation of our two “hugging”
civilisations. Our two countries share a common history of a colonial past,
characterised by colonial oppression and economic exploitation. We have
sought to defeat colonialism through peaceful and nonviolent means. Having
defeated colonialism, we embarked on a road to reconciliation with our
former oppressors. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

We have indeed successfully managed to rebuild our respective countries
from the ashes of our colonial past. In India and South Africa we must
continue to play a leadership role in continental efforts to build a
peaceful and prosperous continent. Our people continue to look upon us as
torchbearers who carry the hopes of our people for the social and economic
renewal of this continent. We cannot fail them. We dare not fail them.
It is quite clear that we are of one mind and indeed in agreement on
various issues, including peace and economic development for the mutual
benefit of our people. Our single-mindedness in respect of human dignity
and the recognition of divinity in all human beings is rooted in my
country’s gift of ubuntu which simply means: “I am because you are”, and in
your country’s gift to the world that “All creation is in the one creator
and the one creator is in all creation”. [Applause.]

As South Africa we will continue to play our part in strengthening these
relations as they are the key to our efforts in the social and economic
upliftment of our people, and I want to believe that that is your ultimate
aim with your own country. Our country will continue to support the people
of India in their noble efforts, because we want to congratulate them on
the work they have done in building India socially and economically, and we
are aware of the challenges that still remain in your continued quest for
peace and prosperity in your country.

We are happy that there is already interaction between our people,
including businesspeople from our two countries investing in our respective
economies and establishing a basis for further trade. There is an urgent
need for us to improve the lives of the ordinary people in our respective
countries. We must therefore redouble our efforts to increase investment in
our respective economies.

Indeed, Your Excellency, possibilities exist for increased co-operation in
various areas, including trade, education, health, tourism, sports and
culture, as well as ensuring exchanges that will nurture, develop and
strengthen people-to-people relations. In my language we say: Motho ke
motho ka batho. [A person is a person because of others.]

Through Nepad we have begun to work tirelessly to place Africa on the path
towards sustainable development. The quest for peace and stability, as well
as sustainable development, is a priority in our country. So, perhaps, at
this stage one needs to say to you, Your Excellency, that when you take on
South Africa you take on the continent. [Applause.] South Africa cannot and
will not proceed without the rest of Africa.

Our success will depend in part on the kind of support and partnership we
develop with countries such as India. The road to peace and development
will be a bumpy one no doubt, but certainly a worthwhile one. It requires
inspired and visionary leadership from our respective countries, and I can
say without any fear of contradiction that in our country and in our
President we have that kind of leadership. I want to believe that the same
thing obtains in your country, Your Excellency. [Applause.]

It is therefore obligatory to work together in pursuit of these noble
ideals. We are pleased and indeed encouraged by your willingness to assist
and to be part and parcel of this renewal and development not only in South
Africa, but also on the continent as a whole. Your support will ultimately
ensure that our continent takes its rightful place among other continents
and that we can take our rightful place in the world arena with confidence,
because we shall have done it ourselves. As the Cradle of Humankind and a
bastion of progress, there is no time to waste because time is not on our
side. [Applause.]

On behalf of the people of South Africa, we wish to express our heartfelt
gratitude for the support we continue to receive from your country. South
Africa is poised for success - make no mistake. These interactions can only
strengthen our resolve to succeed. I salute you and your country. May God
bless you. I thank you. [Applause.]

The Speaker of the National Assembly adjourned the Joint Sitting at 15:22.
