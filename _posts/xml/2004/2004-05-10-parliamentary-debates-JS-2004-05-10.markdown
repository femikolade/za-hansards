                        PROCEEDINGS AT JOINT SITTING
                                    ____

Members of the National Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
assembled in the Chamber of the National Assembly at 10:56.

The Speaker of the National Assembly and the  Chairperson  of  the  National
Council of Provinces took the Chair.

The Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces  requested  members  to
observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.

      ADDRESS WELCOMING FORMER PRESIDENTS N R MANDELA AND F W DE KLERK

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we are honoured to welcome amongst  us  today  two
South Africans who played a significant role in laying a foundation for  the
parliamentary democracy we started 10 years ago. As we mark  this  occasion,
we remember how it was from this Chamber  that  Mr  F  W  de  Klerk  made  a
statement that both literally and symbolically opened the gates to usher  in
a new era for our country.

Subsequently, on 9 May 1994,  the  democratically  elected  members  of  the
National Assembly were sworn in. Most importantly, apart from  electing  the
Presiding Officers of the National Assembly, the  House  elected  the  first
President of a democratic South Africa, Mr Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.

Hon members, both Houses have invited the  two  former  members  to  address
this Joint Sitting to commemorate the start of  10  years  of  parliamentary
democracy. I would now like to call on the hon  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
National  Council  of  Provinces  to   make   some   introductory   remarks.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Madam  Speaker,  Madam
Chairperson, President of the Republic of South  Africa,  Deputy  President,
hon members and guests, I am humbled and  indeed  deeply  thankful  for  the
honour bestowed upon me to say a few words about the former  Presidents,  Dr
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and Mr F W de Klerk at this  auspicious  occasion,
the address by them of the Joint Sitting of Parliament.

On 2 February 1990, a year to the hour after he had been elected  leader  of
the NP, President De Klerk delivered the traditional speech at  the  opening
of the new session of Parliament. Most of his supporters  realised  that  he
would make important announcements on reform, but few realised  exactly  how
far he would go. Towards the end of his speech, to the audible shock of  the
Conservative Party opposition, he announced not only the release  of  Nelson
Mandela, but also the unbanning of  all  political  parties  and  formations
that had  been  restricted,  including  the  SA  Communist  Party.  He  also
announced that  the  government  would  enter  into  genuine  constitutional
negotiation to create a new South Africa.

During the months and years that followed, former  President  De  Klerk  led
his  government  and  party  in  the  difficult   negotiations   that   were
characterised by numerous  crises,  including  the  assassination  of  Chris
Hani, and were bedevilled by violence and boycotts.

After the election, Mr F W De Klerk served for  two  years  as  one  of  the
Executive Deputy Presidents.  In  1996,  he  led  the  New  NP  out  of  the
Government of National Unity and a year later retired from active  politics.
Since then he has established a foundation which is dedicated  to  promoting
communication, co-operation and  understanding  between  community  leaders,
and supporting the Constitution that he helped to create.

As we celebrate 10 years of democratic  rule,  there  can  be  little  doubt
about Madiba's fingerprints over the past decade.  Through  his  vision  and
leadership, our country has in the last decade changed from  pariah  of  the
world to a position of moral and political import. For the greater  part  of
his life and as he correctly observed in his  autobiography,  Long  Walk  to
Freedom, Madiba has  been  the  symbol  of  justice  in  the  court  of  the
oppressor, the representative of the great ideals of freedom,  fairness  and
democracy in a society that dishonoured those values.

He is the greatest statesman of our time and has  indeed  become  a  saintly
icon of the world. It is part of  Madiba's  charm  that  he  can  be  humble
without a hint of false modesty.

Having been inaugurated as the  first  President  of  the  democratic  South
Africa, he arrived in his office with nothing. To get a notebook  or  a  pen
he had to  ask  the  civil  servants,  who  told  him  that  every  item  of
stationery, as well as tea and coffee, had to be ordered from  Pretoria.  It
was not because they were unco-operative, they had their own style of  doing
things, to which Madiba easily adjusted.

Throughout his tenure he sought to give meaning and content  to  the  policy
and philosophy of reconciliation and nation-building. Although he  sometimes
came out strongly against whites who seemed unwilling  to  embrace  the  new
political dispensation, he has never  ceased  to  emphasise  and  appeal  to
whites and  other  minority  groups  to  consider  themselves  part  of  the
majority.

We, and indeed the entire country, are very grateful  to  be  accorded  this
rare opportunity to be addressed by this humble  giant  of  Africa.  Indeed,
his commanding presence will inspire us to greater heights in our quest  for
service delivery.

In  a  life  that  is  characterised  by  social   ills   in   unprecedented
proportions, he symbolises the triumph  of  man's  spirit  over  inhumanity.
Indeed, a South African writer, André Brink, has  observed  that  he  walked
free and, with him, the nation  began  to  walk  to  freedom.  Although  the
challenges are new and the terrain of struggle has changed, we are still  in
the gallant walk. However,  the  momentum  has  increased  and  a  sense  of
urgency is much greater.

We are in no doubt and indeed are satisfied that when  he  left  office,  he
left us with a solid foundation, with able team leaders under the  inspiring
leadership of President Thabo Mbeki in order to continue building  on  those
foundations. The President and indeed the  entire  nation  have  not  failed
Comrade Madiba in this regard. He  knows,  though,  that  we  can  never  be
satisfied with what we have achieved materially and in terms  of  attitudes.
A lot more has to be done, and we dare not fail our people.

Madam Speaker, hon members, I  present  to  you  the  honourable  Dr  Nelson
Rolihlahla Mandela and honourable F W de Klerk to address this august  Joint
Sitting. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         ADDRESS BY MR F W DE KLERK

Agb Speaker, Mnr die President, vorige President Mandela, agb lede,  ek  het
nooit verwag dat ek weer hier sal staan en die geleentheid  sal  hê  om  van
hier af te praat nie. Baie dankie vir die groot eer my aangedoen.  Saam  met
alle Suid-Afrikaners juig my hart vandag oor die wonderlike geleentheid  wat
ons vier as ons terugkyk op 10 goeie jare vir  ons  land  en  al  sy  mense.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Madam Speaker, Mr President,  former  President  Mandela,  hon  members,  I
would never have expected to stand here again and have  the  opportunity  to
address you. Thank you for the great honour bestowed on  me.  Together  with
all South Africans, my heart gladly celebrates this wonderful occasion  when
we look back on 10 good years for our country and its people. [Applause.]]

The past 10 years were made possible by five very extraordinary years  which
preceded  them.  I  am  not  saying  this  because  it  coincided  with   my
presidency. No, they were extraordinary because of the  historic  agreements
which we achieved during those years; because we averted a  catastrophe  and
because we successfully created a new South Africa  -  a  new  South  Africa
offering hope and justice to all its people.

I would, therefore, like to start by paying  tribute  to  all  the  men  and
women who helped to lay the foundations for the past 10 years. To all  those
from  all  parties  who  steadfastly  supported  my   efforts   to   promote
transformation while I was President, I say thank you. Together we  all  did
the right thing. All  of  us  are  co-creators  of  the  new  South  Africa.
Together all South Africans, from all our communities, helped  to  create  a
new nonracial society in which all South Africans have a right to  equality,
a right to call South Africa their home  and  a  right  to  enjoy  the  full
spectrum of rights contained  in  our  new  Constitution  and  our  Bill  of
Rights.

In particular, I would like to  pay  tribute  to  the  leaders  of  all  the
parties who participated in the negotiations and those who stood by  them  -
they are too many to name in person.

But today, in more than one  sense  of  the  word,  is  the  day  of  Nelson
Mandela, of Madiba. [Applause.] And therefore, a special tribute from me  to
a great leader, to a man who towered like a giant  in  this  transformation,
to  a  man  who  has  shown  all  of  us  what  it  means  to  really  build
reconciliation. We honour you, Sir, on this day. [Applause.]

To President Mbeki, I would also like to pay tribute. From the beginning  of
these 10 years, as first Executive Deputy President, he helped to  stabilise
and lay the foundations that brought us to this joyful day. I wish him  well
in his new term of office. [Applause.]

We South Africans can also look back with pride at  the  accomplishments  of
the past  10  years.  During  this  period  we  have  entrenched  our  young
democracy. We held three successful national  elections.  We  witnessed  the
seamless transition from  one  President  to  another,  and  our  democratic
institutions, Parliament and the  Constitutional  Court,  and  our  judicial
system and civil society began to play their assigned  roles  in  our  young
and vibrant democracy. In addition, a great deal has been  done  to  improve
the daily lives of millions of South Africans, especially in the  fields  of
housing and access to clean  water  and  electricity.  The  availability  of
social grants to the poorest of the poor has also grown dramatically.

Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done. I have little doubt that  the
second 10 years of the new South Africa will be dominated  by  economic  and
social transformation. The manner in which we deal with this challenge  will
determine the long-term success and viability of our new society. All  South
Africans must now join hands to tackle economic and social transformation  -
just  as  we  joined  hands  14  years  ago  to  tackle  the  constitutional
transformation of our country.

We need to approach, I  believe,  transformation  within  the  framework  of
three imperatives. Firstly, we need real transformation  that  will,  within
the next 10 years, substantially address the poverty and deprivation of  the
millions of disadvantaged South Africans. We must all work  for  programmes,
programmes that will substantially increase  employment,  that  will  reduce
poverty and that will effectively combat Aids and TB.  We  need  to  develop
the skills required to make our country ever more  relevant  to  the  global
economy. During this period  we  need  to  move,  preferably  naturally  and
organically, towards far more representative institutions.

Secondly, transformation must take place within the framework of  the  basic
rules governing the globalised economy. We need to ensure that South  Africa
becomes a winning nation in highly  competitive  markets,  so  that  we  can
become the first African nation to  join  the  ranks  of  the  First  World.
Thirdly, we need a transformation process that will  enjoy  the  active  and
enthusiastic support of all our  communities  and  of  all  sectors  of  our
economy.

The Government will and must lead this process. But in  this  historic  task
it will require the support of all South Africans - working  in  unison.  We
need a transformation process that will unlock the  enormous  resources  and
talents  of   advantaged   communities,   that   will   mobilise   them   to
enthusiastically address the pressing challenges of our society,  that  will
focus on effective education and training programmes, that  will  facilitate
the expeditious achievement of negotiated, pragmatic and  attainable  levels
of representivity in the public and private sectors.

Our challenge now is to continue to bring real justice  and  equity  to  all
our people - to those who  are  suffering  and  to  those  who  are  already
contributing to a better South Africa.

I call on all our people to continue to work together, to  take  hands,  and
to make our wonderful country a shining example to the rest of the world.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

                          ADDRESS BY MR N R MANDELA

Mr N R MANDELA: Madam  Speaker,  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Chairperson of  the  NCOP,  Mr  President,
Deputy President, members of the Cabinet,  Premiers,  hon  members,  we  are
deeply moved and humbled by your  magnanimous  gesture  in  inviting  us  to
address this joint session of the two Houses of Parliament.
We are aware that an exception to the Standing  Rules  had  to  be  made  in
order to  allow  a  retired  old  pensioner  who  is  neither  a  member  of
Parliament nor the serving head of state of  any  country  to  address  you.
[Laughter.] That all  the  parties  represented  in  Parliament  unanimously
consented to this extraordinary departure from the  Rules  touches  us,  not
only for the honour it pays us, but also for the spirit of our  nation  that
it speaks of. [Applause.]

We remember that on this exact day 10  years  ago  democratic  South  Africa
celebrated  its  ceremonial  birth  with  the  inauguration  of  its   first
President and two Deputy Presidents. We recall the joy and excitement  of  a
nation that had found itself, the collective relief that we had stepped  out
of our restrictive past and the expectant air of  walking  into  a  brighter
future.

The national climate was one  of  magnanimity  and  a  great  generosity  of
spirit. As a people we were  enormously  proud  of  what  we  had  achieved,
negotiating amongst ourselves a peaceful resolution to what was regarded  as
one of the most intractable situations of conflict in  the  world.  We  were
not aware of or blind to the extent, depth and  gravity  of  the  challenges
ahead of us as we set out on that day to transform, reconstruct and  develop
our nation and our society.

However, the  overwhelming  feelings  in  those  early  days  of  democratic
nationhood were of hope and confidence. We had miraculously, as  many  said,
transcended the deep divisions  of  our  past  to  create  a  new  inclusive
democratic order. We had confidence that, as a nation,  we  would  similarly
confront and deal with the challenges of reconstruction and development.

This old man, who was greatly honoured by the nation and  Parliament  to  be
elected founding President of democratic South Africa,  notes  with  immense
satisfaction and pride today  the  persistence  and  strengthening  of  that
spirit of  generosity,  magnanimity  and  confident  hopefulness  about  the
future of our nation. [Applause.]

Merely observing this Parliament inspires  national  pride  and  confidence.
"We, the people of South Africa", the preamble to our  Constitution  states,
"believe that South Africa belongs to all who live  in  it,  united  in  our
diversity." The makeup of this Parliament confirms that the people of  South
Africa had spoken in all its diversity, asserting the strength of our  unity
in diversity.

Allow us, Madam  Speaker,  to  congratulate  you,  the  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces and your Deputies on your  election  to  these
important  and  prestigious  positions   in   our   democracy.   [Applause.]
Parliament is the voice of the people and you, the Presiding Officers,  bear
a heavy responsibility in ensuring  that  the  voice  is  clearly  heard  in
national affairs and that its role be  protected  and  defended.  Similarly,
our congratulations to all the members of Parliament in whom the nation  has
put its trust. Yours is the almost sacred duty to ensure government  by  the
people under the Constitution.

Madam Speaker, we also wish to extend congratulations to our  President  and
to those that he has appointed as members of his  national  Cabinet  and  to
the positions of provincial Premiers. I have said it so often, but  want  to
repeat it here, at what must certainly be  the  last  time  that  Parliament
will bend its own Rules to allow me address it. [Laughter.] No President  or
Prime Minister in the history of this country can claim to  have  done  more
for the people and the country than has been  achieved  by  President  Thabo
Mbeki. [Applause.] He is a modest man and I know he would prefer that  I  do
not sing his personal praises but his achievement as President and  national
leader  is  the  embodiment  of  what  a  nation  is  capable   of.   Public
acknowledgement of his achievements is to affirm ourselves as a  nation,  to
assert the confidence with which we face our  national  future  and  conduct
ourselves on the international stage. Thank you, Mr President,  for  leading
us with such vision and dedication to your task.

Assuming that Parliament is not cavalier about its own Rules and  that  this
is my last address to this House, what do I wish for our democracy  in  this
second decade that we have  entered?  Let  us  never  be  unmindful  of  the
terrible past from which we come - that memory, not as a means  to  keep  us
shackled to the past in the negative manner but rather as a joyous  reminder
of how far we have come and how much we  have  achieved;  the  memory  of  a
history of division and hate, injustice and suffering, inhumanity of  person
against person should inspire us to celebrate our own demonstration  of  the
capacity of human beings to progress, to  go  forward,  to  improve,  to  do
better.

There are many theoretical debates about the meaning of democracy that I  am
not qualified to enter into. A guiding  principle  in  our  search  for  and
establishment of a nonracial inclusive democracy in  our  country  has  been
that there are good men and women to be found in all  groups  and  from  all
sectors of society, and that  in  an  open  and  free  society  those  South
Africans will come  together  to  jointly  and  co-operatively  realise  the
common good.

My wish is that South Africans never give up  on  the  belief  in  goodness,
that they cherish that faith  in  human  beings  as  a  cornerstone  of  our
democracy. The first value mentioned under the founding  principles  of  our
Constitution is that of human dignity.  We  accord  a  person's  dignity  by
assuming that they are good, that they share the human qualities we  ascribe
to  ourselves.  Historical  enemies  succeeded  in  negotiating  a  peaceful
transition from apartheid to democracy exactly because we were  prepared  to
accept the inherent capacity for goodness in the other.

We live in a world where there is enough reason for  cynicism  and  despair.
We watch as two of the leading democracies, two leading nations of the  Free
World get involved in a war that the United Nations  did  not  sanction.  We
look on with horror as  reports  surface  of  terrible  abuses  against  the
dignity of human beings  held  captive  by  invading  forces  in  their  own
country. [Applause.] We see how the powerful  countries,  all  of  them  so-
called  democracies,   manipulate   multilateral   bodies   to   the   great
disadvantage and suffering of the  poorer  developing  nations.  [Applause.]
There is enough reason for cynicism and despair, but  then  we  should  take
heart from our own experience and performance.

Let us refrain  from  chauvinistic  breast-beating,  but  let  us  also  not
underrate what we have achieved in establishing  a  stable  and  progressive
democracy where we take freedom seriously, in  building  national  unity  in
spite of decades and centuries  of  apartheid  and  colonial  rule,  and  in
creating a culture in which we increasingly respect the dignity of  all.  In
a cynical world we have become an inspiration to many. We signal  that  good
can be achieved amongst human beings who are prepared to trust and  who  are
prepared to believe in the goodness of people.

Poverty, unemployment, preventable disease and ill health  and  other  forms
of social deprivation continue to blot our landscape as we  strive  to  give
content to the democratic commitment of  a  better  life  for  all.  Nothing
impairs the dignity of a person so much as not being able to find  work  and
gainful employment. The human immunodeficiency virus and  Aids  continue  to
threaten our future in a particularly frightening manner.

Our democracy must bring its material fruits to all, particularly the  poor,
marginalised and vulnerable.  Our  belief  in  the  common  good  ultimately
translates into a deep concern for those that suffer  want  and  deprivation
of any kind. We are inspired by the commitment that  has  emerged  from  all
parties that have participated  in  the  past  elections.  This  Parliament,
leading into the second decade of  democracy,  promises  to  take  seriously
that contract with the people to improve their lives.

We are impressed by the spirit of inclusiveness exuded  by  our  legislature
and our executive. We are warmed by the spirit of generosity that  continues
to characterise our nation and national efforts.

We thank Parliament for this opportunity to greet the  dawn  of  our  second
decade of democracy. We wish you well.


  May God protect our people.

             THANKS TO FORMER PRESIDENT MANDELA AND MR DE KLERK

The  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  Madam
Chairperson of the NCOP, the Deputy Speaker, and the Deputy  Chairperson  of
the NCOP, President, Deputy President, former President Mandela  and  Mr  De
Klerk,  on  behalf  of  this  Joint  Sitting,  which  reflects  the   public
representatives of our country and, I daresay, on behalf of the  members  of
South African society seated in the gallery and those at home, I would  like
to say to both Mr De Klerk and former President Mandela that there not  many
words with which we can say, ``Thank you for  having  honoured  us  today.''
[Applause.]

As we mark the 10-year anniversary  of  our  democracy,  as  a  country,  we
cannot forget the roles that both of you have played in  different  ways  to
chart the path in which we have all  walked  to  be  where  we  are.  I  can
imagine the day when you, Mr De Klerk, took the decision to convince  people
that it was time to change; people who for many  years  have  had  to  think
differently about who they are in relation to others. I would say that  that
day marked a deposit into an insurance policy, a policy that has  had  value
for all South Africans.

President Mandela, some of us who were young on that day when you  came  out
of Victor Verster Prison wondered what the next step would be.  When  Mr  De
Klerk said that all political  parties  were  unbanned,  we  actually  never
trusted that statement. We thought that it might be a trap.  But,  as  South
Africans, we always surprise ourselves. We had faith and we believed in  who
we are as a country and what we are capable of doing,  and  that  faith  and
belief, but also hard  work,  has  led  us  to  build  a  country  that  you
yourselves, as you  have  said  today,  have  been  proud  to  be  citizens.
[Applause.]
We would like to say, in thanking you, that your words of  wisdom  have  not
fallen on deaf ears. The commitment we have made  will  continue  to  ensure
that we do indeed build a better life for  all  South  Africans.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

                             UNVEILING OF PLAQUE

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We shall now proceed to the  unveiling  of  the
plaque. The Deputy Speaker will read out the words on the  plaque  when  the
plaque is unveiled. The plaque being unveiled is a replica of the  one  that
will soon be permanently mounted on the granite plinth outside the  National
Assembly. We now invite the hon  President,  the  Deputy  President,  Mr  De
Klerk and the Deputy Speaker to join us in front of the podium. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, please don't get up yet. Allow  me  first  to  say
what I have to say. That  concludes  the  business  of  the  Joint  Sitting.
However, members and guests are requested to remain seated while the  plaque
is being unveiled. After  the  unveiling,  the  procession  will  leave  the
Chamber through the front doors.  Members  and  guests  would  then  follow.
[Applause.]

The House adjourned at 11:35.
