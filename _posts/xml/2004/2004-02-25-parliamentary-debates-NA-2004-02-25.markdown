TABLINGS
National Assembly

1.    The Speaker


     Report of Delegation to 7th Session  of  African,  Caribbean,  Pacific-
     European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,  12
     to 19 February 2004.


     The 7th Session of the African, Caribbean, Pacific-European Union Joint
     Parliamentary Assembly (ACP-EU JPA) met in Addis Ababa,  Ethiopia  from
     16 to 19 February 2004. As usual, the joint  plenary  was  preceded  by
     meetings of the ACP and Joint Bureaus (of which South Africa is  now  a
     member), of the ACP plenary and also of the three Standing Committees -
     on Political Affairs, on Economic Development, Finance and Trade and on
     Social Affairs and the Environment.


     The delegation consisted of Dr. Rob Davies and Ms Ntshadi  Tsheole.  We
     were accompanied by Mr Saul Pelle of the South African Embassy  to  the
     EU in Brussels  and  Mr  Mtutu  Masiza  of  Parliament's  International
     Relations Unit. Ahead of the JPA there was also a workshop on  Economic
     Partnership Agreements and  their  implications  for  the  Eastern  and
     Southern African region (of which Ethiopia, the host country, is part).
     This was an informal activity of the  Economic  Development  Committee,
     sponsored by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, at which Rob Davies made  an
     input.


     The 7th Session operated  according  to  the  new  rules  of  procedure
     adopted ahead of the 6th session. These provide for resolutions  to  be
     tabled via the Standing Committees with the  possibility  of  only  two
     "urgent resolutions" per session being tabled independently  on  topics
     agreed by the Joint Bureau. The motivation for this new procedure is to
     encourage the JPA to focus its attention on the common issues of ACP-EU
     relations, rather than the bilateral issues that have in the  past,  in
     practice, dominated JPA proceedings. It was agreed at the Joint  Bureau
     meeting held in Brussels in January that the "urgent resolutions" would
     be on "Cotton and other basic commodities: Problems encountered by  ACP
     countries" and "Damage caused by Cyclones in the Pacific, Indian  Ocean
     and Caribbean and the need for a rapid response to natural  disasters".
     This meant that the JPA proceedings were  largely  focused  on  generic
     rather than bilateral issues. Although the crisis  in  Haiti  was  also
     included on the agenda, the Joint  Bureau  agreed  to  an  exchange  of
     views, but no resolution. However, the discussion was  led  by  Caricom
     delegations, who argued in support of  the  Caricom  plan  calling  for
     dialogue,  but  rejecting  any  violent  overthrow  of   the   Aristide
     government.


     The  resolutions  emerging  from  the  Committees  were  on   "Conflict
     Resolution and Lasting Peace" (Political Affairs Committee);  "Economic
     Partnership Agreements"  (Economic  Affairs  Committee)  and  "Poverty,
     diseases and Reproductive health in ACP countries in the context of the
     ninth European Development Fund" (Social Affairs Committee). There  was
     a fair degree of consensus on the  first  and  the  third  reports  and
     resolutions, as well as on  the  two  urgent  resolutions.  There  was,
     however, a degree of disagreement on the EPA resolution. The resolution
     was adopted by the Committee with a majority made up by the ACP  voting
     together with the European PSE (socialist), Green and GUE (left) groups
     against  the  PPE  (conservative)  group.  The  PPE  indicated  in  the
     Committee that they would call for a vote in plenary by separate houses
     and would vote against the resolution emanating from the  Committee  if
     it were put unamended to the plenary. As the PPE has a majority in  the
     EU house, there  was  a  possibility  that  this  resolution  would  be
     defeated as was a resolution on the WTO post-Cancun at the 6th  session
     in Rome. This led to a process of negotiation, in which our  delegation
     participated at the request of the ACP Secretary General. A  compromise
     was eventually reached, which resulted in fudging clauses on additional
     funding to address restructuring and revenue losses  arising  from  the
     introduction of reciprocity, the  introduction  of  "Singapore  issues"
     into EPA negotiations and trade in  service  negotiations  in  the  EPA
     context allowing for the retention of the right  of  ACP  countries  to
     maintain public services in key areas. Although the original clauses on
     these issues were significantly "watered down" in the  compromise,  the
     aim was to leave space for further debates. The debate on  this  topic,
     during which we took the floor, was attended by EU trade  commissioner,
     Pascal Lamy. In his input, the Commissioner spoke of "reinforcement  of
     regional integration" being "a heart of EPAs". Since the  regions  that
     will be negotiating EPAs, particularly in Eastern and Southern  Africa,
     do not correspond either with any existing Regional Economic  Community
     or the AU defined region, a major challenge of aligning the EPA process
     with regional and continental initiatives clearly exists.  Commissioner
     Lamy also spoke of reciprocity in trade being  introduced  through  the
     EPA process in a "progressively and _harnessed manner".  Clearly  there
     are many issues here; including the  extent  of  reciprocal  duty  free
     opening up of ACP countries' markets to EU imports,  the  length  of  a
     transition to reciprocity, preserving the  rights  of  Least  Developed
     Countries to non-reciprocal duty free access to the EU, and the funding
     of adjustment costs by ACP countries. All of  these  issues  have  been
     taken up by the ACP side, as the input from Mauritian Minister Cuttaree
     for the ACP Council made clear. Differences, however,  exist  on  these
     and other issues. A view beginning to  emerge  from  discussions  among
     parliamentarians in the Southern Africa group (which in the EPA context
     will be the five SACU countries plus Mozambique, Angola  and  Tanzania)
     is that the issue of reciprocity has already been settled in our region
     by the fact that the  bilateral  Trade,  Development  and  Co-operation
     Agreement with South Africa de facto extends reciprocity to other  SACU
     countries. With the EU having half promised to allow duty  free  access
     for all products from ACP countries involved in the  EPA  process,  and
     LDCs having this right on a non-reciprocal basis, the  Southern  Africa
     EPA  should  focus  largely  on  developmental  issues  and  non-tariff
     barriers in the EU market (subsidies and technical barriers to trade).


     The Economic Development Committee (on which we serve) will prepare its
     next report on the controversial issue of  "budgetising"  the  European
     Development Fund, which currently operates on the  basis  of  voluntary
     contributions by EU member states. In the debate  on  this  issue,  the
     development  commissioner,   Paul   Nielson,   spoke   in   favour   of
     budgetisation (i.e. including EDF  funding  in  the  European  budget),
     arguing this was the best way to ensure funding for development in  ACP
     countries -  particularly  with  EU  enlargement  on  the  horizon.  He
     declined, however, to offer an assurance that no ACP country  would  be
     worse off after budgetisation, saying that the focus of funding was now
     on performance, and that funds would not be disbursed to countries that
     could not perform.


     The JPA also received a short input on AU  processes  from  the  Deputy
     Chairperson of the AU Commission, Mr Patrick Mazimhaka. While there was
     general support for AU programmes from the floor,  it  became  apparent
     during this debate that there is an  urgent  need  to  promote  greater
     alignment between the Cotonou and the AU processes.


     As usual Workshops were held  on  issues  of  importance  to  the  host
     country - Food Security in Ethiopia, Health and Education  and  Private
     Sector Development. We participated in the first  two,  which  involved
     visits to water security projects and  programmes  for  sufferers  from
     HIV/AIDS. These gave a vivid  impression  of  the  enormous  challenges
     facing Ethiopia, but also of the efforts being made  to  address  them.
     For  example,  Ethiopia  is  about  to  introduce  an   anti-Retroviral
     programme.


     A feature of the JPA session was  that  Ethiopian  Prime  Minister,  Mr
     Meles Zenawi, made himself available for an hour's Q and A session with
     participants, and later for a  similar  ninety-minute  engagement  with
     members of the Joint Bureau. These covered  a  wide  range  of  themes,
     including the border dispute with Eritrea. The Eritrean delegation  did
     not participate in the 7th JPA, after objecting to the venue.  The  Co-
     Presidents, however, visited Eritrea ahead of the JPA. On  this  issue,
     the Prime Minister essentially argued that  some  of  the  UN  Boundary
     Commission's recommendations were "irrational" as they divided  houses,
     churches, villages and roads. He said that under normal  circumstances,
     his country could probably have lived with them,  but  that  there  was
     serious tension in the relationship with  Eritrea  and  that,  in  this
     context, acceptance could fuel such tensions. He  said,  however,  that
     Ethiopia had renounced war as an option in resolving  this  issue,  and
     was looking for a process of dialogue similar to that  between  Nigeria
     and Cameroon on their border issues.


     The ACP Bureau, of which we are now members, recommended that  we  take
     the vacant position of Co-Vice President for Human Rights. We accepted,
     after pointing to the uncertainties  arising  from  our  election.  The
     position is essentially awarded  to  our  delegation  and  not  to  any
     individual and will be held by whoever leads our delegation to the  JPA
     after our elections. This appointment came too late for us to engage in
     ACP structures on a report drafted only by the EU Co-Vice President. In
     the Joint Bureau meeting, Rob Davies offered a number  of  comments  on
     this, suggesting that there was a need  for  greater  balance  through,
     inter alia, addressing more substantially issues  in  the  EU  such  as
     immigration policy, racism and the rise of far right populism and their
     impact on ACP relations.


     The Joint Bureau, unfortunately, did not have time for any  substantial
     discussion of the  workings  of  the  new  Committee-based  system.  In
     numerous discussions, we indicated our view that it  was  necessary  to
     strengthen  the  Committees'  work  in  the   direction   of   creating
     opportunities for  ongoing  oversight  of  the  EPA  processes,  public
     hearings and the receiving of reports on e.g. impact studies. The Joint
     Bureau did,  however,  decide  that  reports  from  the  Commission  on
     implementation of resolutions (dealt with up to now  in  a  perfunctory
     manner in plenary) should be referred to relevant Committees  for  more
     substantial processing. All of this may well require making  more  time
     available for Committee meetings.


     The 7th JPA is the last that will be held before  EU  enlargement  (May
     1st) and the European Parliamentary elections  in  June.  A  number  of
     regular participants in JPA sessions will not be returning,  and  there
     is much uncertainty about the political complexion of the new  European
     parliament. Generally, however, it is expected  that  enlargement  will
     bring in a number of countries with little experience of,  and  perhaps
     limited interest in, matters of ACP co-operation and that there will be
     major challenges to raise the profile of these issues.


     The next Bureau and Committee meetings have been tentatively  scheduled
     to  begin  on  the  5th  October  in  Brussels,  and  the   8th   Joint
     Parliamentary Assembly to take place in The Hague, Netherlands from  22
     to 25 November 2004.

                  8.5 For a period of absence on  official  duties  of  less
                  than  24  hours  in  the  circumstances  referred  to   in
                  paragraph 8.4,  an  all-inclusive   subsistence  allowance
                  equal to the allowance payable to a Judge  of  Appeal  who
                  is absent from his or her headquarters  for  a  period  of
                  less than 24 hours shall be paid.


              8.  The substitution  for  paragraph  8.10  of  the  following
                  paragraph:


                  8.10 The Speaker may  in  exceptional  cases  approve  the
                  transportation of the effects of the Public  Protector  at
                  State expense and their storage in a warehouse at  his  or
                  her  previous  home  and  at  the  seat  of   the   Public
                  Protector's office for a period not exceeding  12  months,
                  and, thereafter, their transport to his or her  new  home:
                  Provided that the office of  the  Public  Protector  shall
                  call for at least three tenders  for  the  performance  of
                  the services and the lowest tender shall  be  accepted  by
                  him or her: Provided further that the Speaker may  approve
                  the acceptance of a  higher  tender  if,  in  his  or  her
                  opinion, there are good reasons for rejecting  the  lowest
                  tender.


         B. Further recommendations


              1.  The Committee further recommends that  the  abovementioned
                  amendments shall be deemed to have come into operation  on
                  1 September 2003.
              2.  It should  be  noted  that  the  Committee  has  made  the
                  abovementioned recommendations without the benefit of  the
                  views of  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
                  Development and the Minister of Finance  in  this  regard.
                  If any additional or new adjustments to the conditions  of
                  the Public Protector are required it should be  tabled  in
                  the next Parliament.


              3.  The Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development
                  must undertake a comparative review  of  the  remuneration
                  and conditions of employment of the National  Director  of
                  the   Prosecuting   Authority,   Public   Protector    and
                  Commissioners  of   the   South   African   Human   Rights
                  Commission and Gender Commission, which must be tabled  in
                  Parliament  within  3  months  of  the  adoption  of  this
                  resolution by the National Assembly.

12.   Report of the Portfolio Committee on Transport on  the  Road  Accident
     Fund Amendment Bill [B 64 - 2003], dated 25 February 2004:


     The Portfolio Committee on Transport reports, as follows:


     1.     The National Department of Transport (NDoT)  presented  the  RAF
         Amendment Bill (2003) to the Committee in October  2003.  The  main
         objective of the Bill is to alleviate the financial burden  of  the
         RAF by introducing measures that would assist with  the  cash  flow
         situation of the organisation.


     2.     The Committee conducted relatively extensive public hearings  on
         the Bill, as well as oversight visits to  the  head-office  of  the
         RAF,  to  the  main  claims  processing  office  of  the   RAF   in
         Johannesburg, and to the offices of  personal  injury  lawyers,  in
         order to familiarise ourselves  with  the  context  and  challenges
         within which the proposed amendments were being tabled.
     3.     After considerable discussion and  deliberation,  the  Committee
         agreed that some of the proposed measures, with slight  amendments,
         were acceptable. In particular, those clauses of the Bill that:


         a. Provided for the liability of the Fund in  respect  of  hospital
              and treatment costs according to prescribed medical tariffs;
         b. Limited the liability of the Fund in respect of claims  of  non-
              residents and non-citizens of the Republic;
         c. Excluded the liability of the Fund  in  respect  of  claims  for
              emotional shock sustained as a result of witnessing, observing
              or being informed of the bodily injury  or  death  of  another
              person.


     4.     However, in the course of our deliberations, the Committee found
         other clauses to be not suitable. Specifically those that:
         a. Provided for monthly instalments and not  lump-sum  payments  in
              certain cases;
         b. Provided  for  the  mandatory  resolution  of  disputes  through
              compulsory mediation and arbitration.


     5.     Accordingly, on the 19th November 2003 the Committee proposed to
         the NDoT that a  scaled-down  version  of  the  Amendment  Bill  be
         drafted and adopted. On the 18th February 2003, the  NDoT  reported
         back  to  the  Committee  that  the  Department  agreed  with   the
         Committee's proposals.


     6.     Unfortunately, with the  impending  dissolution  of  Parliament,
         there is insufficient time to proceed effectively  with  the  Bill.
         In the light  of  the  wide-ranging  public  presentations  at  our
         hearings, and in the light of the agreement between  the  Committee
         and the Department, we hope that the incoming  Parliament  will  be
         able to take the process forward with relative speed,  and  mindful
         of what has preceded.


     7.     The Committee also recommends that the new Parliament approaches
         the Bill with three other general considerations in mind:


         a. Proceeding with the Amendment Bill should not detract  from  the
              need  to  address  other  urgent  operational  and   financial
              challenges to ensure the short-term sustainability of the RAF;


         b. Legislative amendments and  operational  amendments  should  not
              pre-empt or distract from  the  medium-term  imperative  of  a
              major transformation of the Fund, as  envisaged,  broadly,  by
              the Road Accident Fund Commission Report; and


         c. Reform and eventual transformation  of  the  Fund  is  only  one
              aspect of the challenge. Even more critical is the pursuit  of
              all-round strategies to reduce the number  of  fatalities  and
              injuries on our roads.

         Petrick and Ms V van Zyl.


         Having  considered  the  shortlist  and  having   interviewed   the

         with section 5  of  the  Independent  Communications  Authority  of

         that the  following  candidates  be  appointed  as  councillors  to
