                             APPROPRIATION BILL
                               (Policy Debate)

Vote No 21 - Correctional Services; Vote No 22  -  Defence;  Vote  No  24  -
Justice and Constitutional Development; Vote No 25 - Safety and Security:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I take this opportunity to welcome the  hon
Minister and Deputy Ministers present here this morning, and thank  you  for
coming. I also welcome the hon Minister Ngconde Balfour who has  moved  from
Sport to Correctional  Services.  [Laughter.]  We  want  to  invite  you  to
address the National Council of Provinces.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson.
The Commissioner of Correctional Services is very strict  about  what  I  am
called. He insists that I  only  be  called  the  Minister  of  Correctional
Services. There should be no reference to my previous  life.  [Laughter.]  I
agree with the commissioner. [Interjections.] It is  very  sporting  of  me.
[Laughter.]

Chairperson,  Cabinet  colleagues,  hon  members,  MECs   and   members   of
provincial  legislatures,  Chairperson   of   the   National   Council   for
Correctional Services Judge Desai, Inspecting Judge Fagan  -  they  are  all
there in the  gallery  -  stakeholders  and  community  representatives,  in
addressing you  this  morning  I  want  to  put  into  context  the  serious
incidents that occurred at three of our correctional centres  in  Mpumalanga
and Gauteng during the past four days.

Members of  Correctional  Services,  aligned  to  some  unions,  engaged  in
illegal strike action at the Barberton and Nelspruit  Correctional  Centres.
Despite Correctional Services  being  designated  an  essential  service  in
terms of section 71(8) of the Labour Relations Act of 1995, members  engaged
in irresponsible and illegal actions that had the potential of  putting  the
safety and security of the public at risk. At  Barberton  this  resulted  in
inmates not being provided with meals for  more  than  24  hours,  while  at
Nelspruit 800 awaiting-trial detainees broke out of their cells  by  forcing
the doors after they realised that members of staff were not on duty.

It was only the quick action by  management  and  nonstriking  members  that
prevented a mass breakout at Nelspruit.  While  waiting  for  reinforcements
from the SAPS and from the SA National Defence Force,  seven  dedicated  and
loyal members at Nelspruit stood between the inmates and  possible  escapes.
Firing five warning shots, these committed men contained the situation  and,
with the  assistance  of  reinforcements,  they  succeeded  in  getting  all
inmates back into  their  cells,  thus  preventing  any  escapes.  They  put
themselves at risk of  being  overpowered,  but  were  very  true  to  their
mandate of the ideal correctional official. At Barberton,  36  members  took
it upon themselves to maintain  order  and  control,  despite  irresponsible
actions by others. Those members remained on duty for  more  than  29  hours
without any consideration for their  own  lives  before  being  relieved  by
support staff.

When reinforcement staff came from Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal,  they  arrived
at Barberton and were confronted by illegal strikers  who  wanted  to  block
their path to duty. Undaunted by this,  these  committed  men  responded  by
singing a song that included the words: ``Mti and Balfour, send us  anywhere
and anytime; we will work for you.'' [Applause.]

That had the desired effect, and I can report  to  hon  members  today  that
stability has been restored at Barberton and Nelspruit  which  I  personally
visited yesterday,  while  at  the  Devon  Correctional  Centre  in  Gauteng
nonstriking members continued to be in charge of the situation.

It is on behalf of these committed men and women that  I  stand  before  you
today. They are the true deliverers of a better life for all our people.  It
is they who remain true to the spirit of Batho Pele and its principles,  and
it is for them that the Deputy Minister, the  Commissioner  of  Correctional
Services and I will continue to strive for better working conditions.

It is also true that  at  Correctional  Services  we  are  faced  with  many
challenges relating to remuneration  and  service  conditions.  Our  members
work under stressful conditions, given the nature of their  work.  Those  at
the coalface of security, correction and  care  within  our  facilities  are
potentially exposed to risk, as I have illustrated  to  you  today.  I  will
soon be making a presentation to Cabinet, dealing with the remuneration  and
service  conditions  of  all  our  members.  This  will  include  addressing
critical shortages of professional staff as we fail to  attract  and  retain
much-needed  professionals  simply  because  we  offer  noncompetitive   and
unattractive remuneration packages.

The matter of overtime remuneration is also being tackled as a  priority.  A
task  team,  involving  the  Department  of   Correctional   Services,   the
Department of  the  Public  Service  and  Administration  and  the  National
Treasury, has already completed research and  submitted  recommendations  on
how the weekly establishment  of  the  department  could  be  structured  to
ensure efficient delivery of services.

I have developed an appreciation for the concerns  of  members  relating  to
parity in salaries,  medical  aid  contributions  and  benefits,  and  other
issues such as career advancement and  work  conditions.  These  are,  after
all, matters pertinent to  contributing  towards  pride  in  the  workplace.
However, as a country, we cannot  tolerate  irresponsible  actions  as  have
happened in the past few days.

Those who have made themselves guilty of indiscipline,  illegal  action  and
the disruption of essential services will have  to  bear  the  consequences.
Their actions are unjustified and reprehensible and have put  the  lives  of
others and the public of  both  Barberton  and  Nelspruit  at  risk.  Unions
within the Department of Correctional  Services  operate  within  an  agreed
framework, and I will continue to honour this. I want to repeat that I  will
continue to honour unions that work within these parameters.

At the same time, where individuals or groups of members of  unions  act  as
they did over the past few days, their unions - I am actually  appealing  to
them - must call them to order. If those involved are members of any of  the
progressive unions that we know of within Correctional Services  and  within
the unions that they claim to be part of, then those unions at the  regional
level and at the national level have a responsibility to the  South  African
public to ensure compliance with agreements  that  govern  the  relationship
between themselves and the Department of Correctional Services.
The budget of  the  department  for  the  2004-05  financial  year  is  R8,4
billion. It will provide for an overall establishment of  35  197  personnel
and for  the  supervision  of  an  average  prison  population  of  187  000
prisoners and 72 000 probationers and parolees.  This  includes  allocations
of R2,5 billion for the national office;  R1,322  billion  for  the  Gauteng
region; R1,1 billion for the Western Cape; R972 million  for  KwaZulu-Natal;
R821 million for the Free State and Northern Cape region; R820  million  for
the North West/Limpopo/Mpumalanga region and R795,4 million for the  Eastern
Cape.

Expenditure on compensation of employees is expected to consume  an  average
of 63,9% of the Vote  over  the  medium  term,  while  payment  for  capital
assets, which includes the building of new prisons  by  the  department  and
all payments to private prison contractors, should  consume  an  average  of
14,7%,  mainly  because  of  the  increased  allocation  to   payments   for
capitalisation.
Included  in  the  budget   allocation   is   compensation   of   employees'
expenditure,  which  amounts  to  R5,36  billion  for  personnel   salaries,
allowances and bonuses. Over the medium term this  category  of  expenditure
continues  to  dominate,  owing  to  the   personnel-intensive   nature   of
incarceration  and  rehabilitation,   as   well   as   associated   overtime
expenditure for staffing correctional facilities. An  additional  allocation
of R100 million in 2005-06 will provide staff for new  correctional  centres
and for the related day-to-day operating costs of their activities.

The budget also provides for an amount of R111 million for the  purchase  of
departmental equipment and R1,143 billion for the capital works projects  of
which R194,731 million provides for the fixed portion of the public  private
partnerships  prisons.  This  allocation  includes  new  capital   projects,
maintenance and professional fees.

The total medium-term expenditure framework  allocation  for  capital  works
projects, with allocations of R914,162 million, R982,950 million and  R1,007
billion respectively for the 2004-05 to 2006-07  financial  years,  provides
for the building of four new prisons which will be commissioned in the 2005-
06 financial year. These prisons will be in Gauteng, the Northern  Cape  and
North West.

While Government has made huge strides in the  transformation  of  policing,
as well as the prosecutorial and judicial system during the past ten  years,
we must acknowledge that within Correctional  Services,  transformation  did
not always receive the attention that it warranted. Much of  our  focus  was
on safe custody. A turnaround on this narrow focus has  been  started  under
my predecessor, the hon Mr Ben Skosana and the Commissioner of  Correctional
Services, Mr Linda Mti. Our strategic plans for 2004 to 2007 will  build  on
this foundation of transforming the department and the correctional system.
At Correctional Services we are committed to playing our part in  furthering
integrated governance within the  Justice,  Crime  Prevention  and  Security
Cluster. Our programmes will be consistently aimed at  contributing  towards
delivery on the security priorities, as outlined in  the  President's  state
of the nation address. Central to  this  is  effective  correction,  focused
rehabilitation  and  the  social  reintegration  of  offenders  into   their
communities.

A draft White Paper on Corrections has  been  approved  by  Cabinet,  and  a
joint task team with Treasury has also finalised the costing  of  the  White
Paper's implementation plan. This will be presented  to  Cabinet  and,  upon
approval by Cabinet, a policy conference will be held in the latter part  of
the year to align existing policies with it. The White  Paper  is  aimed  at
steering the transformation of  the  correctional  system  and  delivery  on
rehabilitation. Over the next decade, we will  pursue  a  new  direction  in
correctional management, and the department will  contribute  fully  to  the
drive towards the  attainment  of  social  crime  prevention  and  effective
integrated criminal justice in the country.

The imperatives from which we derive our mandate at Correctional Services  -
that include the Constitution, the white Paper,  the  Correctional  Services
Act 111 of 1998, its regulations,  policies  and  procedures  -  create  the
space for concentrated delivery. We have opted to develop best  practice  in
the implementation of  the  White  Paper  through  establishing  centres  of
excellence in each region. In these centres we will  be  able  to  put  into
practice the needs-based corrections, development and care  programmes  that
are implicit in the White Paper. A total of 36 centres  of  excellence  will
be put in place. Already 23 sites have been identified,  with  the  regional
breakdown being four for the Western  Cape,  three  for  the  Eastern  Cape,
three for KwaZulu-Natal, three for Free State and Northern  Cape,  five  for
Gauteng, five for Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West.

The White Paper calls for a profound commitment by South Africans to  create
the conditions in which the correctional system is solely charged  with  the
care and correction of those who require focused attention  of  professional
correctional officials and those who require to be corrected outside of  the
mainstream of society. Crime prevention and rehabilitation require a  social
compact between government and civil society and, as such,  I  believe  that
we need to mobilise  our  communities  around  issues  of  social  cohesion,
social  justice,  moral  regeneration,  ethical  values  and  socio-economic
development.

Correction is indeed not merely a mandate of the department responsible  for
running  the  correctional  centres  and  community   corrections   offices.
Correction  is  a  societal   responsibility   of   all   institutions   and
individuals.  As  Government,  we  believe  that  correction  -  both  self-
correction and correction of others  -  is  inherent  in  good  citizenship.
Correctional Services is tasked to place rehabilitation  at  the  centre  of
all of its activities. However, the challenge  of  social  reintegration  of
offenders into their families and  communities  is  not  achievable  without
partnerships.

The Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster has  taken  the  lead  in
forging partnerships and the high degree of co-ordination  and  co-operation
within the cluster must  be  extended  to  provinces  and  local  government
structures. It is crucial for Correctional Services that  we  forge  similar
partnerships and levels of co-ordination  and  integration  with  provincial
departments responsible for safety  and  security,  social  development  and
health.  Currently,  we  participate  in  justice  and  safety   forums   at
provincial and local government  level  where  issues  such  as  information
sharing, overcrowding, awaiting trial detainees alternative  sentencing  are
addressed. I want to emphasise that they are not awaiting  trial  prisoners.
A prisoner is a sentenced detainee. If you are  not  sentenced,  you  are  a
detainee.

Of major concern is  the  increasing  number  of  young  people  who  commit
crimes. More than 73 000 young people in the prime of  their  lives  are  in
our facilities, with 26 781 between the  ages  of  18  and  25  years  being
awaiting trial detainees. Some may indeed  be  there  due  to  the  lack  of
alternative  facilities  for  children  awaiting  trial.  Others  are  there
because they have been charged with and sentenced for  serious  crimes  that
include  murder,   rape   and   drug   abuse.   This   has   increased   the
responsibilities on Correctional Services, as  well  as  the  Department  of
Social Development which has a significant role to  play  in  providing  for
the care of children in distress. Provincial Social Development  Departments
will increasingly have to manage places of safety for young offenders as  an
alternative to being placed in correctional centres.

The provision of health services for inmates is also growing in  importance.
Most provincial departments are diverting  their  responsibilities  relating
to health to Correctional Services. We enter into service  level  agreements
with provinces for the provision of health services for  which  we  have  to
pay without any  concomitant  increase  in  our  budget.  Add  to  this  our
difficulty in attracting and retaining health  professionals  and  you  will
begin to appreciate the need  for  greater  integration  between  the  three
tiers of government if we want to remain true  to  our  mandate  of  service
delivery to all our people.

I will be embarking on  road  shows  in  the  provinces  to  meet  political
leaders and to give effect to community outreach programmes of  Correctional
Services. I am calling on the support of Premiers and MECs in  this  regard,
and I do want to invite members of the NCOP to join us in September when  we
reach out to communities throughout the country. We will launch  a  project,
``Correction  as  a  Societal  Responsibility''  that  will   culminate   in
community activities at Drakenstein Correctional Centre in the Western  Cape
on Heritage Day. I do realise that communities are angry  with  inmates  who
are often perceived as being contemptuous of the rule of law.

It remains our responsibility at Correctional Services, and as national  and
provincial political leaders, to convince the  public  that  correction  and
rehabilitation do not translate into soft peddling  on  crime.  We  need  to
convince our constituents that correction and rehabilitation  are  aimed  at
ensuring the safety and security of the public. They  must  understand  that
we cannot release into society angry young people who have  had  no  benefit
of correction and rehabilitation. If we want to  continue  to  do  that,  it
will be at the risk of increasing levels of repeat offending. I  would  like
to extend a hand to communities to assist me in ensuring  that  intervention
and rehabilitation programmes become compulsory for all young offenders.  We
cannot leave them at the mercy of the masters of crime  who  operate  within
our correctional centres all over the  country.  We  cannot  leave  them  to
gangs because if we do, the gangs  will  take  them  up  and  they  will  be
members of those gangs.

We call on hon members here to join us as  we  strive  to  ensure  that  our
resources are prioritised towards the  correction  and  development  of  the
youth, particularly first offenders. It is the youth to  whom  we  have  the
highest moral obligation to correct their offending behaviour and  to  steer
them away from the influence and control of habitual criminals.

We also need to increasingly encourage the use  of  appropriate  alternative
sentencing options within the criminal justice system. The  department  must
enhance service delivery to parolees and probationers in  order  to  prevent
repeat offending which has an impact  on  expenditure.  Within  our  budget,
provision has been made for  constituting  and  implementing  Remission  and
Parole Boards, and it is envisaged that  recruitment  of  staff  for  parole
boards will start next month, while training will follow in August.

As we proceed with the transformation of the correctional  system,  we  need
the criminal justice  system  to  be  responsive  to  greater  capacity  for
rehabilitation and correction that will emerge within the  department.  This
must inform the approach that we develop  to  sentencing  and  to  releasing
offenders on parole,  both  of  whom  must  be  focused  on  furthering  the
correction of the offending behaviour of the sentenced offender.

It is true  that  there  are  members  of  the  Department  of  Correctional
Services who do not see themselves as service  providers,  as  evidenced  by
the legal actions at Barberton and  Nelspruit.  The  transformation  of  the
department  must  entail  addressing  improved  service  delivery   by   our
officials who must fully  understand  that  their  function  is  to  provide
services to  offenders,  their  families  and  friends.  We  therefore  need
committed frontline workers such as those who I alluded to  earlier  and  we
must demonstrate appreciation when they go beyond  the  reasonable  call  of
duty.  Consideration  is  being  given  to  implementing  service   delivery
excellence awards nationally through which members would be judged by  their
peers and honoured accordingly.

Cabinet has also endorsed  the  introduction  of  a  departmental  corporate
identity  that  enables  all  members  to  identify  themselves   with   the
Department of Correctional Services. Through this, members  also  have  some
indication of  respective  positions  within  the  department.  Uniform  and
insignia are a reflection of  mutual  respect  that  is  expected  from  our
members. I am very proud of that uniform. When they sit there  wearing  that
uniform, I am  proud  of  all  of  them,  starting  with  the  Commissioner.
[Applause.] I will be wearing mine within no time - they  are  still  taking
some sizes. [Laughter.] So you will see me coming here wearing  my  cap  and
everything and you will know that I am the First correctional official.

We are committed to instilling in the Department of Correctional Services  a
strong sense of personal and  organisational  discipline.  Communities  will
never respect us as long as we engage in activities  that  are  in  conflict
with the best interests of the people that we claim to serve.

We must dispel the public perception that we are  an  organisation  that  is
riddled with corruption and maladministration. In order to do this, we  must
start dealing effectively and expeditiously with corruption. I am  committed
to supporting the work of the Jali Commission.  We  have  already  benefited
from the 11 Interim Reports of the Jali Commission  and  the  investigations
of the Special Investigative Unit. Culprits  will  be  prosecuted  and  they
need to know that they will no longer be able to exploit  weaknesses  within
internal disciplinary procedures. Later this morning, I will  take  delivery
from the UN Office on Drugs  and  Crime  an  assessment  of  anti-corruption
capacity within  the  department  which  that  office  has  completed.  This
important study will assist us  in  shifting  the  focus  to  prevention  of
corruption  and  in  this  way  undermine  the  inherent  tendency   towards
corruption.

Our Disciplinary Code and Procedure has been exploited by  corrupt  members,
and I am  currently  studying  a  proposed  revised  Disciplinary  Code  and
Procedure that would, hopefully, contribute to dealing with  the  menace  of
corruption.

I would like to acknowledge, in conclusion, the presence of the  Chairperson
of  the  National  Council  for  Correctional  Services,  Judge  Desai;  the
Inspecting Judge, Judge Fagan; the Chairperson of the  Select  Committee  on
Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,  Kgoshi  Mokoena  and  invite  them,
together with all hon members in this House, to join  us  in  ensuring  that
the department lives up to its mission  of  placing  rehabilitation  at  the
centre of all our activities.

I would  also  like  to  invite  members  to  hold  us  accountable  to  our
commitment to a cleansed, trained and dedicated  management;  sound  working
relationships  between  managers  and  personnel  in  order  to  deliver  on
rehabilitation; seeking improved working conditions  for  our  members;  the
delivery of our core services and enhanced corruption prevention capacity.

The planned HIV/Aids Prevalence and Attitude Survey is a  key  priority  for
us. Currently, we are not accredited to  dispense  anti-retroviral  therapy,
and patients who qualify for  such  treatment  are  referred  to  accredited
sites of the Department of Health.

With regard to our development programme, we will concentrate  resources  on
literacy, education, skills development, recreation and  sport  as  part  of
the rehabilitation process. The priority areas in relation to  security  are
to ensure that the escape trend moves downwards,  and  that  the  safety  of
offenders is improved, in particular through an  anti-rape  strategy  within
our facilities.

We accept that Correctional Services is in need  of  a  major  shake-up  and
want to report that it  has  begun.  The  prisoners  at  Barberton  told  me
yesterday that there was one warder who treats  them  like  dirt  and  makes
them want to break out of their cells, who actually told them the other  day
that they can break out whilst they are busy toyi-toying. They told me  that
they do not want that warder there. I gave  the  order  that  he  should  be
fired immediately. He cannot take the case  to  the  labour  courts.  Mr  De
Lange, you know the jargon. I am not a lawyer. I am  a  politician.  I  will
fire the man. Let him go through the processes. He can  litigate  until  the
cows come home, but he will be out of  my  department.  Please,  members  of
this House, the lawyers are there to ``mop up'' after us. It is their  duty.
We sent them to school to do that. We are not in the business  of  ``mopping
up''. That is what they are there for. Are you standing by me, Mr De Lange?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Yes!

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you.

Please, do join us as we venture on a journey that should  change  the  face
of correctional services in this country. I went  there  and  saw  what  was
going on. I reported to my President last night because the members  of  the
public in Barberton and Nelspruit were scared of what was going on there.  I
said to the President, please do me one favour, chief, just back me  because
I'm going to fire them. I have a list of their names and I am  just  waiting
for the final report. I am going to fire them, end of story.  We  will  talk
about litigation later. For now, I must get them out of my system. They  are
not supposed to be there if they cannot do the simplest, simplest things.

We expect hurdles along the way,  even  major  ones.  We  expect  disruptive
elements to continue testing  the  limits  of  our  patience.  Yes,  we  can
possibly even predict that we will be confronted with  more  Nelspruits  and
Barbertons. This might cause a slight slowing down of the journey along  the
way, but no diversions will be taken. We will have to engage all  gears.  If
we have to put this truck into reverse, we will engage the reserve gear;  if
we have to jump from first gear to fifth gear, we will do so. All I want  is
to get that truck moving and the ``bad apples'' falling out of it.
I again invite all stakeholders,  including  the  ``progressive  unions''  -
which I support - to help us in eliminating the ``bad  apples''  within  the
department. I will closely work with them in dealing with all issues.  There
is a departmental bargaining council. I will ensure  that  our  members  get
the remuneration they  deserve.  I  will  not  tolerate  the  disruption  of
services within my prisons, not at all. I am asking members to assist me  in
that regard. I want to assure the people of  Nelspruit  and  Barberton  that
after I came out of there last night at 21:30, I felt  that  everything  was
under control. I would like to get a big applause from this  House  for  our
reaction units that came from all over the country to help  us.  [Applause.]
They are wonderful. They restored stability, and everything is  now  running
smoothly in those prisons.

Hon members, thank you very much for listening to us, and I  hope  that  you
will assist us in  the  journey  that  lies  ahead.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  DEFENCE:  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson.  Hon
Minister, hon Deputy Minister and hon members, may I  start  by  apologising
on behalf of the Minister of Defence who left yesterday for Addis  Ababa  to
attend  the  African  Union  defence  Ministers'  meeting  where  the   non-
aggression  and  common  defence  pacts  are  going  to  be  discussed   and
finalised. The Minister has been part of these discussions on  these  topics
in the structures of both SADC and the AU. His presence  was  highly  needed
and he had to attend this meeting. I hope the apology is accepted.

In celebrating 10 years of democracy, we are also celebrating  10  years  of
the creation of the SA National Defence Force.  These  10  years  have  seen
seven  different  military  formations  integrated  into  the  SANDF.  South
Africa's  military  doctrine  changed  from  an  offensive  to  a  defensive
posture, and defence policies were  shaped  through  a  widely  consultative
process.

When Parliament resolved in 1994 that the SANDF should be called into  being
and simultaneously set out defence policies  in  the  White  Paper  and  the
Defence Review, it would have been difficult for  us  to  foresee  the  very
intense and broad involvement of the  SANDF  in  the  stabilisation  of  our
subcontinent and continent. Most debates  at  that  time,  even  around  the
strategic defence packages, were about why we  needed  to  equip  the  SANDF
when there were no enemies about to attack us.

Very few people could have predicted the vital role the SANDF would play  in
peace-support operations in  the  continent  of  Africa,  and  in  providing
support in securing free and fair elections in our country. With  hindsight,
we are now in a position to know that our nation was wise to have taken  the
decisions it did. The SANDF has been the pivotal instrument of stability  in
Africa south of the  Sahara.  The  peacekeeping  mission  in  Burundi  is  a
shining example.

A defence force engaged in protecting the  country's  territorial  integrity
and its citizens, and a defence  force  that  is  involved  in  peacekeeping
missions  -  not  in  the  destabilisation  of  its  neighbours  -  operates
differently from a defence force at war with its own people and  neighbours.
Its actions are premised  on  assisting  key  role-players  move  out  of  a
conflict situation, as the case has  been  in  Burundi  and  the  Democratic
Republic of Congo.

The African mission in Amib, Burundi, has become a  United  Nations  mission
whose  mandate  it  is  to  support  Burundi's   efforts   to   re-establish
sustainable peace. This is due to the pioneering  role  of  the  SANDF,  and
later collaboration with Mozambique and Ethiopia, thus  creating  conditions
for the UN to take over. As we know, there  are  currently  difficulties  in
the DRC. However, our troops are there as part of the UN force to  help  the
DRC move out of a conflict situation. That is  the  defence  force  that  we
have built today - a force for peace and sustainable development.

However, the world has changed  since  1994,  and  whilst  we  still  cannot
identify any serious threats to our territorial sovereignty, we  still  face
the demons of poverty and hunger. These remain the biggest  threats  to  our
security and stability as a nation. The political  imperatives  that  guided
us in 1994 have altered. Our strategies, training and  modus  operandi  must
be adjusted and fine-tuned to align ourselves with our role on  the  African
continent.

In 1994 we resolved that our posture  would  be  a  defensive  one,  and  we
started the transformation of the defence function in  that  direction.  Ten
years down the line the White Paper on Defence and the Defence  Review  will
now be reviewed. To date, these two fundamental documents  have  guided  the
transformation of the defence function. The foundation on  which  they  were
based remains  sound,  but  there  are  certain  aspects  that  need  to  be
revisited and adjusted.

We aim to complete the review of the White  Paper  on  Defence  and  Defence
Review by the end of this year. This is a crucial exercise that  will  drive
and set in motion the last phase of  transformation  of  the  Department  of
Defence. At the core of the transformation of the defence  function  is  the
Defence Secretariat. Located within the department, it  is  responsible  for
the formulation of all aspects of defence policy, the proper accounting  for
defence expenditure and providing a crucial resource  for  the  Minister  to
enable him or her to give political leadership to the defence function.

As the Deputy Minister of Defence,  I  will  drive  the  completion  of  the
transformation exercise within the  Department  of  Defence.  Transformation
within the Department of Defence is about overhauling the entire  structure,
systems and procedures of the department. It is about the revitalisation  of
the SANDF and all other similar and related aspects. My main focus  will  be
to ensure that the department achieves representivity;  develops  a  reserve
force; looks after a proper migration process  of  the  service  corps;  and
transform the veterans' institutions into  viable  vehicles  for  supporting
and achieving the goals of the Department of Defence.

The quality of the  Department  of  Defence  personnel  is  central  to  the
operational qualities of the SANDF. Human resources 2010 is a  comprehensive
strategy  that  provides  direction  to  the  department's  human   resource
process. It provides the baseline for human resource planning, policies  and
instructions. It also constitutes  a  part  of  the  department's  corporate
strategy.

The issue of transformation of the reserve force  that  is  central  to  the
concept of a small core force has been on our agenda for too long. Whilst  I
am proud to announce that our first reserve force detachment has  been  made
available for deployment, much work still needs to be done to build  up  the
reserve force as a whole. Training programmes for the reserve force must  be
put in place to ensure that it becomes a viable force. There  is  a  lot  of
work to be done in this area.

A decision was taken some time ago to move the  service  corps  out  of  the
Department of Defence on the basis that it must  serve  the  national  good,
and not only the members of the SANDF. It may  well  be  housed  in  another
Government  department  but,  hopefully,  not  Correctional  Services.   The
Department will retain a small directorate to  help  with  the  redeployment
and to assist members leaving the department to acquire much-needed  skills.
This work will include helping them to  enter  other  existing  institutions
for training in different fields.

Linked to, but distinct  from  the  above,  is  the  issue  of  veterans.  A
veterans' directorate was set up in the Defence Secretariat some years  ago.
Legislation has been enacted in this regard. But, the numerous  concerns  of
our veterans are not being adequately addressed. One of the  major  problems
is that we do not have an adequate profile of our veterans,  whether  it  be
in terms of  age,  educational  qualifications,  skills  base,  geographical
locations, access to housing and health facilities, or even  the  number  of
dependants.

Moreover, veterans' issues are handled across the Department of Defence.  As
a result, work is fragmented. Pensions are handled in  one  section  of  the
Department of Defence, war graves in another,  and  liaison  with  veterans'
associations in yet another. The reality  is  that  many  of  our  veterans,
especially those from the previously non-statutory  forces,  are  living  in
squatter camps without proper medical care.

We have succeeded  in  pulling  together  the  various  different  veterans'
associations into one body. We must now see to  it  that  the  basic  social
needs of all veterans  are  met.  It  would  be  wrong  to  allow  a  social
situation to be perpetuated where there is no parity between  veterans  from
the statutory and the nonstatutory forces. At present,  we  are  looking  at
ways of beefing  up  the  veterans'  directorate  to  address  this  crucial
problem.

We will be paying special attention to these areas in order to  ensure  that
the goal of the DOD, being broadly  representative  of  all  South  Africa's
citizens at all levels and in all occupational  classes  and  mustering,  is
achieved. The other issue to which we will  be  paying  close  attention  is
that of training. Human Resources 2010 states that:


  The DOD has not yet attained  the  position  where  personnel's  learning
  pathways are  structured  and  developed  in  tandem  with  their  career
  pathways. This results in inefficiency and contributes to low morale.

To correct this requires a close examination of our  training  institutions,
as well as the content of our training programmes. Our training policy  must
be  aligned  and  adjusted  to  meet  the  growing   requirements   of   our
peacekeeping role. These requirements must  be  drawn  from  our  collective
experiences in the field and we will be looking at  ways  of  upgrading  our
training in this regard.  Peacekeeping  training  is  quite  different  from
training for conventional war. Both have to be carried out.

The transformation of the military justice system is at  present  under  the
microscope. A Ministerial  task  team  has  been  set  up  to  evaluate  the
workings of this system with a view to effecting improvements. In line  with
the Cabinet lekgotla decision, the Foreign Military Assistance Act needs  to
be reviewed in order to tighten up legislation relating  to  involvement  in
dubious foreign military activities. The area  of  defence  procurement  has
been the subject of much debate in recent times. The department has  adopted
all the recommendations  of  the  joint  investigation  into  the  strategic
defence packages, but we are taking other  measures  in  addition  to  those
recommended by the Auditor-General, the Public Protector  and  the  National
Prosecuting Authority.

Firstly, we will complete the transformation of Armscor during this  period.
Its primary role and responsibility as a procurement agency must be  vividly
distinct from  Denel,  the  manufacturing  arm  of  the  state  sector.  Any
blurring of the functions between these two  entities  will  be  eliminated.
The Minister  had  preliminary  discussions  with  the  Minister  of  Public
Enterprises under whom Denel falls. They are in agreement  that  there  must
be close co-ordination between our two departments.

We  will  also  review  Armscor's  internal  administrative  and   operative
activities to see how they match up to the process started  by  the  Cameron
Commission. It is important that the whole Armscor  family  conducts  itself
to standards of which this country can be proud. We do not subscribe to  the
perception that the arms industry is one that  is  shady  and  riddled  with
corrupt practices. Democratic South Africa  has  constantly  endeavoured  to
carry out  its  defence  business  transparently  and  we  will  be  at  the
forefront of the fight to  maintain  clean  practices  in  relation  to  the
defence industry at home and abroad.

The White Paper on Defence Related Industries, which outlines policy,  needs
now to be reviewed. One of the challenges will be  to  successfully  involve
and ensure the participation of all the role-players  in  the  industry  and
civil society, including faith-based organisations. This will  result  in  a
comprehensive rather than a fragmented approach. We must  guarantee  ongoing
work in research and development without  which  we  will  not  be  able  to
maintain our leading position in this sphere. Our approach must be  informed
by the need to increase our greater collaboration among the nations  of  the
South.

Our  role  in  peacekeeping  has  itself  been  a  learning   process.   The
recommendations made by Brahimi on behalf of the United Nations  still  have
to be implemented and tested against our experience.  It  is  important  now
for us to widen our vision of what peacekeeping actually involves.  This  we
can do on the basis of our experiences in Lesotho,  DRC,  Burundi,  Ethiopia
and Eritrea. Without wanting to detract  from  academic  analysis,  our  own
experiences in Burundi and the DRC, and in a limited  way  in  Ethiopia  and
Eritrea, emphasise that we have to be much more sensitive to a  case-by-case
analysis  of  each  situation.  The  tactics  of  peacekeeping   and   peace
enforcement have to be developed on the  ground.  We  have  now  the  actual
accumulated experience from which we can draw  up  our  recommendations  and
proposals.  Training  for  peacekeeping  can  now  be  based  on  our  lived
experience. What is more, we are now in  the  fortunate  position  of  being
part of an international network whose purpose is to share  experiences  and
exchange ideas. This interaction between officers  and  troops  from  within
the continent and beyond is part of our adjustment to and  participation  in
the global environment.

One of the lessons we have learnt in Burundi is that it  is  not  sufficient
to bring combatants into a cantonment area  to  disarm  and  register  them.
Beyond that they have to see  a  future  for  themselves  wherein  they  can
maintain their families and be part of the development and  construction  of
a peaceful society. They have to have somewhere to go and  something  to  do
after  they  lay  down  their  arms.  We  refer  to  this   as   sustainable
peacekeeping.  Sustainable  peacekeeping  must  be  driven   by   the   host
government, who must take the lead within a conglomerate of local  NGOs  and
international development organisations.  The  dynamic  interaction  between
the political and the military processes is therefore ongoing.

By  adopting  an  approach  which  emphasises  the  creation  of  conditions
conducive to the signing of peace agreements, we have shown that  conditions
for peace can be created. In certain conditions  there  is  a  process  that
must precede  the  implementation  of  Chapter  6  of  the  United  Nations'
Charter.  Furthermore,  the  genocide  experience  in  Rwanda  and   present
developments in the DRC further underline the  need  to  review  the  United
Nations system in peace support operations.  Surely  the  concept  of  human
security would seem to dictate that the United Nations peace support  forces
must be so mandated as to be able to intervene in  the  face  of  threat  or
danger to civilian life in their presence. To  mandate  neutrality  in  such
circumstances will make humankind an accomplice in  human  tragedy,  similar
to the Rwandan genocide, by omission or neglect of duty.
In the aftermath of the Rwandan  genocide  and  the  lessons  of  hindsight,
humankind must rise to the responsibilities of our time.  Through  political
partnership within our own region, on our continent and  even  beyond,  with
developing countries of the  South,  we  must  develop  a  common  view  and
approach in order to meet the requirements  and  provide  the  resources  to
manage conflict. The creation of the African  Union  and  its  substructures
places a heavy burden of  responsibility  on  the  security  organs  of  our
country, not least the Department of Defence, which is playing an  important
role in the design and architecture of the Africa Standby Force.

The African  Union  Common  Defence  and  Security  Policy  is  key  to  the
successful functioning of the Peace and  Security  Council  of  the  African
Union. This will be formulated through  a  consultative  process  among  the
defence formations  on  the  continent.  It  must  relate  to  the  specific
conditions we face, because the causes for conflict  on  our  continent  are
complex. In many  cases  they  are  structural  and  stem  from  social  and
economic deprivation. They also include  agents  and  interests  originating
outside our continent.

From August this year, South Africa  will  be  chairing  the  South  African
Development Community, SADC, organ on Peace and Security. We hope  to  bring
together the defence collective of our region to establish sound  structures
from which we can operate. Our collective  experiences  must  be  pooled  to
further stabilise our region and  protect  it  from  internal  conflict  and
ensuing  disarray.  We  will  continue  our  efforts  of  assisting  in  the
reconstruction and demining of Angola,  in  postconflict  processes  in  the
Sudan and our involvement in other  similar  initiatives.  I  also  wish  to
report to you that the United Nations  mission  in  the  DRC  has  requested
South Africa to avail more troops for maintaining peace in the DRC. That  is
the level of confidence shown in our  forces.  We  are  confident  that  the
Department of Defence will rise to this challenge. I thank you. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Ministers  and  members,  distinguished   guests,
comrades and friends, please  allow  me  on  this  occasion  to  express  my
delight and honour in taking part in this Budget Vote debate,  my  first  in
the NCOP as a Deputy Minister. I  also  want  to  use  this  opportunity  to
apologise for the absence of our Minister, Ms Brigitte  Mabandla,  who  only
arrived back in the country this morning.

Let me start with  big  congratulations  to  hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena  on  being
reappointed as the  chairperson  of  our  select  committee.  We  are  truly
blessed to have a person of his stature and calibre to chair our  committee.
I want to state unequivocally that we look forward to working  very  closely
with him and his committee in achieving all the goals that this House  would
want  to,  particularly  in  terms  of  the  Department   of   Justice   and
Constitutional Development. We want to recommit  ourselves  -  I  do  so  on
behalf of my director-general who is here, Adv Vusi Pikoli -  that  we  will
do everything we can to capacitate this House to fulfil  all  its  functions
in relation to our department.

I also want to say a special congratulations to all  other  persons  in  the
House  who  have  been  appointed  to  leadership  positions,   particularly
yourself, Chairperson, and the Deputy Chair and, again,  we  wish  you  well
and we will do everything we can to assist you in your  task  in  performing
your functions here.

This Budget  Vote  takes  place  against  the  background  of  10  years  of
transformation of the justice system  in  a  democratic  South  Africa.  Ten
years ago we took the first tentative steps on our journey to a  transformed
justice system for all, by merging 11 different justice  departments,  which
included those from the former Bantustans,  into  one  national  department.
Those first small and tentative steps in the  journey  were  significant  in
charting a path towards a fair, impartial, effective and accessible  justice
system geared towards the needs  of  all  South  Africans,  irrespective  of
their backgrounds.

Let me remind all of us present here today that the Government's role is  to
serve the needs and aspirations of  all  our  people  to  the  best  of  its
ability and, in doing so, to use  the  resources  entrusted  to  us  by  the
people in the wisest and most responsible  way  possible.  It  is  therefore
imperative for us to take measures that would have a positive effect on  the
lives of our people and the country.

Increasing capacity among the department's personnel  in  order  to  improve
service delivery excellence in line  with  the  principles  of  Batho  Pele;
extending access to justice to all, including to those in  the  poorest  and
most remote areas; re-engineering  the  maintenance  system  and  optimising
other measures meant to alleviate the plight of the poor,  the  marginalised
and the disadvantaged amongst  us;  reducing  case  backlogs  and  improving
court  efficiency;  and  transforming  all  our  institutions,  systems  and
procedures administering justice are all  part  and  parcel  of  this  basic
principle which we have embraced.

Key to the Government's Programme of Action, as outlined in the  President's
state of the nation address, is also the duty  to  improve  the  safety  and
security of all our citizens and communities. For my department,  this  duty
is deeply rooted in the provision of improved access to quality,  swift  and
visible justice through the transformation of our institutions  and  systems
administering justice. We remain committed to these principles.

In my address I  will  therefore  give  feedback  on  some  of  the  notable
achievements of the department in the past years  and  some  initiatives  in
the present, which are of a crosscutting nature and which have a  provincial
flavor. I do so particularly in the context of not trying to  repeat  things
that we have said in the National Assembly.

I want to deal, firstly, with the Re Aga Boswa Project.  Because  our  court
system is the core business  of  the  department  and  the  first  point  of
contact with the public, massive resources and effort have accordingly  gone
into transforming our court systems and processes.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure
that our courts are operating properly and therefore  enable  the  judiciary
and the prosecution to perform their duties optimally.

Maybe I should digress here for just a minute. You know, one often finds  in
the newspapers that something happens somewhere and we then have to  read  -
and we have read recently  again  -  that  somehow  the  justice  system  is
falling apart. I want to assure this House - and I think this  is  something
we should remind ourselves  of  -  that  every  single  day  of  our  lives,
thousands of officials of  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development go to work and make these courts and structures work.

Ninety-five percent of those structures work effectively every  single  day,
of course, admittedly, to varying degrees, but  the  people  are  there  and
they work. A mere problem in one of these structures at any given time  does
not mean that the Department of Justice and Constitutional  Development,  or
anything else, is collapsing. This is something, I think, we  should  remind
ourselves of.

Through the Re Aga Boswa project, processes at the Court Services' Unit  and
at court level are being  re-engineered  to  streamline  organisational  and
management  structures.  The  Re  Aga  Boswa  project  is  premised   on   a
decentralised court service delivery model, which ensures the devolution  of
decision-making  powers  to  competent  and  capable  court   managers   for
effectiveness and efficiency in the court system. The benefit impact of  the
decentralised model is a reduction in the turnaround time in  administrative
decisions, thereby leading to reduced case backlogs and  case  cycle  times,
disciplined staff and the optimal utilisation and management of resources.

The preliminary results  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal  pilot  project  are  indeed
encouraging, and  once  the  model's  best  practices  have  been  analysed,
assessed and refined, we will be rolling  it  out  to  other  parts  of  the
country. Critical resources  currently  located  at  regional  offices  will
therefore be redeployed to the  courts  directly.  The  KwaZulu-Natal  model
will also assist in determining the cost implication of the roll-out of  the
model to other provinces.

Secondly, I want to deal with the establishment of  the  Integrated  Justice
System Co-ordinating Committees. The department is an active participant  in
the justice, crime prevention and security Cabinet cluster, as well  as  the
social Cabinet cluster. This is in recognition of the fact that  to  have  a
positive effect on the lives of all our people, we  need  to  integrate  all
the services of the various departments within the criminal justice  system.
All our department's activities are therefore in line  with  the  priorities
of these clusters.

The JCPS development committee recently carried out a national survey  among
related stakeholders to validate the  establishment  and  to  structure  and
define  the  terms  of  reference   of   interdepartmental   committees   at
provincial, area and local levels. These committees are intended to  promote
co-operation and  co-ordination  between  the  cluster  departments  and  to
facilitate and support the implementation  of  initiatives  to  improve  the
effectiveness and efficiency of the integrated justice system.

The survey brought to light that, although  numerous  and  divergent  forums
currently exist between these departments  and  related  stakeholders,  some
are operating effectively, others less so. Comprehensive terms of  reference
for the establishment of IJS Co-ordinating Committees at the various  levels
have therefore been developed. Work sessions with provinces to  discuss  the
establishment of such committees are now in  the  planning  phase  and  will
commence in the latter part of the  year.  In  the  meantime,  existing  co-
operation structures are being utilised to deal with  both  operational  and
strategic crosscutting issues.

My third focus is  on  the  rationalisation  of  the  High  Courts.  We  are
progressing towards getting rid  of  a  fragmented  court  system  and  have
established, as policy, that no new courts  should  be  established  outside
the existing court structure.

After a long consultation process with the relevant stakeholders,  including
the judiciary, with regard to the rationalisation of the  High  Courts,  the
Superior Courts Bill and  the  Constitutional  Amendment  Bill  were  tabled
before the Portfolio Committee on Justice. As you  would  know,  the  names,
the seats and the jurisdictions of the High Courts are still  reflective  of
the apartheid state and the Bantustans.

The Superior Courts Bill is intended  to  rectify  these  discrepancies  and
legacies we inherited by rationalising the former  Supreme  Court  of  South
Africa and the High Courts of the former TBVC states.  It  also  deals  with
the integration of the labour court and labour appeal court  into  the  High
Court system. This rationalisation will bring the court  structure  in  line
with our post-1994 dispensation. The department has already included in  its
major capital works projects for next year a High Court  building  for  both
the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. Hopefully the Bill will be  passed  by
Parliament this year still.

The fourth area I will deal with is the  redemarcation  of  regional  courts
and magisterial districts. Discussions with regional  court  presidents  and
with intersectoral representatives on the matter  of  the  redemarcation  of
district court jurisdictions  have  also  been  concluded.  Following  this,
regional court jurisdictions have been aligned  with  provincial  boundaries
and, as per the proclamations, have been implemented.

However, two districts in the Eastern Cape, namely Umzimkulu and  Matatiele,
also called Maluti, were included in the area of jurisdiction of  the  newly
created regional division of KwaZulu-Natal. This was  being  done  to  align
the regional court  jurisdictions  with  that  of  the  Interim  High  Court
jurisdictions. However, I am aware that this has created  some  problems  in
that area, at least in some groupings, and we are  re-evaluating  the  issue
and speaking to the affected persons. However, this whole issue may have  to
be reassessed during the process of the Superior Courts Bill's adoption.

An  extensive  consultation  process  involving  all  stakeholders  on   the
redemarcation of magisterial district boundaries has been carried out  at  a
provincial  and  area  level.  Access  to  courts  by  all  sectors  of  the
population, existing court infrastructure and  the  need  to  provide  cost-
effective court services were the guiding principles in this  process.  Nine
provincial reports have been finalised, and the digital maps  depicting  all
new  boundaries  and  recommended  changes  are  in  an  advanced  stage  of
completion.

The recommended changes to magisterial boundaries, if  compatible  with  the
Superior Courts Bill, will be  implemented  in  a  phased  manner  as  funds
become available. At the moment the process is largely part of our  unfunded
mandate. Where a change in a main seat of  court  has  been  recommended,  a
thorough assessment of available facilities will be carried out  before  any
changes are made. An amount of R36  million  has  been  requested  from  the
National Treasury for the implementation of this redemarcation  process  for
the current financial year. Further amounts of R40 million and  R44  million
have been asked for the subsequent two years to finalise this year's work.

The fifth area I wish to deal with refers to lay assessors, an  issue  which
features in the media at present, and we would like  to  say  the  following
about it: As part  of  the  department's  strategic  imperative  to  improve
access to justice and increase  public  participation  in  the  adjudication
process, the lay assessor system will be extended to all regional  divisions
during the next three years. In line with section 180 of  the  Constitution,
the lay assessor system places a strong emphasis on community  participation
in the workings of the court system.

I see that some imminent  experts  and  scholars  have  reckoned  that  this
system is unconstitutional. I would remind them  that  they  should  go  and
read section 180 again, and see that we particularly placed  that  issue  in
the Constitution to avoid  this  kind  of  argument.  In  1995  already,  an
assessors' co-ordination committee was appointed to oversee  pilot  projects
to  increase  the  use  of  lay  assessors  in  criminal  matters   in   the
magistrates'  courts.  As  a  result  of  these  projects,   the   committee
recommended a suitable legislative framework  in  order  to  facilitate  the
expansion of the lay assessor  system.  You  will  recall  that  this  House
passed that legislation in 1998 already.  However,  because  of  a  lack  of
funds, the system's implementation process has been slow to  date,  also  in
terms of pilot project.

For the full implementation of the project to  take  place,  structures  for
the  governance  and  co-ordination  of  lay  assessors  will  need  to   be
established. Other challenges facing this initiative  relate  to  the  funds
required to  compensate  the  assessors,  the  office  space  that  will  be
required at court buildings; the identification of  assessors  who  fit  the
requirements and the possible delays  in  the  finalisation  of  cases  when
assessors do not attend court  sessions  that  the  implementation  of  this
assessor system may lead to.

The project manager visited all the pilot sites  in  the  Western  Cape  and
Gauteng during 2003 in order to assess first hand what  the  challenges  are
and to plan for further rollout. Regulations relating to the Act  have  been
developed and approved by National Treasury. The concerns  of  stakeholders,
such as Amsa, the NPA and the Law Society, will be taken  into  account  and
into consideration before implementation. However, I want to emphasise,  the
rollout of the project will not be stopped!

Sixthly, I deal with the Legal Aid Board. The issue of  the  high  costs  of
private legal services is of concern to Government in general, and to us  as
a department in particular. The cost of litigation means that the  rich  can
freely litigate while the poor, especially  in  civil  cases,  cannot  enjoy
this right. The Legal  Aid  Board  therefore  plays  an  important  role  in
providing  legal  aid  to  indigent  persons  and  legal  representation  as
provided  by  the  Constitution,  especially  to  accused   persons   facing
substantial prejudice.

The Legal Aid Board is consolidating the significant progress  already  made
in transforming itself into a  stable,  efficient,  effective  and  credible
organisation by providing legal services throughout the  country.  This  has
been largely achieved through the establishment of the 58  justice  centres,
27 satellite offices and 13 High Court units.

The Legal Aid Board has also deliberately shifted from the  Judicare  method
of delivery of legal aid services to using public  defenders.  The  Judicare
method  has  proven  to  be  unacceptably  expensive   and   cumbersome   to
administer, and this is, in fact, a phenomenon  worldwide.  If  you  go  and
study Canada or the USA at the moment,  you  will  see  that  they  are  all
moving from the Judicare system to a system  where  they  use  the  kind  of
services we do  now.  The  Board  has  therefore  continued  to  reduce  its
reliance on  Judicare,  which  is  now  only  18%  of  the  budget,  and  is
increasingly using the services from its justice centres, which now make  up
56% of its budget.

A major part of the criticism that was levelled against the Legal Aid  Board
in the past was the quality of the services provided. However, having  moved
to the justice centre model, the Legal Aid Board is now able to monitor  the
performance of its legal practitioners, and is therefore  able  to  identify
and respond to the gaps in service delivery. The Legal Aid  Board  has  also
initiated a host of training  programmes  to  keep  capacitating  its  staff
component.

However, we will have to continue to monitor the system to ensure  that  the
quality of legal services delivered is consistently high. In  addition,  the
department and the Legal Aid Board will also have  to  look  at  alternative
forms of legal assistance to the poor in place of costly  litigation  -  for
example, alternative dispute resolution services may be one of  the  answers
to this problem.

The Legal Aid Board has really drastically improved its services and we  owe
the former chairperson, Judge Navsa, and the continuing  good  work  of  the
present chairperson, Judge Mlambo, the CEO and the  board  appreciation  for
this.

The seventh area I want to address is the issue of the Child  Justice  Bill.
We are committed to strengthening the protection of  vulnerable  persons  in
the criminal justice system. As you are aware, the  Child  Justice  Bill  is
being finalised by the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  at  present.  The
Department has planned and costed intersectorally for the implementation  of
the Bill. Work in this regard is continuing  and  a  holistic  intersectoral
document is being finalised. To drive the process, monthly meetings  of  the
Intersectoral Child Justice Steering Committee, chaired  by  my  department,
are held.

In the meantime, interim guidelines for children awaiting  trial  have  been
implemented to divert them as much as possible for the  mainstream  criminal
justice system. This is in part intersectoral monitoring  and  interventions
to unblock bottlenecks in areas such as KwaZulu-Natal.

A  protocol  has  also  been  drafted  and  implemented  regarding  children
awaiting placement in  reform  schools.  We  have  further  facilitated  the
establishment of three one-stop child  justice  centres  and  mapped  out  a
process for the establishment of one in each province  for  the  next  three
years after the Child Justice Bill has been passed.

We believe that the  approach  of  planning  and  budgeting  for  the  Child
Justice Bill  may  serve  as  a  model  for  every  intersectoral  piece  of
legislation that comes before Cabinet and Parliament in  future.  There  are
still problems with it, but at least it is a model  that  tries  to  address
the implementation problems before we put the Bill into  operation,  and  to
that extent it does create a model.

Finally, let me deal with multipurpose centres. As already  stated,  we  are
committed to strengthening the protection  of  vulnerable  groups,  such  as
women  and  children,  in  the  criminal  justice  system.  The  department,
together with other departments, is involved in integrating  and  increasing
the coverage of governmental services. In addition  to  our  efforts  around
the child justice one-stop centres, we have established the Thuthuzela  Care
Centres for victims of sexual offences.

The multipurpose centres  involve  the  four  core  departments  within  the
criminal justice system: Safety and  Security,  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, Correctional Services and Social Development, and we have  also
at times included Health. The multipurpose centres  are  aimed  at  bringing
services rendered by these departments to communities where  these  services
either do not exist, or do exist but are not easily  accessible,  especially
in rural areas, in an integrated way and under one roof. These  centres  are
currently available in: Thembalethu in George,  Nsimbini  in  KwaZulu-Natal,
Leboeng in Limpopo; Khutsong in Gauteng; Tshidilamolomo in  North  West  and
Centane in the Eastern Cape. Other centres receiving attention  are  Thabong
in Welkom and Augrabies in Kakamas.

In conclusion, we believe that as we integrate more of our service  delivery
between major role-players in the criminal justice system, we will  be  able
to leave a larger justice footprint, which will touch more of our people  in
a positive way.

Let me finally just thank everyone working in the department  for  the  good
work done over the  past  years.  I  particularly  recognise  the  director-
general, Advocate Vusi Pikoli, senior managers in  the  department,  leaders
of the judiciary, in particular our Chief Justice,  Arthur  Chaskalson,  and
our Deputy Chief Justice, Justice Pius Langa, and all the Judges  President,
the magistracy, the National Prosecuting Authority and all the  institutions
linked to the department.

Finally, I just want to say to all  the  other  departments,  since  filling
this position, it is clear to me that there is a  great  wish  to  integrate
our services, but we still have some way to go, and  hopefully  we  will  be
able to speed that up in the coming  year.  Thank  you  also  for  all  your
assistance  and  hard  work.  Thank  you  for  listening  very  attentively.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, before I  proceed  to  call  the
next speaker, I want to take this opportunity to recognise the  presence  in
our mist on the public gallery of Kwevho Community School from Limpopo.  You
are recognised and welcomed to these law-making  Chambers  of  our  country,
which is the National Council of Provinces. This is where the laws that  are
regulating the lives and the relations in our society in  this  country  are
made. So, you are welcome. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you,  Chairperson.  I  apologise  for  my  bedroom
voice. I have the the flu.

There shall be equal status in the bodies of the state, in  the  courts  and
in the schools, for all national groups and races.  All  people  shall  have
equal rights to use their own  languages  and  to  develop  their  own  folk
culture and custom. All national groups shall be protected  by  law  against
insults to their race and national pride. All apartheid laws  and  practices
shall be set aside. All laws which discriminate  on  the  grounds  of  race,
colour or belief shall be repealed.

This was said by the People's Congress in Kliptown on 26  June  1955.  There
was a time in this country when  the  term  human  rights  did  not  have  a
meaning. Just imagine what it was  like  to  be  regarded  as  a  statusless
person in your own country. You had to negotiate and justify your status  as
a South African. We thank our new democratic Government  for  restoring  the
dignity of all South Africans. The greatest thing in this world  is  not  so
much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.
Let us now look at our justice system. I want to focus my attention  on  our
court services. There is this outcry by members of society in regard to  the
court case backlog. In any situation, as you all know, there are always  two
sides to a story. Yes, I agree with those who say the backlog of cases  have
to be brought under control. More than once I witnessed,  in  one  court  in
Gauteng, more than eight cases being remanded within 20  minutes.  This  can
be blamed on the lack of capacity  of  our  investigators  and  prosecutors.
However,  during  the  budget  briefing,  the  committee  was  assured  that
something is being done to improve  the  situation.  I  can  only  urge  the
department to try and expedite this process.

On the other hand, the overcrowding and backlog of cases show that  many  of
our people now have  confidence  in  our  justice  system.  People  are  now
reporting cases in large numbers. Our people now do not care much about  who
presides over their cases. Of course there are still  some  magistrates  who
give alarming verdicts, but I know that the department will deal  with  that
issue.

One other challenge is the security in our courts. Something  must  be  done
about this. Some ugly incidents are tarnishing the image of  our  courts.  I
was comforted to learn that some  funds  have  been  set  aside  to  improve
security measures in our courts. I will be glad if the hon Minister can  say
something about this.

There is one issue, I think, which needs special attention. It  is  that  of
private security companies. Our security or intelligence structures  operate
under stringent conditions of law and oversight, but that is  not  the  case
with private security companies. I wonder why they are not  regulated.  They
have the capacity to access Government information. Can  something  be  done
to curb this anomaly?

The Jali  Commission  was  initiated  by  this  Department  of  Correctional
Services. The department took this route  because  they  wanted  to  expose,
expunge and  flush  out  these  unwanted  and  rotten  elements  within  the
department. This has to be said because there are some  political  piccanins
or political opportunists  or  political  imbeciles  who  believe  that  the
department woke up one day and found the Jali Commission on their  doorstep,
as if this was forced down their throats unwillingly. This is  the  baby  of
this Government and of this department. Well done, hon Ministers.

I would like to thank Commissioner Mthi  and  his  staff  for  briefing  the
committee about some of the  activities  of  this  commission.  Thanks  very
much, Mr Commissioner. The only appeal I want to make, hon Minister, is  for
this commission to please round off.  How  long  are  they  still  going  to
continue? In my opinion, I think they have now overstayed their welcome.  My
philosophy is that the second track must do what the  first  one  failed  to
do.

My belief is that rehabilitation can only be effective if it is  done  in  a
conducive environment.  That  can  only  happen  if  the  department  starts
upgrading its current facilities and begin  to  use  internal  resources  to
fulfil this function to ensure that there is  acquisition  of  skills  while
serving  sentences  and  that  the  skills  acquisition  is  in  line   with
employment opportunities outside prison. It is  true  that  God  will  never
give you a challenge that you cannot handle, but rehabilitation cannot be  a
responsibility of the department alone. As leaders and communities,  let  us
play our role as well. By the way, we  are  talking  of  our  own  sons  and
daughters, sisters and brothers, and fathers and mothers. Let  us  play  our
role as leaders, as well.

At a glance, I am trying  to  see  if  there  are  any  officials  from  the
Department of Safety and Security. I hope that wherever they are,  they  are
following this discussion through their  monitors.  They  will  be  able  to
respond this afternoon. If not, it  would  be  a  pity.  The  Department  of
Safety and Security is faced with the challenge of  dealing  with  organised
crime, to combat serious and violent crimes, to reduce incidents  of  crimes
against women and children and the improvement of basic service delivery  at
police stations, especially through the expansion of sector policing.

Our men and women in blue are expected to handle all these cases.  For  them
to do this effectively, they need our  support.  Many  of  them  have  given
their lives to make sure that you and I are safe, but how  many  of  us  are
making sure that these men and women in  blue,  our  police  officers,  feel
that we appreciate what they are doing? This brings me to an issue I  raised
three years ago, and that was to improve the  working  conditions  of  these
police officers and for them to be paid a decent  salary.  This  will  go  a
long way to avoid the temptations of  so-called  moonlighting.  I  know  the
department will do something about this. I have not rented a  crowd,  but  I
think that I am doing something here.

In the same debate, three years ago, I requested the  department  to  review
the criteria used in promoting these police officers. There  are  those  who
have remained in the same rank for the past six years. That  is  the  reason
some of them are joining the Metro Police. May I, on their  behalf,  request
that this matter be  looked  into  seriously?  I  know  my  magnificent  and
dynamic department and Ministry will respond positively.

We appreciate what our police  officers  are  doing  in  the  Eastern  Cape,
tracking down illegal circumcision schools. This is done to save lives,  but
my problem is the way in which these arrests are dramatised. There are  some
elements who are going all out to try and ridicule our culture and  customs.
No true African would smile and celebrate  when  their  noble  tradition  or
culture is undermined or ridiculed. No one is immune  to  problems.  As  you
are aware, even a lion has to fight off fleas. What is happening,  could  be
described as adjusting one's underwear in public.

Let us thank our SANDF for doing us proud on  the  continent,  that  is,  in
Burundi, Rwanda, the DRC, etc - as was said by the Deputy Minister. What  we
have discovered is that our force is more acceptable than all  other  troops
deployed by their countries in the  same  areas.  This  is  so  because  our
troops know what human rights violations  are  all  about.  They  know  that
there are no human rights if it is not based  on  risk  analysis,  an  early
warning system, peacekeeping, peace making, a peace process and prevention.

Hon Minister, the briefing by all departments has helped  us  to  understand
what our troops are going through. Your officials were prepared  and  ready.
We thank them for that. To my  committee  members,  I  want  to  thank  your
provinces for deploying you to this committee. I could not  have  asked  for
more. It is in the culture of this committee to work as a unit or a  family,
regardless of our political backgrounds. Once again, the assembled  team  is
like a well-oiled machine. Thanks  to  you,  hon  Ministers,  for  your  co-
operation, even from your officials. If there  are  some  misunderstandings,
we are able to handle them as leaders and as adults.

In life, as in soccer, you will not go far unless you know  where  the  goal
posts are. It therefore makes sense for us to support this Budget  Votes.  I
have spoken. [Applause.]

Mr J W  LE  ROUX:  Deputy  Chair,  Deputy  Ministers  and  colleagues,  when
Commissioner Mti addressed our committee,  he  said  that  our  correctional
services are the best in Africa, but that we want to  be  the  best  in  the
world. The DA pledges its full support to achieve this goal.

Die DA bepleit `n stelsel van konstruktiewe gevangenisstraf  waar  die  klem
op vaardigheidsontwikkeling, opleiding en die  opheffing  van  die  individu
val. Die dag wanneer 'n gevangene vrygelaat word,  moet  hy  'n  beter  mens
wees as wat hy was met toelating, én moet hy toegerus wees om 'n  nuwe  lewe
te kan begin.

Duisende gevangenes kan  in  die  boubedryf  baie  suksesvol  gebruik  word.
Gedurende die opleidingsproses kan waardevolle infrastruktuur  geskep  word,
en na vrylating is  daar  geweldige  potensiaal  vir  indiensneming  en  vir
entrepreneurskap.

Daar bestaan geen grondige rede hoekom  gevangenes  nie  ook  aangewend  kan
word om ons geweldige behuisingstekort te help  verlig  nie.  Dieselfde  kan
ook op landbougebied gebeur. Daar is tans gevangenisse  wat  baie  suksesvol
is met die verbouing van groente, vrugte en vleis. Hierdie aktiwiteite  moet
net drasties  uitgebrei  word.  Na  vrylating  kan  dié  persone  ook  groot
suksesse op  landbougebied  behaal.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The DA advocates a system of  constructive  imprisonment  which  emphasises
skills development, training and the upliftment of the  individual.  When  a
prisoner is  released,  he  must  be  a  better  person  than  he  was  upon
admission, and he must be equipped to be able to start a new life.

Thousands of prisoners  can  be  used  very  successfully  in  the  building
industry.  During  the  training  process  valuable  infrastructure  can  be
created, and after release there is tremendous potential for employment,  as
well as free enterprise.

There is no valid reason why prisoners  cannot  also  be  utilised  to  help
relieve  our  tremendous  lack  of  housing.  The  same  also   applies   to
agriculture. There are at present prisons which  are  very  successful  with
regard to the cultivation of vegetables, fruit and  meat.  These  activities
must just be drastically extended. After being  released  these  people  can
also achieve great success in the field of agriculture.]

Unfortunately, overcrowding and a  lack  of  facilities  make  it  virtually
impossible for us to achieve these noble ideals. It is true that we must  do
everything possible to lower our intake of  prisoners,  and  our  philosophy
tries to do just that. The fact is, however,  that  we  urgently  need  more
prisons now. Unfortunately, our budget allocation only allows  us  to  build
four prisons in the near future. The level of overcrowding is about  60%  to
70% and the projections are that this figure will stay the same up to 2007.

If we cannot solve the problem of overcrowding,  all  our  plans  to  become
world leaders will not succeed. The fact that our prisons are  crowded  with
awaiting-trial detainees, and  not  prisoners,  as  the  Minister  said,  is
unacceptable. It is unfair that  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services
must carry the responsibility that is clearly a structural  problem  in  the
legal system. It would help Correctional  Services  if  Deputy  Minister  De
Lange could add this problem to his agenda. It is  clear  that  we  do  need
better facilities for our head office, but will it not send a very  positive
message if we rather delay the construction of new  offices  and  use  these
considerable funds to create more space for prisoners?

Lastly, the question of gangs must receive more urgent  attention.  If  some
members of our staff are involved  in  gang-related  activities,  surely  we
must get rid of the bad eggs in our midst. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  hon  MECs,
special delegates and  hon  members  of  the  House,  foremost,  I  want  to
congratulate the hon Ministers and Deputy Ministers  on  their  appointments
and reappointments. I wish them a fruitful and successful term of office.

In putting a comprehensive and effective criminal justice system  in  place,
there will be some major problems that the Government will have  to  address
- and did address, over the past 10  years.  Many  steps  have  indeed  been
taken and must still be taken. You must  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  the
electorate judges our work, not on the basis of what we have been  doing  or
are doing, but by results. The key performance  indicators  will  always  be
the following: Is  crime  being  brought  under  control?  Is  the  criminal
justice system dealing effectively with crime? Is an efficient deterrent  to
crime being put in place? Are  our  citizens  and  others  enjoying  greater
safety and security?

We acknowledge that Government and communities are  deeply  concerned  about
the culture of violence. Because that culture of violence must be  reversed,
heavy emphasis must be placed on the implementation of the criminal  justice
system. We need those additional police officers and  correctional  services
officers who should be well-trained, and  the  additional  vehicles  on  the
ground where they can all make a difference.

We need, and we believe there are, committed  officers.  In  the  same  way,
they must be rewarded for hard work.  We  need  consequences  for  continued
failure. We need a  united  national  campaign  to  show  zero-tolerance  to
criminals. We need to  fight  crime  together,  as  a  nation.  The  New  NP
supports these Budget Votes. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S SHICEKA: Thank you very much, Chairperson, Deputy Ministers, the  Chair
of the Council and hon members. My  focus  today  is  on  a  clause  of  the
Freedom Charter that was adopted in 1955. The clause on which I will  focus,
says that all shall be equal before the law. However,  before  I  engage  in
that - because I believe that this Charter lives - we have to look at  where
we are coming from and how far we have gone as a Government.

There  were  many  factors  that  militated  against  the   efficiency   and
effectiveness  of  our  courts  before  1994.  They  include  the  lack   of
credibility, the lack of integrity and the lack of legitimacy. The  mandates
of the court were vague, ambiguous and largely directed  at  supporting  and
ensuring an illegitimate system of government. They often functioned  in  an
uncoordinated manner. They were not subjected to any effective and  credible
oversight and control mechanisms.  They  were  characterised  by  an  uneven
distribution of resources between traditionally black and white areas.

Transformation,   therefore,   brought   legitimacy,   accountability,   and
effectiveness. Substituting the supremacy of Parliament  with  that  of  the
Constitution was a fundamental arena in the process of transformation.  This
shift has repositioned  and  redefined  the  independence  of  the  judicial
system in our  country.  The  judicial  service  commission  and  magistrate
commission that were partly reconstituted  yesterday  as  we  appointed  the
members designate, have made important progress  regarding  the  appointment
of the judicial system in our country, particularly  the  representivity  of
the system to  ensure  that  it  truly  reflects  the  demographics  of  our
country.

The rationalisation of the magistrate courts across the length  and  breadth
of our country is commended by the  committee.  With  the  establishment  of
high courts in all provinces, the people of Mpumalanga will no  longer  have
to go to Gauteng for  their  high  court  cases.  The  high  court  will  be
established in their  own  area.  The  rationalisation  of  the  magisterial
boundaries must be concomitant and be in  line  with  our  local  government
boundaries, as must all structures in our country.
The committee supports the clarion call of the department.  This  calls  for
efficiency, accessibility, swift and effective service. We believe that  the
department has its heart in the right place. We also  want  to  say  to  the
department it must make sure that it  strengthens  the  correlation  between
prosecutors and investigators, because many cases are lost.  You  find  that
these cases are lost simply because the magistrates and  judges  claim  that
there is insufficient evidence. That insufficient evidence is  caused  by  a
lack of cooperation between the two institutions.

We also note with appreciation that the disappearance of  case  dockets  has
been reduced. We also support the view that  the  Minister  is  implementing
integrated case flow management in all areas, as well as the appointment  of
registrars who are going to ensure that cases  are  managed  properly,  that
the case files do not  disappear  or  do  not  get  stolen  by  thieves  and
criminals who pay our officials to do the job for them.
We also support the view that is expressed by the department  that  it  will
be taking the courts to the people by establishing courts in  various  areas
in our townships and in our rural areas. We also support  the  view  of  the
department that says every one  million  people  will  have  access  to  the
courts by 2007. We hope the Deputy Minister will be able to meet his  target
because we are going to hold him to it, to ensure  that  oversight  work  is
being done. He has made that promise. It is documented and he has  to  stick
to it.

We also support the view that he is  going  to  establish  minimum  security
measures in our courts by 2007, as has been  raised  by  our  chair,  Kgoshi
Mokoena. This is an area of importance, and one  of  concern.  The  National
Crime Prevention Strategy which we developed in 1996, pushed to ensure  that
special courts are established, particularly the sexual offences courts  and
the equality courts. As we speak, we have  218  equality  courts.  It  means
that if you are disgruntled, unhappy or aggrieved about discrimination,  you
can go to court now, and they are able to ensure that you get a  redress  in
that respect.

Also, maintenance investigators are in place. There are about 72  now.  Both
these investigators and prosecutors will be increased to 100 in  71  courts.
It tells men who are irresponsible,  who  father  children  and  then  leave
them, that they are going to be in trouble. Therefore, ensure that you  take
responsibility in this respect. If we do that, we  will  be  able  to  spare
some resources because people will not have to be paid  through  the  system
of social grants to children.

The conviction rate has increased in our country. In 1999 it was 78% and  it
has gone up to 81% by 2000, but we believe that more still has  to  be  done
in this respect. We must make sure that once you are arrested, you  will  be
convicted. An average case preparation cycle has decreased from 110 days  to
71 days. We commend this achievement, but we believe  that  there  is  still
more room for improvement. You must do more. The court managers who will  be
appointed  in  our  courts  to  ensure   that   our   courts   are   managed
professionally, are also  appreciated  by  the  committee.  We  believe  the
decentralisation  that  you  have  implemented  is  a  step  in  the   right
direction. However, we believe that you must ensure that these managers  are
supported. You do not have to have magistrates being turned  into  managers,
but should have managers who are trained  in  management  and  who  must  do
their work. There are still overall challenges which I want to outline as  I
move on. One of the major challenges that are still there  is  the  increase
of the number of women judges, particularly black women. [Time expired.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Sihlalo, noNgqongqoshe namaSekela  abo,  sithi  unwele  olude.
[Chairperson, Ministers and their Deputies, we say: Long live!]

There is a need for greater synergy among  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, the Department of Correctional Services and  the
Department of Safety and Security, as well as  the  Department  of  Defence.
These departments need to establish closer co-operation in  order  to  focus
on dealing effectively with the grave issue of crime in South Africa.

These four departments are the very machinery that holds  the  potential  to
effectively rid our communities  of  crime.  They  should  not  function  in
isolation, but in partnership with each other. They  need  to  forge  closer
relations and bear in mind that in order for the  cycle  of  justice  to  be
complete, they all need to perform consistently and  diligently.  This  will
also do away with the backlogs that are hindering the  process  of  justice.
The reward of diligent work will be a crime-free South Africa.

Touching  on  justice,  the  Department  of   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, on the other hand, does not seem to be managing the process  of
court cases speedily. The postponement of cases  creates  intense  backlogs,
leaving the state burdened for months with  the  maintenance  of  prisoners,
some of whom are eventually found innocent after lengthy waiting periods  in
prison. This is unacceptable.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development needs to find  ways
of dealing with cases speedily. One of the contributing factors to  backlogs
in court cases is that courts are inaccessible. The township of  Zonkizizwe,
for example, does not have a court. The people are expected to  travel  long
distances to reach the Heidelberg  court.  You  also  find  the  same  thing
regarding the Germiston regional magistrate's court. This leads  to  further
backlogs  in  court  processes.  This  court  services  Alberton,   Thokoza,
Katlehong and other neighbouring areas. This regional court has a record  of
approximately 400 postponed cases, while the court can only  dispose  of  40
cases in a month. In this regard, we request that the Minister revisit  this
matter and consider taking the court back to Alberton where it was.

The backlogs in the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
owing to the postponement of cases,  has  led  to  overcrowding  in  prisons
which fall under Correctional Services. This  overcrowding  itself  is  very
unhygienic and leads to the spread of  infectious  diseases.  This  is  also
most unfortunate for child offenders who are  negatively  affected  by  long
waiting periods in prisons.

The Department of Defence also plays a crucial role in  terms  of  combating
crime. However, they need to be afforded the power to make arrests, as  well
as statements that would  effectively  oblige  them  to  testify  and  hence
contribute positively towards the  conviction  of  offenders.  Crime  levels
will definitely be reduced if the  Department  of  Defence  can  assist  the
Police  Service  to  combat  crime.  They  therefore  need  to  establish  a
partnership which the IFP believes can only bring about positive results  in
drastically reducing crime in South Africa.

With the very limited time that I have, may  I  also  touch  on  safety  and
security. While we support the budget, we would like to see  the  department
taking vigilant steps towards combating crime against  women  and  children.
Women and children are often vulnerable to violent  crime  and  abuse.  More
often than not, crimes committed against women and children do  not  receive
the  necessary  attention  they  deserve,  resulting  in   offenders   going
unpunished, setting them free to recommit their crimes.

The IFP condemns  this  cycle  and  calls  for  the  department  to  conduct
stringent investigations into crimes against women  and  children.  The  IFP
thus requests that funds be allocated to  training  officers  to  deal  with
such crimes in order for them to gain much-needed experience  to  deal  with
sensitive cases in a manner that is both dignified and humane  in  order  to
accommodate the victims. It is important for the  police  to  sharpen  their
investigative skills. [Time expired.]

Mr A L MOSEKI: Hon Chairperson of this  august  House,  hon  Ministers,  hon
colleagues and distinguished citizens of this country  in  the  gallery,  we
are gathered in this House this morning to  debate  the  budget  of  the  SA
National Defence Force.

The department whose  budget  we  are  debating  derives  its  mandate  from
Chapter 11, section  200  and  other  sections  of  the  Constitution.  This
department is mandated by the Constitution to structure and  manage  a  very
disciplined Defence Force. Another purpose of  that  section  is  to  ensure
that this well-structured and disciplined force defends  this  country.  The
Constitution further requires our Defence Force to defend  and  protect  the
Republic of South Africa and its citizens against forces  of  aggression  in
accordance with principles of international laws and regulations.

During the past 10 years, a process of building the National Defence  Force,
which could meet the above-outlined requirements,  began.  Forces  from  the
liberation movements, the  apartheid  regime  and  Bantustans  were  brought
together to establish a force that must serve the citizens of  this  country
and ensure that our democratic gains are defended continuously.

This Defence Force that we are talking about has played  an  important  role
since its establishment 10 years ago. The important role that it has  played
has removed the prejudices that were indoctrinated into the  former  defence
forces, especially those of the apartheid regime and the Bantustans. We  now
have a Defence Force that defends the citizens of this country  and  ensures
that in this country we all feel protected as citizens.

It is, however, important to point out that there are still some  challenges
that are faced by this department, and an example like what occurred at  the
Tempe Military Base cannot be left out in this instance. We  therefore  want
to urge the department  to  speed  up  the  process  of  ensuring  that  the
attitudes of those who still have prejudices are transformed.

I also want to say that despite the daunting challenges that the  department
has faced during in the past 10 years, the report given by  the  secretariat
to the select committee under the leadership of Kgoshi Mokoena gave  a  very
clear  indication  that  much  progress  has  been  made  with   regard   to
transforming this department. For that we want to commend the Minister,  the
Deputy Minister and the secretariat for a job well done.

Our defence needs to be combat-ready,  because  this  is  an  area  that  we
picked up at a meeting that we had. The defence needs to be combat-ready  in
order to continuously defend this country and democracy,  and  for  that  it
becomes important for us as citizens  and  public  representatives  of  this
country to ensure that funds are made available to replenish  the  equipment
and to ensure that  hi-tech weapon systems are established  in  our  Defence
Force. That is necessary for us in order to compete with what  is  happening
all over the world,  and  if  we  do  not  do  that,  we  will  become  very
vulnerable.

The people of this country expressed their  unconditional  support  for  the
people's movement on 14 April. They voted, they shouted and they  said  that
despite all the negative sentiments  that  are  expressed  by  some  of  the
public representatives in this House against transformation,  the  ANC  must
continue to lead our people and ensure that transformation does take  place.
It is for that reason that we, as members of this glorious movement  and  as
responsible public representatives, have been given this mandate.

We want to say to the department that we will give  them  our  unconditional
support. In our interaction with the department, when  the  department  sent
its strategic business plan to us, we became convinced that the  budget  and
strategic business plan meet all the requirements in order to  be  supported
by this House.

We therefore unconditionally support what  the  Chairperson  of  the  select
committee said when he presented his input, namely that  this  House  should
unconditionally agree  to  the  Vote  as  presented  to  us  by  the  Deputy
Minister. [Applause.]

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Mnr die Voorsitter,  ek  wil  graag  `n  verwante  aspek
aanraak,  'n  saak  wat  nie  slegs  Verdediging,   Justisie,   Grondwetlike
Ontwikkeling  en  Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit  raak   nie,   maar   wat   ook
Intelligensie  en  Buitelandse  Sake,  trouens   ook   aspekte   van   ander
portefeuljes,  sonder  die  minste  twyfel  raak.  Ek  glo   dat   van   die
sleutelportefeuljes vandag in hierdie debat verteenwoordig is,  en  derhalwe
wil ek dit graag hier opper.

Die Regering moet ongetwyfeld bewus wees  van  die  werwing  van  soldate  -
rekrute - manlik, sowel as vroulik, vir die Al-Kaïda-, Hamas- en die  Fatah-
bewegings. Trouens, hierdie werwing word openlik  in  hierdie  land  gedoen,
onder meer in plekke van aanbidding. Gister op Channel 702,  die  sogenaamde
Cape Talk, in die bekende Tim Modise se program, Netwerk, was  daar  `n  gas
by  name  van  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Mr Chairperson, I would like to touch  upon  a  related
issue, a matter that  not  only  affects  Defence,  Justice,  Constitutional
Development and Safety and Security, but Intelligence  and  Foreign  Affairs
too, in fact, without any doubt aspects of other portfolios too.  I  believe
that some of the key portfolios are represented in this  debate  today,  and
therefore I would like to raise it here.

The Government must undoubtedly be aware of the recruitment  of  soldiers  -
recruits - male, as well as female,  for  the  Al  Qaeda,  Hamas  and  Fatah
movements. As a matter of fact, this recruitment is openly done at,  amongst
others, places of worship in this country. Yesterday, on  Channel  702,  the
so-called Cape Talk, on the show of  the  well-known  Tim  Modise,  Netwerk,
there was a guest called. [Interjections.]]

I beg your pardon?

An HON MEMBER: Chairperson, is the member prepared to answer a question?

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Chair, if you will allow me extra time at the end of  my
three minutes; I have only three minutes ...
The ACTING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: There  is  no  such  rule,  hon
member. Say whether you agree to answer the question or not.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Chair, in that case, I  am  not  prepared  to  answer  a
question.

The ACTING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Okay. Fine, you may proceed.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Thank you.

Voorsitter, gister op Channel 702, Cape Talk, het 'n sekere persoon by  name
van Iqbal Jassien openlik propaganda gemaak vir hierdie  bewegings.  In  die
beperkte tyd is daar net enkele vrae aan die onderskeie Ministeries, en  kan
hulle in hul reaksies daarop reageer.

In die eerste plek: Wat is die Regering se beleid -  die  amptelike  beleid-
met betrekking tot hierdie bewegings  -  die  Al-Kaïda-,  Hamas-  en  Fatah-
bewegings? Tweedens: Het die Regering enige  planne  om  sulke  persone  wat
gewerf word  te  verhoed  om  die  Republiek  van  Suid-Afrika  te  verlaat?
Derdens: Verlaat sulke rekrute Suid-Afrika,  indien  dit  nie  verhoed  word
nie, dan  wel  met  die  goedkeuring  en  die  medewete  van  die  Regering?
Vierdens: Indien sulke persone terugkeer na die Republiek  van  Suid-Afrika,
gaan hulle vervolg word en, indien wel, kragtens welke wette?  Indien  hulle
nie vervolg word nie, wat is die rede waarom hulle nie vervolg word nie?

Het ons hier te doen met `n kwessie van `n deurlopende hantering van die  70
persone in Zimbabwe wat op dieselfde grondslag  gehanteer  word  as  hierdie
persone wat die land verlaat? Die Ministers hoef nie oor mekaar  te  val  om
my te antwoord nie, en moet ook nie terugval op vae antwoorde soos die  feit
dat die hele aangeleentheid sub judice is nie, want dit is nie. My vrae  het
niks daarmee te doen nie. Hulle moet ook nie die vrae  probeer  ontwyk  deur
te sê dat dit nie vrae is wat in hierdie debat tuis  hoort  nie.  Dit  hoort
inderdaad in hierdie debat tuis.
Wat hier van wesenlike belang is, is regsekerheid -  die  hele  kwessie  van
die ``rule  of  law''.  Wat  hier  ter  sprake  is,  moet  geld.  Daar  moet
regsekerheid in hierdie land kom. Hierdie mense kom terug om die  land,  wat
reeds 'n geweldige groot mate van onrus ervaar as gevolg  van  geweld,  roof
en misdaad, te destabiliseer.  Ons  kan  nie  toelaat  dat  hierdie  persone
ongehinderd  gaan  en  terugkom  nie.  [Tyd  verstreke.]   (Translation   of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: Yesterday on Channel 702, Cape Talk,  a  person  called
Iqbal Jassien was openly promoting propaganda in favour of these  movements.
In the limited time there  are  just  a  few  questions  to  the  respective
Ministries and they can reply to them in their answers.

Firstly, what is the Government's policy - the  official  policy-  regarding
these movements - the Al Qaeda, Hamas and Fatah  movements?  Secondly,  does
the Government have any plans to prevent  such  persons  who  are  recruited
from leaving the country? Thirdly, do such recruits leave South  Africa,  if
it is not prevented, with the approval  and  knowledge  of  the  Government?
Fourthly, if such persons return to the Republic of South Africa, will  they
be prosecuted, and if so, under which laws?  If  they  are  not  prosecuted,
what are the reasons that they are not prosecuted?

Are we dealing here with a  question  of  continuous  treatment  of  the  70
persons in Zimbabwe who are treated on the same basis as  these  people  who
leave the country? The Ministers do not have to fall  over  one  another  to
answer me, and they should not resort to vague answers like  the  fact  that
the matter is sub judice, because it is not. My questions  have  nothing  to
do with that. They must also not try to evade the questions by  saying  that
such questions do not belong in this debate.  They  indeed  belong  in  this
debate.

What is of essential importance here is legal security - the whole issue  of
the rule of law. That which is relevant here, should  be  applied.  We  must
have legal certainty in this country. People return to  the  country,  which
is already experiencing a great measure of unrest due to  violence,  robbery
and crime, to destabilise it. We cannot allow these people to  come  and  go
unhindered. [Time expired.]]

Ms P M HOLLANDER: Hon Deputy Chairperson of Committees ...

Ms S J LOE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Can you take your  seat,  hon  member.
Yes?

Ms S J LOE: Mr Chair, I was wondering whether we are going according to  the
speakers' list as it appears in front of us. Are we, Sir?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Allow me  to  give  you  a  one-minute
induction. As  I  am  presiding  in  the  Chair  here,  I  do  not  have  to
communicate any changes with regard to the speakers list. I liaise with  the
Duty Whip who liaises with party whips in terms of  reordering  or  changing
the speakers' list. As far as I am concerned, I am on  the  right  track  in
terms of the proceedings of the day. Can you take your seat?  Can  you  take
the platform, hon Hollander? [Interjections.] What is the  point  of  order?
[Interjections.] Hon Ntwanambi, can you stop your dialogue? I just  want  to
hear on which point the hon member is rising.

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: I can understand if the speakers' list  has  been  changed.
That is fine. However, I do not think our party has been  communicated  with
in that regard. Can we just find out whether our member, who is due to  make
her maiden speech today, is in fact on the speaker's list  or  not.  We  now
have had two speakers subsequent to the time slot in which she  should  have
spoken. I think neither our party nor she actually knows whether she  is  on
the list at all. That is not what we have in front of us. Can you  at  least
tell us where she is on the list.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Are you referring to hon Loe?  She  is
going to speak after hon Hollander. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: I think you did well to  conduct  that  mini-
workshop, because members need to understand the proceedings of this House.

I can understand the vigour you have, hon member, since your  leader  is  in
the gallery, hence you would  like  to  be  seen.  You  should  respect  the
presiding officer and let us allow the proceedings to continue. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  hon  Chief  Whip.  Hon
Hollander may proceed.

Ms P M HOLLANDER: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy  Ministers,  hon  members  and
distinguished guests, on the question of Al Qaeda, I would like to tell  the
hon member Van Heerden that the intelligence has  reported  that  they  have
caught members of this organisation, and they have sent them back  to  their
countries. The review of the first decade of  freedom  will  be  an  ongoing
matter for debate and reflection throughout 2004.

The nature of our transition, which is about the fundamental  transformation
of all aspects of life and social endeavour,  means  that  this  debate  has
many components and potential approaches. In the spirit of  Batho  Pele,  we
say ... ``motho ke motho ka batho ba bangwe.'' [... no man is an island.]

The ANC is an agent of change  and  therefore  the  incarceration  programme
finances the detention of prisoners  in  safe  custody  until  they  can  be
lawfully released. The programme provides for the  healthcare  and  physical
needs of offenders in terms of norms and  standards  that  comply  with  the
Constitution.
The Department of Correctional Services strives to provide  adequate  prison
accommodation that complies with accepted standards. In prisons where  male,
female  and  juvenile  offenders  are  accommodated,  female  and   juvenile
offenders are housed in separate designated sections.

To deal with  overcrowding  in  prisons,  the  Departments  of  Correctional
Services and of Justice and Constitutional Development  have  initiated  the
following: transferring unsentenced juveniles  to  places  of  secure  care;
converting   certain   prison   sentences   to   correctional   supervision;
identifying, renovating and upgrading existing facilities; placing awaiting-
trial detainees under community correction; and piloting  integrated  action
by departments to review cases and reduce the average detention cycle  times
of awaiting-trial detainees. We would like  to  commend  the  Department  of
Correctional Services.

Apart from these initiatives, the department should address overcrowding  on
a continuous basis in conjunction with the other role-players  in  the  CJS.
One strategy is the use of Saturday  courts  to  address  the  backlog  with
regard to awaiting-trial detainees. The  implementation  of  the  electronic
court process will also go a long way towards streamlining court  processes,
although the department will continue to  release  offenders  serving  minor
offences after they have served a set minimum sentence.

In terms of the Constitution, a child is  a  person  under  the  age  of  18
years. The department regards a person between the ages of 14 and  25  as  a
youth. The department  is  responsible  for  the  detention,  treatment  and
development of sentenced juveniles. However, here I would like  to  ask  the
hon Deputy Minister for Justice, Mr De Lange,  that  before  they  pass  the
Child  Justice  Bill,  to  have  sectoral  discussions  take  place  between
departments, because the Youth Commission says that a person is regarded  as
a youth up to the age of 35.

Section 7(2) [c]  of  the  Correctional  Services  Act,  Act  111  of  1998,
stipulates that children must be kept separate from adult offenders  and  in
accommodation appropriate to their age, as young offenders  are  predisposed
to negative influence. The aim  of  this  separation  is  the  provision  of
distinctive custodial, development and  treatment  programmes,  as  well  as
religious care, in an environment conducive to  the  care,  development  and
motivation of youths to participate and to develop their potential.

There are mother and child units in  eight  female  prisons  nationally.  By
June 2003 there were 208 infants under the age of five in prison with  their
mothers. The policy on such infants  clearly  stipulates  that  mothers  and
children  are  kept  in  a  separate  unit  within  the  prison,  where  the
surroundings and facilities are complementary to the sound physical,  social
and mental care and development of children. However, we would also like  to
ask the department if there are facilities for crèches  for  these  children
at these prison facilities.

The policy also stipulates that the admission of an infant with a mother  is
permitted if no other suitable accommodation and care are available at  that
stage, and that it should be regarded  as  a  temporary  measure  only.  The
right of the mother to have her child with her during admission  promotes  a
positive relationship between mother and child. Policy emphasises  that  the
mother should be taught good childcare practices  for  her  own  self-esteem
and self-confidence and for the benefit of the  child.  We  do  commend  the
Department of Correctional Services.

With regard to reintegration into the  community,  the  department  aims  to
equip offenders with the skills required for  effective  reintegration  into
society after release.  Offenders  sentenced  to  longer  than  six  months'
imprisonment undergo a basic pre-release programme before  release.  Aspects
receiving attention include  how  to  secure  employment,  personal  finance
management and street law.

Specialists from the community are also involved in the presentation of  the
programme. Care and support for an offender are prerequisites for  placement
in the community. Before  offenders  are  placed,  they  are  assisted  with
obtaining employment and  accommodation,  or  at  least  care  and  support.
Community  involvement  in   supporting   offenders   after   placement   is
encouraged. We therefore ask that the department  makes  more  contact  with
their communities.

The  administration  programme  funds  the   overall   management   of   the
department. It includes policy formulation by  the  Minister,  the  national
commissioner, and  other  members  of  senior  management,  and  facilitates
prison inspections by the inspecting judge.  The  budget  of  the  programme
accounted for about 32% of the budget of  the  department  in  2003-04,  and
remains at approximately this level throughout the medium term.

Employees of the Department of Correctional Services  are  not  entitled  to
strike and conditions of  employment  have  to  be  negotiated  with  labour
unions in a bargaining council. [Interjections.] The major unions active  in
the department are the Police and Prisons Civil  Rights  Union,  the  Public
Servants' Association  and  the  Democratic  Nursing  Association  of  South
Africa. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, I thank you; enkosi; ke a  leboga,
Aluta Continua!

Ms S J LOE: Thank you, Mr Chairperson, and may I say that it is  a  pleasure
and a privilege for me to address this House for the first time, as well  as
the hon Deputy Ministers and the public gallery,  including  the  Leader  of
the Official Opposition whom I was not expecting.

The NCOP undoubtedly presents challenges and complexities  that  are  unique
to the members of this Chamber, as opposed to the National Assembly and  the
provincial legislatures. It is our task to closely guard  the  interests  of
the provinces from a national perspective. In  this  regard,  no  portfolios
present a bigger challenge than those in the security and  justice  cluster.
While the  power  in  these  departments  remains  at  national  level,  the
provinces will continue to battle with the huge problems  that  beset  them,
and we in the NCOP will be just as powerless to assist.

Indeed, in respect of policing, our MECs have no political power at all  and
are  rendered  almost  useless  in  their  roles,  as  are  the   respective
legislatures in their oversight capacities over the SA Police Service.

As a national police service every police official reports to  the  national
commissioner in Pretoria. The civilian departments of  safety  and  security
at provincial level have some say in the  appointment  of  their  provincial
commissioners in the SAPS, but these provincial commissioners are  appointed
by, and report to the national commissioner. So there is no point in  having
any say at all.

The budget of the service is derived  entirely  from  the  national  budget.
Political accountability for SAPS rests largely with the  national  Minister
for Safety and Security. Now, I have experienced first-hand the  frustration
in the legislatures in this regard. In the second term Gauteng  had  as  its
MEC a very energetic and sharp-minded person  whose  talents,  in  my  view,
were almost entirely wasted. She was, in the words of an opposition  member,
nothing more than an expensive public relations officer,  which  some  might
deem unnecessary harsh criticism, but it was close enough to  the  truth  to
find its target.

Over the years, the lack of  political  power  has  plagued  the  provincial
departments, the MECs,  and  the  legislatures.  Gauteng's  Premier  Shilowa
recently said in an address in the Gauteng  legislature  that  policing  was
not his  provincial  government's  responsibility.  So  with  all  the  best
intentions in the world, MECs do not have the right to  do  much  more  than
monitor and evaluate the police, oversee  the  formation  and  functions  of
community police forums, and implement  the  dubiously  successful  National
Crime Prevention Strategy.

MECs were not consulted on the controversial Resolution 7  which  redeployed
the police and regraded police stations, causing uncertainty  in  the  ranks
and lowering already damaged morale. To this end Government's insistence  on
racial quotas and demographic correctness has resulted  in  police  vehicles
being used to ferry police officials for long  distances  between  home  and
work at every shift  change,  reducing  the  already  inadequate  number  of
reactionary vehicles available to the public. In  a  country  where  violent
crime is rampant, this is simply not good enough.

In any event, provincial governments are  far  better  placed  than  central
Government to formulate crime  prevention  policies  and  practices  and  to
equip  police  according  to  their  needs  and  according  to  local  crime
imperatives.

The DA applauded Government for introducing  Metro  Police  to  the  largest
centres in South Africa, precisely because this  decentralises  the  control
of policing and allows local government to address crime  on  the  basis  of
where and how it happens. However, this excludes huge areas of South  Africa
and, of course, whole provinces that do not have Metro areas.

I say again that the very role of this House is to look after the  interests
of the provinces. We need to decentralise the  SAPS  and  devolve  political
power in order to properly address  crime  in  the  provinces.  Simply  put,
provinces must be empowered to deal with crime.

The debate must begin on how we flatten the organisational hierarchy of  the
SAPS  and  give  substantial  policing  powers  to  the  provinces  and   to
provincial commissioners. Further, we must begin to focus on  station  level
where each station commissioner must be in a position to manage his  or  her
people. Like any other manager in the private sector,  they  must  have  the
power to hire, fire, promote,  train  and  reward  their  officers,  and  to
decide how to allocate their budgets and other resources.

More importantly, each station commissioner should be required to publish  a
pledge to the  communities  they  serve  on  the  levels  of  services  that
community can expect. I am convinced that these measures  would  go  a  long
way to protecting our people  from  crime.  I  thank  you,  Mr  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member,  I  hope  that  the  quietness  and
orderliness that have accompanied your  speech,  will  be  reciprocated  and
observed by all members of this House. I think  this  is  a  very  important
comment that I must make. Without any waste of time, I then proceed to  call
the hon Deputy Minister of Correctional Services, hon Gillwald.

THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES:  Hon  Chairperson,  colleagues
and Committee Chairperson, the hon Kgosi Mokoena, firstly, I would  like  to
congratulate you on the structure of this  debate.  I  think  it  is  really
important that the cluster approach be emphasised as in the  cluster  debate
and, after a couple of initial comments, I will deal with those issues  that
I feel speak  to  our  intercluster  relationship,  its  successes  and  its
failures and as those pertain to the Budget.

I would just like to make a few comments about the hon Loe's input  and  say
that there is  a  fundamental  misunderstanding  of  the  whole  process  of
intergovernmental relations and how we promote these. You have  every  right
to push a federal agenda. We do not hold  the  same  views.  I  worked  very
closely with the MEC for Safety and Security  in  Gauteng  particularly  and
found her to be a very effective official  who  tried  to  make  the  system
effective at the provincial level. So I would just like to say that I  think
the understanding of intergovernmental co-operation in the  different  tiers
is a little shortsighted.

I think that there are a couple of fundamental issues that we need  to  look
at. The basic statistics that tell us the story about  prisons  is  that  we
have 186 000 inmates in our correctional facilities,  while  we  have  space
for 113 000. This is an overcrowding of between 53 000 and 58 000  people  -
it goes  up  and  down.  This  is  probably  one  of  those  areas  that  is
symptomatic of the clusters not working well together. This is where we  are
not achieving the kind of results that we had hoped  for,  and  this  is  an
important issue that we need to deal with as a cluster. For us, we need  you
all to see the cluster as a continuum. It  starts  at  investigations,  goes
through to prosecutions, sentence and, ultimately, incarceration.

We are the receiving receptacle for the activities and  decisions  that  are
made on the supply side of our equation, which is in police and in  justice.
To a large extent it is difficult for us, but not impossible -  and  I  will
address that later - to  address  the  issue  of  inflows.  However,  unless
justice and police take it as seriously as we do and work together,  we  are
not going to find a  permanent  solution.  That  is  one  of  the  issues  I
discussed closely with the Deputy Minister for  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development.
We feel that  where  our  departments  interface  to  produce  a  collective
result, those interfaces need to be regulated by protocols that  define  the
roles that  determine  the  outcomes  and  define  accountability,  so  that
performance can be assessed and is regulated. We do  need  those  protocols,
because in the  projects  that  we  have,  collective  efforts  between  our
departments have reduced year on year the awaiting  trial  detainees  by  10
000 since last year. It is not good enough! Very  often  those  efforts  are
either personality driven or they are funded, and  when  the  funding  dries
up, they stop. We need to understand that this must be  an  ongoing  process
and, more than the problem itself, it  illustrates  to  us  that  integrated
government is not just something  Ministers  do  at  their  interministerial
committee meetings.

If it is to be successful, it must happen all the way down and  particularly
at the face of service delivery. Where you find that projects work  as  they
pertain to corrections, you will find that the head of prison is meeting  in
a justice forum with the local prosecutor, with the  senior  magistrate  and
with all the roleplayers in the cluster to make the system work.

However, he is not required to. There  is  no  protocol  that  says,  ``Thou
shalt do this ... and this is what is expected of you ...  and this is  what
happens if you fail ... '' So, again it is personality driven. We  have  the
various parts of the machinery. We have to reassemble them  in  a  way  that
they work and we have to provide the oil that makes it work  efficiently.  I
think this is very important. Our awaiting trial detainees  are  symptomatic
and may be a case study for us of how integrated governance  fails  and  has
the potential to work. I think those are the important issues that  we  must
talk about.

For instance, there are already  mechanisms  in  place  to  reduce  awaiting
trial populations and they are not being used. For  instance,  diversion  is
not readily used - one of the problems being that we  are  wholly  dependent
on  the  provincial  social   development   departments   to   provide   the
infrastructure. They are not keeping  up  infrastructure  expansion  at  the
rate of the supply side.

Who are to take in the children, for  instance?  Places  of  safety,  secure
places for child offenders are not being provided  at  the  rates  they  are
required. I refer here to the hon Loe's notion that we  need  to  co-operate
more closely. She has a federal model;  we  have  something  else  in  mind.
However, what I am saying is that we need to liaise at  a  provincial  level
and make our case with provinces as they make the decisions.

The important thing, though, is also to let people know what will happen  if
they do not do this. We run a severe risk, and this is where I am  going  to
alert you to one of the most telling statistics.  I  was  in  the  Kroonstad
Prison yesterday. Sixty two per cent of our prison population  is  under  35
years old. These are young people.

The average sentence is about nine years and two days. If a 16-,  17-,  18-,
19-, or 20-year-old  therefore  goes  into  our  correctional  facility  and
receives an average  sentence  of  nine  years  -  which  is  very  high  by
international standards, I might add - but if they  do,  they  will  realise
into society, we will release them onto society at  the  age  of  30,  fully
expectant to be reintegrated because they served their dues to  society.  If
we have not rehabilitated and impacted on those children and young  people's
capacity to interact progressively and proactively  with  society,  we  will
have  failed  the  communities  we  are  undertaking  to  protect,   because
essentially, if we do not impact on these people  with  our  rehabilitation,
we will just be recycling more and more violent or  criminal  elements  into
our society. We cannot do this.

Perhaps the biggest tragedy of  overcrowding  is  that  it  impacts  on  our
operational budget, our ability. It is  terribly  expensive  to  house  that
number of people. We are not saying we are  unwilling  to  hold  people  who
present a clear risk to society, but too many  people  are  sitting  in  our
prisons who are not a risk to our society. This is  what  I  am  saying:  we
need to reduce that population so that we have more  operational  budget  to
spend on the  inmates  who  spend  long  terms,  or  even  short  terms,  to
rehabilitate them, skill them and give them the capacity to  deal  with  the
society as  normal,  active  and  engaged  individuals.  This  is  extremely
important.

So, what is not happening? Diversion  is  not  practised.  Take  alternative
sentencing. Magistrates  often  do  not  consider  community  service.  Why?
Because it takes a little more effort. We must encourage our magistrates  to
do this. Very often for petty crime, where the offender represents no  clear
and danger risk, bail is given or a fine is given that is  unaffordable,  so
you have people who go back to prison because they cannot afford  R100  bail
or a R100 fine. They sit in prison,  either  awaiting  trial  or  serving  a
sentence, because they cannot afford R100.

And what do we do? We teach them how to  become  criminals  in  the  current
environment. We must keep these people out. If you do  the  sums,  it  costs
about R100 a day to keep a person in prison. Just do the numbers.  If  there
is R100 bail, it is better to come to us at correctional services  and  say,
``Provide the R100 bail and let them go,'' because they  are  sitting  there
for no reason at all. It is certainly cheaper for  us,  and  we  keep  those
people out of prison.

I now come to prosecutors.  I  know  that  there  have  been  programmes  to
introduce plea-bargaining and it is being more widely used, but not  enough.
It is really important. However, we have  come  up  with  some  really  good
innovations and that, of course, is the trick in any developing society.  If
you have resources that are under severe pressure because of the needs of  a
society, the only ingredient that really  makes  that  money  worthwhile  is
applying innovation, applying new ways of doing things and imagination.

Perhaps the most recent manifestation of this is our long-awaited  community
courts. In justice I militated very strongly for these, and I am so glad  to
see that in the Cape area three will be introduced there. There  is  already
one in Pretoria, and these courts will  deal  with  petty  crime  and  anti-
social behaviour,  and  will  use  alternatives  to  imprisonment,  such  as
diversion and community service.

Just listen to the range of partnerships, and this is the  issue.   We  need
to synergise our various skills,  and  the  partners  are,  of  course,  the
Departments of  Justice,  Social  Development,  Correctional  Services,  the
South African Police Service and the  National  Prosecuting  Authority,  the
Legal Aid Board, the Provincial Department of Social  Services,  Nicro,  the
City of Cape Town in this case, and the universities and  the  law  centres.
So you can see all these bodies have brought their skills  together,  put  a
little bit of innovation with their resources and  we  are  coming  up  with
something that provides a real and measurable solution. I  want  to  applaud
that effort.

With the police I am calling for something that  I  hope  my  colleague  the
Deputy Minister is listening to. We released around 16 500 people per  month
who have been the victims of earlier arrests. They  are  arrested,  no  case
can be developed and on a three monthly cycle they are  eliminated.  If  you
have a justice of normal standing and you have a job and you  are  arrested,
and you are in prison for three months, you could well have  lost  your  job
by the time you get out. It is incredibly disruptive.

We used to have a system that I think we should consider,  although  not  in
cases where the perpetrator presents a potential  risk.  Here  there  is  no
question  that  we  need  to  detain  people  under  certain  circumstances.
However, we had a  thing  called  case  readiness  certification.  A  senior
official in the police department would go through the files  and  determine
which ones are ready to go to the prosecutor to present. This happened  when
we had all the evidence to make an arrest.

At the moment there is a habit to arrest and investigate as time allows.  We
have 16 500 people per month being released from our prisons  because  there
is no case or evidence against them. We need a corporative process with  the
Minister, and maybe case readiness certification is an  answer,  maybe  not,
but I know  that  we  will  come  up  with  solutions  that  really  make  a
difference.

In terms of the budget there are a couple of issues that I  need  to  raise.
We are engaged with Treasury to ensure the  alignment  of  our  Draft  White
Paper and the budget allocation. If this  exercise  is  based  merely  on  a
review of current expenditure patterns, delivery by the  Department  on  its
mandate will be  severely  hampered.  What  is  required  is  a  fundamental
revision of the real cost drivers and of the current base  line  allocation.
The realignment exercise must be conducted  as  a  matter  of  urgency.  The
wider the gap between expenditure patterns and policy provisions,  the  more
difficult it becomes to achieve that policy stated  aims.  This  realignment
exercise must be conducted as matter of urgency.

With reference to our expenditure on personnel there are several risk  areas
that need to be noted. The success of our corrections care  and  development
programme is  highly  dependent  on  a  range  of  professional  and  middle
management skills that are unique to this kind of  work.  Our  vision  of  a
people-centred corrections work process is put at severe risk if we  do  not
acquire the necessary psychologists, medical  and  other  attendant  skills.
This is a people-driven business that requires a specific mix of skills.  To
ignore these requirements is to impact on our very core business.

In terms of  our  budget  allocation,  the  impact  of  HIV/Aids  cannot  be
ignored. Increased budgets for peer education  will  be  necessary,  not  to
mention  the  cost  of   expanded   antiretroviral   treatment   programmes.
Prevention  regimes  and   other   communicable   diseases   and   voluntary
counselling  and  testing  processes  are  also  required.  The   need   for
specialist nutritional and medical skills associated with the  treatment  of
HIV/Aids infections is acute and is also expected to  rise  sharply  in  the
short and medium term.

I am just a humble bookkeeper by training. Let us  just  do  the  sums.  Our
budget is just over R8 billion. Payments for overtime are R900  million.  It
is unsustainable. This is nearly 10% of our budget. There are ways in  which
to  solve  this  problem.  We  are  not  trying  to  exempt  ourselves  from
overpayment if people work overtime. We are exempt  from  the  labour  laws.
However, if we moved from a five day to a seven day dispensation  very  much
like the SAPS, we could use that money to work in shifts, employ  3,4  or  5
000 extra people who will relieve  the  load  on  the  current  workers  and
therefore impact dramatically on the need for overtime payments.

What are the solutions? If we negotiate through the  forums  for  parity  on
salaries with, for instance, a comparable department such as SAPS  and  then
employ the extra people, whose objectives will we be meeting?  The  national
objective for  job  creation  and  unions  should  be  delighted  with  this
solution because they also propose  a  work  creation  model  for  us  as  a
country, so there are ways in which to  do  this.  What  is  required  is  a
genuine desire to talk and thrash out solutions. If we meet and we  redefine
the old problems, all we become is acutely aware of how bad the problem is.
However, if a solutions-driven process is put  in  place,  the  unions,  the
progressive unions and ourselves have a long way to go.

I was at Kroonstad yesterday. I met all the staff and there was a  question-
and-answer session. The leadership of certain unions stood  out.  All  their
problems were related to themselves. Not one problem was raised  about  care
for the inmates who are our core business since they are  entrusted  to  us.
Worse still is the complete misunderstanding of,  for  instance,  the  issue
around overtime. It is as though we are standing on  the  edges  waiting  to
wrap it up. There was not one condemnation of the behaviour in Baberton  and
Nelspruit.  Not  one  condemnation!  It  is  required.  It  is  an  absolute
requirement. There were no statements on corruption  and  what  the  union's
role is in fighting it.

I think these are important issues. If we  are  going  to  make  progressive
strides forward, and as we see the Jali Commission  wrap  up  its  work,  we
need  to  know  that  there  are  people  on  the  ground,  working  in  our
correctional facilities,  who  have  the  same  objectives  of  seeing  this
department go forward and flourish and I think  that  is  really  important.
One does not get that impression on occasions like these. For me  it  was  a
little bit sad.

An interesting thing is that I am a great technology  buff  and  I  tend  to
like technology solutions.  However,  I  also  do  believe  that  technology
should be appropriate and relevant to the matter at  hand.  If  any  of  you
have any time and  you  have  not  done  this,  go  to  the  office  of  the
Inspecting Judge. Here technology is working and it is instant  information.
If I need some statistics, I can very often phone that office. I can  always
get the same stuff from my department, but they are very often  out  in  the
field working. So I very often use that office, as well.  I  am  not  saying
that my department cannot provide it, but the spontaneity,  the  instantness
of the information that they have and the network that they have  out  there
of people inspecting prisons, asking the right kind of questions,  reporting
back - I think this is a model to be followed.

Also, the National Council for Correctional Services has been  delegated  to
me as a responsibility. I would like to speak to Judge Desai, because  I  am
actually going to have to pick his brains and rely on his wisdom  so  as  to
see that this becomes a more useful tool in policy development and  in,  for
instance, an issues such as assessing parole on  life  sentence  inmates.  I
would like to thank Judge Desai for the advice he has given us,  and  me  in
particular in my voyage of discovery as I tried to find out  about  our  new
department.

We need to deal with the issues around women. A very  interesting  statistic
for those of you who do not know, is that out of 186 000 inmates  there  are
only 4 000 women. However, there are  special  issues  about  women  inmates
that are not being addressed by our facilities,  and  if  equal  outcome  is
what we are driving for, we need to  understand  that  we  need  to  provide
special care for those women who find themselves having  collided  with  the
law in some way or other. We need to put in the right  protocols  to  ensure
that the women who emerge are able to be integrated.

Also, I would love to see a study on a  comparison  on  sentencing  for  the
same crime. Very often women sentences are very harsh and we need to have  a
look at that.

I now come to the issue of crèches -  of  course  crèches  are  appropriate.
Where a mother comes in with an infant and there is no  better  placing,  we
have a very flexible and progressive policy. Although the rule calls  for  a
child staying with a parent for only two years, we will allow it for  up  to
five years. We will allow it for up to five years, but obviously  the  ideal
situation for the children has to be sought. Crèches  are  evident  in  most
places, but not ideal.
We have huge challenges infrastructurally. We will never  meet  the  demand.
People are talking about 250 000 inmates by the end of the decade - I  think
it might even be sooner. There is no way we can  build  enough  prisons.  We
have to  fix  up  sentencing  issues,  we  have  to  fix  up  awaiting-trial
populations and we have to show a determination between all role-players  to
achieve a human rights-based system of  corrections  and  rehabilitation.  I
thank the members. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  proceedings  will  be
suspended at this point in time and resume once more at 14:00. We  therefore
want to appeal to all members to be seated at 14:00 exactly. Thank you.

Business suspended at 12:44 and resumed at 14:00.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)
Vote No 25 - Safety and Security:

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Let  us  take  our  seats.  Order!  Hon
members, I see you are looking at me with great surprise.  You  want  me  to
say there will be time for meditation and prayer. We  have  done  that  this
morning. This is a continuation of this  morning's  debate.  So,  those  who
have just arrived, do not be surprised, we have already done  that.  We  are
proceeding with the debates of the cluster on safety and security.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Hon Chairperson and hon members of  the
NCOP, I was hoping that conditions would be created  in  this  House  for  a
little cold in order to generate heat. When it is already as hot as  it  is,
I do not know if we will be able to do that. The temperature in  this  House
ought to be the same as outside, and that will allow for  robust  engagement
with regard to the debate we are going to engage in.

After the initial 10 years of our democracy, we can say without any fear  of
contradiction that the SA Police Service is one of the  best  yardsticks  to
measure how far we have come as a country and as a nation. The SAPS  is  not
yet 10 years old, but the movement of the majority of  the  members  in  the
service; from the approach  to  policing  under  apartheid  to  serving  the
people under the democratic South  Africa,  has  been  dramatic.  Over  many
years in the past, the police have been a battering ram for apartheid.  Some
police actions have resulted in the torture, death and exile of  many  South
Africans, as well as the creation of circumstances for the violation of  the
human rights of the majority of the people.

There was still bloodletting in South Africa as recently  as  the  beginning
of the 1990s. Many people who died were freedom-loving  South  Africans  who
were struggling for the  liberation  of  their  motherland.  The  truth  and
reconciliation process exposed the involvement of  some  police  members  in
human rights violations. It goes  without  saying  that  there  was  intense
hostility between the people and the police, even as we  were  entering  the
democratic phase with the 1994 election.

Our first decade of freedom and democracy  has  produced  a  police  service
that works tirelessly to create an atmosphere of  safety  and  security  for
the people as one of the  building  blocks  for  the  consolidation  of  our
democracy. These policemen and women are no longer part of the problem,  but
have repositioned themselves to contribute to the search  for  solutions  to
the many outstanding strategic and  tactical  questions  that  define  human
interaction in our country. They are relentless  in  their  strategising  to
formulate programmes to combat crime and criminality. Working as they do  on
the ground, and side by side with members  of  our  communities,  they  know
that conventional policing on its own cannot provide permanent solutions  to
crime, especially social crime.

In the Western Cape, the police joined hands with the people in response  to
President Thabo Mbeki's call in his state of the nation address in  February
last year, namely that the best  way  of  fighting  crime  was  to  mobilise
communities ``to be the driving force with the police to  create  a  greater
awareness about crime in our communities.''  That  same  month  the  Western
Cape launched the Bambanani Against Crime Campaign, which attracted  25  000
people who attended the function to commit  themselves  to  crime  fighting.
There has been no looking back since  then,  with  the  communities  working
together with the police for safety and security in  the  Western  Cape.  At
every  event  in  the  province,  subsequently,   police   deployments   are
accompanied by the presence of Bambanani volunteers.

One of the major accomplishments of  the  campaign  was  the  Safer  Festive
Season Project which was launched on 8 December last year  and  which  ended
on 18 January 2004. The project attracted 3 467 volunteers who  worked  with
the police to cover community-based activities,  shebeens,  trains,  beaches
and the roads. They also provided protection for children and  young  people
who participated in the various festive activities, including visits to  the
beaches. Their presence was recorded again last Thursday when they did  duty
in Mitchell's  Plain  on  the  occasion  of  the  launch  of  the  anti-drug
campaign.

The police, under  Commissioner  Mzwandile  Petros,  have  rezoned  the  138
police stations in the province into manageable crime areas of at least  six
police stations each  for  an  integrated  and  focused  approach  to  crime
fighting. Senior police  officers  have  been  assigned  to  the  zones  for
command and control. Though the project was  started  at  the  beginning  of
this year, the results are already visible, given  the  reduction  in  crime
that has happened. There have also been a  number  of  instances  where  the
collaboration between the  police  and  communities  has  provoked  creative
thinking in the fight against crime.

The police in Limpopo Province converted a  police  vehicle  into  a  mobile
community  safety  centre  to  improve  service  delivery   to   the   rural
communities of the province. This innovation earned the  police  respect  at
home and abroad. They won the United Nations award  for  Innovation  in  the
Public Service in the Africa category. The award ceremony was  held  a  week
ago at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  We  are  proud  of  our
police in Limpopo and the other  role-players,  especially  the  communities
who have been working together with them. Sithi! Halala! [Applause.]

The North Rand policing area in  Gauteng  has  become  a  leader  in  sector
policing. The area community policing board designed  a  model  for  Tembisa
township in pursuance of the principle of sector policing that  was  adopted
by the police. The genesis of the project saw  broad  consultations  between
the board members  and  other  partners,  including  the  police,  community
leaders and residents. In the end  Tembisa  township  was  divided  into  12
sectors commensurate with the 12 municipal wards in the  area.  Each  sector
has a number of units that have unit committees that function  as  community
policing forum substructures. The  police,  who  worked  together  with  the
communities, are deployed in these sectors on a 24-hour basis. The  presence
of the police in the sectors and their ability to work in concert  with  the
people have reduced crime in Tembisa and the North Rand.

While I have mentioned only these few examples, I do want to say that  there
are many indicators that our police are indeed rooted  in  our  communities,
and  there  is  interaction.  That  produces  the  circumstances   regarding
community policing that we have defined as  a  Government.  Indications  are
there that these good programmes are being emulated elsewhere.

The SAPS conducted crime and sociographic profiles of the 63  areas  in  our
country where  most  contact  crimes  occur.  Areas,  therefore,  where  our
integrated effort will be mounted, include Duncan  Village  in  the  Eastern
Cape, Batho in the Free State, Mamelodi in  Gauteng,  KwaMashu  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, Thoyandou in Limpopo,  Kanyamazane  in  Mpumalanga,  Temba  in  North
West, Geleshewe in the Northern Cape and, of  course,  Khayelitsha  here  in
the Western Cape.

We are going to implement a programme in those areas that will  be  targeted
at social crime prevention, working  together  with  other  Cabinet  cluster
committees, like the social  and  economic  sectors,  in  the  provision  of
services that will change for the better  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of
the people.  We  together  with  the  Ministries  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs,  Housing  and  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  will  therefore
address the problems arising from the current patterns of  human  settlement
in South Africa. Informal settlements, as you are aware,  negatively  affect
the programme to render effective policing in such areas.  The  majority  of
the settlements have no proper streets and streetlights. The dwellings  have
no numbers and therefore no reference points for investigations.

Many shacks have mushroomed along our main arterial  roads  where,  now  and
again,  incidents  of  stone  throwing  at  passing  vehicles  occur.   This
phenomenon has become a specific danger in the  Western  Cape,  particularly
on the N2 freeway, passing Gugulethu and Khayelitsha. The N1 Grassmere  Toll
Plaza near Johannesburg has been targeted recently by  criminals  who  place
boulders on that stretch of road to slow  down  motorists  for  attack.  The
perpetrators lie in wait close by and disappear  into  the  nearby  informal
settlement after the deed.

We are happy that the Ministries, already cited, will use the Urban  Renewal
and Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programmes to build new  houses
for the people, recreational facilities, especially for the  youth,  and  to
install street and other lights. Those  Ministries  have  already  announced
their plans the implementation of which will contribute to the reduction  of
social crime.

The other day I received a letter from Zola Maseko, a young film writer  and
director. Some of his  works  have  earned  him  worldwide  recognition  and
international awards. Some of us here will of course remember  him  for  his
thought-provoking work on Sarah Baartman which was flighted by our  national
television network. Zola is an ex-uMkhonto  weSizwe  combatant,  who  worked
for three years  in  the  frontline  as  an  MK  underground  operative.  It
therefore goes without saying that he has a deep understanding of firearms.

His  letter,  like  some  of  the  letters  I  receive  from  some  of   our
compatriots, is heart-rendering. In that  letter  he  mourns  the  death  of
Dumisani Dlamini, himself a filmmaker and a  friend,  who  was  gunned  down
exactly a month ago, today. He was 29 when he died. Dumi,  as  Dumisani  was
known to his friends, had just completed post production work on Zola's  new
film, Drum, when he was killed. He was the producer of that film.  The  film
seeks to  understand  the  role  of  Drum  magazine  during  the  old  days,
particularly the times when the  struggle  for  our  liberation  was  moving
towards its peak. Of course the film  also  comments  on  the  contributions
that  were  made  by  various  political  role-players,   including   former
President Mandela, Walter Sisulu, O R Tambo, to mention just a few.

Zola makes the following observation in his letter:


  I cannot help thinking that were it not for the proliferation of guns  in
  our society, Dumi would be alive today and so would be the thousands upon
  thousands of South Africans who die from gun violence each year.
However, there are other South Africans who have  baulked  at  the  idea  of
having  stricter  measures  in  place  to  ensure  proper  gun  control   by
registered owners and to stop the circulation of illegal firearms. It  is  a
fallacy to think that registered owners commit no infraction  regarding  gun
control. They do. Many of the illegal firearms  in  circulation  were  owned
legally once upon a time.

From January to May  this  year,  registered  gun  owners  in  South  Africa
reported that 7 993 firearms were either lost or stolen from them.  This  is
in addition to the 85 634 lost or stolen firearms since the year 2000.  What
I am indicating to you is the number of firearms that were  lost  and  which
obviously are in circulation illegally in this country. Perhaps, we  do  not
know this, the murder of Dumi Dlamini may have been perpetrated by  somebody
carrying one of  these  firearms.  Stricter  gun  control  measures  do  not
undermine the right of anyone to own a firearm. They protect  the  right  of
people to be safe from firearm abuse and every peace-loving and  law-abiding
citizen should support such measures.

I am not going to say more on this question because, as you  may  be  aware,
there is a High Court action that was brought on Friday  last  week  against
the President as first respondent, the Minister for Safety and  Security  as
second respondent and the National Commissioner of the South African  Police
Service as third respondent. The South African Gun  Owners  Association  and
six others brought an urgent application for an interdict to set  aside  the
promulgation of the Firearms Control Act, as well as  the  firearms  control
regulations.

As announced in the National Assembly last week, the  Firearms  Control  Act
will come into effect in its  entirety  on  1  July  2004.  We  divided  the
implementation of the Act into phases after  it  was  promulgated.  We  have
budgeted R63 199 956 for the implementation of the whole Act, including  the
allocation to provinces of R53 700 365,61 to take care of their end  of  the
implementation.

The allocation has been divided as follows: The  Eastern  Cape  received  an
allocation of R10 302 573, 90 - we should have given you 10  more  cents  at
least to make up the R1 - the Free State received  R4  562  910.20;  Gauteng
received R8 392 552; KwaZulu-Natal received R9 133 062; Limpopo received  R4
067 926,90; Mpumalanga received R3 816 100,57 and the  North  West  received
R4 452 761, 36. The allocation of the Northern Cape and  Western  Cape  fell
on the keys of my computer. I do not  know  what  happened,  but  they  have
disappeared from my copy, but they have also been given an allocation.

The provincial budgets will be used to service the 315 firearm  registration
centres allocated to the provinces as follows: 53 for the Eastern  Cape,  25
for the Free State, 22 for Gauteng, 55 for KwaZulu-Natal -  there  are  many
people in KwaZulu-Natal who are applying for  firearm  licences;  I  do  not
know why that is so - 28 for Limpopo, 22 for Mpumalanga, 31 for North  West,
32 for the Northern Cape and 47 for the Western Cape.

A total of 8 768 entry-level constables and 2 732  administrative  personnel
will be assigned to the  various  provinces  during  the  current  financial
year. Gauteng will receive the biggest number of  1  935,  followed  by  the
Western Cape who will get 1 590, KwaZulu-Natal will receive 1  227  and  the
Eastern Cape will receive 1 183. The remaining numbers will be allocated  as
follows: Mpumalanga will receive 789, Limpopo will  get  690,  the  Northern
Cape will receive 496, the Free State will receive 442 and  the  North  West
will get 382. When the police in your provinces say that they  do  not  have
the necessary human resources, tell them that on this day,  I  indicated  to
the NCOP that they are given these numbers. Of course  they  will  also  say
that they do not have adequate vehicles. If  I  had  enough  time,  I  would
indicate how many vehicles they are going to  get,  but  you  will  remember
from an announcement we made a while back in the NA, we  had  said  that  we
are striving towards a position where we will ensure that  each  vehicle  is
going to accommodate two members. We are not  going  to  continue  having  a
situation where a number of people share one vehicle. This  time  around  we
are moving towards that arrangement. [Applause.]

Gauteng is going to get 600 members  whom  we  are  allocating  to  the  new
division that has been established within the police for the protection  and
security services, while the Western Cape is going to get 400.  The  Western
Cape will receive the 400 from the beginning of next year, and those  police
members will be allocated to what we define as the new  railway  contingent.
In other words, these policemen will be working on the railway lines and  at
the stations in the Western Cape, but that is only a pilot project.  We  are
going to expand the service to  cover  all  the  provinces  in  future.  The
upgrading of the Philippi Police  College  may  see  some  increase  in  the
indicated personnel figures. We will possibly add to what I am  giving,  but
there are 240 members of SAPS whom we are going to allocate  to  Limpopo  as
part and parcel of our protection  and  security  services.  At  the  moment
those are the three provinces that we are considering, but as  we  get  more
funds we are going to recruit more people into this particular  division  of
the police.

An allocation of R345  million  has  been  made  for  the  construction  and
completion  of  new  police  stations  around  the  country,  and  for   the
finalisation of work started during the last financial  year  regarding  the
upgrading of some of these stations. During the current  financial  year  we
have already opened new police stations  at  Mangaung  in  the  Free  State,
Tsolo in the Eastern Cape and Mabopane in the North West.

The upgraded police station at Frankfurt in the Eastern Cape will be  opened
on 9 July 2004 and will be named after Comrade Steve Tshwete. [Applause.]

Following a Cabinet decision that the SA National  Defence  Force  would  be
replaced by SAPS for border control, a task  team  comprising  members  from
both structures was set up. The task team  has  finalised  the  strategy  to
effect this over the next six years.

During the current financial year, 5 130 additional  SAPS  members  will  be
assigned to border duty. Their work will cover the border with  Namibia  and
Botswana. The affected South African provinces will be Northern Cape,  North
West and Limpopo.

The 2005-06 financial year will see the consolidation of  our  border  work,
and during the 2006-07 financial year  the  police  will  take  over  border
control on the Lesotho border that  will  benefit  the  Eastern  Cape,  Free
State and KwaZulu-Natal. The MECs and the members of  this  House  who  come
from those provinces will remember the problems that  we  continue  to  have
and will appreciate the scope of the difficulties  that  we  have  in  those
provinces, but this is how we would want to address that situation.

During the next financial year the Mozambique  and  Swaziland  borders  will
receive attention, benefiting KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga  and  Limpopo.  The
last phase will affect the border between Zimbabwe and Limpopo.

The provincial Secretariats for  Safety  and  Security,  as  well  as  their
Independent Complaints Directorate counterparts continue to deliver  a  good
service in  our  provinces.  Of  course,  there  are  discussions  that  are
happening at the political level to fund the best  strategy  to  enrich  the
work those structures do, both at national  and  provincial  levels.  It  is
common cause that such an assessment would be done, given the experience  of
the past ten years of our democracy.
We will come back to the legislative  entities  like  the  NCOP  when  those
discussions gel into proper instruments ready for enactment as part  of  our
law. I am sure that members of the NCOP will agree with me that we have  the
necessary framework and springboard  on  the  ground  in  order  for  us  to
continue providing a service for the safety and security of  our  people.  I
am sure that we will all agree that the allocation  that  we  have  received
this year is an allocation that will enable us to do the work that  must  be
done. I am therefore certain that we will agree that we must have  in  place
an amount of money that we can use as a vehicle to effect the  changes  that
we must in order for us to consolidate our work and to rid  our  country  of
crime and criminality. Thank you.

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, firstly,  we  the  people  of  the
Eastern Cape would like to thank the Minister for the allocation. I am  sure
that it will advance our programme in making sure that  quality  service  is
provided for our communities and  that  the  Eastern  Cape  becomes  a  safe
passage for all our people in the country.

Of course, since 1994 the department of safety and liaison in  the  province
has managed to transform and participate in government  programmes  so  that
we can provide support  for  individual  rights  and  freedoms  of  all  our
people. In the past 10 years the Eastern Cape has seen the building  of  the
new SA  Police  Service  infrastructure,  which  the  Minister  has  already
mentioned. In our evaluation, more than R100 million has  been  provided  to
improve service delivery  that  subsequently  provided  improvement  of  the
working conditions for more than 16 502 police members in the province.

This year the number,  which  the  Minister  pronounced  here  in  terms  of
allocation, will add to the personnel, which finally will  become  a  useful
mechanism in providing a safe province in this financial year. The  province
has managed to establish working relations  with  a  number  of  departments
including the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.

The  Department  of  Justice,  in  collaboration  with  its  partners,   has
developed a number of special courts to deal with  specific  crimes.  Family
courts have been established to hear cases such  as  domestic  violence  and
maintenance of children. Special personnel, including social workers,  staff
these courts to deal with these cases.

Special prosecutors staff the sexual offences courts  that  deal  with  rape
and child abuse in the province. A special court  has  been  established  to
deal with environmental courts. One is  in  Port  Elizabeth  and  it  is  to
ensure that our natural resources are not exploited to such an  extent  that
extinction looms.

We have  also  collaborated  with  correctional  services.  Overcrowding  of
prisons is at the top of the agenda of the Eastern Cape Provincial  Criminal
Justice Forum that has been established in collaboration with  all  relevant
law-enforcement agencies. Many prisons  experience  situations  where  their
accommodation is overcrowded and this is the challenge that  the  provincial
criminal justice forum is  beginning  to  address.  This  is  an  integrated
approach to  providing  a  quality  service,  together  with  all  necessary
agencies in the province.

The establishment of the special investigations  unit,  the  Scorpions,  the
Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Joint Anti-Corruption Task  Team,  JACTT,  has
assisted in eradicating corruption and fraud within the  state  institutions
and the general public. The  integrated  team  made  up  of  the  SAPS,  the
Directorate of Special Operations, the Scorpions, the special  investigating
unit and others have  recovered  state  assets  which  are  worth  about  R6
million, and that was in the province only.

We believe that this collaboration repositions all forces  which  stand  for
justice in that province, so that it is able to proceed with  the  provision
of a quality service to all our people.

This year the department undertakes the following tasks: Firstly,  to  pilot
a national monitoring  and  evaluation  tool  at  Motherwell  and  Mdantsane
police stations  by  June,  with  a  proposed  roll-out  later  during  this
financial year to evaluate service delivery at  police  station  level.  The
Minister has already indicated this  area  of  work.  So,  the  province  is
collaborating in making sure that this project is going to take off.

Secondly,  we  will  conduct  research  on  the  efficiency  and  impact  of
community police forums by the end of August this  year.  This  is  to  make
sure that our interventions in facilitating an  effective  community  police
forum service is strengthened.

Finally, we did get assistance from an EU-funded programme  which  is  worth
R250  million  in  the  province.  We  will  facilitate   the   design   and
implementation of prevention, awareness and educational programmes  focusing
on crimes against women and children. These will  include  community  victim
empowerment programmes and offender support  programmes.  During  the  first
phase of this programme an amount of approximately  R9,3  million  has  been
set aside for community mobilisation.  We  are  of  the  opinion  that  this
approach is not only going to make interim interventions, but  will  provide
a long-term solution and mobilise the resources  and  capacity  of  all  our
communities.

This intervention by the SAPS in collaboration with the EU has  repositioned
us. As a result of this, we strongly believe that very soon the province  is
going to be a zero area in terms of the levels of crime,  because  currently
we have the second lowest province rating in terms of the  evaluations  that
have been done across the country.
So, with those  few  words  we  want  to  say  to  the  hon  Minister:  Your
allocations will further strengthen  our  efforts  in  making  sure  that  a
collaborated approach in our anticrime strategies is  strengthened.  We  are
further committed to making sure that  all  the  community  policing  forums
that are collaborating with our communities will  be  repositioned  so  that
the whole question of anticrime  and  security  for  our  people  becomes  a
project of South Africans because, clearly,  the  personnel  within  the  SA
Police Service will not be  able  to  guard  each  and  every  single  South
African individual in that province. However, it is only  when  the  police,
the communities and all stakeholders act together in  providing  a  peaceful
package that we would be able to say that all our people are finally free.

Lastly, we really want to say  to  this  House  that  we  are  committed  to
providing a peaceful atmosphere in our  province  because,  clearly,  it  is
peace which provides the basis for any development.  The  current  2010  bid
which South Africa has secured, sets a challenge to everybody,  particularly
for us all in creating peaceful conditions  so  that  finally  South  Africa
will be ready for that 2010 bid. With those few words, thank you very  much.
[Applause.]

Mr B H CELE (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, Deputy Chair. Hon Minister,  I  hope
that next time the hon Minister speaks here, he  will  mention  good  things
that come from my province, like it was the case with the Western  Cape  and
Limpopo.  Then,  hopefully,  KwaZulu-Natal  will  be   topping   the   list.
[Interjections.]

I hope my comrades and colleagues here will be sharing my  dream  that  when
one day, at about 2 a.m. when young  people  leave  the  nightclubs  or  any
place that they have been where they can enjoy themselves,  they  are  in  a
position to walk home without fear of any accident, rape or attack from  our
streets. That is an ideal that all of us share.  We  need  to  work  towards
that ideal. It is on that  score  that  we  are  quite  grateful  about  the
announcement made by the Minister in which he tried to strengthen  and  make
that dream a reality. We are trying to work in the province to  create  what
is known as a united front against crime,  where  everybody  works  together
and make sure that we close all the  gaps  where  criminals  are  making  an
advance to destabilise and make sure that the lives of our  people  are  not
ideal as we would like them to see.

Dealing with this, we start as we did in Umzimkhulu area last week  when  we
launched the co-operation of departments. We have been looking at all  those
departments in the provinces, beyond the ones that form the  social  cluster
here. One department  that  we  believe  should  be  part  of  fighting  and
combating crime is the Department of Education. This department  has  tended
to be the market of criminals. Most of the  drugs  that  are  produced,  get
marketed at our schools. Besides illegal firearms, drugs  are  part  of  the
lives of our children at school. We believe that education must  be  brought
on board to try and fight hard to be part of this front against crime.

General civil society should be part of that, but sometimes business do  not
get as involved as we would love to see it  getting  involved.  This  is  my
eighth week, if I am  not  mistaken,  since  I  was  appointed  in  the  new
responsibility that I am doing. We have already  buried  six  policemen  who
were killed - which comes to almost one  policeman  a  week  that  is  being
killed. I think it is one front on which we have to work much harder. It  is
on that score that I have invited the human rights organisations to be  part
of our finding the solution to this problem. When we try to  be  tougher  in
trying to find solutions to this, we seem to behave like big  macho  men  or
cowboys; especially when we say: Police have the right to defend  themselves
when they are shot at.

It looks like that  statement  was  misinterpreted  when  the  Minister  was
making his announcement of increasing the numbers of the police. I  hope  we
are not going to have colleges that produce policemen and women who will  be
taken to the grave. These policemen and women must be part  of  society  and
must come back and do the exact job that they were trained  for.  The  human
rights and other civil organisations,  NGOs  and  CPOs  should  be  part  of
finding solutions on how to save our police and  make  sure  that  they  are
there to do the job. We cannot allow for the  creation  of  new  graves  and
leave that unchallenged.

I am from the province that has not built a single police  station  for  the
past ten years. There are only two police stations  that  are  about  to  be
finished, but before that no new stations were built. I am hopeful that  the
Minister and my  colleagues  will  understand  that  in  the  most  populous
province we will build more police stations. There  have  been  57  requests
for police stations to be built in the  province.  Yet,  not  a  single  new
station was built for the past 10 years. That is a major challenge  for  us.
We have tried to find a reason why these requests were made and yet  nothing
was built. You drive for an hour between the police  stations  in  the  area
where they have requested those police stations.  At  any  given  point  you
need to drive for an hour  from  this  particular  community  to  reach  the
nearest police station. Their requests to have some  police  stations  built
in these areas are very genuine requests.

Looking at the issue of illegal  firearms,  sometimes  it  is  baffling  why
those people who are opposed to strict gun control measures are making  such
a noise. I agree. Most of our people die because of these illegal  firearms.
As the figures have been given this afternoon, most of the illegal  firearms
used in crime once used to be legal,  and  we  are  sometimes  careless.  We
would support this to make sure that these guys are controlled.

One other thing we need to add to this is  the  psychological  disarming  of
society. You often see a mother on her way to the supermarket to buy  a  toy
gun as a present. If you buy him or her a present at the age  of  eight,  by
the time he is 12 he will be looking for the real  thing.  You  have  geared
and socialised that particular child in believing that having  a  gun  is  a
good thing. At the age of 12 we are looking at the real  thing  and  at  the
age of 14 we will lose that guy. It is up to us to make a call to  say  that
one of the things that must be removed from every toy  shop  should  be  the
toy guns. Those things must be sorted  out.  It  will  save  a  few  of  our
children who are very enthusiastic to get hold of the real thing.

Over the past two  days  we  have  lost  three  people  because  of  illegal
firerarms. There was a party in Inanda, and  after  the  party  ended,  they
came back with illegal firearms. Three people, including the mother  of  the
house, were ordered to kneel and pray. They were  shot  in  the  head  while
kneeling. I want to believe that it was caused by an illegal firearm in  the
hands of the enemy. We do need stricter control of firearms.

We will be working hard to root out domestic violence. We  will  be  looking
for real assistance in that regard. I feel we need to  be  harsher  when  it
comes to domestic violence; the abuse of women and our children.  We  really
cannot be kind and be seen as being soft on that.  Unfortunately,  I  wonder
how much training we have given so that our personnel  are  able  to  handle
those sensitive cases.  I  do  not  think  that  the  police  personnel  are
negotiators. When somebody comes to the police station to report  an  abuse,
instead of arresting the abuser, they try to negotiate with the woman to  go
back home. The result is that she will be dead the next day. I think  it  is
one area in which we in the SA Police Service are still lacking. We need  to
give ourselves a push and say that our job is to protect our women  and  our
children, and not to negotiate on their behalf and allow them to be  further
abused.

We would have loved to get more figures. I believe we will be  able  to  get
more as time goes on. We hope that  vehicles  will  be  provided  to  police
personnel. I believe we still have a number of police personnel  who  cannot
use vehicles. I do not know whether we encourage  that  kind  of  behaviour,
and I know that all who come to the police station have a driver's  licence.
There are still those in the system who cannot use those vehicles. When  you
phone them, they will tell you that there are no  vehicles,  which  actually
means that there are no licensed drivers. [Time expired.]

Mr T MAKGOE (Free State): Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon members, I think  that
the message from the MECs is very clear today, especially as it pertains  to
the killing of police officers. I concur fully with what  the  Minister  for
Safety and Security, Comrade Charles Nqakula, said during his budget  speech
on 22 June 2004, particularly on the outstanding  performance  of  the  SAPS
members.

Quite correctly the majority of the  SAPS  members  deserves  accolades  for
discharging their duties and responsibilities with courage and  distinction.
For instance, the quick reaction by the SAPS  members  saw  a  swoop  on  an
armed gang 15 minutes after robbing a wholesaler in Botshabelo in  the  Free
State on 21 June 2004. The swift action of the SAPS members  and  the  local
community once again paid off after an escapee shot and  killed  two  police
officers at Reitz in the Free  State  on  5  June  2004.  When  cornered  by
members of the SAPS at Orange Farm in Gauteng on 18 July 2004,  the  suspect
shot and killed himself. I am sure the message that came  from  the  members
of the community and the SAPS is that if you kill a police  officer  in  the
Free State, you will be forced to kill yourself.

There are quite a number of such  commendable  police-community  deeds  that
include the creation of a secure and peaceful environment during  the  April
2004 election when the ANC was again mandated  to  ensure  that  the  people
continue to govern. The Government and the  people  of  South  Africa  will,
therefore, seize every opportunity to contemptuously decry the  maiming  and
slaying of members of the SAPS on or off duty. Equally, we will  remove  all
stops when dealing with  those  undeserving  police  officers  who  find  it
convenient and exciting to violate human rights of those of our  people  who
are unsuspecting and sometimes unknowing, yet law-abiding. For instance,  an
avalanche of public complaints was received mainly from  the  Qwa  Qwa  area
against some members of the SAPS. The reported complaints include  cases  of
rape in police cells, assaults and verbal abuse of citizens. Some  of  these
police officers are drunk 90% of the time. These  untransformable  and  ill-
disciplined Bantustan remnants are firmly determined to  remind  us  of  the
past that we so much seek to forget.

The Free State provincial government has  embarked  upon  numerous  projects
designed to monitor and measure the conduct  and  performance  of  the  SAPS
members. They include the following: The launching of  a  toll-free  number,
0800 72 73 74, through which communities can register complaints against  or
compliment members of the SAPS; the placing of suggestion boxes in all  Free
State  police  stations  to  gather  opinions;  the  commissioning  of   two
community climate surveys during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 financial years  to
test the perceptions of the communities as the recipients of police  service
delivery; the  extension  of  oversight  responsibility  of  the  provincial
secretariat  to  include  monitoring  of  police  dismissals,   suspensions,
overall discipline, human resources and the promotion of  women  within  the
SAPS. I hope, hon Minister, that the next commissioner of the Free State  is
a female. [Interjections.]

In line with the national transformation agenda, a number of police  station
precincts have been redemarcated in the  Free  State  in  order  to  provide
deracialised an equitable service delivery to all our communities. There  is
a tendency in South Africa that ensures that police  stations  in  townships
only serve communities in  the  townships  and  are  not  allowed  to  serve
farming communities around those townships. We view this as  racist  and  we
are in the process of changing it in the Free State.  The  official  opening
of Mangaung Police Station by the hon Minister, Comrade Charles Nqakula,  on
4 June 2004 is an  appropriate  example.  Further  redemarcation  of  police
station precincts that are being implemented include the police stations  of
Parys and Tumahole - my hometown and that of the Chairperson of the  ANC  in
our province, Comrade Ace Magashule - Sasolburg and Zamdela;  Kroonstad  and
Maokeng; Thaba Nchu and Selosecha; and Welkom and Thabong.

History will judge us unfavourably if we  neglect  the  present  and  future
needs and interests of our young. A case in point involves a boy who, on  19
June 2004, was assaulted, abducted and taken to an initiation school on  the
outskirts of Masilonyana in Theunissen in  the  Free  State.  This  boy  was
subsequently circumcised without his or his  parents'  consent.  The  matter
was reported to the  local  SAPS  and  to  myself.  Upon  investigation,  39
initiates were found in two initiation schools. Their  ages  ranged  between
15 and 21 years. They were all admitted to hospitals in Welkom and  Virginia
for treatment and were later released.  Consequently,  eight  suspects  were
arrested and charged for assault and abduction, because there is  a  law  in
our province that regulates cultural activities. The Free  State  provincial
government, through my department, then  released  a  stern  public  warning
that while the Constitution of South Africa allows  for  the  expression  of
cultural and traditional beliefs, the  Government  would  not  tolerate  the
establishment and operation of initiation schools outside  the  dictates  of
either a national or a provincial law.

The public perception survey commissioned by my department during the  2003-
04 financial years revealed that 53% of the respondents were of the  opinion
that the major cause of crime was the high unemployment  rate  in  the  Free
State. My department will be facilitating  the  establishment  of  the  Free
State youth development centre over the next MTEF period.  The  centre  will
provide skills training and enhance the employability levels  of  our  youth
and consequently impact on crime. On our visit to the Kroonstad  prison,  we
found young people aged 12 and 13 in prison.  I  have  engaged  the  MEC  of
Education about how they could make sure that  these  children  continue  to
receive education, because if we do not  do  that,  they  will  be  lost  to
crime. They will start at age 12 and will end up  being  criminals  for  the
rest of their lives.

Whereas our youth was unreservedly antagonistic toward the police  authority
of the previous regime, the 2004 Youth Day saw both members of the SAPS  and
our young people historically marching together under conditions  of  peace,
stability and jubilation at Zamdela Stadium in the Free State.

When the people's contract  was  signed  on  14  April  2004,  the  ANC  was
mandated amongst others to deploy more than 150 000 police in  active  duty.
In fulfilment of  this  popular  commitment  to  our  people,  I  have  been
informed by the police, and I can safely assure hon members that a total  of
442  functional  police  officials  and  291  civilian  personnel  will   be
recruited this financial year into the SAPS in the Free  State.  During  our
budget speech on 10 June 2004, I further made a  plea  to  the  councillors,
church leaders and other prominent South  Africans  to  encourage  community
members to join the reservists in the SAPS - and  I  had  to  do  a  lot  of
checking because I was not sure whether  the  ANC  supports  the  policy  of
reservists and was assured that it does. That plea was  made  in  line  with
the  Minister's  call  in  the  extended  parliamentary  committee  on   the
recruitment of reservists. This recruitment  drive  will  target  unemployed
youth and thereby boost our sector policing endeavours and  enhance  visible
policing. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I am aware that most of you  are  making
your maiden speeches, but unfortunately I cannot give  you  more  time  than
that which has been allocated to you. Thank you very much.

Mr D A WORTH: Hon Chairperson, I am very pleased that the  hon  Minister  of
Safety and Security this afternoon touched on the question of  the  Firearms
Control Act which  comes  into  effect  this  Thursday,  1  July,  in  fact,
tomorrow evening at midnight. The DA, of course, supports this Bill and  any
attempts to rid the country of some  estimated  three  million  illegal  and
homemade guns.

The Act, as we  all  know,  aims  to  regulate  the  ownership  and  use  of
firearms, allowing background checks on those applying  for  a  gun  licence
and restricting shooting to sport clubs and self-defence.  However,  as  the
deadline  nears,  there  are  fears  that  law-abiding  citizens  are  being
penalised  by  the  lack  of   information   and   administrative   capacity
constraints within the department. Some two million legal firearms  have  to
be  registered.  Law-abiding  citizens  should  not  be  made  criminals  by
default.

Some of the problems with regard to the implementation of the new  Act  are:
Firstly, staff are somehow going to have to deal with the  backlog  of  some
60 000 applications and the complicated procedures and  appeals  within  the
new system; secondly, the insufficient  technology  for  weapon  dealers  to
communicate electronically with the Firearms Registry in Pretoria;  thirdly,
the lack of information about the SABS approved institutions  to  deal  with
competency   certificates   and   accreditation   and   training   of   such
institutions; fourthly, what firearms owners are to  do  with  the  existing
parts or ammunition that may be illegal  from  Thursday,  1  July;  fifthly,
whether sufficient police officers and officials have been trained  to  cope
with  the  implementation  of  the  new  Act;  and  lastly,  the   lack   of
transparency and accountability in the licensing process.

The Minister of Safety  and  Security  must  meet  with  representatives  of
firearm associations, dealers and the security  and  hunting  industries  to
address their concerns about the  implementation  of  the  Firearms  Control
Act. It is clearly not the intention of  the  Act  to  disarm  the  security
industry, or to shut down  firearms  dealerships  and  professional  hunting
operations. The Act includes exemptions that should prevent this.  If  there
are concerns that these exemptions are inadequate, these must be addressed.

Furthermore, public awareness campaigns regarding the  implications  of  the
Act need to be carried out by the department as  a  matter  of  urgency.  In
this regard, the Minister should publish a schedule  of  deadlines  relating
to the Act as soon as possible. I wish  to  state  once  again:  Law-abiding
citizens should not be made criminals by default. I thank you. [Applause]

Mr L RAMATLAKANE (Western Cape): Chairperson, it is difficult to talk  after
the DA which purports to be the shop-steward of the Gun Owners  Association.
However, I will leave that for the Minister to deal with. Let me first  take
this opportunity to congratulate the ANC on yet another victory achieved  in
the Western Cape. On 23 June 2004, five by-elections took  place  in  a  DA-
controlled ward. The ANC won two of these DA-controlled  wards.  In  one  of
them the ANC has taken control of the  entire  town.  [Applause.]  It  means
that this glorious movement must elect its  mayor.  It  means  that  in  the
Western Cape our people are beginning to realise that the ANC is  the  party
that carries the hope of all the  people  of  this  country:  black,  white,
coloured and Indian.

Two weeks ago in the legislature, during  the  budget  debate,  we  made  it
clear that the Western Cape is no longer an isolated province, but  part  of
the rest of the country. On 14 April this year our people went to the  poll,
having a common understanding that they would  want  to  see  this  province
being governed by the party that has been the voice of  all  the  people  in
this country since 1912 when it was  established,  the  party  that  started
delivering a better life for all our people since it  took  over  after  the
1994 democratic breakthrough. In the province we are ready to  confront  all
the challenges head-on. The ANC-led provincial government is  determined  to
make the Western Cape a home for all its people, black and white. It is  for
this reason that we have committed ourselves to  work  as  a  collective  in
ensuring that the level of crime and violence against women and children  is
reduced at all times.

It is no secret that the Western Cape is grappling with  gangsterism,  crime
and organised crime. Some of these  crimes,  like  gangsterism,  are  deeply
rooted within affected communities. In fact, some communities see this as  a
way of life. Many innocent young children have died in the  process  of  the
gang turf wars in the Western Cape. When Premier Rasool last  spoke  in  the
provincial  legislature,  he  committed  all   the   provincial   Ministers,
including myself, to 20 service-delivery building blocks to the province  of
the Western Cape. Chief amongst these was the call  made  by  the  President
that the security agencies arrest 200 identified high-flying criminals,  and
some of these, of course, are based in the Western Cape.

The President's call was followed by the Premier's call that  in  the  first
100 days, three of these high-flyers  should  be  arrested  in  the  Western
Cape. Two weeks ago our policemen and women further  strengthened  our  case
with the arrest of a drug lord, seizing mandrax tablets worth  R3,5  million
at the house of a well-known drug dealer in Elsies River.

As a part of our clampdown or take  down-strategy,  the  Western  Cape  will
start the implementation of the Prevention of  Organised  Crime  Act,  Poca,
with a special focus on gang membership. We hope  to  receive  full  support
from the national Government on all these  endeavours.  As  demonstrated  by
law enforcement agencies that we walk  the  talk,  seven  gang  members,  in
terms of the Poca Act, of Cisko Yakkies, the Americans and Dixie Boys, well-
known gangs in the Cape Flats, are behind bars and are being  prosecuted  by
various magistrate courts under  the  Poca  legislation.  The  Western  Cape
government appreciates the support  given  by  the  national  Government  in
ensuring that police personnel is increased in the Western  Cape  from  what
we inherited, 11 000 to 18 000 at the moment. This will  increase  to  about
20 000 in 2006. We can clearly see that the  said  increase  would  make  it
possible for us to take back the streets and all the public places.
We are happy that the 400 railway police are going  to  start  training  and
take up their duties in January 2005. That means that will bring back  much-
needed safety to metro rail.

With respect to the Independent Complaints Directorate in the Western  Cape,
it is a considered view that the integrity of this directorate  is  critical
for the important work of pursuing the  Constitutional  imperative.  We  can
sum this up by saying that the attention being  given  to  the  ICD  at  the
moment should be intensified for its optimal functioning in the province.

Understanding the  direction  that  we  must  build  partnerships  with  our
people, we initiated an approach that is about people  working  together  in
tandem  with  Government  and  police  in  the  fight  against  crime.  This
particular campaign was launched, as the Minister has already mentioned,  in
Khayelitsha on 9 February 2003 with 25  000  people.  During  December  last
year we met with 125 000 people in the province in a call for  partnerships.
More  support  became  evident  during  the  festive  season  when   3   000
volunteers, bambanani, ordinary people, put shoulder to the wheel,  side  by
side with the police, to fight crime. As  a  provincial  government  we  are
investigating how we can make it possible that these 3  500  volunteers  can
be part of the Extended  Public  Works  Programme  in  terms  of  getting  a
stipend of about R50 a day, but continue to work  with  the  police  in  the
fight against crime.

With bambanani against crime and a people's contract to fight  crime  during
December and January this year, we  have  witnessed  a  decline  in  general
crime of 18% compared to the previous year. We also witnessed a  decline  of
34% on murder. For the same period, road  fatalities  declined  by  32%.  We
dearly thank these volunteers.

President Thabo Mbeki  has  made  this  call  that  all  of  us  must  begin
delivery, must bring Government programmes to our people, build  a  contract
and make our communities safer. This brings me to another matter  of  public
importance, namely the use and trade of drugs on the Cape Flats, and to  our
programmes to empower the community to fight this scourge.

The national Minister of Safety  and  Security,  the  Deputy  Minister,  the
Premier and the MEC for education, addressed  the  community  of  Mitchell's
Plain last week, urging  them  to  form  this  partnership  in  the  crusade
against drugs. Many young scholars have become victims of a new  fashionable
drug called tik-tik. The drug is highly addictive.

I am glad to announce that the men and  women  in  blue  in  the  SA  Police
Service have been hard at work, hunting down those who are dealing in  drugs
in general. We want to thank them dearly for their hard work,  and  tomorrow
we will be tabling a business plan in Cabinet to say how we will  take  this
process forward, and thereafter we will obviously seek engagement  with  the
national Government for maximum support.

The Western Cape is on course to make this  province  a  home  for  all  its
people. It is for this reason that work for the integrated criminal  justice
cluster should be intensified. We believe  that  when  these  agencies  work
hand in hand, we will be making a huge impact on crime and fighting crime.

This brings me to the issue of our Department of Correctional  Services.  It
is matter of public knowledge that activities of some of  the  personnel  at
Pollsmoor prison leave much to be desired. We are told  that  corruption  is
rife at these facilities. When you hear a member of the public  speak  about
the corruption in this institution, when you  read  a  newspaper,  when  you
listen to the radio, you will of course understand that  something  must  be
done at this institution. We need, as a matter  of  urgency,  mechanisms  to
deal with gangs and gang subculture in Pollsmoor.
It is said that the officials sometimes turn a blind eye on  contraventions,
such as the trafficking of  drugs,  in  this  institution.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, I want to  indicate
that I come from a movement committed to a better life for all  and  in  our
strategic quest for social justice and the  establishment  of  a  democratic
constitutional order that gives effect  to  that  life.  The  Department  of
Safety and Security is moving with pride and recording  major  achievements.
These rest on problem solving that addresses the immediate  and  deep-rooted
social causal  factors  which  encourage  social  crime,  and  move  towards
creating an environment in  which  citizens  can  empower  themselves  in  a
manner that creates opportunities for a better life. However, we  do  so  in
the face of major challenges of developmental  imbalances  which  require  a
fundamental environmental redesign to reduce crime. In this  regard  I  want
to quote from the socioeconomic profile  of  Batho  Education  in  the  Free
State which we are targeting for a holistic development to fight crime.  The
profile reflects the developmental imbalances in our country:


  Almost the whole police station area suffers from a lack of streetlights.
  Only masts with floodlights have been erected. The results are many  dark
  places exist in the area, street names do not appear on  street  corners,
  resulting in members of the SAPS having to ask around to identify streets
  when there is a crisis. A large open space without houses exists.

I think those who know the Free State there  will  know  there  is  a  place
called Freedom Square which is an  informal  settlement.  The  residents  in
this area use this open space as a thoroughfare. This  open  space  is  very
dark at night, as no lights have been erected there.  The  place  is  strewn
with boulders behind which persons can  hide  and  then  attack  defenceless
victims, ending in rape, robbery and even murder.  I  hope  those  who  come
from the Free State are conversant with these kinds of problems. Of  course,
they are not only prevalent in the Free State, but also in the rest  of  our
country.

Our National Crime Prevention Strategy is informed by  a  comprehensive  set
of factors which include the  above  conditions.  It  emphasises  entrenched
economic strain and deprivation, low education levels, a legacy  of  a  poor
human rights culture, high rates of urbanisation,  high  levels  of  illegal
gun  ownership  and  alcohol  abuse,  radical  socioeconomic  and  political
transition, repeat victimisation risks and the impact of HIV/Aids on  crime.
The profile, however, only tells us the what, where, when  and  the  how  of
crime. It not only gives us an indication of the immense  problem  faced  by
ourselves in South Africa, but also the police.

Since the adoption of the National Crime Prevention Strategy  in  2000,  the
police have launched major law enforcement  projects  and  other  programmes
intended to improve the overall functions of the  criminal  justice  system.
There are also  crime  prevention  programmes  aimed  at  complementing  law
enforcement. The social  crime  prevention  unit,  which  is  one  of  them,
continues to  focus  on  building  community  policing  and  community-based
partnerships for crime prevention with stakeholders in Government and  civil
society. Policing tools like sector policing play a  role  in  this  regard,
but the service  has  also  developed  resource  manuals  to  support  crime
prevention partnerships,  with  information  like  the  designing  of  safer
places and  manuals  for  crime  prevention  through  environmental  design.
Programmes that improve service delivery  such  as  the  victim  empowerment
programmes are cornerstones of crime prevention  as  they  build  trust  and
confidence in the police as a partner in the prevention programmes.

In its social crime prevention  programmes,  police  focus  specifically  on
violence against women and children, recognising  that  cycles  of  violence
that start in the home contribute to intergenerational cycles  of  violence.
Investment in breaking those cycles  of  violence  therefore  has  long-term
benefits. For this reasons the role  of  police  in  dealing  with  domestic
violence should not be underestimated. The correct response  from  a  police
member is not only the enforcement  of  the  law  or  the  criminal  justice
process that will result in the punishment of  the  offender.  Supporting  a
victim and referring her to other social  service  providers  is  important.
Therefore, the police can assist the victim and the  family  to  break  free
early in the cycle of violence.

The police contribute to all three focused areas  of  the  interdepartmental
antirape strategy - prevention programmes for rape, improved  investigations
of rape cases and better services  to  victims.  Victim-friendly  facilities
are of particular benefit  to  victims  of  gender-based  violence  as  they
enable statements of victims to  be  taken  in  privacy  within  a  friendly
environment. In our last financial year, the police provided assistance  for
the establishment of  victim-friendly  facilities  at  143  police  stations
throughout the country. I hope that the 57 police  stations  which  will  be
established in KwaZulu-Natal are constructed in such a  way  that  they  are
friendly so as to enhance the combating of violence against women.  Training
on  generic  victim-friendly  services  and   domestic   violence   services
provision were provided for 2 424  police  members  in  the  past  year.  In
recognition of the continued need to improve the skills  of  police  members
to deal with domestic violence, a comprehensive new  training  programme  is
being finalised and is about to swing into practice.

In its programme  for  children  and  young  people,  the  police  focus  on
reducing the risk of children becoming victims of crime  or  offenders.  The
Captain Crime  Stop  project  for  young  children,  which  I  witnessed  in
Khayelitsha, raises awareness about children's rights  and  how  the  police
can assist them. Other programmes like  adopt-a-cop  is  aimed  at  building
relationships of trust with children,  raising  awareness  about  the  risks
related to crime and assisting school safety activities.

The National Commissioner has initiated pilot projects for  street  children
in Sunnyside and Hillbrow, in conjunction with other departments  and  NGOs.
The programme has realised the  development  of  integrated  community-based
crime prevention strategies in Thohoyandou, uMhlathuzi and KwaDukuza.

The police focus on improving access to policing,  police  service  delivery
and crime prevention as part of  the  integrated  work  plan  of  the  urban
renewal  programme  and  the  integrated   sustainable   rural   development
programme. A crime prevention programme has been  implemented  in  Mdantsane
and Motherwell in the Eastern Cape.  This  is  an  integrated  programme  to
mobilise action  and  encourage  participation  at  community  level  around
strategic crime prevention interventions. As you may be aware, community  or
consensus policing has always been our vision. Police must  be  visible  and
not be involved in ``fire brigade policing''. We want an  integral  approach
where communities are accepted as largely responsible  for  prosecution,  to
lay charges, make statements, testify in our courts and  assist  the  police
with whom they have a relationship of reciprocal control.

However, the role  of  the  community  must  not  be  confused  in  policing
operational matters. Communities cannot be  involved  in  police  databases,
criminal records and finger printing, maintenance of  forensic  laboratories
or specialised crime units such as  organised  crime  or  certain  types  of
public order policing, for obvious reasons.

Over and above our efforts to  concentrate  on  the  generators  of  contact
crime, the police will  intensify  their  efforts  this  year  to  implement
sector policing. The increase in police visibility  not  only  serves  as  a
crime deterrent; it also contributes to an increased feeling of  safety  and
security among communities. Our focus this year will be on  the  63  contact
crime priority areas. This will include implementing sector  policing  plans
based on the profiles of  the  stations,  deploying  sector  policing  teams
during each police shift, establishing partnerships  with  all  role-players
to ensure a multidimensional approach  to  contact  crimes,  and  recruiting
sector policing reservists for each area.

The police have already completed a practical  implementation  model  for  a
sector policing  which  consists  of  examples  taken  from  various  police
stations,  to  serve  as  an  initiator  and  to  enhance   the   successful
implementation of sector policing. The Minister has  indicated  the  example
of  Thembisa.  This  manual  will  form  our  primary  guidelines  for   the
initiative in the 63 areas. At the beginning of  last  year  we  launched  a
voluntary counselling and testing programme contributing  to  identification
and registration on disease management programmes.

Lastly, we realise the increasing need to focus on physical fitness for  the
policewomen and men. We are in the process of establishing physical  fitness
centres in all provinces. This will ensure that we do not  end  up  with  an
obese police force that might not be  able  to  cope  and  deal  with  crime
because of a lack of fitness. Therefore  it  is  a  challenge  also  to  the
communities to say that since the police participate  in  these  programmes,
they would also ensure that they are physically fit.  Only  then  will  they
make sure that in combating crime they are able to chase the  criminals  and
catch them - even if they go down into the deepest hole.  They  will  do  so
because of  their  fitness,  but  it  will  also  contribute  to  a  healthy
community. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr F CACHALIA  (Gauteng):  Chairperson,  the  Chairperson  of  the  National
Council of Provinces,  Minister  and  Deputy  Minister,  colleagues,  it  is
really quite a privilege for me as  a  newly  appointed  MEC  to  have  this
opportunity to address the NCOP for the first time in the  presence  of  the
Minister and the Deputy Minister.

Let me begin with some responses to issues raised by the Minister.  He  must
surely be right to observe that one of our greatest  achievements  over  the
past 10 years - if, for only a moment, we reflect  on  where  we  have  come
from - is the transformation of the Police Service  from  an  instrument  of
the apartheid  state  into  a  Police  Service  that  is  appropriate  in  a
democracy and which serves all the safety concerns of the  citizens  of  the
country. I also concur with the Minister that if we are going to succeed  in
combating the scourge of crime  in  our  country,  it  is  crucial  that  we
mobilise communities as part of that endeavour. When  communities  establish
effective community policing forums,  when  they  provide  the  police  with
information on suspicious activities, when they interact with  their  sector
managers, when they demand street lighting, they are helping the police  not
only to prevent crime, but also to combat  crime.  I  can  confirm  that  in
Tembisa sector policing has played a major role  in  significantly  reducing
the levels of crime in that community.

I am sure, hon Minister, that the people of Mamelodi will  be  very  pleased
to hear you say that that community will receive special attention  when  it
comes to the implementation of social crime prevention programmes. Since  my
appointment, I have visited Mamelodi on three occasions. The  crime  problem
in Mamelodi is very serious and I think a lot can be  done  to  improve  the
functioning of the CPF there and the  service  delivery  of  the  police  in
Mamelodi. I think the people of Gauteng will also be very  pleased  to  hear
the Minister make  particular  mention  of  a  problem  that  we  have  been
experiencing in Gauteng  recently  -  the  placing  of  rocks  on  roads  by
criminals. There  is  the  incident  that  the  Minister  mentioned  at  the
Grassmere Toll Plaza. We have also had  other  incidents  at  the  Buccleuch
Interchange, and the people of Gauteng will be pleased to hear the  Minister
indicate that a  proactive  approach  is  being  adopted  to  prevent  these
problems.

I do want to say to the Minister  that  I  think  that  the  Police  Service
should be  encouraged  to  adopt  a  proactive  approach.  Simply  improving
visible policing in high-risk areas is not a sustainable strategy, and  ways
have to be found to ensure that the SAPS,  the  metro  police,  the  traffic
police  employed  at  provincial  level,  local  government  and  the   road
regulatory  authorities  all  have  a  role  to   play   in   developing   a
comprehensive approach.

I want to  express  in  the  strongest  terms  support  for  the  Minister's
initiatives to introduce  measures  for  stricter  gun  control.  There  can
hardly be any question that one of the main risk factors in the  scourge  of
violent crime that we face in our country is the proliferation of guns.  The
Centre for the Study of Violence and  Reconciliation  recently  published  a
report that showed that there was a connection between  guns  and  the  high
levels of femicide in South Africa, which apparently is  among  the  highest
in the world. There is a high incidence in the use of guns.  Some  of  those
guns, by the way, which are basically responsible for the killing  of  women
in domestic situations, are legal guns. I do think it would have  been  more
helpful in this debate on gun control if the  hon  members  of  the  DA  had
stated very clearly whether  or  not  they  supported  the  policy  and  the
purpose behind this legislation, rather than to  obscure  that  question  by
reliance on process-type arguments, which is  an  indirect  way  of  casting
doubt as to the appropriateness of this legislation.

In the ANC's manifesto there is a strong commitment to combating  crime  and
to creating a safer community, and those commitments have been  incorporated
into the budgets and programmes of provincial governments and  the  national
Government. I think it is quite appropriate  that  we  should  be  concerned
about how the criminal justice system is resourced; that we  should  applaud
the employment of more police officers; and that we should  agree  that  the
steps that we have taken to strengthen our sentencing  laws,  for  instance,
by introducing  mandatory  sentencing;  are  appropriate  responses  to  the
challenge we face of combating violent crime. However, I think  it  is  also
important to recognise, as the President observed,  that  narrowly  punitive
responses are not the answer to the crime problem we face in South Africa.

Surely, one of our commitments must be to reduce, over time,  the  rates  of
arrest and incarceration in our society. What  we  must  recognise  is  that
there is a strong  connection  between  our  developmental  agenda  and  our
safety agenda. When we create jobs, when  we  fight  poverty,  we  are  also
fighting crime. When we provide children with secure families,  with  access
to education, with access to health services; when we attack  child  poverty
- our premier announced recently in his opening address to  the  legislature
a comprehensive programme for alleviating poverty faced  by  children  -  we
are fighting crime, because the research is  clear:  children  who  grow  up
with the necessary support structures are able to avoid crime.

Similarly, we know that imposing criminal sanctions is not the only  way  to
fight against the abuse of women  and  children.  The  economic  and  social
measures which  are  introduced  which  empower  women  to  be  economically
independent of their potential abusers, are also part  of  the  strategy  of
combating the abuse of women in our society. I want to say that  I  am  very
pleased  that  Deputy  Minister  Susan   Shabangu   has   been   given   the
responsibility to focus on social crime prevention.  We  have  to  recognise
that this is an essential and fundamental aspect of our strategy  to  combat
crime.

Finally,  I  would  like  to  make  some  observations  about   co-operative
governance and its relationship to social crime prevention. It seems  to  be
appropriate to make such observations in the National Council of  Provinces,
which is at the centre of the system  of  co-operative  governance  that  we
have created. I am convinced, hon Deputy Minister, that part of our  problem
with social crime prevention is that we tend  to  think,  certainly  in  the
provinces,  of  social  crime  prevention  as  the  responsibility  of   the
department of community safety, but to me it is quite clear  that  the  only
way in which  our  social  crime  prevention  programmes  are  going  to  be
effective, is if they  are  integrated  vertically  across  departments  and
horizontally across the spheres of government.

Local governments have a very important role to play  in  developing  social
crime prevention strategies. Some of the cities in  Gauteng  are  developing
city safety plans. I think one of our challenges is to ensure, certainly  in
the provinces, that we are able to develop  co-operative  arrangements  with
local government to ensure maximum impact of  our  social  crime  prevention
strategies. Could I suggest in  the  presence  of  the  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces - Gauteng can at least claim you  sometimes  -
that the National Council of Provinces is perhaps the  one  area  which  can
really make a contribution to safety issues by strengthening  the  focus  on
co-operative  governance  responses  to  the  challenge  of   social   crime
prevention. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr P MOLOTO (Limpopo): Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy  Ministers  present
here  today,  colleagues  from  other  provinces,  members  of   the   NCOP,
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, this year's anniversary  of  the
Freedom Charter Day, June 26, was launched with a new book called  The  Road
to Democracy. This book, together with other books  such  as  Long  Walk  to
Freedom as said by our President, will help us to address  the  other  goals
of inculcating in the youth a love  for  our  people  and  culture.  Indeed,
these books will help our youth to understand where we come  from,  and  not
to be ignorant of the events that led up to where we are today.

Tomorrow, as we will be drawing to a close of the youth month  of  June,  we
will certainly not be drawing to a close an end of memories of the youth  of
yester-years who donated their youthful bodies to  cushion  the  everlasting
bed for democracy.

The police in Limpopo have taken the centre stage in  service  delivery.  In
his remarks, when presenting the Impumelelo Award in  Cape  Town  in  March,
Comrade Kader Asmal said: ``The cops in Limpopo are not  corpses;  they  are
alive.'' Yes, indeed they are alive! On that day they won a platinum  award,
and thereafter proceeded to win an  international  award  from  the  UN  for
service delivery to the rural areas of our province. [Applause.]

This is a clear indication that they have embraced the democratic agenda  of
our country. The award winning mobile community centre  can  render  at  the
same time  the  following  services:  opening  of  case  dockets,  documents
certification, and at the same time it makes police patrol visible.

The hon Minister,  Comrade  Charles  Nqakula  was  present  at  our  service
delivery  excellence  award  in  March.  Transformation  within  the  police
service was very evident. Two police  stations  that  are  being  headed  by
women scooped the most important awards. This goes to prove,  as  the  court
would say, beyond any reasonable doubt the efficiency and  effectiveness  of
women in a profession long dominated by men.

We also take pride in saying that our initiative of  the  Premier's  Service
Excellence Award Competition is proving  to  be  a  morale  booster  to  the
police officials and a source of inspiration to management.

Whilst we can say that crime in Limpopo has decreased,  we  continue  to  be
deeply disturbed about the continued incidents of contact  crimes.  Many  of
you will remember a horrendous incident that happened at Medingen,  near  to
Tzaneen, when three little girls were killed by  a  man  said  to  be  their
father. Memories of the  Mabeba  girls  -  Mosibudi  (6)  Morongwa  (3)  and
Matshidiso (1) - will always haunt  us  as  a  perpetual  sign  of  violence
against women and children.

These horrendous crimes prompted us  to  commission  the  CSIR  to  research
their root causes. The interim report has since been submitted  to  us,  and
we are entering the stages of implementation.

Related to the incidents of violence against  women  and  children,  is  the
issue  of  firearms  control.  Those  whose  firearms  are  being  used   to
perpetuate violence against  others  should  have  their  licences  revoked.
Recently we had a case of a farmer shooting in full view of other workers  a
person and later claiming that he mistook that person for a baboon.

Earlier on I spoke about the good  work  that  the  police  in  Limpopo  are
doing. We will remember the arrest of the Boeremag  and  the  uncovering  of
their  arms  caches.  The  discovery  and  the  resultant  arrests  of   the
perpetrators transporting the biggest abalone containers is  known.  All  of
the above are milestones in excellent police work.

However,  the  recent  arrest  of  the  mercenaries  in  Zimbabwe  and   the
confiscation  of  a  truck  carrying  illegal  cigarettes   worth   millions
emphasise, especially for our province, the severity of our problems if  the
security at our airports, landing strips and border posts is compromised.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Ministers, MECs  in
the House, my colleagues, ladies and  gentlemen,  I  rise  to  present  this
speech as prepared by my MEC Maureen Modiselle who could not  make  it  here
today. May I also submit her humble apologies.

Deputy Minister  Gillwald  mentioned  in  her  budget  speech  that  current
strategies cannot continue. We already know that the SAPS has over the  past
10 years demonstrated patent improvements in its investigative capacity.  So
too  has  the  National  Prosecuting  Authority   improved   the   rate   of
prosecution, on almost all fronts.

The supply-side pressure on our  department  resulting  from  this  improved
capacity, in both SAPS and NPA, has swelled the number of inmates to  record
levels. To say that the department is under severe pressure  to  accommodate
both  inmates  and  awaiting-trial  detainees  is   an   understatement   of
gargantuan proportions. In a nutshell, we have the capacity  to  accommodate
113 000 inmates and the current prison population stands at 187  000,  which
includes the awaiting-trial detainees population of 53 880. That  is  nearly
one third of the total inmate population.

Crime prevention marks one alternative.  However,  it  is  common  knowledge
that without support, co-ordination and drive, an intervention  will  not  -
with  the  attendant  complexities  of  crime  prevention  which  have  many
stakeholders and are  cross-discipline,  and  with  results  that  are  only
evident over the long term - achieve its true potential.

For too long, we have simply assumed that the SAPS will take the lead.  This
was reinforced through moving the National  Crime-Prevention  Strategy  into
the SAPS. The recent SAPS restructuring  of  crime  prevention  into  a  new
programme entitled ``Visible Policing'' to replace  the  programmes  ``crime
prevention and operational response services'' marks the  final  realisation
that it is not the SAPS that is responsible for  crime  prevention.  Rather,
it is one role-player among many that need to engage in crime prevention.

South  Africa's  current  developmental  paradigm  needs  a  strong   crime-
prevention approach. The alternative is to imprison more  and  more,  unless
we turn the tide. Successful crime prevention requires an understanding  and
prioritisation of the possible causal factors behind the main crime  threats
facing a particular locality. Around these, an intervention  strategy  needs
to be developed, taking into consideration existing efforts and  identifying
gaps. Progress needs to be measured and evaluated and the necessary  changes
effected. All  these  need  to  be  underpinned  by  a  partnership  of  the
involvement of service providers and beneficiaries.

The entire process needs to be focused. Ideally, this needs to be  happening
within an institution that is sustainable. As crime  prevention  takes  time
to show results, it has the stature and authority to  attract  new  partners
and keep them focused on and committed to the  task  in  an  environment  of
competing political needs. It should be located at an efficient local  level
in order to maximise impact. Local municipalities must meet  most  of  these
criteria.

To  promote  crime  prevention,  some  of  the  following  issues   can   be
considered. The resource allocation to crime prevention remains limited  and
completely overshadowed by that allocated to reactive  responses  to  crime.
Government can support both  civil  society,  as  well  as  crime-prevention
activities of departments themselves.  Many  departments  can  make  a  huge
impact  by  undertaking  crime-prevention  actions  within  their  own  core
mandates. The idea of  a  crime-prevention  centre  -  be  it  at  national,
provincial or local  level  that  will  offer  support  through  monitoring,
evaluation, and  training  and  development  -  needs  to  be  pursued.  The
importance  of   knowledge-based   intervention,   proper   monitoring   and
evaluation  cannot  be  underestimated.  South  Africa  needs  to  document,
evaluate, disseminate and build on best practices.  The  state  can  play  a
crucial role of facilitating, co-ordinating and providing resources.

Careful evaluation  and  support  of  the  integrated  development  planning
process, IDP, in terms of the extent  to  which  it  promotes  a  safer  and
secure community, is important;  so  too  is  support  of  multi-stakeholder
partnerships.  Legislative  framework  mechanisms  aimed   at   facilitating
interaction between spheres of government, in the form of  intergovernmental
forums which  can  add  value  to  an  IDP  infrastructure  -  such  as  the
intergovernmental relations Bill - need to be pursued and promoted.

Alcohol and crime represent a particular nexus and a  number  of  prevention
interventions can be considered. Provincial legislation needs to be  put  in
place and the national drug master plan needs to be  reinvigorated.  It  was
stated that a dedicated person needs to be appointed  at  provincial  level,
and that such a person would deal specifically with substance abuse and  co-
ordinate activities of different departments.

Clear strategies on how to use  tax  resources  such  as  those  applied  in
Australia need to  be  considered.  There,  alcohol  taxes  go  into  skills
training and a whole range of initiatives, such as  school-based  programmes
and programmes that address domestic violence. Interventions  are  carefully
monitored and evaluated for impact against set targets.

Regarding departments and crime prevention, the following issues need to  be
taken  into  consideration.  Strengthening  law-enforcement   capacity   and
approaches can contribute to effectiveness and  speedier  turnaround  times.
Confidence  needs  to  be  built  and  this  will  help  contribute  towards
deterring crime. There should be a prioritisation  of  cases  ie  detectives
need to be allocated to highly solvable cases. There  is  a  need  for  more
extensive and regular analysis of impact of different strategies.  Proactive
strategies such as targeted patrols, sector  policing,  and  problem-solving
policing need to be strengthened. An  awareness  of  diversion  options  for
minor offences needs to be developed. A relationship with local  authorities
should be built to improve the flow  of  information  in  order  to  develop
appropriate responses.

There should be improved efficiency in the justice sector.  The  skills  and
capacity of court staff should be improved. The Child  Justice  Bill  should
be implemented and extended to all provinces. The criminal  justice  process
time should be reduced. There should be collaboration  with  other  criminal
justice system partners; and an effective  and  appropriate  justice  system
needs to be implemented.

There  needs  to  be  promotion  and  support  of   research   on   offender
reintegration. The impact of imprisonment regarding communities  has  to  be
considered. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr Z C NTULI: Chair, hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon  MECs,  hon
members, on 28 March 1996, Comrade President Thabo Mbeki had  the  following
to say, and I quote:


  Only through linking our collective resources, and through maximising the
  synergy of combined actions, will we be able to effect the  socioeconomic
  changes our society requires.

The core feature  of  the  people's  contract  is  to  get  our  Government,
together with our people, working towards a better life  for  all,  hand  in
hand, our people participating in changing their lives for the better.

The  Department  of  Safety  and  Security  cannot  be  isolated  from  this
approach. We have the responsibility to make many of our people more  active
in the justice system. It greatly  helps  that  NGOs,  traditional  leaders,
municipal structures, the business fraternity,  religious  leaders  and  the
youth -  through  community  policing  forums  -  consider  crime-prevention
campaigns as a responsibility for us all. In doing so, we shall  succeed  in
providing community services to improve the  effectiveness  of  our  justice
system. Community police forums play an important  role  in  mobilising  the
people  against  crime,  and  bridging   the   communication   gap   between
communities and the police services.

The building of a peaceful and stable democracy in South Africa is  hampered
by the excessive prevalence of guns - both licensed and unlicensed - in  the
hands of citizens. This is a legacy of the conflict  of  the  past  and  the
lawlessness it engendered, as well as the lack of confidence  in  the  state
security services of the  past.  We  need  to  campaign  for  strong  action
against perpetrators of violent crimes in order to  change  South  Africans'
attitudes towards gun possession and the culture which  encourages  children
to glorify violence and ownership of guns.

Because I come from KwaZulu-Natal,  I  shall  not  have  fairly  represented
voters without mentioning that we need to  ensure  a  speedy  reclaiming  of
weapons distributed by the apartheid regime on a permit system, such as  the
G3s.

Policing must be visible. The reason for promoting a  visible  police  force
is simply that the police must be in  touch  with  their  communities.  They
should  patrol  both  on  foot  and  in  cars,  and  interact   with   their
communities. Police must be welcomed at community  gatherings.  They  should
not lurk in armoured cars or  behind  barbed  wire  garrisons  as  they  did
before. This requires a new emphasis on area  specialists  -  policemen  who
know the community they serve, rather than technical  experts;  an  emphasis
on smaller, accessible police stations, rather  than  large  and  impersonal
fortresses.

Police must be seen, and see themselves as the guardians  of  human  rights,
generally, and the Constitution in particular. Police should be required  to
be politically nonpartisan in the performance of their duties. In  the  long
term, the police must assume the constitutional profile  of  a  guardian  of
the Constitution and not the instrument of any political party. This is  not
to deny the right of any policeman to join a political party or trade  union
of his choice, but it is about placing limits on the political  profile  and
involvement of such a policeman. Local  station  commanders  should  not  be
seen canvassing or holding office in any political party.

Furthermore, the broader policing function  must  be  subjected  to  greater
multiparty scrutiny through the bodies of elected representatives at  local,
regional and national government levels, and it should not  be  the  concern
of only one party. There must  be  reappraisal  and  redirection  of  police
training, not only to educate trainees in more effective  investigative  and
technical skills, but also  in  the  use  of  alternatives  to  violence  in
solving problems and, more generally, on the importance of  human  rights  -
both now and in the future.

Training will be a central component of reform  and  transformation  of  the
police, in place of the correspondence courses currently favoured.  Training
should be skills-based, on the  job  and  it  should  recognise  talent  and
experience rather than certificates. Special attention should  be  given  to
former Bantustan  and  TBVC  areas.  There  still  exist  out  there  police
officers who openly declare political allegiance in the course of  duty  and
that is against the constitutional mandate of the SAPS.

Bekungaba ngcono ukuba usekhona lapha uQabane uBheki  ngoba  ngifuna  ukusho
ukuthi,  laphaya  KwaZulu-Natal,  isekhona   le   nhlese   kumbe   inhlesana
yamaphoyisa asadla ngoludala. Kunamaphoyisa  asacabanga  njengoba  kwakwenza
ama-ZPs, amaPhoyisa akwaZulu.

Ngizokhuluma  ngiqonde  ngqo.  Laphaya  esiteshini  saseMlazi   kunomqondisi
ongakawuboni umehluko wokuthi akuseyona i-ZP lena ekhona manje,  sekuyiSAPS.
Usazishayela nje ngoludala kangangokuthi uma  ukhuluma  naye  uze  akutshele
ukuthi yena uyiliphi iqembu. Uma ngabe uthi uyamkhuza ngokuthi, ``Hhayi  bo,
phela    njengoba    ungumqondisi    lapha,     ungathathi     izinhlangothi
kwezepolitiki'', uye athi uma usho njalo ngeke avote ngoba phela uma  umuntu
engathathi hlangothi kusho ukuthi akavoti. [Uhleko.]

Sithi-ke thina, Ngqongqoshe ohloniphekile, abaphathi abanjenga lona  ophethe
isiteshi  lapha   eMlazi   sebephelelwe   isikhathi.   Kungcono   ashintshwe
Ngqongqoshe, ukuze sibone ukuthi  ngeke  yini  mhlawumbe  ashintshe  indlela
acabanga ngayo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[I wish Comrade Bheki was still here because I want to say that there  is  a
group of policemen in KwaZulu-Natal who are still holding on  to  the  past.
There are policemen who still think like the ZPs, Zulu Police.

If I may say, in uMlazi police station there is a director who has  not  yet
seen the difference between the ZPs and the SAPS. He is still holding on  to
the past in such a way that when you speak to him,  he  even  tells  you  to
which political party he belongs. If you try  to  convince  him  that  as  a
director he cannot take political sides, he says you  mean  he  cannot  vote
because if he is not affiliated to any political party, it  means  one  does
not vote. [Laughter.]

We are saying to the hon Minister that  managers  like  the  one  who  heads
uMlazi police station should have their time lapsed.  It  will  be  for  the
best, Minister, if he is transferred if he cannot change his attitude.]

As the ANC, we regard our municipal police system as  an  important  element
in our plan to extend the policing services  to  the  broadest  spectrum  of
South Africans. We understand the strains under which  they  must  sometimes
work, and that people may not always be co-operative towards them.  However,
when they signed up, they made a commitment to fulfil  their  duties  in  an
impartial and respectful manner. Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy  Minister,  our  hon
MECs and all colleagues, this afternoon I am truly a permanent  delegate.  I
will be presenting this speech on behalf of my hon MEC, Pogisho Phasha,  who
could not make it to this gathering.
Our history has  been  a  bitter  one;  dominated  by  colonialism,  racism,
apartheid, sexism  and  repressive  labour  policies.  The  result  is  that
poverty and degradation  exist  side  by  side  with  modern  cities  and  a
developed mining,  industrial  and  commercial  infrastructure.  Our  income
distribution was racially distorted and  was  ranked  as  one  of  the  most
unequal in the world. Lavish wealth and  abject  poverty  characterised  our
society.

Passionately  and  with  purpose  we   are   focusing   on   restoring   the
socioeconomic imbalances in our society, bringing institutional  reforms  in
the  public  sector,  and  to  entrenching  the  ethos  of  Ubuntu   through
restitutional reforms, redress,  reconciliation,  reconstruction  and  moral
regeneration. Only an all-round effort  to  harness  the  life  experiences,
skills, energies and aspirations of our people will lay the basis for a  new
democratic order free from want, ill-health and fear.

In order to deal with the budget for 2004-05, it would be proper to  outline
some  of  the  successes  attained  that  we  should  jealously  guard,  and
reinforce the gains made thus far. During 2003 the SAPS  in  Mpumalanga  set
specific policing priorities and objectives with regard to  crime,  in  line
with the nationally identified priority crimes. These were organised  crime;
serious and violent crime; crime against women and children; improved  basic
service delivery to all communities and human resources.

There was a  significant  decrease  in  high  profile  cases  of  aggravated
robbery. Hijacking of motor vehicles decreased  by  20,2%  and  bank-related
robberies by 15,4%. Both these categories of crime have reached  the  lowest
levels recorded since 1996-97. Despite these  gains  in  the  fight  against
crime,  some  categories  of  crime  have  shown  increases.  These  include
aggravated robbery and street robbery, especially in  informal  settlements,
former black townships and even rural areas. Added to that are robberies  at
residential and business premises. The contributory factor in  the  increase
in this category of crime can, in part, be attributed to  alcohol  and  drug
abuse.

In keeping with the Government's commitment to enhance its effectiveness  in
reducing crime, we are pleased to announce that the budget of  the  SAPS  in
Mpumalanga for 2004-05 is R222,8 million, effectively an increase  of  R34,3
million from the previous revised baseline allocation of R188,5 million.  An
additional amount of R9,3 million has been allocated for overtime.

An  amount  of  R39,2  million  has  been  earmarked  for  the  purchase  of
approximately 379 vehicles. In addition, 848 officers will be  appointed  in
this financial  year.  The  bulk  of  these  additional  resources  will  be
directed to those areas most in need so that the response time, as  well  as
the aspect of service delivery, can be improved.

Based on the experiences of the past and  the  crime  trends,  the  SAPS  in
Mpumalanga has identified the following strategic priorities for the  medium
term: Firstly, to combat organised crime,  focusing  on  drug  and  fire-arm
trafficking, vehicle theft and hijacking, as well as  commercial  crime  and
corruption among public officials; secondly, serious and violent crime,  for
which  strategies  have  been  developed  to,  among  others,  counter   the
proliferation of firearms, improve safety and security in high crime  areas,
combat crimes such as taxi violence and maintain security  at  major  public
events; thirdly, to focus on strategies to reduce the  incidence  of  crimes
committed against women and children and  improving  the  investigation  and
prosecution of these  crimes  and,  fourthly,  to  improve  overall  service
delivery at police stations.

Policing visibility will be enhanced  by  implementing  sector  policing  as
part of the crime  prevention  strategy  as  a  partnership  between  police
officers,  appointed  sector  management  and  communities.  A   recruitment
process in terms of which funds have been provided to  increase  the  number
of  personnel  will  support  this  approach.  This  labour  input  will  be
complimented by a concomitant expansion of the department's  vehicle  fleet,
equipment supplies and IT infrastructure.

In line with the President's state  of  the  nation  address,  the  SAPS  of
Mpumalanga have committed themselves to arrest  at  least  30  of  the  most
wanted criminals in the first 100 days of our third  democratic  Government.
In due course, we will inform the legislature on the progress made  in  this
regard.

The victim empowerment programme, in  partnership  with  the  department  of
health  and  social  services  and  Business  Against  Crime,   is   a   key
intervention for improving  the  services  to  the  public.  Victim  support
centres are provided to enable statements  of  intimate  violence,  such  as
rape, sexual offences, child abuse and domestic  violence,  to  be  made  in
private. To date, victim support centres have been established in 42 of  our
91 police stations in the province. An additional 10  support  centres  will
be established in the present financial year.

We cannot underestimate the role of communities in identifying the  problems
and challenges in combating and preventing crime. By empowering  communities
through broad-based public education, be it electronic, media or  print,  we
can  promote  the  role  and  responsibility  of  members  of   society   in
complementing all the efforts of the different institutions of the  criminal
justice system and other organs of state.

Public education and the prevention of  crime  are  facilitated  by  various
strategies such as holding anticrime rallies, campaigns at schools  on  drug
abuse, sexual  abuse,  violence  and  illegal  weapons.  Alcohol  and  drugs
provide our youth with a false sense of security. Peer pressure needs to  be
dealt with in partnership with the educational institutions.

In addition, hon members, anticrime school games will  be  encouraged  as  a
means of advocating anticrime messages and  providing  recreation  in  those
areas without infrastructure. Both soccer and netball  will  be  encouraged.
This will be  a  joint  effort  between  the  department  of  education  and
culture, the department of sports and recreation and us.

In conclusion, the call for Africa's renewal, for  an  African  renaissance,
is a  call  to  rebellion.  We  must  rebel  against  the  tyrants  and  the
dictators, those who seek to corrupt our  societies  and  steal  the  wealth
that belongs to our people. We must rebel  against  the  ordinary  criminals
who murder, rape and rob, and conduct war  against  poverty,  ignorance  and
the backwardness of the children of Africa. I thank you.

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, obviously in responding to the debate of this morning and  this
afternoon, one cannot really respond to every single issue raised.  However,
I want to assure members that we have made notes of  the  issues  they  have
raised in respect of the Department of Justice, and we will deal with  every
single one of them in due course. If you want us to give you a report  back,
either in the committee or in a session like this, we will do so. So,  I  am
not going to respond to all of them.

I want to make a few general observations about the challenges  we  face  in
the criminal justice system, because if you look at the  debate  today,  the
underlying theme of the  debate  is  the  problems  we  are  facing  in  the
criminal justice system and how we are trying to address  them.  I  want  to
make a few general observations for us to think about and debate  as  we  go
forward, because if we do not do so and we  only  look  at  specific  little
issues, I think we will lose the broader picture.

I think many debates in  the  criminal  justice  system  results  in  finger
pointing. Things go wrong, in the sense that the police, the  prosecutor  or
someone else has not done their job properly. Of course, that is  a  useless
debate. It does not take us anywhere and it does not solve any problems.  If
you actually check in each individual case,  you  will  probably  find  that
either all of them, or at least half are to blame in  the  process  for  the
kind of problems we face.

Therefore, that kind of response is not going to work anymore. It has to  be
a multidisciplinary response which addresses the systemic problems  that  we
face. That is what Cabinet and Government have been doing more and  more  as
we go along, and it has become more and more successful, and  we  are  doing
so in trying to get this multidisciplinary response to matters.
Therefore, obviously, it is not easy to address  all  of  these  challenges,
but I want to raise a few, just to remind us when we look  at  this  debate.
The first issue is that we keep on forgetting that we are in transition.  We
are a society in transition. You do not have to be  a  genius  to  read  the
literature on societies in transition to see that those types  of  societies
have their own unique problems. In fact, these problems are very similar  in
each of these countries. One of  the  problems  always  arises  within  your
justice system, particularly in your  criminal  justice  system,  because  a
society in transition, of course, is trying to  replace  the  old  with  the
new. In replacing the old with the new, of course, it  creates  instability,
insecurity and cracks in the system, where things fall  through  the  cracks
sometimes.

That is one of the things we  have  to  realise.  We  are  that  society  in
transition and we are getting better at dealing with  it.  However,  in  the
process, as we are getting stronger and better at  what  we  are  doing,  we
must realise that that is the type of society we are dealing with.  You  are
not dealing here with the United States of America.  So  it  is  useless  to
compare the  things  we  are  doing  here  with  societies  that  have  been
democracies for 300 years. If you want to compare us, compare  us  with  the
United States 300 years ago when it had its revolution. If  you  read  about
that revolution, you will see that it was a society in transition  that  had
enormous problems, perhaps even the exact problems that we  face  now,  only
maybe in a different form. Therefore, the first thing that we have to do  in
our debate, is to recognise that we are a society in transition and that  we
have to find solutions to this society in transition.

Secondly, the  issue  about  the  legislation  that  we  have  passed  is  a
response, and usually it is a harsh and inflexible response, to the kind  of
problems we are facing, which is particularly around crime. So if  you  look
at the bail laws, for example, they are incredibly tough  laws.  If  you  go
and compare them with other bail laws in the world, and although  they  have
been declared to be constitutional, they are incredibly tough  in  terms  of
their putting the onus on the accused in very serious crimes.

Now, what did we think was going to be the response when  we  passed  a  law
like that? The response is fuller prisons. If you look back to when  prisons
started getting  more  and  more  overcrowded  in  terms  of  awaiting-trial
prisoners, it started in 1995, when those laws were passed.  A  year  or  so
after that, the minimum sentence law was passed.  The  consequences  of  our
responding to those laws in the way we did, of course, also created  certain
problems for us in the system. It also creates solutions in the  sense  that
it does keep the worst amongst us in prison for longer periods of time,  but
of course it has a negative spin-off.

Then, the third issue I want to raise is the issue of  management.  I  think
in this society we generally have a problem with  management.  We  have  the
problem in civil society and the private  sector,  and  we  definitely  have
that problem in the public sector. We  should  acknowledge  that,  as  well.
That is not going to change overnight. It  is  not  only  in  terms  of  the
people we have in this country, and here the issue is not black  and  white.
The issue is just a general  problem  we  have.  It  is  also  the  kind  of
management systems that we have in this  country.  We  have  inherited  them
from a system that did not look at empowering and capacitating  people,  and
therefore the management systems that we have are very  bad.  So  management
is a problem.

If  you  come  to  the  criminal  justice  system,  it  even  becomes   more
problematic because it is like a pipe that  runs  across  many  departments.
You cannot have an excellent department and think that  if  you  are  great,
and your department does  everything  correct,  that  the  criminal  justice
system is going to work. At the very least,  all  the  departments  have  to
work together correctly and see how they impact on each other. That  is  the
problem with it. If you  have  management  problems,  that  of  course  gets
exacerbated. Look at the further problems  we  have.  You  can  only  manage
there where the law tells you to manage and where the law  empowers  you  to
do so. The police, for example, have laws that regulate them.  In  terms  of
the law they have a certain way of working and of managing  the  police.  In
justice we have the same when we deal with the prosecutors, and  so  on  and
so on.

Where the problem lies, is where these  structures  work  with  each  other.
That's where we don't have synergy. We don't have  laws,  accountability  or
responsibilities of any kind or nature, because the law doesn't provide  for
that. For example, if the police draft a docket, and then  hand  it  to  the
prosecuting authority, what happens there  in  terms  of  that  relationship
with regards to what you can do and what you can't do, and who you can  hold
responsible and whom you can't, does not exist.

In many societies that  are  older  democracies,  laws  do  not  necessarily
govern those relationships, but conventions do. However,  our  democracy  is
ten years old. We do not have those conventions  yet.  They  haven't  really
developed. Therefore,  it  is  very  important  for  us  to  actually  start
identifying - the Deputy Minister of Correctional Services started  speaking
about it this morning - these synergies between departments  where  we  have
not yet created conventions and so on, to work  together.  She  mentioned  a
simple one - people who are in prison as a result of not being able  to  pay
their bail of R100. There are people like that,  but  then,  of  course,  we
have passed a law a few years  ago,  to  deal  with  people  like  that.  We
created a special mechanism to get them out  of  prison.  A  law  like  that
exists. They should not be in prison. If they are in prison, someone is  not
doing his or her work. The problem there is that that person is  in  prison,
in correctional services, but correctional services do  not  appear  in  the
courts. You need to  create  a  mechanism  whereby  every  week  the  prison
administration identifies persons who could not pay their bail  of  R100  or
R500 and hence should not be in prison in terms of the Act. They  should  be
able  to  have  that  responsibility  and  then  take  those  names  to  the
prosecuting authority.

Someone in the prosecuting authority dealing with those prisons  then  needs
to say that they are going to take these matters to court,  and  so  on.  It
happens in some places. Here in Mitchell's Plain they do that. They  have  a
system that works like that, but the  problem  is  that  this  is  only  one
example. The law exists. We have to create the mechanism  for  every  prison
in this country. So, I can go on and on and give you  examples  of  how  our
departments should be able to sit down and work  out  where  we  touch  upon
each other and what mechanism exists and which do not. I am not saying  that
that is going to solve all the problems, but that will go some way  also  in
creating this.

What you then do with those mechanisms is that you put them in  a  protocol,
a law, or a guideline that everyone has to abide by. What  it  does,  is  it
enables Ministers to actually start managing the process,  because  now,  if
you ask someone why something has not been done,  there  is  a  system  that
shows who was responsible. You can start holding people responsible.

Managers, the ones who are sitting here,  can  actually  start  doing  their
work better because the systems are in place to do so.  Those  are  some  of
the other issues.

I think another issue we need to look at very  seriously,  is  the  kind  of
statistics that we have. Each department has a bit  of  statistics,  and  if
you were to put all of that together, you would be able  to  work  out  much
more scientifically where we should be going, and how we should  be  dealing
with issues. Somehow  statistics  seem  to  be  very  important,  obviously,
because people hold on very tightly to them. They keep them  very  close  to
their chests for some reason.

The point is that we have to  find  a  mechanism  in  the  criminal  justice
system of getting all this information together so that we can  also  arrive
at our decisions much more scientifically. Those are  some  of  the  general
points I wanted to make in this debate,  because  I  think  that  as  we  go
ahead, for us to really start dealing effectively with systemic problems  in
a more systematic way, we will have to start tackling some of these issues.

The issue of security in courts has been raised and this is  a  very  touchy
issue. An issue that we haven't looked  at  is  costing.  It  will  cost  an
enormous amount of money. An audit has already been  done  of  the  security
requirements of the courts. At the moment, the best we can do is to try  and
put as much security at the high-risk courts. Then we  can  proceed  to  the
other courts. Of course, at the high-risk courts we will  have  to  try  and
install machines to see if people have guns on their person, and some  alarm
systems. We will also try and get a company to come and  collect  the  money
at the end of the day, so that people at  the  courts  don't  have  to  keep
money in their pockets. That's what they were doing until a half  year  ago.
They used to carry all the money in their pockets and deposit it at the  end
of the day.

These matters  are  being  dealt  with.  This  year  alone,  we  have  again
allocated R70 million for security in  the  courts,  but  clearly,  this  is
going to be a long-term process to try and create a  whole  security  system
for all our courts and the personnel at those courts.  It  is  going  to  be
problematic and costly. What we will do is to keep on reporting on  how  far
we are and so on.
I also want to respond to one issue raised by one  of  the  members  of  the
opposition, and I am sure that the Minister for Safety  and  Security  could
better respond to this, but I recall that he was not here  this  morning.  I
don't know whether someone has told him that this  issue  had  been  raised,
that is to give more police power at  provincial  level  and  that  this  is
going to be Nirvana, and it is going to solve  all  our  problems.  I  don't
have a doubt that we can debate that issue to  what  extent  that  that  can
happen.  One  thing  I  do  know  is  that  the  nemesis  of  Government  is
fragmentation. The more you fragment Government, the more you have  to  then
create structures to try and counter  the  fragmentation.  What  happens  in
Government then is that we spend our time in  meetings,  not  governing  but
trying to deal with turf issues amongst different structures.

Therefore, if we start allocating more regional powers to the  provinces  in
terms of policing, I seriously think that it will exacerbate the issue  much
more. In fact, we have  tried  it  already.  The  first  two  years  of  our
democracy, we tried it. It was  an  absolute  unmitigated  disaster  of  the
worst kind. That is what happened. If you remember, we had many more  powers
provincially; in fact, the police were under provincial competence  at  that
stage. That is what will happen if we do that. We have to have a very  clear
policing structure in the country. Whether you then specialise and  how  you
do that is a job for the police management.

On the suggestions that were made in  that  debate,  that  somehow  we  must
fragment these powers more, and that this is  going  to  be  a  solution  to
problems, I think I should leave it to the experts  to  respond  further  to
that. As far as I am concerned, on the  issue  of  fragmentation  alone,  it
will be an absolute disaster for us.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Thank  you,  Chairperson,  Minister,  Deputy
Ministers, hon delegates and members. Firstly, I must thank members for  the
support they gave to the budget of the Department of Defence. We  are  in  a
more fortunate  situation  than  the  others  who  made  presentations  this
morning. Nobody really fought with us. Everybody was agreeing  with  us.  In
fact, I  want  to  thank  Chief  Mokoena  for  supporting  the  peacekeeping
missions. It is very important for our people to realise the  importance  of
peacekeeping in the role that we play. People must understand that even  our
economic growth depends on  stability,  not  only  the  stability  of  South
Africa, but also that of the whole region.

We thank you for the support that has been demonstrated this morning.  There
was a statement by Mr Moseki about  the  incident  at  the  Tempe  base.  Of
course he was also advocating that  transformation  be  accelerated  in  the
Department of Defence. I want to assure him that transformation is not  only
going  to  be  accelerated,  it  is  going  to  be  tackled  vigorously  and
aggressively during this term. [Applause.]

We are even going to transform the military legal system. We  want  to  make
sure the soldiers, especially those on the ground, are happy,  so  that  you
do not find a situation where the military legal system is meant  to  choose
between those and others. We want to make sure that when people are  in  the
defence service, they are all treated with the respect they  deserve.  There
was a gentleman from the DA this morning who was  complaining  about  people
who are being recruited by Hamas and other groups for training  outside  the
country. [Interjections.]

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: I am from the Freedom Front. Just a correction.

THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Oh, I am  sorry,  from  the  Freedom  Front.
Sometimes the Freedom Front and the DA are the same to me. [Laughter.]
At the moment we are busy reviewing the  Foreign  Military  Assistance  Act,
with the aim of addressing exactly what the member from  the  Freedom  Front
is talking about, which is to make sure that  we  prevent  our  people  from
getting involved in all these dubious activities, like the one we  have  had
in Zimbabwe. This amendment to the Act is going to  make  sure  that  we  do
everything to prevent South Africans from  getting  involved  in  all  these
foreign dubious military activities. So, the matter is being  addressed.  At
the right time you will definitely be a part of that amendment Act.

There was also talk about the role of the SANDF in  fighting  crime  to  the
extent that there was even a suggestion that  the  soldiers  be  given  some
arresting powers. I first want to state that the role of the  SANDF  is  not
to fight crime. In terms of the Constitution, the primary role of the  SANDF
is to defend and protect the republic, its  territorial  integrity  and  its
people. That is the primary role of the  SANDF.  Of  course,  sometimes  the
President may also, in terms of the Constitution, authorise  the  deployment
of the SANDF in co-operation with the police  service.  However,  even  when
they are deployed, they are there  in  co-operation  with  the  police.  The
soldiers are not trained to combat crime. The  training  is  too  different:
the police are trained to protect, but soldiers are trained to kill and  not
to protect. So I think we should accept that we could not use  the  soldiers
to do the work of the police.

I think there was also the suggestion - and I am happy  that  it  is  coming
from the members and not from the Ministry and the  department  -  that  the
budget of defence must be increased. I think  this  call  is  long  overdue,
especially with our special responsibilities now and with all what  we  want
to do. I am happy when members call  for  the  increase  of  the  budget  of
defence. Lastly, I want to  thank  all  the  people,  especially  those  who
listened to us this morning, those who participated in our debate and  those
who also supported the defence budget. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Chair,  this  morning  I
dealt with most of the issues that I thought related to the  cluster  issues
that particularly impinge on the work that we do. I dealt with  them  fairly
extensively. I only just want to support the  Deputy  Minister  for  Justice
and Constitutional Development in his call for a  clearer  understanding  of
how our integration mechanisms work and to set for ourselves those  specific
frameworks. I think this is very important.

He also made a very  good  point  about  the  sharing  of  information.  Our
statistics must in some way talk to one another. You  will  find  that  some
departments collect statistics on specific issues,  others  collect  others.
When you compare them, there are differences,  because  when  you  see  what
they are measuring, it is not quite a case of comparing apples with  apples.
So we must co-ordinate and share information, firstly, to make sure that  it
speaks to similar issues across departments  and,  secondly,  obviously,  to
strengthen that old homily that information is power. I  would  really  like
to support what he said.

The other very important point is that it does not help to apportion  blame.
That is totally useless. What has to be done is to determine  the  synergies
that need to come together and to  make  the  process  go  forward  for  our
integrated governance model that we have chosen for very specific reasons.

On the issue of gun control,  I  am  going  to  add  my  two  cents'  worth,
although I am not a specialist. This is a very important  issue.  The  point
that was made in yesterday's article is that, in fact, there are two  issues
under gun control. The one point is the circulation  of  illegal  guns,  and
the other is the number of legal guns in the possession of the  citizens  of
this country. The fact that guns are  controlled  and  registered  does  not
necessarily mean that  they  are  safe.  The  combination  with  alcohol  is
lethal. The guns and alcohol combination is dead wives and children.  It  is
a terrible thing, and we have to stop this menace.

Another area in which justice must interface very strongly with  the  Police
Service is to make sure that the protection orders that are issued  go  onto
some sort of central basis so that the police have the ability  to  actually
take guns away, because they know that there is a  protection  order  issued
against somebody who has the potential to be  violent.  We  need  to  really
manage this. I can only say that if there is anything I can  do  to  support
the process, you have my vote on that.

We have to make people understand that guns  are  dangerous  and  that  they
have to be managed very well by their owners. We firmly believe that  people
are able to do this. When there is evidence to suggest that the contrary  is
true, we have to act. We have to act in a co-ordinated manner  or  else  the
women and children of this country will continue to  be  cannon  fodder  for
the gender imbalance that still persists in our society.

I also have to endorse the views of the  MEC  for  safety  and  security  in
Gauteng on the issue of our developmental  agenda.  Our  process  cannot  be
strictly punitive. It has to be about rehabilitation. We  have  to  talk  to
the issues that he spoke to, in that the sentences  in  themselves  are  the
punishment. Serving the sentence must become part of  the  repair  mechanism
that integrates people  into  society.  We  do  that  because  that  is  our
contribution to fighting crime overall, and we must continue to do  that  as
a core mandate for ourselves.

I would like the MEC for safety and security from Gauteng to please take  my
greetings to his predecessor. I mention his  predecessor,  because  I  would
like to warn all the MECs that the 16 days of activism  are  coming  up  and
this requires a lot of planning. One of the things we should be focusing  on
is how we change the behaviours of people in our  society,  male  people  in
particular, men and boys, and also in our own departments.

Are we certain that we are  making  policies  applicable  to  the  whole  of
society? For instance, are our regulations against sexual  harassment  clear
and unequivocal? Are we making sure that the police in our  departments  are
issuing domestic maintenance orders fairly and objectively? Are  our  police
dealing with domestic violence cases in the sensitive and specific way  that
we  require  them  to?  Are  our  Corrections  officials  responding  in  an
appropriate way to the levels of violence  within  our  prisons?  These  are
things that we have to talk about during the 16 days  of  activism,  because
they start here with us, and then we can convey the message through  example
to our communities that interface with us in the service model.
I did raise one thing in the National Assembly that I  want  to  leave  with
the cluster to think about. My view is that Gauteng has  done  a  very  good
shared-services model. I believe that our cluster should maybe look at  ways
of sharing our noncore business, for instance processing salaries. If we  as
a cluster did that in a central hub that serviced  the  departments  in  the
cluster - I have done the numbers a bit - I remain convinced that  we  would
be loosening up operational budget.  We  should  perhaps  think  of  shared-
services models for our clusters in order to loosen and free up  operational
budgets for work outside the department.

Of course, critical to this decision would be  for  the  Department  of  the
Provincial Service and Administration to agree to it and to condone  it,  if
they also thought that it could work. The Gauteng shared-services model  has
been a money saver. It has released resources for their operational  budget,
and it is something we should be bold enough to consider as  a  cluster.  On
that note, I will leave you with that thought. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you very much, Chairperson.  The
first thing I want to do is to also make my own comments on the  point  that
the hon De Lange made with regard to our resistance to the fragmentation  of
the Police Service in this country. In fact, the MECs for  community  safety
and liaison, together with the Deputy Minister and myself, will  be  meeting
at the end of July to look at a number of things where it is  necessary  for
us to begin to consider some policy shifts within the whole ambit of  safety
and security in this country.

We are moving towards the submission of a draft for  consideration  of  what
we will term the safety and security  Act  in  South  Africa,  which  is  in
keeping with the 1996 Constitution. I am sure you are aware that  the  South
African Police Service Act is based  on  the  interim  Constitution  of  our
country, but we are going  to  be  discussing  matters  like  that.  We  are
convinced that we need a clear command and control  system  with  regard  to
policing in this country. It cannot be subjected to  fragmentation  at  all;
otherwise we would have very severe problems if we were to allow for that.

The last time I came to this House I made a plea -  hon  Chairperson,  I  am
sure you remember this, because you were in the Chair that  day  -  which  I
thought was an impassioned plea to members of this  House,  namely  that  we
come to these structures at the behest of our  people.  We  represent  their
interests, and I said on that day that it is our responsibility, all  of  us
who are public representatives, to educate our people in terms  of  all  the
Acts and pieces of legislation that we promulgate from these Houses.  If  we
do not do that, we will come back to this House and make arguments  such  as
those made by the hon Worth, because he has not done  his  work  at  all  in
terms of interaction with the people, if he speaks  the  way  that  he  does
about our Firearms Control Act.

This issue has been part of the public discourse since  1999.  This  is  not
the first time that we are beginning to talk  about  the  implementation  of
the Firearms Control Act. It has been part of our discourse since  1999.  It
was, in fact, started by the National Secretariat for Safety  and  Security.
Afterwards, people came to Parliament for our public hearings,  and  because
this particular Bill was termed controversial, there were  two  sessions  of
public hearings on this particular question, which means we used the  entire
year 2000 for that kind of public engagement.

On 4 April 2001 we promulgated that Act, and we have been implementing  this
Act in phases since that period. So, the first phase started on 1 June  2001
when we implemented some sections. Then on 1 July 2003 we implemented a  big
chunk of those sections. The consequence of  that  implementation  is  that,
amongst  other  things,  we  implemented  section   8   which   deals   with
accreditation. Now, with regard to that accreditation, 285 entities  applied
and they have been properly registered, as well  as  seven  people  who  are
training providers.

Now, at the end of this process, the hon Worth comes to us and says we  must
not promulgate  something  that  we  are  already  implementing.  I  do  not
understand what he is talking about. If he is not  representing  the  people
here and therefore, is oblivious to these  programmes  that  I  was  talking
about of implementation, he will come and speak in that fashion.

I know that there are people who are ignorant; they  do  not  know  what  is
happening in  South  Africa.  You  cannot  blame  it  on  us.  It  is  their
responsibility to learn and understand what is happening  in  South  Africa.
We go on a walkabout, and when they report about our walkabout, they say  we
are attempting to impose the law on people when the law  has  two  weeks  to
come into effect.
What is unfortunate is that there are those whose responsibility  it  is  to
communicate  to  the  public  as  communicators,  who  themselves  are   not
communicating properly. How can any journalist in this country  -  I  was  a
journalist  myself,  I  know  how  journalism  works  -  do  a  story  which
completely exposes your ignorance? How do you work on such  a  story?  If  I
were a journalist, I would say that the genesis of this thing was  in  1999,
unless they do not do any research, and if journalists do not  do  research,
they are not worth the paper that they use to write the stories on.

Chairperson, I ought to  have  indicated  to  this  House  that  the  Deputy
Minister is going to be responsible for the  entire  period  of  our  social
crime prevention.

All the matters that were raised here regarding that matter that was  raised
by the hon Cachalia from Gauteng, for instance, about the way  in  which  we
must work horizontally as departments, and vertically in terms of the  three
spheres of our governance, is correct. She is our vehicle  that  pushes  for
that kind of relationship,  because  there  is  an  understanding  that  you
cannot use pure basic  and  conventional  police  methods  to  fight  social
crime. It is not possible. We, therefore, need to have some partners  as  we
deal with this matter. In the first instance, those partners would be  found
in Government.

The hon Cele from KwaZulu-Natal also raised this  matter  in  terms  of  our
social partners. There are quite a number of these social partners  that  we
work with. He raised, for instance, the  Department  of  Education;  we  are
working with the Department of Education on the  safe  schools  project.  We
are working with them, amongst others, on the implementation  of  our  draft
laws, so we are already working with them there. He  raised  the  matter  of
business; we are working with big business. Business Against  Crime  is  one
of our social partners. There are a number of such civilian structures  with
whom we are working.
Now, the hon Moloto of Limpopo raised the issue of abuse of  our  women  and
children. It is part of  the  responsibility  of  the  Deputy  Minister.  He
raised, for instance, the question of these young infants  who  were  raped.
We need to ensure that as public representatives,  hon  Worth,  we  need  to
work with everybody who is involved in these kinds of programmes for  social
crime prevention, which necessarily must  include  our  mobilisation  behind
the programme of moral regeneration in this country, which  is  led  by  our
Deputy President.

The hon Makgoe of the Free State raised the matter of the youth  in  prison.
The  hon  Gillwald  is  now  working  with  corrections.  I  know  what  her
orientation is with regard to matters like these,  on  questions  of  abuse.
That is why she was talking about the 16 days of activism.  She  is  amongst
those who are really passionate about problems that relate to abuse.

We do want to divest our prison system of  young  people  who  are  detained
there. We are looking at a measure which will ensure that  we  remove  these
children from our prisons and keep them in places  which  will  be  properly
organised for  their  own  safety  and  rehabilitation.  Again,  the  Deputy
Minister is going to be in charge of the programme from the  point  of  view
of safety and security, and will deal with those questions.

I am happy that the hon Mluleki George raised the question  of  peacekeeping
and the support that we are getting regarding  that  matter.  Of  course  he
would get the support from the ANC members here for such a  project  because
it stems directly from the Freedom Charter. You will  find  it  amongst  the
clauses of the Freedom Charter; there will be peace and friendship.

What we meant is that we would not only  secure  South  Africa,  but  ensure
that all the countries on  the  continent  are  also  secure.  That  is  the
responsibility we have because this governing party in this country has  for
many years been working with many people  on  the  international  front  who
assisted us to get to where we are today. We would not  have  been  able  to
move this country to this democratic dispensation we have now if we did  not
have that support.

We are being internationalist, therefore, in our  approach  to  all  matters
that we handle, and will always go  to  countries  that  appeal  to  us  for
assistance. Those who try to shoot this down will speak until the cows  come
home. They are not going to stop us from our  responsibilities.  [Applause.]
Thank you very much to  everybody  who  made  submissions  and  suggestions.
Those suggestions are going to be taken up, and we will  of  course  fashion
programmes around the new issues that you were suggesting.  Thank  you  very
much, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I take this opportunity to  thank  the  hon
Ministers who made their presentations  this  morning  together  with  their
Deputy Ministers. I also want to thank the hon MECs who have  come  all  the
way to give input of their provincial life regarding the issues that are  on
the table. May I promise the hon  Minister  for  Safety  and  Security  that
regarding the issues that we have raised, we in the NCOP  are  going  to  do
more oversight than just looking into the legislation that we have.

We have picked up 753 pieces of legislation  that  have  been  passed  since
1994  to  date.  We  have  to  make  sure  that  those  Acts  are   properly
implemented, which points to the issue that was raised by the hon  Cachalia,
that at some stage we all need to come back here to look at what  it  is  we
have to do to ensure that as  we  speak  in  this  House,  local  government
becomes part of  it;  that  we  have  provincial  governments  and  national
Government in one House, talking about the issues  that  are  affecting  our
people out there. Thank you very much for your participation. This House  is
adjourned.

The House adjourned at 16:50.
