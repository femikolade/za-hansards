  INVITATION TO FORMER PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA AND FORMER PRESIDENT F W DE
               KLERK TO ADDRESS A JOINT SITTING OF PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, welcome and  good  morning.
After yesterday's event, we are excited to come together. When I look at  my
Premier, I know that something was done for women in  Gauteng  to  celebrate
Mother's Day. We welcome you this morning. This sitting has been  called  to
deal with only one matter, and that is the motion which is  printed  on  the
Order Paper in the name of the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Chairperson, hon members, I wish  to
move the draft resolution in the name of the  Chairperson  of  the  National
Council of Provinces, namely:


  That the Council resolves that, with reference to the resolution  adopted
  by the Council at its plenary on 5 May 2004, the resolution be amended by
  the substitution of paragraph (3)(b) with the following:


  (b) subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly, to invite former
       President Nelson Mandela and former President F W de Klerk to address
       a Joint Sitting of the Houses on 10 May, the day of the  inauguration
       of former President Mandela 10 years ago, in order to commemorate  10
       years of a democratic parliament.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! As there is no speakers' list,  I  shall
now put the question. The question is that the motion be agreed to.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to
cast  their  provinces'  votes.  Are  all  delegation  heads   present?   In
accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  an  opportunity  to
make a declaration of vote, if they so wish. We shall now proceed to  voting
on the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in  alphabetical  order  per  province.
Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they  vote  in
favour or against, or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: The Eastern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Free State?

Ms B MARSHOFF: We support it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Gauteng?

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M Shilowa): Siyavuma. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs M N OLIPHANT: Siyayisekela. [We support it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Limpopo?

Kgoshi L M MOKOENA: Re kwana le wona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mpumalanga?

Ms Y N PHOSA: We support it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Northern Cape?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: We support.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: North West?

Ms T R MODISE: We support.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Western Cape?
Ms N NTWANAMBI: We support.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Motion agreed to in terms of section 65 of  the
Constitution.

[Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, on a point of order!

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Watson,  I  was  of  the  opinion  that  the
matter was being dealt with in terms of section 65 of the  Constitution.  It
is the provincial heads who have to  give  a  provincial  mandate,  not  the
political parties.

Mr A WATSON: My delegation was not consulted on whether  we  support  it  or
don't support it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You don't have to be consulted, Mr  Watson.  It
is the province that has to deal with the matter. The resolution comes  from
the province and not from this. You are being  told  the  mandate  from  the
province.

Mr A WATSON: I don't understand you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Watson, can you sit down, please?  That  is
why I said this morning that we have to have a workshop  to  deal  with  the
Rules, and the Constitution, I am sure, so that all of  us  will  understand
how the National Council  of  Provinces  works.  We  are  not  the  National
Assembly, where all political parties have a  voice.  We  have  areas  where
provinces have a role and a responsibility, and this is one of them.  If  it
is a section 75 matter, then it is fine, it can be dealt with per party.

Maybe this would help us, so that we teach  each  one  of  us  here  in  the
Council how we operate in the Council and how the  Rules  operate  here  and
how the Constitution deals with the National Council of  Provinces.  We  are
not rubberstamping, but we have  a  mandate.  Your  party  is  part  of  the
province in Mpumalanga - let me say where you come from. Therefore  that  is
the mandate from the province, and we carry that mandate here.

The Council adjourned at 10:08.
