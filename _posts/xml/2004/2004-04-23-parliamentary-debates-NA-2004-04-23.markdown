                        ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY SPEAKER

The SPEAKER: Honourable Chief Justice Chaskalson, hon President  and  Deputy
President, hon members  of  the  executive,  hon  members  of  the  National
Assembly, guests and members of the public, it is with great  humility  that
I take the Chair as Speaker of the National Assembly. [Applause.]  I'm  sure
you are not surprised.
As Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of South  Africa,  I  am
awed by the  confidence  and  responsibility  bestowed  on  me.  I  will  do
everything in my power to conduct my duties as Speaker in  a  manner  worthy
of the trust expressed by the act of my election.

I wish to take this opportunity to  acknowledge  the  outgoing  Speaker,  Dr
Ginwala, in the gallery. [Applause.] I  intend  to  ensure  that  Parliament
appropriately bids her farewell. In so doing, as  a  people  we  should  not
only thank her for her  contribution,  but  should  also  collectively  take
stock of the road we have travelled. It has been  a  brief  but  intense  10
years. It has been an  historic  time  in  its  groundbreaking,  foundation-
laying achievement.

Dr Ginwala was part of it all. She made an indelible  mark.  Dr  Ginwala,  I
salute you. [Applause.]

Hon members, no doubt most of us are exhausted from the  election  campaign.
However, we have pressing work to fulfil a compelling mandate given  by  the
South African people, who came out in their thousands on 14 April  2004.  So
we need to gear ourselves for a full programme in the weeks ahead.  We  dare
not fail our people.

May I welcome the returning members back to the House. Most  importantly,  I
welcome the new members to this honourable House. Thank you. [Applause.]

                         ELECTION OF DEPUTY SPEAKER

Lindiwe  Mahlangu-Nkabinde  properly  elected  as  Deputy  Speaker  of   the

Mahlangu-Nkabinde on her election as Deputy Speaker.

                     ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY DEPUTY SPEAKER

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,  hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, it's an honour for me  to  address  you  this
morning. I will try by all means not to follow in the steps of  the  Speaker
by crying, but the tears are so close! [Laughter.]

I am humbled and very grateful for the confidence shown and honour  bestowed
on me by this House by appointing me to this prestigious position. I  commit
myself to serve this House and my  country  with  diligence.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

the House.

                     CONGRATULATIONS TO PRESIDENT-ELECT

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the  DA,  I  would
like to congratulate President Thabo Mbeki on his handsome victory.  He  has
received a resounding mandate from the people of South  Africa  to  serve  a
second term as our President. Today we celebrate his  achievement.  We  also
celebrate the way in which the President has come to power as a  consequence
of a free and fair election. [Applause.]

This peaceful convocation in the halls of Parliament honours the  President.
It also honours the entire nation and our  Constitution.  South  Africa,  as
the President has been the first to observe, faces great challenges and  the
President faces great expectations. The gospel of  Luke  teaches  us:  ``For
unto whom much is given, of him much shall be  required;  and  to  whom  men
have committed much, of him they will ask the more.''
The issues that defined the political debate,  Mr  President,  in  the  past
election are the very same issues that will continue  to  define  the  South
African reality in the months and years ahead of your continued  presidency.
I do wish to make it clear that the President will have the full support  of
the DA as he confronts these challenges. We will - and  we  do  sometimes  -
disagree with the ANC ... [Laughter.] ... on how these challenges are to  be
met. We will and do occasionally oppose those policies that we  believe  are
more likely to harm the people than help them. And yet we can  and  we  will
work together, Government and the opposition. We are  rivals,  not  enemies,
for whatever our political differences, we do share the same goals  and  the
same dreams. [Applause.] All of us here today dream of  a  South  Africa  in
which there is food on every table in every home every day. All of us  dream
of a South Africa where no one will live in fear of crime. All of  us  dream
of a South Africa in which no one has to suffer and die from illnesses  that
are preventable and treatable. All of us dream of a South  Africa  in  which
each child has the same opportunities.
The first decade of democracy has ended and the election  of  the  President
today is the heralding of the second. Let us dedicate  this  new  decade  to
the welfare of the people of South Africa. Let us work to  build  a  healthy
relationship between Government and the opposition as well.  And  with  hope
for the future, I would like to extend my hand to President Mbeki,  so  that
as Government and opposition we can honour  our  common  commitment  to  the
Constitution and the people of South Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Hon  Madam  Speaker,  Your  Excellency  the
President and Your Excellency Deputy President, hon members of  the  Cabinet
and hon members of this House, I would like to say that both the IFP  and  I
congratulate the President on his election and wish  him  success  with  his
new Cabinet.

In the remarks I  made  during  our  last  meeting  of  Cabinet  before  the
elections, which were released to the media, I praised President  Mbeki  for
the role he performed in promoting reconciliation  within  our  country  and
internationally. During the past cycle a lot was achieved, and yet much  was
left to be completed.

We are at the beginning of  a  new  cycle  which  holds  both  promises  and
concerns, and we hope that through his leadership the President will  fulfil
the promises and address the concerns of  these  times.  The  President  has
received a powerful mandate from the electorate, which ought to  enable  him
to fulfil the many expectations our people have in respect  of  development,
economic growth and progress.

We also hope that through his leadership, the  Government  will  finally  be
able to resolve the crises of HIV and Aids, crime, unemployment,  corruption
and poverty. The President has received a clear and strong mandate to do  so
and the IFP wishes him success in his endeavours.

For 10 years the  IFP  actually  worked  in  Government  and  throughout  my
campaign I stated that while the glass is half  full,  we  must  acknowledge
that the Government has achieved many wonderful things. We will support  any
effort made to give a  solution  to  these  problems  and  promote  economic
growth and equitably distributed development. Within  the  strength  of  the
mandate received by the President also lies the  inexplicable  concern  that
our democracy may be weakening.

We call on the President to exercise his  maximum  wisdom  and  prudence  to
ensure that our democracy will be strengthened during the next  five  years.
This should include providing centrality into the role to be played by  this
Parliament, as well as ensuring the vitality of political  pluralism  and  a
properly functioning system of checks and balances.

The IFP remains  committed  to  strengthening  our  democracy  and  we  will
support any effort made to this end, while countering any threat  which  the
present situation may pose  to  further  democratic  evolution.  A  Dlamini!
[Hail Dlamini!] [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, my apologies, I keep forgetting  that  I  am
now  the  fourth  largest  political  party  in  this   House.   [Laughter.]
[Applause.] Madam Speaker, hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President  and  hon
members, on behalf of the UDM, allow me to extend my congratulations to  our
newly elected President, President Thabo Mbeki, to  the  presiding  officers
and to each and every member of Parliament.

Today we have also sworn an oath or affirmation that extends  beyond  merely
our separate duties to our constituencies. It extends  beyond  that  to  the
greater good of the entire nation. I  hope  that  whilst  we  represent  our
individual policies and constituencies in the coming  five  years,  we  will
all  remember  that  we  should  be  working  towards  a  greater  and  more
prosperous South Africa.

Once again as a nation we have proven that we will continue to stay true  to
the political miracle that is South Africa post-1994. I hope  that  we  can,
in our various roles, set about the  equally  important  task  of  attaining
true economic and social freedom for all.  Idasa  deserves  recognition  for
their advocacy on political  funding,  which  in  this  election  helped  to
improve the transparency and fairness of donations.

In the same vein I wish to thank the businesses  and  individuals  who  have
contributed to a variety of political parties. The system is still far  from
perfect, but that is an issue for this House to resolve during this term.

In conclusion, hon President,  the  people  have  given  you  and  your  new
executive or would-be new executive a  mandate  to  create  work  and  fight
poverty. We wish you luck and want to assure that we will be there  to  make
sure that this mandate is not betrayed. To  the  outgoing  Cabinet  members,
just these  few  words:  As  a  former  colleague,  we  know  that  you  are
experiencing a lot of stress  at  this  time.  [Laughter.]  If  you  do  not
receive a call before Monday, please do  not  call  the  hon  President:  it
would be too late, and he'll be too busy!

For those of us who will continue as public representatives, the  task  that
awaits us is large and the time is short. It  will  require  dedication  and
hard work. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam  Speaker,  Comrade  President,  Deputy  President,  on
behalf of the ID, the new kids on the block, we wish you well  and  we  want
to congratulate you on your election.  It  is  well-deserved  after  a  good
fight, and it certainly is in the best interests of our country.

The ID looks forward to working with you in the next five  years.  We  would
like to be a constructive, but fearlessly independent  opposition.  We  will
certainly congratulate  the  ANC  when  they  do  well.  We  will  certainly
motivate you to do better, but  although  we  will  not  rejoice  about  the
mistakes when we see things are not going right, we will certainly  want  to
criticise and add value to building South Africa. [Applause.]  That  is  the
mandate that we will bring to the table, to build South Africa.

We certainly want to ensure that we realise  the  constitutional  rights  of
all South Africans. The Constitution is a product that has  emerged  out  of
many years of struggle and certainly the time has come to breathe life  into
that  Constitution.  We  would  like  to  also   ensure   that   all   those
constitutional rights are realised. I also want to congratulate the  Speaker
and the Deputy Speaker on their election today and  I  certainly  also  look
forward to working with them. The next 10 years, Comrade President, must  be
there to strengthen and deepen our democracy, and under your leadership  I'm
sure we will achieve that. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN  SCHALKWYK:  Madam  Speaker,  the  New  NP  supports  President
Mbeki's  election.  Mr  President,  we  will  work  with   you   to   create
opportunities for all our people.

UMongameli uMbeki  nguMongameli  wabantu  bonke.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  Abantsundu
nabamhlophe,  abebala  namNdiya,  amadoda  nabafazi.   [Kwaqhwatywa.]   Siya
kusoloko sisebenzisana ukuqinisekisa ukuba le  minyaka  ilishumi  izayo  iba
ngcono  nangakumbi.  Kufanele  sikwenze   oku   ngenxa   yabantwana   bethu.
[Kwaqhwatywa.](Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[President Mbeki is  the  President  of  everybody.  [Applause.]  Black  and
white, coloured and Indian, men and women. [Applause.] We will  always  work
together to ensure that the next ten years become even better. We should  do
this for the sake of our children. [Applause.]]

Die volgende  paar  weke,  mnr  die  President,  gaan  gekenmerk  word  deur
feesvierings, vierings van ons eerste dekade van vryheid asook van die  nuwe
Regering. Niks moet ons aandag aftrek van hierdie feesvierings nie,  wat  `n
belangrike baken is van wat Suid-Afrikaners van alle gemeenskappe hier  saam
in ons land bereik het. [The next few weeks, Mr President, are going  to  be
characterised by celebrations, celebrating our first decade  of  freedom  as
well as the new Government. Nothing should detract our attention from  these
celebrations, which are an important beacon of what South Africans from  all
communities have achieved together here in our country.]
During the negotiations that started in 1990 we  planted  a  seed  in  South
Africa. At that time it was a seed that sometimes seemed to have  fallen  on
barren ground. In 1994, with our first democratic  elections,  we  began  to
give that seed the water that it needed to grow. With the  adoption  of  our
final Constitution the seed sent out strong roots  into  the  earth  of  our
country and began to reach skyward. By 1999 the seed was  a  strong  sapling
that has today become the solid tree of our  democracy.  Our  South  African
democracy stands as a beacon and a reminder of  how  we've  come  this  far.
This growth was only possible with  the  help  and  participation  of  every
South African community.

We gather now for the first time under the shade of that tree, to  share  in
its fruits and to enjoy the bounty of our  freedom  together.  The  next  10
years in South Africa hold great challenges and even greater  potential  for
all our people. As we move forward, building on what has been  achieved,  we
will strengthen our shared South African patriotism  and  help  to  complete
the process of national reconciliation.
The New NP offers our congratulations to the President on his  election  and
our best wishes for his second term in  office.  To  him  South  Africa  has
entrusted the care of this tree of democracy, and, Mr President, we add  our
assurance that we will assist in nurturing it as it grows  to  even  greater
heights. Thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the  ACDP  I  would  like  to
extend congratulations to the new President, Mr Mbeki, on  his  second  term
in office as the President. [Interjections.] I'm going to address  that  one
later on ... moenie ``worry'' nie! [... do not worry!] [Laughter.]

We are also very happy that the President has set a very good  example  that
other heads of state should follow, by taking  a  principled  stand  not  to
extend his term in office to a third term. We say this because  he  welcomed
the  elections  in  Malawi  and   spoke   against   third-term   presidents.
[Interjections.] Last night, as my wife and I were leaving a restaurant,  we
came across an hon member of Parliament who  seemed  surprised  to  see  me.
Using the Pelindaba slang, he said: ``Kganthe o boile? Ke ne  ke  re  re  go
phiahlantshitse!'' ["Are you back? I thought we had smashed you!'']

I said in reply: ``You can't get rid of me.''

King David once said: ``Unless the Lord had been  my  help,  my  soul  would
soon have settled in silence.'' I thank God for allowing my  colleagues  and
me to be part  of  the  third  democratic  Parliament  that  is  facing  the
challenges of providing solutions to the many problems  facing  our  nation.
As the ACDP we will continue our promotion of solutions  based  on  biblical
principles and trust that our contribution to the  building  of  our  nation
will result in a secure and prosperous  future  for  all  our  children  and
grandchildren. We will continue to be a source of godly wisdom  and  caution
in this House and we'll  give  credit  where  it  is  due  and  constructive
criticism where and when it is due. As the hon Leon correctly said,  we  are
rivals and not enemies.

I wish all the hon members well throughout this term and trust that we  will
together not fall short of satisfying the  needs  and  expectations  of  the
electorate. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, hon President, on behalf of the  FF  Plus  I
want to congratulate President Mbeki on his re-election for a  second  term.
This is something President Bush of the United States  wishes  he'd  already
achieved. He's still busy with that! [Laughter.]

When I look at our recent election results, I see that  the  ANC  grew,  but
they grew only by about 4%. I must inform the President  that  the  FF  Plus
grew by 33% in this House ... [Laughter.] [Applause.]  ...  and  because  of
that growth rate we considered putting up a candidate against  you,  but  we
decided in the end not to do that! [Laughter.]

English is a strange language. In English they say  a  politician  runs  for
nomination, he or she then stands for election and the elected  becomes  the
sitting member. Therefore President Mbeki ran for nomination, he  stood  for
election and now he's become  the  sitting  President,  but  South  Africa's
problems are so serious, we cannot afford to have a sitting president,  sir.
The President must stand up and solve the problems! [Laughter.]  [Applause.]
Thank you, sir!

Reading history I learnt one lesson, and that is that a leader cannot  solve
all the world's problems in one lifetime. You can  only  do  your  best  and
leave a strong base for the next generation to build on. In  the  next  five
years it is important that we tackle South Africa's problems in such  a  way
that we leave a strong base for the next generation of political leaders  to
build  on.  The  decisions  of  this  presidential  term  must  leave  clear
guidelines  for  the  next  generation  on  how  to  address   poverty   and
unemployment, on diversity and the cultural accommodation of all.

Namens die VF Plus  wens  ek  die  President  geluk  met  sy  verkiesing  as
President. Suid-Afrika is nie `n maklike land om te regeer nie. Met 11  tale
en nog meer godsdienste is Suid-Afrika `n gemeenskap van  gemeenskappe.  Dis
belangrik dat ons in die volgende vyf jaar vorder met  oplossings.  Ons  het
genoeg gepraat oor diversiteit. Daar moet nou konkrete goed gebeur  wat  die
verskillende gemeenskappe kan oortuig dat  hier  `n  plek  in  die  son  vir
elkeen is. Ons moet die volgende vyf jaar konkrete riglyne neerl√™ sodat  die
leiers wat n√° president Mbeki kom, nie nodig het om al die debatte oor  taal
en kultuur van vooraf te  voer  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[On behalf of the FF Plus I  want  to  congratulate  the  President  on  his
election as President. South Africa is not an easy country to  govern.  With
11 languages and  even  more  religions  South  Africa  is  a  community  of
communities. It is important for us to make progress with  solutions  within
the next five years. We have talked enough about diversity. Concrete  things
should be happening now  which  will  be  able  to  convince  the  different
communities that there is a place in the sun for everyone. Within  the  next
five years we must lay down concrete guidlines  so  that  President  Mbeki's
successors will not have to engage in all the  debates  about  language  and
culture all over again.]

The FF Plus will be  constructive  in  our  approach.  When  we  agree  with
solutions we'll support the President in solving those problems. As  in  the
past, we'll be critical when we disagree and we'll not be  afraid  to  speak
our minds. The President already knows, as a leader,  that  the  higher  you
climb the mountain, the harder the wind  blows.  I  want  to  conclude  with
advice, and share a quote that means  a  lot  to  me,  with  the  President.
President Abraham Lincoln said:


  If I were to answer all the attacks made on me, this shop might  as  well
  be closed for any business. I do the very best I know how, the very  best
  I can, and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the  end  brings  me
  out right, what is said against me won't amount to anything. If  the  end
  brings me out wrong, then angels swearing  I  was  right  would  make  no
  difference.

Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  Deputy  President,  hon
members, we have just emerged from a successful national election.  We  must
unreservedly thank all South Africans, who have demonstrated to the rest  of
the world that they value their democratic institution  and  its  processes.
Hence they went out in big numbers to exercise  their  constitutional  right
to vote.

Today we are witnessing a special  event,  namely  the  appointment  of  our
country's head of state. As we are about to officially  celebrate  10  years
of  our  democracy,  the  UCDP  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate President Thabo Mbeki on his second term in office. We  believe
and hope that he will execute his mandate  in  the  best  interests  of  the
country as a whole. We wish him well. As the opposition we will continue  to
engage him in a constructive manner that takes  our  country  and  democracy
forward.

Motlotlegi Tautona, a Modimo yo o tletseng tshwaro o go  tlhogonolofatse,  o

(Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[Hon President, let the God of mercy bless you, and give you the  power  and
strength to govern South Africa as a country. When the rain  falls  for  the
saints, it also falls for the wicked. [Applause.]]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President  and  hon
members, I can see that this is a day for diplomacy ... [Laughter.] ...  and
I am not so sure whether I can abide by  the  diplomatic  mood.  [Laughter.]
First of all, I would like to congratulate our eminent  Speaker  and  Deputy
Speaker. The PAC wishes to warmly congratulate President  Thabo  Mbeki  upon
his second term in this national office. The PAC will  co-operate  with  his
Government on all issues in which our policies converge.

In the past we have demonstrated this on matters such as Zimbabwe and  Iraq.
Today I stand here humbled and with deep gratitude to  all  the  voters  who
voted for the PAC -  the  champion  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  the
African people. They believed, against the odds, that the PAC would  prevail
and continue  to  be  their  reliable  servant.  We  have  fought  a  fierce
political battle with hardly any funding. We literally faced  the  tanks  of
the rich with our fists ...  [Laughter.]  ...  and  stones.  We  defied  the
forces of plutocracy, which are determined to  replace  democracy  with  the
government of the rich, for the rich, by the rich. [Laughter.]

Mr President, our country is endowed with enormous wealth  and  enough  land
for everyone. Let our policies be aimed at removing  the  shame  of  a  two-
nation syndrome of the extremely rich ones and the  extremely  poor  others.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] Mr President, once again, the PAC  appeals  to  you,
sir, to see that no former freedom fighters  continue  to  languish  in  the
prisons of this country as ``criminals''. Once  again,  Mr  President,  warm
congratulations and all the best. [Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon President, may I, on  behalf  of  the  MF,
extend to you sir, our heartiest congratulations on your second term.  Madam
Speaker,  to  you  and  the  Deputy  Speaker,  we   extend   our   heartiest
congratulations as well. Malibongwe! [Let it be praised!]

Hon MEMBERS: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The women's name!]

Ms S RAJBALLY: I also convey our heartiest congratulations, especially  from
my leader, Mr A Rajbansi, and the entire MF team, for  your  record-breaking
success in obtaining 70% for the ANC in the elections. [Applause.]

To the ANC, I must say: nathatha amashansi, nathola amamiliyoni.  [You  took
your chances and won millions.] [Applause.] [Laughter.] You have shown  that
you belong to the downtrodden masses of South Africa. You are a  footsoldier
who has his feet firmly on the ground. Sir, the leadership and guidance  you
have given our wonderful country in your  first  five  years  have  built  a
strong foundation for a great future South Africa. The  elections  were,  at
times, quite dirty. You conducted yourself like one of our great  statesmen,
as negative tactics, billboards, radio, the print media and adverts did  not
deter you from the chosen path. [Applause.]

The coming or future generation will thank you  and  our  great  Madiba  for
prompting unity. The MF is one of the parties that responded  to  the  unity
call. For the record, the so-called Indian vote went  strongly  towards  the
MF and the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, for which we thank our community for  their
support and look forward to the same support in  our  by-elections  and  the
local government elections. In the two giant  townships  of  Chatsworth  and
Phoenix, the MF successfully gave our hon  Tony  Leon  a  thrashing  at  the
polls. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

On this day the MF hopes that your call for unity  will  be  heeded  in  the
KwaZulu-Natal area. The MF will always support the call  for  unity  in  our
great South Africa, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. We have a great country,  a
good Government, and we are the envy of the world with  our  standards.  Our
greatest document, our Constitution, builds our country on peace, unity  and
reconciliation. May peace prevail in our beautiful  country  all  the  time.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, the hon the President  of  the  Republic
of South Africa, not every person gets a chance in his life to  congratulate
a President. It is my privilege and honour to  congratulate  you.  Possibly,
this  is  my  last  chance  to  congratulate  a  President  of  a   country.
[Laughter.] [Applause.] On behalf of Azapo, ...

[... we are saying to Mr Thabo Mbeki that we wish him  all  the  success  in
his new term of office. We encourage him to continue doing the good  job  of
leading the nation, as he has done in his  first  term.  We  as  Azapo  will
support you all the way. We are saying, let's  work  together  in  order  to
bring about good results and the development of our nation.]

Hon President, the greatest  challenge  we  have  is  fighting  poverty  and
joblessness. Ndaa. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  PRESIDENT:  Madam  Speaker,   hon   President,   hon   members,
distinguished guests and the people of South Africa,  before  I  say  a  few
words, I would like to say that as I was sitting here  today,  I  remembered
that when we came here to elect the President on the  last  occasion,  there
were 13 parties in this House. As democracy would have it,  after  a  window
opportunity for crossing the floor, the House had  17  parties.  There  were
many voices, some of them were very humorous. [Laughter.] As democracy  will
have it, some of them are missed today. Only 12 parties came back with  what
a warrior would call ingozi nemihuzuko [wounds and  bruises].  But  that  is
the life of democracy.

It gives me great pleasure to address this august House  on  this  wonderful
occasion of the election of our hon President, Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki  as  the
President of the Republic of South  Africa.  It  is  a  wonderful  occasion,
because the election of the President takes place against the background  of
a massive vote of confidence in the ANC  by  the  people  of  South  Africa,
giving it an increased majority on April 14. The overwhelming  mandate  from
the electorate is a display of confidence  not  only  in  the  ANC  and  its
policies, but in its President,  who  has,  over  the  last  five  years  of
leading our country, taken South  Africa  to  greater  heights  through  his
outstanding leadership and commitment to improving the quality  of  life  of
the people of our country, especially the poor and marginalised.

On our election today, Zizi, the representatives  of  the  people  of  South
Africa are reconfirming the confidence that they have in you  and  the  ANC,
because of the manner in which you have led the country  in  working  for  a
better  South  Africa,  a  better  Africa  and  indeed,  a   better   world.
[Applause.] The  massive  mandate  we  have  received  has  humbled  us  and
reminded us of the responsibility we have of accelerating  the  delivery  of
basic needs and services, narrowing the gap between the haves and the  have-
nots and dealing with the issues that were  raised  by  the  people  of  our
country in the massive door-to-door elections campaign we undertook  in  all
corners of the country.

President,  you  heard  them  asking  you  for  jobs,  water,   electricity,
sanitation, proper roads, good education for their children and  many  other
services. In celebrating the 10 years of our  freedom  this  year,  we  look
back with pride at the achievements we have made in a short space  of  time.
We are also filled with great enthusiasm and  vigour  to  work  harder  than
ever before, to continue to undo the legacy of apartheid and colonialism  in
the next decade of freedom.

Through your leadership and previously that of our  icon,  former  President
Madiba, our country has become  a  respected  member  of  the  international
community. Hon President, the celebration of our freedom on the day of  your
inauguration,  27  April,  should  mark  a  further  consolidation  of   our
democracy and a  further  commitment  of  the  people  of  South  Africa  to
continue working together as they have done over the last 10 years, to  make
ours a winning and prosperous nation.

The people have spoken: You are the President of all  the  people  of  South
Africa. Let  me,  therefore,  on  behalf  of  all  our  people,  say  halala
[congratulations], Mzizi!

HON MEMBERS: Halala! [Congratulations!]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Dlamini! Jama! Sijadu! Ngcib'enoboya! Gugu  lamaGwala!
Gqabi! Nomana! Zulu! [Applause.] [Clan names of President Mbeki.]

Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: It is now  my  honour  to  call  upon  the  President-elect  to
address the House. [Applause.]

THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Thank you very much.  Madam  Speaker,  Deputy
Speaker, hon Chief  Justice,  hon  members  of  the  National  Assembly  and
distinguished guests, I would like to thank the hon members for electing  me
to the high post of the President of the Republic. I would also like to  say
thank you very much indeed for the statements of  congratulation  that  have
been made. I have taken note of what the leaders of  our  political  parties
have said concerning their willingness to participate  and  co-operate  with
Government in addressing  the  challenges  that  our  country  faces,  while
maintaining their independence and their right to criticise  and  take  what
they believe are correct positions.

Madam Speaker, I would like to say that I believe  that  the  President  and
the Government should reciprocate those feelings of our  political  parties,
and I think that is what should happen as we  go  into  the  next  term.  My
thanks also go to our Chief Justice, Arthur Chaskalson,  for  convening  our
third democratic National Assembly  ...  [Applause.]  ...  and  guiding  its
proceedings earlier today and this afternoon.

At the same time I am honoured to congratulate you, Madam Speaker  and  your
Deputy, for the privilege  you  have  been  accorded  to  preside  over  the
proceedings  of  this  important  Chamber.  Similarly,  I  am   pleased   to
congratulate the hon members on their election by our  people  to  serve  as
their public representatives, and wish you success in  your  work  over  the
next five years.

I think, Madam Speaker, I must particularly thank  the  hon  Motsoko  Pheko,
the President of the PAC of  Azania,  for  a  highly  diplomatic  statement.
[Laughter.] I trust that the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers  have  heard
what  the  hon  Bantu  Holomisa  said:  please  don't  call  the   President
[Laughter].

During the election campaign,  Madam  Speaker,  all  the  political  parties
represented in this House undertook that if elected to govern  our  country,
they would do many things that would help to  improve  the  quality  of  the
lives of the millions of our people. Together we recognised and spoke  about
the reality that, despite the fact of our hard-won  freedom  and  democracy,
very many of our people continue to lead miserable lives. Together we  spoke
about the challenges of unemployment and  poverty,  of  lives  destroyed  by
disease and crime, of the unfinished work of ending the  racial  and  gender
imbalances that continue to characterise our society, and  of  the  need  to
strive further to achieve the related goals of national  reconciliation  and
social transformation.

I am certain that even those who only experienced the election  campaign  by
watching  its  television  coverage,  could  not  have  missed   the   great
enthusiasm with which the electorate welcomed the opportunity to choose  our
national and provincial legislatures. This was both a vote of confidence  in
our democratic system and a message to  all  of  us  present  here,  of  the
expectations  of  the  masses  of  our  people  that  the  legislatures  and
governments they would vote for would do  everything  necessary  further  to
change their lives for the better.

Whatever anyone and all of us might have said during the election  campaign,
we are aware of our people's sincere appreciation of the changes  that  have
taken place during the last 10 years. That appreciation also tells  us  what
else we need to do to respond to the needs of the people. The fact that  our
country has done what it has, also tells the people that  we  can  do  more.
Indeed, it would be entirely logical and correct that  these  masses  should
expect that we will do even better than in the past,  given  the  experience
we have accumulated over the last decade.

Throughout the election campaign we also tried  to  inspire  the  people  to
participate and involve themselves in the process of the reconstruction  and
development of our country. As in the past, we must  therefore  continue  to
project the  vision  and  actively  encourage  a  people-driven  process  of
change.

Gathered in this House, Madam  Speaker,  is  an  important  segment  of  our
country's  national   leadership.   This   leadership   has   a   continuing
responsibility to ensure that together  we  respond  to  the  needs  of  our
people, about which we all spoke during the election campaign.  We  share  a
common responsibility to encourage our political organisations, as  well  as
inspire and mobilise the  people,  to  join  hands  in  a  popular  national
movement, to speed up the process towards the achievement of the goal  of  a
better life for all our people.

I trust  that  in  addition  to  your  work  as  lawmakers,  you  will  also
contribute to the national effort to ensure  that  we  actually  do  succeed
further to improve the lives  of  our  people.  Equally,  the  national  and
provincial governments that are to be constituted next week  will  have  the
task of ensuring that we achieve faster and better progress in this  regard,
during the imminent first five years of our second decade of democracy.  We,
for our part, will do our best to encourage Government to live  up  to  this
responsibility.
Once more, Madam Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  hon  members  for
electing me as President of the Republic, for the warm statements they  have
made, and look forward to working with you  as  we,  together,  continue  to
serve the people of South Africa as best we can. Thank you very much,  Madam
Speaker. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 14:55.

National Assembly

1.    The Speaker:


     (a)    The President of the Republic  submitted  the  following  letter
         dated 18 March  2004  to  the  Speaker  of  the  National  Assembly
         informing Members of the National Assembly  of  the  employment  of
         the South African National Defence Force:


         EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE  FORCE    IN
         COMPLIANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THE AFRICAN UNION


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that I  authorised  the
         employment of the South  African  National  Defence  Force  (SANDF)
         personnel in fullfilment of the international  obligations  of  the
         Republic of South Africa  towards  the  African  Union  Mission  in
         Comoros.


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of Section 201(2)(c) of the Constitution of the Republic  of  South
         Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996), read  with  section  93  of  the
         Defence Act, 2002 (Act No 42 of 2002).


         A total of 17 SANDF members will be deployed to Comoros to  act  as
         military observers and in  support  of  the  south  African  Police
         Service (SAPS) training effort. The Comoros Nation will be  holding
         Parliamentary elections over the period March to  April  2004.  The
         AU commission has approached member states to contribute  personnel
         to  the  AU  Observer  Mission  during  the  said  elections.   The
         deployment will be as follows:
         Seven military observers comprised of:
         (a)     One Colonel;
         (b)     Two Majors and a Lieutenant Commander;
         (c)     Two Navy Lieutenants;
         (d)     One Non-Commissioned Officer for Operations; and


         11 members in support of the SAPS training effort comprised of:
         (a)     Two French-speaking Interpreters;
         (b)     Two Communication Technicians; and
         (c)     Seven Aircrew members.


         The  SANDF  members  will  be  deployed  throughout  the  electoral
         period, which is expected by the African Union (AU)  to  be  for  a
         maximum period of four months. According to the  AU  practice,  the
         AU will provide return air tickets and daily subsistence  allowance
         of US$ 90 to cover meals, acommodation and incidental  expenses  of
         the seven  military  observers.  Members  will  also  be  paid  the
         standard  Republic  of  South   Africa   allowances   for   foreign
         deployment. The estimated cost for the deployment of  the  military
         obervers is as follows:


         (a)     Republic of South Africa allowance R191 243
         (b)     Reserve Force wages, subsistence and travel allowance R  49
              747 Total estimated cost R240 990


         The Department of Foreign Affairs will be responsible  for  funding
         the Republic of South  Africa  allowances  and  the  Department  of
         Defence will be responsible for the rest of  the  cost  from  their
         current budget allocation.


         The cost for the  11  members  deployed  in  support  of  the  SAPS
         training   effort   will   depend   on   the   actual   operational
         requirements, but is estimated as follows:


         (a)     Preparation and communication R61 728
         (b)     Two support flights, C 130 and Casa 212 Aircraft R960 062
         (c)     Allowances and accommodation R570 647 Total Estimated  Cost
              R1 592 437


         The Department of Foreign Affairs will bear this cost.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National
         Council of Provinces as well as to the Joint Standing Committee  on
         Defence, and wish to request that you bring the  contents  of  this
         report to the notice of the National Assembly.
         Regards


         T M MBEKI
