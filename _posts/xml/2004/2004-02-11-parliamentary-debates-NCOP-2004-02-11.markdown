  APPLICATION BY MONSANTO SA (PTY) LTD TO IMPORT GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT
                            FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the application as published in the Business Day on  19  January
              2004 by Monsanto SA (Pty) Ltd,  to  the  Directorate:  Genetic
              Resources/National Department of Agriculture for a  "commodity
              clearance permit number for transgenetically modified wheat";


       (b)  that in the application Monsanto asks for a  permit  that  would
              allow for the importation of GM wheat  for  human  consumption
              and the manufacture of animal feeds;


       (c)  that nowhere in the world has GM wheat been allowed to be  grown
              commercially and  even  in  the  USA  and  Canada,  regulatory
              approval will take years, if it is ever granted;


       (d)  that South Africa is being asked to take  an  environmental  and
              food safety leap no other country has yet taken;


       (e)  that all applications for GM wheat  worldwide  have  encountered
              technical problems because of its inherent genetic instability
              which means that many unintended consequences to human  health
              and the environment can result;


       (f)  that we have acceded to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety  and
              that the first meeting of  the  parties  will  take  place  in
              Malaysia from 23 - 27 February 2004;


       (g)  that it has become urgent for South Africa  to  revise  its  GMO
              Act, Act 15 of 1997,  and  thus  to  implement  the  Biosafety
              Protocol;


       (h)  that also the African Union has  recommended  that  we  use  the
              African Model Law on Biosafety when implementing our biosafety
              regime ...

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.  Your
motion will be printed in full on the next Order Paper.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      CONGRATULATIONS TO CHARLIZE THERON ON WINNING GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the exceptional honour that befell the  South  African  actress
       Charlize Theron on Sunday, 25 January 2004,  when  she  received  the
       sought-after Golden Globe award for best actress in the film Monster;


  (2) congratulates her on this and wishes her well in her  career  and  in
       the run-up to the Oscar awards;


  (3) notes with pride that she is not afraid to acknowledge in public  her
       origin as a South African; and


  (4) requests her kindly, upon receiving the Oscar or  any  other  similar
       award, to consider also saying a few words in Afrikaans and/or any of
       the other indigenous languages of South Africa.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is  there  any  objection  to  the  motion?  No
objection. The motion is agreed to. I am not quite sure how the  House  will
communicate its desire to the  person  mentioned  in  the  motion,  but  the
motion is agreed to.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                REAFFIRMING OF IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION BY ANC

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon Chair, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ANC has  continuously  reaffirmed  the  importance  of
       education in the further political,  social,  cultural  and  economic
       development of our people;


  (2) further notes that as proof of the commitment of the ANC, expenditure
       on education has remained the largest budgetary item in South  Africa
       over the past decade;
  (3) acknowledges the fact that progress in  education  is  ahead  of  the
       Millennium Development  Goals  and  well  ahead  of  most  comparable
       developing countries; and


  (4) commends the Minister of Education on his  achievements  in  reducing
       the number of unqualified teachers from 74 000 three years ago to  30
       000 and the programmes his Department has put  in  place  to  upgrade
       teachers' qualifications even further.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

     MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS BY DA TO CANVASS VOTES AT EXPENSE OF ANC

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that the ANC rejects as mischievous the diatribe of  DA  leader
       Tony Leon at the launch of his party's election manifesto;


  (2) further notes the desperation with which the DA is trying to convince
       our people that their quality of life has not improved;


  (3) also notes that the DA does not want our people to  believe  that  it
       was the ANC that was responsible for these radical  improvements  and
       that they think that through lies and distortions they can  hide  the
       bankruptcy of their own arguments;


  (4) is of the view that, if the situation of our people prior to 1994  is
       compared with the way we are now living, the conclusion that the  ANC
       has been successful in improving the quality of lives of millions  of
       South Africans is inescapable;


  (5) notes that an even greater majority has given their stamp of approval
       for the ANC during our second democratic elections in 1999;


  (6) also notes that, according to opinion polls, an even greater majority
       intends to do so during the coming elections;


  (7) lastly notes that the ANC believes our people can distinguish between
       lies and objective facts; and


  (8) believes that the best way to assess our Government's performance  is
       not to listen to what others have to say  about  it,  but  rather  to
       measure the impact of its policies and programmes on our own lives.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

                    GOVERNMENT COMMENDED FOR LAND REFORM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I hereby move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that land restitution, tenure reform  and  land  redistribution
       are major policy instruments used by the ANC for alleviating poverty;


  (2) welcomes the fact that in the last decade our ANC-led Government  has
       processed more than 47 500 out of more than 91 000  land  restitution
       claims;


  (3) further notes that these claims involved 810 292  hectares  affecting
       115 504 households with about 606 000 beneficiaries; and


  (4) commends the Government for its commitment to accelerate land reform.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   GOVERNMENT COMMENDED ON ITS SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE
                            MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that millions of rural South Africans  depend  upon  biological
       resources for their day-to-day survival;


  (2) further notes that  access  to  this  "natural  capital"  provides  a
       crucial contribution to  livelihoods,  an  important  buffer  against
       poverty and an opportunity for self-employment;


  (3) acknowledges the contribution of government over the past  decade  to
       ensure a more equitable distribution  of  the  rights  of  access  to
       natural resources; and


  (4) commends in particular our ANC-led  Government's  efforts  to  create
       opportunities  for  local  communities  through  its  community-based
       natural  resource  management  programmes  to  participate   in   the
       planning, control and conservation of natural resources and,  in  the
       process, share in the benefit of these resources.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     A JOURNEY TO FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

THE MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you  very
much, Chairperson and members of this House. Chairperson,  it  was  in  1906
that Pixley ka Isaka Seme wrote, and I quote:


  The brighter day is rising upon Africa. Already I seem to see her  chains
  dissolved, her desert plains red with  harvest,  her  Abyssinia  and  her
  Zululand the seats of science and religion, reflecting the glory  of  the
  rising sun from the spires of their churches and universities. Her  Congo
  and her Gambia whitened with commerce, her crowded cities  sending  forth
  the hum of business, and all  her  sons  employed  in  the  advancing  of
  victories of peace - greater and more abiding than the spoils of war.

As a movement, the ANC  has  been  marching  on  the  road  to  freedom  and
democracy, both within South Africa and throughout our continent  since  its
very founding.

We have seen before us that bright day and we still await the zenith of  its
sun when, in the words of the Freedom Charter of 1955, and I remind us all:


  The people shall govern.
  All national groups shall have equal rights.
  The people shall share in the country's wealth.
  The land shall be shared among those who work it.
  All shall be equal before the law.
  All shall enjoy human rights.
  There shall be work and security.
  The doors of learning and culture shall be opened.
  There shall be houses, security and comfort.
  There shall be peace and friendship.

These are the goals that direct us, and these are the  values  that  sustain
us.

Ons is nou  in  die  tiende  herdenkingsjaar  van  ons  eerste  demokratiese
verkiesing, en dit is gepas dat ons weer kyk  na  die  pad  van  vryheid  en
demokrasie wat ons tot dusver geloop het.

Ja, ons doen 'n terugblik oor 'n terrein waaroor ons beweeg  het.  Maar  ons
kyk ook vorentoe na die pad wat voorlê, 'n pad  met  moordende  passe,  maar
met uitsigte oor valleie heen waar  mens  net  verstom  kan  staan  oor  die
skoonheid en die wonder van hierdie land van ons met sy wye verskeidenheid.

Vryheid en demokrasie - woorde wat geskyn het soos die son in die drome  van
die onderdruktes - dra met hulle verskillende  betekenisse,  afhangende  van
die tyd en konteks waarin ons hulle gebruik. Daar is  diegene  wat  glo  dat
ons vryheid bereik het met ons eerste verkiesing in 1994,  en  dat  dit  die
einde van ons reis na demokrasie was.

Hierdie is 'n vereenvoudigde siening. Ons het dit nie met  'n  wet  van  die
Parlement reggekry om die onregverdighede van die verlede  uit  die  weg  te
vee nie, of die hindernisse  wat  opgesit  is  -  somtyds  is  hulle  bykans
onsigbaar - te vernietig nie. Maar hierdie  onregverdighede  en  hindernisse
sal met ons en ons samelewing wees vir 'n geruime tyd en vir  die  jare  wat
nog voorlê.

Ons oorgang na demokrasie was 'n wonderwerk, maar ons reis het maar  so  pas
begin. En dit is ons mense wat  daardie  wonderwerk  'n  werklikheid  gemaak
het.

Ek is trots om deel te wees van hierdie beweging van  die  ANC  wat  oor  'n
periode van meer as 90 jaar geveg het vir ons vryheid en demokrasie. En  ons
gaan nie nou ophou nie. En vir meer as 90 jaar het ons  die  debat  aan  die
gang gehou oor die terme vryheid en demokrasie, en wat dit werklik  vir  ons
beteken. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We are now commemorating the tenth year of our first  democratic  election,
and it is appropriate for us to take another look at  the  road  to  freedom
and democracy that we have walked thus far.

Yes, we look back on the ground that we  have  covered.  But  we  also  look
forward to the road that lies ahead, a road with murderous mountain  passes,
overlooking valleys that will leave one amazed by the beauty and the  wonder
of this country of ours with its vast diversity.

Freedom and democracy - words that were shining like the sun in  the  dreams
of the oppressed - convey different meanings,  depending  on  the  time  and
context in which we use them. There are those who believe that  we  achieved
our freedom with our first democratic election in 1994, and  that  that  was
the end of our journey to democracy.

This is a simplistic view. With a  single  Act  of  Parliament  we  did  not
manage to wipe away the injustices of the past, or to destroy the  obstacles
- sometimes nearly invisible - that were created. But these  injustices  and
obstacles will remain with us and our society for  a  considerable  time  in
the years to come.

Our transition to democracy was a miracle, but our journey has  just  begun.
And it is our people who have made that miracle a reality.

I am proud to be part of this movement of the ANC who  has  fought  for  our
freedom and democracy over a period of more than 90 years. And we  will  not
stop now. And for more than 90 years we  have  kept  the  debate  about  the
concepts of freedom and democracy, and what it really means to us, alive.]

To us freedom has two aspects. Firstly, it means  freedom  from  oppression;
from degradation and indignity; from poverty and want;  from  prejudice  and
bigotry.

Then there is freedom to fulfil one's potential as a member of  society;  to
associate with whomever one chooses;  to  practise  the  religion  of  one's
choice; to live where one chooses  and  to  exercise  one's  choice  in  the
election of a government.

But unlike our neoliberal colleagues, we believe that  the  freedom  of  the
individual is tempered by  the  consideration  of  the  collective  good  of
society as a whole.

And this is  why  we  protect  the  most  vulnerable  in  our  society  with
legislation that prevents exploitation. This is why  we  implement  policies
to redress the imbalances  of  the  past,  in  the  areas  of  commerce,  of
employment and  wherever  the  disabling  legacy  of  apartheid  leaves  its
deathly pall on the aspirations of our citizens.

For the ANC freedom is not simply  about  voting.  Democracy  is  about  the
voice of people resounding throughout the institutions of our land - in  our
schools, our boardrooms and our state institutions. It is about  building  a
society where the opinions, the needs and the insights of the community  are
respected, and the channels are created for expressing these.

Sedert  1994  het  ons  'n  Grondwet  te  boek  gestel  wat  progressief  en
inspirerend is. Dit word beskou as een van die  mees  gevorderde  grondwette
ter wêreld. Ons suksesse om dienste wat die staat lewer uit te brei  oor  'n
kort bestek van  tyd,  en  ondersteuning  aan  miljoene  verarmde  mense  te
verleen, is sonder gelyke in ons tyd.

Ons het 'n parlementêre stelsel daargestel wat die deelname van diegene  wat
voorheen aan die kantlyn moes sit - en nie net  aan  die  kantlyn  moes  sit
nie, hulle was heeltemal uitgesluit - stelselmatig versterk het.

Ons regering soek ook aktief geleentheid om tussen mense te  beweeg,  en  om
na hulle te luister deur die imbizos,  deur  veeldoelige  gemeenskapsentrums
en ons kiesafdelingskantore. Maar solank as wat daar 'n enkele  honger  kind
in ons land is,  sal  ons  reis  nie  voltooid  wees  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Since 1994 we have put on paper a  Constitution  that  is  progressive  and
inspiring. It is considered one of the most advanced  constitutions  in  the
world. Our successes in expanding the delivery of state  services  within  a
short space of time, and  providing  support  to  millions  of  impoverished
people, have no equal in our time.

We have established a parliamentary system that systematically  strengthened
the participation of those who were previously marginalised - and  not  only
marginalised, but completely excluded.

Our Government is actively looking  for  opportunities  to  be  amongst  the
people,  and  to  listen  to  them  through  imbizos,  through  multipurpose
community centres, and our constituency offices. But as long as there  is  a
single hungry child in our country, our journey will not be complete.]

Chairperson, what must guide us as we march towards deepening democracy  and
freedom? As we march towards it in a real sense, some help can be  found  in
our Constitution, which creates the framework within which all  institutions
of our society function. The Constitution protects our rights from  assault.
It creates the context and system in which our key  institutions  operate  -
our courts, our legislatures and our institutions that protect democracy.

But it is to the state that the Constitution assigns a  specific  role  when
it speaks in section 195 of a development-oriented public  service  -  which
in  1994  was  the  buzz  word  amongst  the   world   experts   in   public
administration and public management.

New public management says -  to  put  it  somewhat  simplistically  -  that
government departments must operate  the  same  way  as  business.  This  is
premised on an assumption  that  business  is  always  more  efficient  than
government and  that  if  we  adopt  business  principles,  government  will
deliver services more efficiently, more effectively, and more  economically.
And this view was promoted by the radical right of the  1980s,  led  by  the
Thatcher and Reagan governments.

In the words of Demetrios Argyriades, Professor  of  Public  Administration,
New York University: ``New Public Management firmly  rejected  (the  concept
of) public or general interest.''

Ronald Reagan in his inaugural address in 1981  said:  ``Government  is  not
the solution to the problem, government is  the  problem.''  Throughout  the
80s, the  most  powerful  nations  of  the  world  sought  to  diminish  the
influence of the state in delivering better lives for people.  And  this  is
what  led  to  drastic  cutbacks  of  services  to  people  and  to  various
distortions. I think we can very clearly say today that, as a  developmental
state, we have learnt that there is no way that  business  can  replace  the
state and that it is the developmental state that will ensure that  services
are delivered to the furthest-flung parts of our country.

If we look at the 10-year review, it  very  clearly  states  that  to  those
areas over which Government had a direct influence, we were able to  deliver
services. And I think the story speaks for itself - the story of  the  South
African democracy and its first 10 years. Many of  us  may  wish  to  forget
that the state maintenance  grant  only  benefited  450  000  children  with
mothers. That grant was there if there was no father - this  father  had  to
vanish.  It  didn't  do  any  good  to  the  family.  It  led   to   greater
fragmentation, because the kids knew that this father  pitched  up  late  at
night when the neighbours didn't see, and disappeared  some  time  later  in
the day when the neighbours went to work and so  on.  [Laughter.]  But  what
was more, the 450 000 who received this grant were  from  particular  racial
groups in our country and the  grant  did  not  reach  the  poorest  20%  of
children in our country, who we are trying to reach with the  child  support
grant.

We had to review and say let's ensure that the service is  accessed  by  the
poorest, but that it must  be  for  the  children.  Now  sometimes  you  put
Government policies in place and there are distortions in the way  they  are
implemented. So what happens at the moment? You have some  young  girls  who
receive this grant, but do not use that  money  for  the  children.  And  we
heard from older people in our communities who  stand  up  in  meetings  and
inform Ministers and the President that this grant  is  not  doing  what  it
should be doing. And I think there's a need for us as  legislators  to  say:
How do we, with all sectors of our society, ensure that the grant does  what
is intended; that the policy as implemented serves as a safety net  for  the
child; and that communities again say, ``every child is my child''? We  will
ensure that there are no distortions. We need to guide  these  young  women,
so that they know that it's not for them, but for the children.

The positive thing is that we now talk about millions of  children  on  this
grant. It's no longer 450 000.  But  there  are  still  areas  that  we  can
improve upon. What we should improve upon is  to  ensure  that  the  service
delivery mechanism functions in a more  effective  way.  ``Efficiency''  and
``effectiveness'' are not terms that are exclusive to  the  private  sector.
They must be part of the Public Service, of the public sector, and  we  must
all make it happen.

I think one would also say that new public management,  as  I  reflected  on
earlier, still prevails in  many  societies,  but  there  is  an  increasing
awareness that values and outcomes must play a central role in  the  way  in
which the state performs its functions.

We in the ANC never chose or sought to sacrifice  the  common  good  at  the
altar of profit, economy or  privatisation.  Yes,  the  Government  must  be
effective and efficient and yes, we  want  to  increase  the  trajectory  of
economic growth. But we must not and will not take our eyes off  the  common
good - the collective wellbeing of our society. To the ANC it is the  people
who elect the Government. We, as public  representatives,  will  fulfil  our
mandate by ensuring that the welfare of many is not lost to the  profits  of
a few.

Today, of course, the name of  business  as  the  model  of  efficiency  and
rectitude is tarnished by the massive scandals  that  scream  out  from  the
headlines - Enron, Parmalat, etc. Maybe there will be  a  little  bit  of  a
review - a view that says don't emulate business.  Look  at  the  principles
effected in a way that is appropriate for a developmental state. But  do  it
in such a way that the public good is never sacrificed.

There are still those amongst the  opposition  who  cry  for  a  lean,  mean
state. They go a little silent during election time because they  know  that
there are more than one million voters out there. But they cry out and  they
also see certain aspects as the panacea for the challenges of our nation.  I
want to state categorically that, as long as the ANC is in  power,  we  will
not seek to create a lean, mean state. What we seek is a state that has  the
ability  to  operate  efficiently  and  effectively  economically,  and   is
dedicated to enhancing the goals of special significance highlighted in  the
Millennium  Declaration.  These  goals  are  peace  and  the  rule  of  law,
development and poverty  eradication,  protecting  our  common  environment,
democracy, good governance and human rights. That's what we look towards.

We know that globalisation has brought in its  wake  a  complex,  integrated
world - a world with  greater  dependencies  and  increasing  imbalances  of
power and ability to negotiate. In this  context  the  state  has  an  ever-
increasing role to provide the enabling environment for economic growth  and
development.  It  must  ensure  that  basic  services  reach   all   people,
particularly the unemployed and the poor. Yes, we  must  streamline  and  in
some instances ensure that  we  rid  the  core  Public  Service  of  certain
functions, as well as ensuring that every  public  servant  is  productively
employed. That's fundamental to us.

But internationally now it  is  recognised  that  the  state  is  a  pivotal
development partner,  working  along  with  the  private  sector  and  civil
society. Ten years ago, as well, ``governance'' was much less used  than  it
is today. And the increased use of the term  ``governance''  indicates  that
good governance is of importance, not only to the state, but  to  all  other
sectors, such as the market, civil society and international  agencies.  But
the emphasis on governance does not mean  that  we  do  not  require  strong
government. We need a public sector that is  capable  of  addressing  market
failures and dysfunctionalities and, in an environment of skewed  allocation
of resources, inequality, huge gaps in income  distribution  and  challenges
of poverty,  is  capable  of  developing  and  implementing  solutions  that
transform the very nature of our society. We  need  constantly  to  question
whether our state machinery is able to rise to this massive challenge.

And we talk about the two - the dual economy. The state needs to respond  in
order to ensure that we are able to handle, manage and ensure  that  nobody,
no one part of the dual economy falls by the wayside. Do we have the  finest
minds, the  strongest  and  most  talented  leaders  forging  ahead  in  the
changing fabric of South African society? Our President in the state of  the
nation address raised the issue of the talent of  leadership  that  we  have
within  our  Public  Service  cadres,  but  also  strongly  pointed  to  the
weaknesses that still persist in many quarters.

Our interventions in the Eastern Cape and our restructuring  processes  have
shown that we are beginning to build a  public  service  that's  capable  of
performing its critical role as the implementors of freedom  and  democracy.
Parliament has a crucial role to play  in  this  regard  in  acting  as  the
custodian of these values of freedom and democracy;  in  being  fearless  in
its  endeavours  to  hold  the  machinery  of  Government  to  account   and
unwaivering in pointing out the shortcomings to the executive.

We in  this  country  have  strongly  adhered  to  the  principles  of  good
governance in  implementing  the  prerequisites  -  the  separation  of  the
legislative, judicial and executive arms of Government, a  free  press,  the
protection of human rights and so  on.  Our  Bill  of  Rights  is  the  most
progressive in the world.

But addressing first-generation rights such as these does not  in  isolation
put food into the stomach of a child, give a roof to a homeless  family,  or
protect the face of a battered wife. We must also focus on the role  of  the
state in  addressing  basic  needs  by  ensuring  that  the  benefits  of  a
democratic state are real to all. And this is part of our long  walk  -  the
walk, the journey to freedom and democracy that we must still walk.

Yes, there's global recognition that the world is more democratic than  ever
before. But it is  also  globally  recognised  that  the  number  of  people
slipping into poverty has increased.  What  value  does  democracy  have  in
itself, if it is accompanied by  hunger,  disease  and  suffering?  We  must
question this. We  must  explore  and  debate  which  particular  models  of
democracy deliver effectively and rapidly.

And there's a growing  discomfort  among  developing  nations  about  single
applications of terms such as ``good  governance''.  One  single  definition
does not allow regional and  local  differences  to  be  reflected,  or  for
indigenous practices to be given due recognition. We cannot simply  apply  a
one-size-fits-all solution to the  range  of  challenges  and  circumstances
facing different countries, different regions  and  different  sectors.  The
United Nations Development Programme, in its study on  capacity  development
recently released, notes, and I quote:


  While the best  global  knowledge  should  be  shared  and  put  to  use,
  developing countries in the end need policy choices  that  are  based  on
  their own development model. They need to be able to make decisions  that
  can be nationally negotiated and agreed on in ways that seriously respect
  stakeholders' rights.

As a member of the ANC I am filled with pride at what we  have  accomplished
in the first 10 years of democracy. But we cannot be  complacent  while  one
child goes about with an  empty  stomach,  while  people  still  suffer  the
degradation of poverty and  the  indignity  of  being  without  work,  while
people are still subjected to racism and so on. We still need  to  walk  the
long journey to true freedom and democracy.

Our debate needs to extend  to  the  nature  of  a  development  model  most
appropriate to South Africa  -  a  complex  nation  that  has  emerged  from
decades of institutionalised oppression.  Should  we  revise  the  model  on
which  our  state  is  constructed  to  address  effectively  our   specific
challenges of  poverty  and  inequality,  whilst  enabling  us  to  play  an
international role?

Should we revise the model that can deliver, in the words of  the  President
in his state of the nation address last week:


  ... greater progress with regard to the  integration  of  our  system  of
  governance, achieving seamless co-operation both  within  and  among  all
  spheres of government ... [that can] consolidate the practice of creating
  public-private partnerships and  building  government-civil  society  co-
  operation, to ensure that we utilise our collective  capacities  to  give
  further impetus to the overall  development  and  transformation  of  our
  country.

Our democratic South African state has been fundamentally transformative  in
changing the legislative framework, addressing macroeconomic  stability  and
eradicating institutionalised  racism  and  inequity.  We've  intervened  in
instances of social need with social grants and subsidies,  with  relief  to
the  most  needy,  and  our  role  with   regard   to   investment,   public
participation and local economic development has been facilitative.

We have drawn citizens directly into policy debates  through  our  community
forums, our imbizos and this House going out into the provinces and  meeting
with people at  grass-roots  level.  Our  parliamentary  processes  and  our
channels for comment and communication have facilitated that. At  the  heart
of the debate which needs to inform our  choices  as  we  enter  the  second
decade of democracy is: How do our institutions of state,  and  the  various
stakeholders that are involved, further develop a sense of  the  appropriate
role of the state and the manner in which we  engage  in  poverty  reduction
and addressing basic needs?

More than ever we live in a connected world. This places its own  particular
set of demands upon  our  resources  -  human  and  capital  -  as  well  as
requiring us to be innovative and  creative  in  seeking  solutions  to  the
problems that beset developing nations. But we are on a journey  to  freedom
and democracy and we're going to complete this journey.  It's  fitting  that
Parliament takes the lead in  stimulating  discussion  on  such  a  critical
topic, for it is Parliament that is the custodian of  our  freedom  and  our
democracy, it is Parliament that holds the executive to account  and  it  is
Parliament that must ask the searching questions and ensure that  Government
fulfils its mandate in delivering to the people to  build  the  better  life
that we promised in 1994.

I remain confident that, with the  support  of  this  House,  the  ANC  will
ensure that the flag of freedom and the torch of democracy  fly  higher  and
burn brighter over our land, our  region  and  our  continent,  because  the
people do govern. Thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson.


  We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world
  to know: that South Africa belongs to all  who  live  in  it,  black  and
  white, and that no government can justly claim  authority  unless  it  is
  based on the will of all the people.

This uncontested and powerful message was issued by  the  People's  Congress
at Kliptown on 26 June 1955. From that day the ANC  never  looked  back.  We
set our own agenda. The aim was to free our people from the heavy chains  of
apartheid. Look where we are today.

Ten years ago, the 11th of February challenged all  South  African  patriots
and political organisations to define their role in the  new  South  Africa.
However, today we  are  presented  with  a  new  task,  which  is  to  judge
ourselves and reflect on the strides  made  and  challenges  encountered  in
creating a better life for all in our first democratic decade.

We managed to achieve our goals, and the target we set to build  one  united
and democratic South Africa has materialised.  As  we  celebrate  our  first
democratic decade,  taking  steps  forward  towards  our  second  democratic
decade and a third term of ANC democratic rule, we  must  assure  all  South
Africans, both black and white, that the  ANC  Government  is  committed  to
fighting poverty and creating more job opportunities. That is what  we  call
``A people's contract to create work and fight poverty''.

During our first decade, amongst other things, we set out to establish  laws
that would protect the dignity of  our  people.  These  laws  also  included
those affecting children, youth, women and  people  with  disabilities,  and
there were other  laws  which  were  meant  to  shatter  racist  and  sexist
apartheid policies.

Last year the people's Government  introduced  the  Children's  Bill,  whose
objective is to ensure that no child is subjected to injustice, be  it  from
the biological parents or whoever, and it also  explains  clearly  the  role
that parents ought to play in the development process of the child.

We have gone further  to  ensure  that  poor  families  with  children,  war
veterans and families taking care  of  children  are  beneficiaries  of  the
social grants. A social grant or pension is no longer seen  as  a  privilege
but as a right. There was a time in this country in which only a section  of
the community received child support grants, to the total exclusion  of  the
majority.

We have inherited a Public Service and a society with scarce  skills.  Human
resource capital and skills development were addressed along  racial  lines.
I do not think you still want  me  to  remind  the  House  of  the  kind  of
education that was introduced in 1953. Better and good education, as we  all
know, was reserved for a chosen few, but look at the situation today.  I  am
happy to note that today we have  a  Public  Service  that  is  accountable,
responsible, manageable, sensible and transformable. Of  course,  there  are
still those few individuals who want to be pushed like wheelbarrows. But  we
have moved, and we're almost there.

As we inherited a corrupt and chaotic Public Service, we had to ensure  that
we uprooted the demon of corruption, and ensure that there was  no  one  who
enriched himself or herself through the Public Service. That is why we  have
a reliable Public Service Commission, anticorruption units and other  bodies
to deal with corrupt tendencies within the state.  We  are  doing  all  this
because we care.

Let us look at our judiciary. There was a time in this country when a  black
magistrate was not supposed to preside over a case in which the accused  was
white. A black police officer would not arrest a white person no matter  how
serious the crime was. Again, we have moved - all that is now  history.  The
transformation  of  our  judiciary  is  remarkable,  thanks   to   the   ANC
Government.

We were able to establish institutions whose  objective  was  to  strengthen
our democracy. We have the Gender  Commission,  the  Public  Protector,  the
Human  Rights  Commission,  the  Youth  Commission,   the   Public   Service
Commission, the National Prosecuting  Authority,  an  independent  judiciary
and many other institutions. These institutions are  meant  to  support  and
defend our democracy, and to  deal  with  specific  matters.  If  there  are
people who cannot see the speed with which the ANC Government is  moving,  I
think their IQs need to be tested.

The task of our Police Service is no longer fighting  freedom  fighters  and
destroying the liberation movements, but fighting crime and  creating  peace
and stability. They are now  able  to  deal  with  new  democratic  societal
challenges and with global challenges. Our police  officers  are  no  longer
seen by communities as enemies, but as  partners  in  fighting  crime.  This
partnership against crime has yielded a good output.

As we continue to better the lives of our people,  let  us  join  hands  and
reflect on what was said by the People's Congress in 1955:


  Let all people who love their people and their country now say, as we say
  here:


  These freedoms we will fight for, side by  side,  throughout  our  lives,
  until we have won our liberty.

I have spoken. Thanks, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  colleagues,  it  is  indeed
nauseating to reflect upon the dungeon days of apartheid  and  the  plethora
of abhorrent legislation that sought to subjugate people of colour and  herd
societies into ghettoes, and denied people  their  basic  human  rights  and
stripped them of their dignity. But the indomitable human  spirit  prevailed
and 14  years  ago  to  this  day,  the  venerable  Nelson  Mandela  emerged
triumphantly  from  Victor  Verster.   And   I   cried.   And   you   cried.
[Interjections.] And  grandmother  and  grandfather  cried.  And  all  South
Africans cried with joy at the unfolding of the drama of triumph over  evil,
signifying the end of the denial of freedom  and  the  arrival  of  the  new
democracy.

One cannot but recall that the same Mr Nelson Mandela, 28 years  previously,
stood in the dock in the Great Synagogue in Pretoria and uttered  defiantly,
in stoic defence of the liberation struggle, and I quote:


  I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which  all
  persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is  the
  ideal which I hope to live for and achieve. But if needs  be,  it  is  an
  ideal for which I am prepared to die.
There is no doubt that there  have  been  many  real  achievements  -  piped
water, electricity, health and education facilities to millions,  especially
in rural areas - and  skilful  management  of  the  economy.  Ten  years  of
democracy is an  achievement  worth  celebrating  and  even  crowing  about.
[Interjections.] But can we ignore the huge potholes of  failure  along  the
road taken in the decade of freedom and democracy?  [Interjections.]  As  we
pause on the threshold of the next decade of  further  freedoms  and  deeper
democracy we cannot wish away the malignant failures such  as  unemployment,
Aids and of course the economic ruins of  Zimbabwe.  Aids  and  unemployment
are wreaking destruction among the poor in our midst.

The President in his state of the nation address  made  scant  reference  to
one of the major themes that have arrested the attention of media  headlines
- the theme of HIV/Aids. One of the major blemishes on  the  ANC  Government
would be that  a  Constitutional  Court  order  was  needed  to  compel  the
Government to begin making available drugs meant  to  stop  transmission  of
the virus from  mother  to  child.  For  quite  a  considerable  period  the
President  and  the  Health  Minister  withdrew  into  a  cocoon  of  denial
regarding the provision of antiretrovirals.

Zimbabwe  remains  the  Government's  biggest  foreign   policy   albatross.
[Interjections.] May I appeal to the Chair for protection?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You may proceed.

Mr N M RAJU: We cannot celebrate freedom and democracy when  our  neighbours
are brutally denied them. [Interjections.] We cannot share  our  freedom  of
speech and communication when our neighbours have their  newspaper  printing
houses   destroyed   or   locked   and   journalists   put   behind    bars.
[Interjections.] We cannot rejoice when  our  neighbours'  children  sit  at
empty tables. [Interjections.]

One of the central themes that took centre stage during the dawn of  freedom
and democracy was  reconciliation  and  reconstruction  -  the  politics  of
accommodation  and   forgiveness,   but   not   forgetfulness.   Truth   and
reconciliation became the keys to unlock the infinite capacity  of  men  and
women to shed antagonistic attitudes and embrace one another  across  colour
and ethnic lines as fellow South Africans. In the  words  of  the  venerable
redeemer, the colossus of forgiveness and redemption, Nelson Mandela, and  I
quote:


  We may never forget but we must forgive. To make peace with an enemy  one
  must work with that enemy and that enemy becomes your partner.

And in the words of that  brave  and  intrepid  defender  of  the  faith  of
Afrikaner hegemony, hon F W de Klerk, who stood before  an  impatient  world
and dared to bring the curtain down on  the  narrow  parochial  ideology  of
apartheid:


  The simple, most important factor which became the driving force  towards
  a totally new dispensation in South Africa was a  fundamental  change  of
  heart. It was  not  a  sudden  change  but  a  process  -  a  process  of
  introspection, of soul-searching, of repentance.

There is no doubt that South Africa has moved into the future with  one  big
leap  forward,  developing  the  politics   of   forgiveness   in   a   more
sophisticated manner than any other  country.  It  now  needs  to  show  how
citizens can be empowered to join in that process at grass  roots  and  help
create  a  multifaith  and  multicultural  society  across  all  the  former
divisions. Only if it can begin to do this may it well  become  one  of  the
key players in the 21st century.

Another important development in the political  scheme  of  things  was  the
attention given to gender equality. More and more South  Africans  began  to
appreciate the importance of treating women as equals, as  equally  powerful
components as their male counterparts. The ANC Government must be  applauded
for their  consistent  elevation  of  women  as  Cabinet  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers and top managers in business and commerce. Why is there no noise?
Over the  years  there  has  been  a  considerable  international  focus  on
strengthening the role of women in  government.  The  Beijing  Platform  for
example, hon Chair, states that without the active  participation  of  women
and the incorporation of women's perspectives at  all  levels  of  decision-
making the goals of equality, development  and  peace  cannot  be  achieved.
[Time expired.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Madam Chair, the 10 years of democracy  in  South  Africa,  I
believe, mark the beginning of a long and turbulent journey to  freedom  and
democracy. The journey to freedom and democracy  is  a  process  that  takes
decades. I believe that only our children's children will enjoy  the  fruits
of such freedom and democracy. Our task right now is to lay the  foundation.
The Batswana people would say it very nicely, namely that mahube a naka  tsa
kgomo [we are still at the beginning phase].

I thank God that I have  been  able  to  be  part  of  this  nation-building
process. I  know  that  having  achieved  the  political  kingdom  does  not
necessarily mean that we have achieved and attained  the  economic  kingdom.
President Nyerere said, when he visited  this  country,  that  we  had  only
taken the office, not yet the power, which tells you  that  between  freedom
and democracy lies power.

As a member of the IFP, looking back over the 10 years, I can  rightly  take
pride in a long string of achievements.  Our  Government  has  completed  an
unprecedented reform of all our laws, ranging from the Constitution to  most
of the regulations implementing the hundreds of  laws  this  Parliament  has
passed, to bring about beneficial change in almost  all  fields  of  social,
economic and cultural activities within our society. If you look  around  in
all our major cities, and in many rural areas, you can see how  an  enormous
amount of physical development has taken place. I am very proud of that.

However, by the same token, we must agree quite  positively  that  we  still
face enormous challenges. We are still the wretched of the  earth,  and  the
tears of our people, even though the sun shines beautifully over  our  land,
are still flowing.

We need to face the challenges of unemployment and  poverty.  The  image  of
squatter camps around our country, and  the  abject  poverty  in  which  our
people live, leave much to be desired. Each of us  in  this  Chamber  drives
past the squatter camps  every  time  we  move  from  the  airport  to  this
Parliament. One wonders how many of us really feel their hearts sinking  and
their guts twisting when we see such a display of horror and despair.

Only through employment will our people achieve equal  dignity  and  freedom
from the enslavement of poverty. A long-term strategy which  addresses  both
the needs of the poor and the expectations of the rich has to be  developed,
otherwise our people will not understand us when  we  talk  of  freedom  and
democracy.

A really new South Africa must be built with the commitment  and  sacrifices
of all, to make it a decent and prosperous place for all. I  agree  with  Mr
Saki Macozoma, as he was quoted in one of the newspapers recently, that  the
economy of this  country  is  still  largely  in  the  hands  of  the  white
minority. Therefore, full, meaningful liberation will not be realised  until
our  people  are  freed  -  both  from  economic  oppression  and  from  the
dehumanising legacy of darkness,  of  the  long  years  of  colonialism  and
apartheid.

What the new light over our land must show right now is  a  nation,  as  our
President usually says, ``busy creating a better  life''.  Although  we  are
still at the end of the beginning, I believe the  indomitable  human  spirit
will triumph. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, dit is met 'n  gevoel  van  groot  dankbaarheid
teenoor ons Hemelse Vader dat ek vandag vir 'n oomblik terugkyk  na  daardie
deel van die reis na vryheid en demokrasie wat ons  reeds  voltooi  het,  en
waarvan ek die voorreg gehad het  om  deel  te  wees,  en  hulde  bring  aan
daardie leiers wat ons weggelei het van die  afgrond  van  'n  vernietigende
burgeroorlog, en ons saam op die reis geneem het na vryheid en demokrasie.

Ek verwys hier spesifiek na voormalige Presidente F W  de  Klerk  en  Nelson
Mandela, wat vandag 14 jaar gelede  vrygelaat  is,  maar  ook  na  President
Thabo Mbeki en Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk  wat  by  hulle  die  leisels
oorgeneem het en ons verder  gelei  het  op  hierdie  pad.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, today, with a feeling of the utmost  gratitude
to our Heavenly Father, I reflect for a moment on that part of  the  journey
to freedom and democracy which we have already completed and of which I  had
the privilege to be a part, and pay tribute to  those  leaders  who  led  us
from the brink of a destructive civil war and who took us with them  on  the
journey to freedom and democracy.

I refer here specifically to former Presidents  F  W  de  Klerk  and  Nelson
Mandela, who was released 14 years ago today, but also  to  President  Thabo
Mbeki and Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk who took over from  them  and  led
us further on this road.]

In his last speech to Parliament as President on 28  February  1994,  former
President De Klerk addressed, with due urgency, issues pertaining to  a  new
constitution for a democratic, nonracial South Africa where minorities  were
assured of their protection in the new dispensation,  and  he  concluded  by
referring to the fact that we had succeeded in bringing  South  Africa  from
the brink of catastrophe and conflict, and said:


  We had succeeded in negotiating a  transitional  Constitution  which  can
  provide the basis for a prosperous and peaceful society, which guarantees
  greater rights and freedom, not only for those  who  previously  did  not
  have the vote, but for all South Africans.

Op 2 Februarie 2004, presies 14  jaar  na  sy  epogmakende  toespraak  op  2
Februarie 1990, het voormalige President De  Klerk  weer  'n  rigtinggewende
toespraak gemaak waartydens hy daarop  wys  dat  ten  spyte  van  die  groot
uitdagings wat ons steeds in die gesig staar ten opsigte  van  die  lys  van
onopgeloste probleme waarvan ons almal bewus is, die positiewe van die  nuwe
Suid-Afrika by verre die huidige probleme oorskadu. Hy sê:


  Dit was deur  onderhandeling  dat  ons  'n  katastrofe  in  hierdie  land
  afgewend het. Dit was omdat ons besluit het om met  mekaar  te  praat  en
  werklik te praat, om op te hou om  op  mekaar  te  skreeu,  maar  oorkant
  mekaar te gaan sit, as geswore vyande daardie tyd, en die waarheid op die
  tafel te sit ...

Hy gaan voort:


  En dit  sal  slegs  deur  onderhandeling  en  dialoog  wees  dat  ons  'n
  gesamentlike visie vir transformasie sal ontwikkel. Doen ons dit nie, dan
  sien ek vir Suid-Afrika 'n donker  pad  van  groeiende  polarisasie,  van
  hernieude rassespanning en van alles wat daarmee gepaard sal gaan.

Hy wys daarop dat aggressie en die ``fight back'' pad die verkeerde  pad  is
wat ons op die glybaan sal plaas terug na die ou Suid-Afrika. Hy gaan  voort
deur te sê: (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[On 2 February 2004, exactly 14 years after his  epoch-making  speech  on  2
February 1990, former President De Klerk again made a directional speech  in
which he pointed out that, in spite of  tremendous  challenges  which  still
are facing us regarding the list of unsolved problems of which  we  all  are
aware, the positive far overshadows the current problems. He said:


  Dit was deur  onderhandeling  dat  ons  'n  katastrofe  in  hierdie  land
  afgewend het. Dit was omdat ons besluit het om met  mekaar  te  praat  en
  werklik te praat, om op te hou om  op  mekaar  te  skreeu,  maar  oorkant
  mekaar te gaan sit, as geswore vyande daardie tyd, en die waarheid op die
  tafel te sit ...

He continued:
  En dit  sal  slegs  deur  onderhandeling  en  dialoog  wees  dat  ons  'n
  gesamentlike visie vir transformasie sal ontwikkel. Doen ons dit nie, dan
  sien ek vir Suid-Afrika 'n donker  pad  van  groeiende  polarisasie,  van
  hernieude rassespanning en van alles wat daarmee gepaard sal gaan.

He pointed out that the road of aggression and ``fight back'', is the  wrong
one, which will put us on a downward slide that will take  us  back  to  the
old South Africa. He continues by saying:]


  I welcome initiatives to return to a more inclusive model that will focus
  on the solution of the great challenges with which our country will  have
  to  wrestle  during  the  coming  decades,   rather   than   on   typical
  confrontation politics.

He gave his full and enthusiastic  support  to  the  co-operation  agreement
between the New NP and the ANC, and said:


  I will vote for the New NP because I want to be represented  by  a  party
  which can make a difference. And the stronger the  New  NP  becomes,  the
  greater that difference will be.

Hy sê [He says]:


  Ek gaan vir die Nuwe NP stem omdat dit 'n ware nie-rassige party  is  wat
  werklik omgee vir almal wat dit ondersteun; ongeag hulle  ras  of  kleur.
  Dit is 'n voorloper-party as dit kom by nie-rassigheid in Suid-Afrika.


  I will vote for the New NP because I support its policies; also where  it
  differs with the ANC on important issues. I will  vote  for  the  New  NP
  because it puts South Africa first.

As Suid-Afrikaners wil ons graag 'n toekoms van hoop skep  vir  ons  en  ons
kinders. Ons kan egter alleen hierin slaag indien ons  in  die  eerste  plek
bereid is om die werklikhede van Suid-Afrika vierkantig in die  oë  te  kyk,
en te verreken in al ons planne om daardie beter toekoms van hoop  te  skep.
Wanneer 'n mens  daardie  werklikhede  verreken,  kan  geen  denkende  Suid-
Afrikaner tog werklik glo dat 'n wit-gedomineerde party regs van die  ANC  -
soos die DA is - ooit daarin sal kan slaag  om  deur  hulle  aggressiewe  en
polariserende tipiese Westminster styl van  opposisiepolitiek  hierdie  land
te regeer nie.

Om hulself voor te hou as 'n alternatiewe regering wat enige oplossings  vir
enige probleme of uitdagings van  Suid-Afrika  kan  bied,  is  eenvoudig  'n
blatante leuen wat daarop gemik is om Suid-Afrikaners  gruwelik  te  mislei.
Hulle kan en sal eenvoudig nooit in enige posisie  wees  om  enige  van  die
menigte beloftes wat hulle nou maak uit te voer nie - al gebeur wat ook al.

Hulle  weet  dit,  maar  desnieteenstaande  gaan  hulle  voort   met   hulle
misleidingsplan. Om net een voorbeeld te noem: hulle kan nie, en  sal  nooit
in 'n posisie wees om een polisiebeampte te ontplooi nie,  maar  hulle  gaan
voort  om  in  hul  propaganda-advertensies  te  beloof  dat  hulle  150 000
polisiebeamptes in ons strate sal ontplooi teen 2007.

In skrille kontras hiermee is die koalisieregering tussen  die  Nuwe  NP  en
die ANC in die Wes-Kaap, soos blyk uit Premier Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  se
openingsrede op Maandag, tans besig om die  aantal  polisiebeamptes  in  die
Wes-Kaap met die hulp van die nasionale regering van 12 000  tot  18 000  te
vermeerder. Die aantal polisiebeamptes in die provinsie is reeds tot  16 000
vermeerder sedert die koalisieregering die  bewind  oorgeneem  het  aan  die
einde van 2001. Tans is hulle op koers om daardie getal  tot  18 000  op  te
stoot teen die einde van hierdie jaar; met ander woorde 'n toename van 50%.

Dit is dan waarom hulle daarin geslaag het om die veiligste  feesseisoen  in
die Wes-Kaap te hê in 'n dekade, met moord wat gedaal het met 34%, roof  met
24% en totale misdaad wat  gedaal  het  met  18,2%.  Die  feite  spreek  vir
hulself. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[As South Africans, we would like to create a future of hope  for  ourselves
and our children. However, we can only succeed  in  doing  this  if  we  are
willing to look the realities of  South  Africa  squarely  in  the  eye  and
acknowledge them in all our plans to create that better future of  hope.  If
we take those realities into account, no thinking South African  can  really
believe that a white-dominated party to the right of the ANC - like  the  DA
-  with  their  aggressive  and  polarising  typical  Westminster  style  of
opposition politics, will ever succeed in governing this country.

To  present  themselves  as  an  alternative  government  that  offers   any
solutions to any problems  or  challenges  of  South  Africa,  is  simply  a
blatant lie which is aimed  at  misleading  South  Africans  horribly.  They
cannot and never will be in any position to realise any of the multitude  of
promises they are now making - no matter what happens.

They know this, but notwithstanding that, they continue with their  plan  of
misleading people. To mention but one example: They cannot  and  will  never
be in a position to deploy a single police  officer,  but  their  propaganda
advertisements continue to promise that they  will  deploy  150  000  police
officers in the streets where we live by 2007.

In sharp contrast with this, the coalition government  between  the  New  NP
and the ANC in the Western Cape, as is apparent from Premier  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk's opening address on Monday, is currently busy, with the  help  of
the national government, increasing the number of  police  officers  in  the
Western Cape from 12 000 to 18 000. The number of  police  officers  in  the
provinces  has  already  been  increased  to  16  000  since  the  coalition
government took over at the end of February  2001.  Currently  they  are  on
course to push that number up to 18 000 by the end of this  year;  in  other
words, an increase of 50%.

That is why they succeeded experiencing  the  safest  festive  season  in  a
decade, with murder declining by 34%, robbery by  24%  and  crime  in  total
declining by 18,2%. The facts speak for themselves.]
We are a diverse society emerging from a divided past. This brings  with  it
huge challenges:  The  issue  of  reconciliation  and  nation-building,  and
joining the rich mosaic of our  cultures,  races,  religions  and  languages
into a united nation where the diversity is not experienced as  a  liability
that needs to be managed, but rather cherished  as  a  national  asset  that
enriches our society.

The New NP has chosen to embrace the spirit of a new  South  Africanism  and
to join the hands of all communities in the  pursuit  of  peace,  prosperity
and harmony amongst diverse cultures, races and religions that make up  this
dynamic South Africa.

The New NP and the ANC have undertaken to work together to create  a  future
of hope for all,  to  strengthen  the  political  centre  of  South  African
politics  and  to  ensure  that  the  future  we  deliver  jointly  will  be
experienced as an exciting, safe and secure future by each and  every  South
African - be they black, white, coloured or Indian.

The minorities, in particular, have for the first time now  been  confronted
with the stark choice between confrontational opposition  with  no  hope  of
assuming power,  where  the  polarising  style  can  only  lead  to  further
isolation and marginalisation from the mainstream of South African  society;
or joining the New NP in taking hands with the majority, and being  part  of
the decision-making processes so as to create a common future  of  hope  for
all, minorities and majority alike.

We can only  walk  this  road  together  if  we  are  able  to  bring  about
reconciliation in this country. We say, let us overcome  our  divided  past.
Let us embrace our common future together in the best interests of  all  our
people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Nksz P C P MAJODINA:  Sihlalo  weekomiti,  mandilibulele  eli  thuba  lokuba
ndithethe apha namhlanje.

Mnu Raju, apha kuseMzantsi Afrika. Xa uMongameli ethetha  nesizwe  soMzantsi
Afrika  akathethi  nesizwe  saseZimbabwe  -  qwaba!  Kufuneka   siwahloniphe
amalungelo amanye amazwe kuba nathi siyafuna awethu amalungelo ahlonitshwe.

Singena kule ngxoxo-mpikiswano namhlanje,  sinezivubeko,  sineenduma  ngenxa
yokuba sasikhe saba  zizicaka.  Oomama  nabantwana  boMzantsi  Afrika  bathi
ngeli xesha, ``siyekeni, asisafuni  kuchukunyiswa  emizimbeni  ngoba  saziva
iinduma  zorhulumente  wangaphambili''.  Umzam'  omhle,  uRhulumente  we-ANC
uwuzamile, ugqatso ulufezile. Abapheli ke ooTomasi abaza kufuna  ukungcikiva
bade baqiniseke ukuba eli  nxeba  liphuma  igazi  ngenene.  Ewe  kaloku,  xa
wawungazange wayazi intlupheko  nokulamba,  uthumela  abaphandi  ukuba  baye
kukubuzela  ukuba  abantu  balamba  njani  na,   uza   kuyithetha   le   nto
uyithethayo.  Umahluko   wawumkhulu,   kodwa   thina   bantu   babecinezelwe
nababeyazi indlala, sithi umahluko mkhulu, inguqu ikhona eMzantsi Afrika.

Ukuphatha ilizwe ke asikuko  ukuphatha  ivenkile  esispaza,  ubone  iswekile
ingekho, ufake ityuwa. Sipheth' ilizwe  apha,  sikhokel'  abantu.  Iinkokeli
zabantu zangena zingqawuza ePalamente ngo-1994, zize  kukhokela,  zingezanga
kuphikisa.

UMgaqo-siseko uyabakhusela  oomama.  Sihleli  sisithi  siyazingca  singabemi
boMzantsi  Afrika.  Bayabhala  abantu  boMzantsi   Afrika   ngabakubonileyo,
bangqine  oko  bakuvileyo,  bekubonile  ke  phofu.  Izibonelelo   kubantwana
ziyinto engazange yenzeka. Uthethile uMphathiswa apha. Abantwana  babesakuba
nezifo kuba babengondlekanga, kodwa namhlanje  akukho  namnye  umntwana  one
``Khwashiyoko'', ngoba uRhulumente uyabondla. Bondle, Thabo Mbeki!

Bayangxola, bathi ungen' uphuma elizweni. Ufanele ukungen' uphuma  elizweni,
kuba ulungiselela  esi  sizwe.  Bafuna  imisebenzi.  Baza  kuyifumana  njani
imisebenzi abantu xa uhleli ngaphakathi? Bathi xa ehamba  uMongameli,  bathi
abamazi ukuba  uya  phi  na.  Abazi  kumazi  ngoba  kaloku  bayahlutha  apha
ezindlwini zabo. [Uwelewele.]

Namhlanje, xa umntu  waselalini  eNtafufu,  umntu  wangaphaya  eSterkspruit,
eHeshele,  evulela  amanzi  empompeni,  ufumana  kuyinto  engazange  yenzeke
kwiminyaka elishumi edlulileyo. Namhlanje uyakwazi  ukuba  angathwali  emele
entloko. Umama namhlanje uyakwazi  ukucofa  umbane,  angahambi  aye  kutheza
iinkuni  ehlathini.  Loo  nto  ke  yenziwe  nguRhulumente  obaziyo   abantu,
nguRhulumente  onika  oomama  isidima,  nguRhulumente  obathandayo   oomama.

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson of Committees, thank for  granting  me  this
opportunity to speak here today.

Mr Raju, this is South Africa. When the hon President  addresses  us  he  is
not addressing the people of Zimbabwe. That is all!  It  is  also  important
that we should respect other countries' rights, as we would like ours to  be
respected.

We begin this debate today as people with scars  as  we  were  once  slaves.
Women and children of South Africa are saying  that  they  do  not  want  to
experience physical abuse like  during  the  apartheid  times.  The  ANC-led
Government has accomplished a good cause.  There  will  always  be  doubting
Thomases that seek only to exploit until blood comes  out.  Indeed,  if  you
never experienced poverty and hunger, and only sent researchers to find  out
about how poverty-stricken people were or are, you would say what  you  just
said. There was discrimination and there existed a  big  difference  between
black people and white people, and we, as those that  were  oppressed,  knew
what hunger was. Yes, there is  a  big  difference  even  now  and  that  is
because there is change in South Africa.

Governing a country is not like managing a spaza  shop,  where  you  can  do
things unsystemically sometimes. Power is in our hands and we are  meant  to
govern, and lead people. When the leaders  of  our  people  came  into  this
Parliament in 1994 they knew that they were  coming  to  play  a  leadership
role, and not to oppose.

The Constitution protects the rights of women. We always claim to  be  proud
to  be  citizens  of  South  Africa.  South  Africans  write   about   their
experiences.  Child  grants  were  never  seen  before.  The  Minister   has
presented  his  speech.  Young  children  used  to  become  very  sick  from
malnutrition but today no child has  been  reported  to  be  suffering  from
kwashiorkor because the Government feeds them. Feed them, Thabo Mbeki!

They say you spend little time attending to  matters  of  the  country.  You
have to go around the world because  you  are  building  relationships  with
other countries so as to help build our country. They want  jobs.  How  will
people get jobs if you remain in the country? When the hon President  leaves
the country, they say they do not know where he is going.  They  will  never
know because they never have to struggle and  are  not  suffering  in  their
homes. [Interjection.]

Today, people from Ntafufu, Sterkspruit and  Herschel  are  among  those  to
whom water is accessible; something that did not exist 10 years  ago.  Today
most people do not have to balance water buckets on their heads.  Today,  my
mother switches on the light and never has to fetch wood  from  the  forest.
That has been made possible by this Government  -  the  Government  that  is
committed to restoring the dignity  of  women;  the  Government  that  loves
women.]

Eya he, ho tshwara mme ke ho tshwara thipa ka bohaleng. Rona ka nako ena  ha
re tshwane le mafura a thokolosi ao e tla reng ha  o  a  tshela  ka  nokeng,
metsi a nyoloha, ona  a  theohe.  [Kena  hanong.]  (Translation  of  Sesotho
paragraph follows.)

You touch a woman, you touch the blade of a sharp knife.  We  mean  what  we
say. [Interjections.]]

Sihlalo, banento ethi siphinda into enye; sasithe amanzi,  sasithe  izindlu.
Siza kuyiphinda nangoku,  kuba  asiguqu-guquki;  Siyayazi  into  esiyifunayo
siyi-ANC.  Lo  gama  abantu  bethu  bengekawafumani  bonke  amanzi,   siseza
kuwaphinda  amanzi,  siseza  kubanika  izindlu  oomama  ukuze  umama  ahlale
endlwini, abe nelungelo, athi ``apha kukwam,  ngeli  xesha''.  NguRhulumente
ophetheyo lowo.

Kukho imithetho eyenziweyo  ejongene  noomama  ngqo.  Siyakwazi  ukuma  apha
namhlanje  singabambelanga  bani,  sime  ngokuba  singoomama,  sinamalungelo
okuma. I-ANC ke iyakhokela ngokubhekisele kuloo mba.  Apha  kweli  lizwekazi
iAfrika, eli lizwe liyakhokela  ekubekeni  oomama  phambili,  ukuze  baziwe,
banikwe isidima nesithozela abasifaneleyo  ngoba  kaloku  oomama  basisiseko
selizwe ngalinye.

Kuya kufuneka ke ukuba umntu ofake izikhuseli-langa  zamehlo  azikhulule  xa
kunethayo,  ngoba  uya  kungaboni.  Siyahamba  thina  nale   nqwelo,   kwaye
ayimanga.  Iqhubela  phambili  inqwelo,  inde.   Sitsho   nesihloko   sithi,
-``Yindlela ende eya enkululekweni''.  Singaphakathi  kule  nkululeko  kwaye
siyilwele. Incwadi yamaGalati, isahluko sesithandathu, ithi:


  Yimani nithi ngxi, ningahexi enkululekweni yenu, ngoba niyilwele.

Namhlanje ke,  Sihlalo,  njengoko  sixhamla  apha,  kukho  abantu  abathetha
kamnandi   bethetha   utyhatyhiwe   ngathi   bakhwele   emqolweni    wehagu.
[Kwahlekwa.]

Abantwana bethu  bondlekile;  abantwana  bethu  bahle;  oomama  bayathandwa;
oomama baziva bekhuselekile ngenxa yemithetho ephunyezwe kule Ndlu.  Abo  ke
bakude  nokulawula  ilizwe,  ngxee  torho!,  kuba  kuthetha   abantu   ukuze
kuphathwe, kukhokelwa abantu ngumntu olandela inkqubo  ethile.  Ukuba  ngaba
awunayo  inkqubo  oyilandelayo  awunakuze  ubakhokele  abantu.  Ukuba  ngaba
awunayo  inkqubo  oyilandelayo  uza  kujonga  umqulu  wezithembiso   zonyulo
wabanye abantu ukuba uthini na, uyeke ukuthetha ngalo wakho.

Ewe, amatyotyombe,  ukuba  uthetha  ngawo  Mnu  uRaju,  ayinxalenye  yezinye
zezinto ezenziwe ngabantu  ababenani  ngaphambili.  Abantu  babengenalungelo
lakusondela edolophini.  Idolophu  yaye  iyeyabantu  abamhlophe.  Namhlanje,
siyenzile indlela yokuba umntu ahlale nokuba kuphi na.  Bafuna  eziya  ndawo
nanizenze yazezenu, yiyo loo nto besondeza amatyotyombe abo.

Sinengxaki  yokulawula  amatyotyombe  awakhiwa  nini.  Kambe   ke,   izindlu
siyabanika abantu bakowethu, ngoba kaloku indlu sisidima kubantu  bakowethu.
Nokuba ezo nkokeli  zenu  zinganxiba  ihempe  enegqabi,  nguZizi  ophetheyo,
nguKhongolose ophetheyo. Bathetha abantu  boMzantsi  Afrika,  baza  kuphinde
bathethe. OoSambhuntsuntsu ke nezaphuselane azisayi kuhlala zingakhali.

Sihlalo,  mandibulele.  Ndiya  ngokuba  shushu  ngoba   ndisuka   ezilalini.
Ndithethela oomama ababengathathi ntweni, abakwaziyo ukuma namhlanje  bathi,
``naku,  ndiyakwazi  ukuthenga  ukutya.  Abantwana  bam  bayaya  esikolweni;
abantwana bayatya esikolweni''.

ILUNGU ELIHLONIPHEKILEYO: Malibongwe!

Nksz P C P MAJODINA:  Kuthi  ke  loo  nto  ibingekhe  ibe  kho  ukuba  ngaba
uKhongolose  wayengekho.  Ibingekhe  ibekho  ukuba  ngaba  abantu  boMzantsi
Afrika bebengayazi into abayifunayo. Ngenxa yokuba siyazi into  esiyifunayo,
namhlanje ke, Sihlalo, sithi siyixhasa ngokupheleleyo.

Xa ndigqibezela, Sihlalo, phaya ekhaya akuzange zibekho  iirobhothi.  Abantu
bakuthi bayama,  bayibukele  le  nto  intle  imana  ivala,  ivula.  Abazange
bayibone. [Kwahlekwa.] Loo nto ke  luphuhliso  oluzinzileyo  nolungagungqiyo
lwe-ANC. Ndiyabulela. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[Chairperson, they say that we  always  say  the  same  thing.  We  promised
people water and houses. We are going to  repeat  that  because  we  do  not
change at every opportunity. The ANC knows what it wants. If  everyone  does
not yet have access to water and houses, we will continue  mentioning  water
and adequate housing for women so that they can have places they  can  claim
as their own. That is the commitment of the ANC-led Government.

Legislation is provided to protect women's rights. Today,  women  can  claim
their rightful place and role in our country because that has been  provided
for  by  the  Constitution.  The  ANC  is  a  leading  example   where   the
emancipation and empowerment of women is  concerned  so  that  they  can  be
treated with the dignity and respect they  deserve  because  women  are  the
foundation of each and every country.
It will be important, therefore, that those who have  sunglasses  on  should
take them off, as they will not be able to see when it rains. We are  moving
forward; things are happening. The road ahead of us is long and we  are  not
turning back. We are walking the long road to freedom. We  fought  for  this
freedom. The book of Galatians, Chapter 5:1 says:


  Stand fast therefore in the liberty that Christ has granted us and be not
  entangled with the yoke of bondage.

Today, Chairperson, as we are enjoying our freedom,  there  are  people  who
speak as they wish as though they were "riding a pig". [Laughter.]

Our children are well  fed  because  they  are  well  looked  after  by  our
Government. They look beautiful. Women feel that they are loved.  They  feel
safe and protected, and that is being safeguarded by  the  Constitution  and
legislation that has been passed  by  this  House.  To  those  that  are  in
opposition to our Government we say,  ``Sorry!''  People  are  governed  and
ruled by a person who follows a certain rule himself. If you do not  have  a
plan and a programme of action, you can never be able to  lead  people.  You
will only criticise other people's manifestos, and not follow yours.

Indeed, the informal settlements you are talking about, Mr  Raju,  are  part
of the things that were created by people you  used  to  work  with  before.
People did not have the right to come near the cities. The cities and  towns
were reserved for white people. Today a person  can  choose  to  live  where
they want. People want to be close  to  the  areas  that  you  reserved  for
yourselves; that is why they build their shacks near your ``areas''.

We have a problem controlling the spiralling of these  informal  settlements
that you  created.  However,  we  have  a  standing  commitment  to  provide
adequate housing to our people because that, to people, helps restore  their
dignity. You and  your  leaders  may  wear  and  boast  the  most  expensive
clothes, but our leader is the son of the amaZizi clan. The ANC  rules.  The
South African people spoke. They are going to speak  again.  The  opposition
will always have something to say in opposition.

I would like to thank you, Chairperson, for this opportunity. I am  becoming
heated because I come directly from the rural areas. I speak  on  behalf  of
women who used to have nothing, but who today  are  able  to  buy  food  for
themselves. Their children attend school. Their children are being  provided
with food at school.

An HON MEMBER: Praise!

Ms P C P MAJODINA: That could never be the  case  if  the  ANC  was  not  in
power. That could never be the case if South  Africans  did  not  know  what
they wanted. Because we know exactly what we  want,  Chairperson,  we  fully
support it.

In conclusion, Chairperson, there were no robots  where  I  come  from.  Our
people look at them and say they look wonderful because they never saw  them
before. [Laughter.] That is sustainable development  by  the  ANC.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I see the election has begun in earnest, when  I
listen to the  hon  member.  [Interjections.]  If  anybody  wanted  to  know
whether it had begun, he or she just had to listen to that speech.

But when did this journey that we are talking about begin? Did it  begin  in
1994 or did it begin with Mr De Klerk? Did it begin  with  the  Republic  in
1961, the Act of Union in 1909, the founding of the ANC in  1912?  Well,  of
course all these events contributed to the progress of our  nation,  in  one
way or another. The struggle of man to elevate and enable himself is as  old
as time itself, and our Constitution, essentially, is a  product,  in  fact,
of the reformation.

The Greek model of democracy, which we talk  about,  became  deeply  flawed.
The great historian Edward Gibbon wrote, and I quote him:


  The Athenians finally wanted not to give to society, but for  society  to
  give to them. The freedom they wanted was  freedom  from  responsibility.
  Then Athens ceased to be free. In the end, more than they wanted freedom,
  they wanted security, they wanted a comfortable life  and  they  lost  it
  all: security, comfort and freedom.

And they practised slavery.

Does it sound familiar, Madam Chair? Are there not people  in  South  Africa
today who would swop our hard-fought-for liberty for security  and  comfort?
Are there not people now who want to taste the  fruits  of  government,  but
want to do nothing to plant that fruit or to water the tree of liberty?

We must pause, we must celebrate; it's proper that we do. We  have  much  to
be grateful for, but we need to look back and  face  the  realities.  George
Washington said:


  Government is not reason, it is force;  like  fire,  it  is  a  dangerous
  servant and a fearful master.

The great Thomas Jefferson  wrote:  ``Eternal  vigilance  is  the  price  of
liberty.'' And we need to remember that.

That is why it is  good  that  we  celebrate  10  years  of  full  universal
suffrage and democracy on the eve of an election. Because it is the  promise
and reality of an election that is the constant reminder that  we  are  free
and that our power is not a right, but a privilege. Power in a democracy  is
not inherited, but support earned.

Elections are a constant promise that society retains the option for  change
or censure.  So  what  we  celebrate  is  not  10  years  of  ANC  rule  and
government, but equally, 10 years of freedom from government. The real  test
of our Constitution and democracy, of course, will come when the  people  of
South Africa want, one day, a change of  government  and  vote  accordingly.
This election itself is the celebration, not the  result  of  the  election,
and the victor in our  system  must  not  be  the  majority  only,  but  the
minority also; not only the strong, but the weak and the vulnerable.

Civilisations are judged not on how majorities look  after  themselves,  but
on how great societies govern with fairness, equity  and  justice,  also  in
the interests of minorities. We have much to  be  proud  of,  but  what  has
eluded South Africa is true unity.

I want to say we must celebrate, Madam Chair,  but  we  must  not  celebrate
selectively. By doing that we devalue our democracy and  we  trivialise  and
politicise a great period in our history,  when  great  South  Africans  did
great  things,  and  the  nation  of  South  Africa,   together,   responded
magnificently to an enormous opportunity and achievement.

We have our friend there, the hon Majodina, who said: ``Who turned  the  tap
on?'' Well, I say to you: Who built the dam from which  the  water  came  so
that you could turn the tap on? [Interjections.] They say: ``Who turned  the
light on?'' I say: Who built the power station? [Interjections.]

You see, I'm not arguing  that.  I'm  just  saying  that  you  cannot  argue
selectively. One has to rise above that. [Interjections.]

This is a magnificent time in our history. We must celebrate, but  not  with
a sense of triumphalism but with a sense of gratitude  and  humility.  [Time
expired]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Thank you, Chairperson, for the opportunity.  I  couldn't
hear anything after the moving speech  of  the  hon  Majodina,  just  a  few
noises except for the last question -  who  built  the  dam  and  the  power
station? The answer is simple. It was the black  workers  of  this  country,
who were exploited. [Applause.] If we had had time as the ANC we could  have
built more dams and power stations which would be better than  the  ones  we
have.

Hon Chairperson,  Mr  Bhengu  raised  a  concern  that  when  he  drives  to
Parliament he sees some shacks. It's unfortunate that he just shot  and  ran
away. It's only cowards who do that. If you are a  soldier  you  must  shoot
and wait to see whether your target falls down  or  not.  However,  we  must
respond because we should not give a wrong impression to the public.

I think, as Mr Bhengu sees those shacks there, he must  celebrate  that  the
people are coming  back  to  the  land  from  which  they  were  inhumanely,
forcefully, and violently removed.  He  must  celebrate  that  there  is  no
longer influx control - section 10 - which prevents them from  coming  back.
He must celebrate that they come back into  the  caring  hands  of  the  ANC
council in Cape Town which is in partnership with  the  New  NP  to  provide
them with decent low-cost housing, which will bring back their dignity.

He must also celebrate that today, as we speak, the people of  District  Six
are coming back home.  He  forgets  that  the  world  icon,  Comrade  Nelson
Mandela, only had his first vote when he was 74 years old. If his  27  years
had not been wasted in jail, we could have done better than what we have.

of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, Minister Fraser-Moleketi, and hon members of the NCOP,  it
is a great pleasure for me that, as one of the people who struggled so  hard
for independence,  I  am  part  of  this  free  debate  and  the  democratic
Government. I feel very proud that I have a right to  speak  Siswati  inside
this free Parliament. Oh, it feels  so  magnificent  to  be  free  in  South
Africa!]

The late President of the ANC, Chief Albert Luthuli, in 1961  at  the  Nobel
Lecture said:


  Apartheid survives because those who sponsor  it  profit  from  it.  They
  provide moral whitewash for the conditions which exist in the country for
  the fact that the country is ruled exclusively  by  a  white  government,
  elected  by  an  exclusively  white  electorate  which  is  a  privileged
  minority; for the fact that 87% of land and all  best  agricultural  land
  within reach of town, market and railways is reserved for white ownership
  and occupation and now through the recent Group Areas Act, nonwhites  are
  losing more land to white greed ...

Furthermore, the late President of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, also had  this  to
say:


  The true patriots of  South  Africa,  for  whom  I  speak,  will  not  be
  satisfied with anything less than direct individual  adult  suffrage  and
  the right to stand for and be elected to all  organs  of  government.  In
  economic matters, we will be satisfied with nothing less than equality of
  opportunity in every sphere, and the enjoyment by all of those  heritages
  which form the resources of the country  which,  up  to  now,  have  been
  appropriated on a racial ``whites only'' basis. In culture,  we  will  be
  satisfied with nothing less than the opening of all doors of learning  to
  non-segregatory institutions on the sole criterion of ability.

Today, Chairperson, as we celebrate 10 years of freedom  and  democracy,  we
need to pay tribute to these gallant fighters of our movement. This  freedom
didn't come on a silver plate. It is a result of struggle and sacrifice  led
by the ANC. Hence we now have an opportunity to chart our future together.

On 28 February 1994, in his last speech to the apartheid parliament,  former
President F W De Klerk said:


  During the past four years, we have succeeded in  bringing  South  Africa
  back from the brink of catastrophe. Our society was  deeply  divided.  We
  were on the brink of conflict. Our country was ostracised  and  isolated.
  Our economy was in a hopeless downward spiral.

He went on further to say in conclusion, ``When we awake  on  29  April,  we
will be more free than we have ever been before.''

Loko kwashiwo iminyaka  lelishumi  leyendlulile.  Lamuhla  sigubha  iminyaka
lelishumi yenchubekela phambili kanye nekuthula ngaphansi  kwembuso  we-ANC.
[That was said 10 years ago. Today we are celebrating 10 years of peace  and
prosperity, under the leadership of the ANC-led Government.]

``After ten years of freedom, South Africans occupy a  prime  place  at  the
table of nations where we eat never only on  our  behalf.''  Those  are  the
words of Comrade President Thabo Mbeki. He further continues and says:


  Our  finances  are  sound  and  highly  praised  internationally.  Public
  accountability exists as never before. Our media are free to the point of
  excess. People are moving to our  shores  in  great  numbers  whether  as
  tourists, business, professional people or returnees.

Truly speaking, South Africa has never been a better  governed  and  managed
country than under the  ANC  leadership  working  in  partnership  with  the
people. Even the DA's Colin  Wells  Eglin  agrees,  with  his  33  years  of
experience in Parliament in which he belonged to six parties,  from  the  UP
to the current DA. He has also  served  under  seven  presidents  from  J  G
Strydom up till the current President, His Excellency, T M Mbeki. He said:


  There is more access to Bills. This  gives  the  opposition  a  lot  more
  access and power to change legislation.

He  only  complains  that:  ``There  is  very  little  publicity   for   the
opposition." [Laughter.] Who can do better than that?

Some people say that South Africa deserves better. In a record  time  of  10
years, the ANC has acquired skills and the ability  to  manage  the  economy
better than ever before. We are all in agreement that there has  never  been
a better Minister of Finance than the hon Comrade Trevor Manuel. Who can  do
better than him? You can take all the members of the DA  into  account,  but
none of them can do that. [Applause.]

As we speak today, Government is running a low debt and  is  therefore  able
to increase service delivery on education, health,  housing,  social  grants
and other services. The question is: Who can do better than that?

The  Government  has,  under  the  leadership  of  President  Thabo   Mbeki,
amplified  its  relations,  interventions  and   assistance   with   African
countries and of course with other countries abroad. The  question  is:  Who
can do better than that?

Hon Chairperson, just imagine, if you woke up one day  and  found  that  the
hon Tony  Leon  was  the  president.  What  would  happen  to  our  economy?
[Interjections.] People would cry, hon Raju, not  out  of  joy  but  out  of
sadness. Bantfu bangakhala. [People would  cry].  Just  ask  yourselves  how
many Harksens would flock back to  the  country,  whether  from  Germany  or
other countries. The response is that people would cry, not out of  joy  but
out of sadness.

With his cowboy tactics,  as  if  he  comes  from  Texas,  Zimbabwe  may  be
attacked  under  the  pretext  of  having  weapons  of   mass   destruction.
[Interjections.] And people would cry, not out of joy but  out  of  sadness.
What may happen to land restitution  and  reform  is  that  these  would  be
banned concepts in the country and people would cry, not out of joy but  out
of sadness.

I,  however,  together  with  millions  of  fellow  South  Africans,   sleep
peacefully knowing that our beloved country is in the caring  hands  of  the
ANC. If there is anything that South Africa deserves better, it is a  better
and  constructive  official   opposition   with   a   vision   rather   than
individualistic missions. The ANC lives and leads a people's contract for  a
better South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Chairperson,  I
think it has been quite an opportunity this afternoon to engage  in  such  a
very important debate, a debate where we reflect on the journey  to  freedom
and democracy. I thought I would use this opportunity  in  the  response  to
start off by sharing an experience. And I will then  go  into  some  of  the
responses.

It was 31 July 1981, when, in Ashdown Park,  Harare,  just  after  midnight,
two young people, respectively aged 20 and 23, found the body  of  the  then
chief representative of the ANC, Joe Gqabi, in a car outside the  house.  He
had 22 bullets shot into his body. Uzi machine guns were used  to  kill  him
that night. They expected, it appears, to kill three people, but  they  only
assassinated one. This was a South African - a leader of  the  South  Africa
people, killed by a South African unit that was  sent  into  a  neighbouring
country, in order to try to stop the journey to freedom and democracy.
I raise this  today  because  I  think  that  our  journey  to  freedom  and
democracy is not just about the journey for ourselves. It's  a  journey  for
our people, our children, our grandchildren and for the ones who are yet  to
be born.

There are many who came before and who were wrenched away from us under  the
most terrible circumstances. Joe Gqabi, left a relatively  young  wife.  Now
that I am 43, I can say she was young then. At that time, I thought she  was
not so young. But he also left young  children  and  a  grandchild  at  that
point in  time,  a  grandchild  that  was  never  to  know  the  love  of  a
grandfather. Joe Gqabi is one of many South Africans  who  sacrificed  their
lives. Today as we speak about our journey to  freedom  and  democracy,  and
the one that we still intend to walk, we don't only remember Joe  Gqabi,  we
also remember Katryn Schoon, Jenny Schoon and many other South Africans.

There are South Africans who died on both sides of  the  divide.  There  are
those who were part of the South African Defence Force at that  time.  There
are those who served as askaris and in different ways. This is part  of  our
history, our journey and of the  trauma  that  is  there  in  South  African
society. We need to rise above that and walk this path. As  we  walked  this
path - our journey to  freedom  and  democracy  -  we  did  not  do  it  for
ourselves only. We did it for the South African people, our communities;  we
do it for our children, our grandchildren and for  the  beautiful  ones  who
are  yet  to  be  born.  We  have  a  responsibility.  As   we   have   this
responsibility, we need to look at how we engage.

We can trivialise the 10 years of a journey that has been  walked  and  that
we want to deepen. We can say that everything or nothing has  happened.  But
we have  a  responsibility  to  the  grandchildren,  the  children  and  the
beautiful ones yet to be born, because we want them to grow  up  in  country
that belongs to everyone. We want our kids to grow up, free of  the  fetters
and shackles of racism and discrimination and free of the fear of  want  and
poverty. But to do that, we need to  come  together  in  a  common  contract
where we say that all South Africans must contribute to  make  this  journey
happen.

Kgoshi Mokoena earlier reminded us that the Freedom Charter says that  South
Africa belongs to all  who  live  in  it,  black  and  white,  and  that  no
government can justly claim authority, unless it is based  on  the  will  of
the people. And I challenge every South African, from  any  political  party
and from any part of the  South  African  spectrum,  to  say  that  this  is
incorrect. Because I do believe - we do believe - that South Africa  belongs
to all who live in it. But we must make that a reality. We  need  to  ensure
that we realise it in  every  way  whatsoever.  We  must  make  use  of  all
institutions, instruments of the state and everything  available  to  us  to
make this happen.

We reflect on what we have achieved. We still have  a  long  road  to  walk.
There is no question about it. We have not  achieved  everything.  But  then
given a decade in the life of a nation  that  has  been  subjected  to  such
extreme laws, that has gone  through  the  kind  of  history  we  have  gone
through, that has been so divided, would we really  imagine  that  we  could
overcome these differences in 10 years? If we would, then we would  be  mere
dreamers. South Africans are realists. As Africans,  we  are  realistic.  We
are going to walk this path in a way  that  is  going  to  say  that  it  is
difficult, but we will make it happen.

We still need to come to  terms  with  the  trauma  that  is  there  in  our
society. There are those who  have  slogans  that  say  that  we  can  solve
problems easily. What kind of magic wand is there, that can make it  happen?
It is not possible. Let's not mislead our people. Let's not even try  to  do
that.

Some hon members, like hon Raju, at  instances  clearly  indicated  that  we
need to listen and hear, not selectively look at issues. He  called  Aids  a
theme. I never considered Aids to  be  a  theme.  But  Raju  also  tries  to
suggest that the building blocks that were put in place, according  to  him,
were not there. Let's not deny what happened. If there is anything  that  we
should say, we can do the following better, but  let's  not  pretend  as  if
nothing happened. When we are in the legislative  arm  of  governance  as  a
whole, let's not say that the following had to happen and with glee say  the
judiciary enforced it. What does that suggest? Do we want  a  country  where
the judiciary will determine policies and  their  implementation?  There  is
something wrong with that.

I think that we need to go back and reflect. Let's look  at  the  separation
of powers. Let's look at the  role  of  the  various  arms  and  reflect  on
whether, in what has happened over the past 10 years, the steps were  always
right. It cannot  be  correct  that  we  pass  by  decree,  or  through  the
judiciary, the  effecting  of  the  implementation  of  certain  programmes.
Something is very wrong with that, and we need to ask the questions  as  the
legislature. We should not be blind to it. Let's not  look  at  it  and  say
there were no programmes. We know that there is a five-year  programme  that
was there from the side of  Government.  As  the  Government  rolls  out  an
aspect of the treatment programme, because it is comprehensive,  we  say  we
need to do it in a responsible way because we must have  the  infrastructure
to roll it out.

The very people who shout and say ``do more'' are  the  people  who  on  the
next day will say that the infrastructure  is  not  good  enough.  Let's  be
clear about what we really want. Let's ensure that when we roll it out,  the
burden is carried by the implementation  arm  and  not  by  the  population.
Let's not have  the  programme  unfold  and  then  say  we  don't  have  the
resources  to  sustain  it.  This  Government  will  not  roll  out  in   an
unsustained way. Our policies have always been so focused.

In terms of some of the other issues raised, it seems as if the  hon  Bhengu
somehow has a magic wand for the economy. Let's hear that. Let's hear  where
this amazing growth is going to come  from,  that  is  going  to  solve  the
problems. I think we should look at it. What I think we all agree  with  and
agree on, is that we are facing enormous challenges,  but  together  we  are
going to resolve that. That's why we are here in this House. That's  why  we
stood to be elected representatives of the people of South Africa.  We  were
willing to take on the challenges, not because  we  thought  we  would  make
magic. Let's leave it to those who can make it. But maybe hon Bhengu can  do
that. I must be careful. I should not venture into an area of  which  I  may
not know sufficient - that of magic, myth and so on. [Laughter.]

I want to agree with the rest of the  members.  I  think  actually  everyone
said this in some way, even if it was grudgingly.  We  may  not  agree  with
where the journey started ...

Ons mag nie almal saamstem waar hierdie reis begin het nie. [We may not  all
agree about where the journey began.]

But indeed we agree that we are on a journey that started way back. We  also
agree that there were men and  women  who  played  an  outstanding  role  in
making this journey a reality, who have handed over  the  baton  to  us  and
said that we must continue and have the stamina to do so.  I  think  we  all
agree on this. Let us take the responsibility to do it in a manner in  which
we do not deny reality and facts.

Hon Durr, I agree with you. Let's not honour selectively. At the same  time,
let's not be selective when we use the term  ``honour  selectively''.  Let's
ensure that we celebrate all and build  together.  For  us  to  deepen  this
journey to freedom and democracy, we need to ensure that we  overcome  in  a
real sense the evils of racism that are still there in our society. We  need
to overcome the inequalities that are still there in South African  society.
Let's say that together we have walked a long way, somewhat of  a  way,  but
there are still huge challenges in terms  of  eradicating  poverty.  We  are
going to contribute together to enhance the economic growth  trajectory.  We
are going to deal with the challenge to overcome the trauma  that  is  there
in South African society. We will ensure that every child is our  child  and
that we are part of the global village. We are part of Africa and  we  won't
engage in Africa selectively as we choose.

As some members behind me said, Zimbabwe is not a tenth province. It  cannot
be a tenth province of South Africa. As we engage and have  an  interest  in
Zimbabwe, let's also have an interest in the Democratic Republic  of  Congo,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Africa  because  it  is  our  region  and  our
continent. We used to sing  about  Africa  and  we  still  do.  We  are  all
Africans. We are a diverse people. We celebrate our diversity  of  language,
culture and religion, and of just being a proud people. Let's remember  that
we do this not for ourselves, but for our grandchildren,  our  children  and
for the beautiful ones who are yet to be born. When they are  born  in  this
country of ours on this continent of ours, they  should  say:  ``Indeed,  we
merely loaned to our ancestors this land of ours, and  they  have  given  it
back to us in an even better state  than  they  found  it.''  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, thank you  very  much  for  the
inspiring debate. Yes, Mr Durr, I did hear you saying that the ANC was ...

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I heard you battling  with  the  years.  I've
never heard of a year called 19-1912.

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, are you participating in the debate or  are  you
the Chairman of the debate?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I want to thank  the  hon  Minister  and  the
members who contributed to this debate. Yes, we are on  a  journey  that  is
going to take us to where we want to be. If we work together as  a  team  we
will reach our destination. Thank you very much, hon Minister.

Debate concluded.

            NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: BIODIVERSITY BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon members, having listened  to  a  challenging
topic - ``A journey to freedom and democracy'' - allow  me  to  lay  another
brick in this important wall as we build on this journey.

The Bill before us today seeks to provide for the  effective  and  efficient
management  and  conservation  of  our  country's  biodiversity  within  the
framework of the National Environmental  Management  Act  of  1998,  amongst
other things.

In our quest for our mission and vision, that is to work  towards  the  goal
of a better life for all and  to  ensure  that  our  country  grows  through
sustainable development to the benefit of all  its  people,  this  piece  of
legislation serves as one of  the  pillars  in  fulfilling  such  goals  and
ensuring achievement of those noble objectives.

It would be noted that the Genetically Modified Organisms Act of  1997  does
not deal  adequately  with  the  obligations  as  clearly  outlined  in  the
Cartagena Protocol. Therefore section 76A was introduced  in  this  Bill  to
ensure our country's  compliance  with  its  obligations  in  terms  of  the
Cartagena Protocol.

The aforementioned section, section  76A,  also  empowers  our  Minister  to
recommend to the permit-issuing authority not to  issue  a  permit  for  the
release, for whatever purpose, of a genetically modified organism  into  the
environment, if it is suspected that it poses a  threat  to  any  indigenous
species or the environment, unless and  until  an  environmental  assessment
has been conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the Act.

It is therefore our firm belief that this important section, section  78(1),
ensures that our  country,  as  one  of  the  original  signatories  to  the
Cartagena Protocol, adheres to the spirit and letter of the protocol  in  so
far as genetically modified organisms are concerned.

This Bill also proposes the establishment of the  SA  National  Biodiversity
Institute, which will, amongst other  things,  monitor  the  status  of  the
Republic's biodiversity, monitor the conservation status of  all  listed  or
protected species and listed ecosystems, and also monitor the status of  all
listed and invasive species and report on all of them to the Minister.

The same institute will also advise the Minister on any matter regulated  in
terms of  this  Bill,  inclusive  of  the  management  and  conservation  of
biological  diversity,  the  sustainable  use   of   indigenous   biological
resources, etc.

The institute, established as a juristic person, will have  general  powers,
which will influence and enable its effective and efficient running and  the
fulfilment of its expectations and requirements.

In line with our principles of democracy, wide consultation  has  been  done
in relation  to  this  Bill  and  the  response  of  such  consultation  was
positive, which implies that the Bill was widely supported.

In conclusion, the introduction of the  National  Environmental  Management:
Biodiversity Bill for our consideration is welcomed and supported  heartily.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I shall  now  put  the  question.  The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. As the decision  is  dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I  shall  first  ascertain  whether
all delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  their  provinces'
votes. Are all delegation heads present in the House? Yes.

In  accordance  with  Rule  71  I  shall  now  first  allow  provinces   the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they so wish.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in  favour  of,  or  against,  or  abstain  from
voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Eastern Cape supports.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Mr T S SETONA: Free State supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Gauteng supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Ms B THOMSON: In favour.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Re a dumela. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Ke wa rona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Northern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Ke wa rona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Oh, I see we do not  have  the  ninth  province  in  the  House,  but  eight
provinces have voted in favour. I therefore  declare  the  Bill  agreed  to.
[Applause.]

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                           AFFAIRS - ANNUAL REPORT

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Hon Chairperson  and  hon  members,  as  we  tabled  this
report for consideration and adoption, it was interesting and fulfilling  to
note, with enthusiasm, that there  are  members  of  the  various  political
persuasions committed to the ideal of working towards the goal of  a  better
life for all, in pursuance of the growth of the country for the  benefit  of
all its people.
By that, we have all enjoyed the possibility created in 1994 for us to  work
together practically to  construct  a  society  that  cares,  with  all  the
expectations and  requirements  placed  on  our  shoulders  by  our  various
constituencies.

In the report tabled before us today, members will note  that  not  all  the
funds allocated to the select committee were used. This was because  of  the
fact that the select committee, owing to a lot of legislation  work  it  had
to consider, was not in  a  position  to  undertake  most  oversight  trips.
Furthermore, owing to the fact that the committee deals with  a  cluster  of
departments, time is severely constrained. Of course, other oversight  trips
were not approved.

We hope these concerns will be noted so that a repetition of  the  things  I
have alluded to above is avoided in  future.  This,  if  attended  to,  will
enhance the effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  committee  and  thereby
result in rapid service delivery  to  our  people  and  the  communities  we
represent.
In spite of the fact that some annual reports were not scrutinised and  that
intended quarterly briefings from the Department of  Land  Affairs  did  not
materialise in the short term, the committee covered most of  the  work  set
out in the programme for the year.

The feeling amongst committee members is that,  in  line  with  transparency
and  accountability,  the  committee  should  issue  press   statements   on
pertinent issues relating to the activities in  the  committee.  During  the
period under review the committee dealt with and considered 11  Bills,  five
international  agreements  and  protocols,  institutional  oversight   work,
national  visits   and   international   visits,   amongst   some   of   its
responsibilities.

In conclusion, the report of the select committee is tabled for adoption.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I'm not sure if the Western Cape has  decided
to move out of the House. [Interjections.] We will come to  this  report  at
the end of the day.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND RECREATION -
                                ANNUAL REPORT

Mr D M KGWARE: Thank you,  Chairperson.  The  report  has  been  adopted  at
committee level, and before one could,  perhaps,  make  some  comments,  I'd
just like to acknowledge the support  and  the  participation  of  committee
members. I think they need to be commended on that. Also,  the  co-operation
that one has received from the members of  the  committee,  debating  issues
without  any  fear  and  putting  their  minds  up  there,  is  a  sign   of
healthiness, and one would like to commend that.

However, then let me say that, out of the 12 pages that I have here, I  will
be selective. There is a  lot  to  say  and  we  could  have  gone  on  very
lengthily, to speak on the report itself. However, I will just  highlight  a
few things.
I'm honoured to be called upon to report to the House against  the  backdrop
of significant developments that have been taking place over the  past  year
in education, arts and  culture,  sport  and  recreation,  and  science  and
technology  in  our  country,  due  to  the  participation  of  the   select
committee.

I must also indicate that, as many of our leaders of  Government  have  been
called to task to respond to the developments  and  achievements  that  have
taken place over the last 10 years of democracy  in  our  country,  I  would
like to take this opportunity to highlight a few of  these  with  regard  to
education,  arts  and  culture,  sport  and  recreation,  and  science   and
technology.

The  committee  on  sport,  recreation,  arts  and  culture,   science   and
technology was tasked with a formidable mission to ensure that the  NCOP  is
sensitive to  provincial  interests.  Among  the  core  objectives  were  to
stimulate nature, protect the arts and culture of this country and focus  on
institutional capacity, gender policies, moral regeneration  and  linguistic
diversity in order to allow South Africans to participate fully  in  social,
political and/or economic life.

With regard to legislation, the committee  was  party  to  the  formulation,
debating and passing of the Natural Scientific Professions Bill, B  56-2002,
the Education Laws Amendment Bill, B  38B-2003,  and  the  Higher  Education
Amendment Bill, B 36-2003.

With regard to international protocols, I'm proud to announce to  the  House
that the committee has been part of the President's  call  on  strengthening
our link and contribution to the  African  continent,  by  agreeing  on  the
ratification of the SADC Protocol on Culture, Information and Sport. Let  me
indicate that this protocol commits us to  ensuring  that  culture  plays  a
significant role in the economic development of the SADC region.

With regard to oversight, I am proud to  announce  that  the  committee  has
been successful in getting the various  relevant  departments  on  board  in
reporting specific  issues  that  concern  our  nation.  The  committee  had
briefings by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science  and  Technology,  and
the Department of  Education  on  various  issues,  including  their  annual
reports. We  also  had  a  briefing  by  PanSALB  on  the  private  member's
legislative proposal language Bill by the  SA  Human  Rights  Commission  on
their fourth Economic and Social Rights Report, and by  the  CSIR  on  their
annual report.

As the law-making institution in the Republic, it is very important that  we
do a follow-up to see if the provinces implement the laws and policies  that
Parliament makes, and the  challenges  and  developments  thereof.  In  this
regard, although we did not go to all the nine provinces,  one  major  thing
is that we conducted a study tour  to  the  KwaZulu-Natal  province,  and  I
would like to indicate to the House that I think this is  one  of  the  best
visits ever, presented by the NCOP, on the side  of  education,  because  we
actually went to the heartland of KwaZulu-Natal,  right  up  to  Ulundi.  We
trotted deep down there, and we saw whatever there was to  see.  The  report
on this, which comes from the committee, is available. We  could  debate  it
at some stage, but you should pick it up.

With regard to overview, let me indicate that, as a committee, we  are  also
faced  with  the  acid  test  of  the  legitimising  of  the  programmes  we
elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation  we  adopt
and whether they serve their established objectives.

We have raised that, whilst we are processing and going forward,  there  are
a number of other things that we still have to  discuss,  and  that  we  can
discuss. We have made that recommendation in the actual report, as  some  of
the few things that we can pick up and build on. It also depends on  how  we
relate in terms of oversight. There's a rotational  kind  of  programme,  so
that each and every committee gets an equal  share  in  terms  of  oversight
visits.

I am proud to announce that, through our interaction with the provinces,  we
have experienced and witnessed the  positive  change  in  our  country.  The
people of this country are starting to reap the fruits of freedom.

Responding to  general  investments  in  education,  sport  and  recreation,
science and technology, in almost all of the  10  years  of  our  democracy,
education, I think we  would  all  agree,  is  one  of  our  best  and  most
practical means for advancing the frontiers of human  fulfilment  and  human
freedom for a sustainable future in our country.

With regard to sport and recreation, I concede with the  Minister  of  Sport
and Recreation that, although we need to build an environment of  stability,
that is a prerequisite for  achieving  success  in  our  country's  sporting
codes. Let me indicate that much of the first decade of  our  democracy  was
spent in laying the basis for equity in sport, with the main focus being  on
accessibility and opportunities for all South  Africans.  I  must  say  that
this we have achieved, as a Government of the people of this country.

Our Government inherited a situation in which the majority  of  the  people,
especially the black population, had  access  to  virtually  nothing,  while
small minorities thrived on resources provided by our discriminatory state.

With regard to science and  technology,  the  United  Nations  places  South
Africa in position 39 in the area of information and  technology,  ahead  of
Thailand and India in position 63. Let me  also  indicate  that,  out  of  a
total of 162 countries, South Africa is ranked in position 39, in  terms  of
technological  achievement.  This  positions  us   as   dynamic   technology
adopters.

In arts and culture, I'm proud to say that  the  Government  has  continued,
tirelessly, to consolidate the role of arts and  culture  in  South  African

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON INTERVENTION IN THE LEKWA
       TEEMANE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY IN TERMS OF SECTION 139(1)(c) OF THE
                                CONSTITUTION

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon  colleagues,  the  ad  hoc  committee
established  by  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  in  terms  of   Rule
160(1)(b),  having  considered  the   application   for   approval   of   an
intervention made in accordance with section 139(1)(c) of the  Constitution,
as submitted by the provincial government of the North West  province,  into
the affairs of the Lekwa Teemane local municipality referred to it,  reports
as follows.
The  Lekwa  Teemane  local  municipality  has  since  its  establishment  in
December 2000 been struggling to maintain financial stability. This is as  a
result  of  political  instability  and  institutional   problems   in   the
municipality which have resulted in poor financial planning and  management.
The department of local government and housing in the  North  West  province
had, in terms of section 105 of the Municipal Systems Act of  2000,  put  in
place a monitoring and supporting system at the  municipality  in  order  to
address some of the municipal problems. However,  these  measures  were  not
successful because  of  political  instability  and  the  inability  of  the
council to meet and take the necessary decisions.

The  municipality  consists  of  two  major  towns,  namely  Christiana  and
Bloemhof, which are bordered by townships and farms.  The  municipality  has
since embarked on an amalgamation process  of  the  two  towns,  surrounding
townships and farms, but has not succeeded - except  for  the  finance  unit
which is also still not completely integrated.  As  a  result  of  that  the
municipal functions are duplicated.  The  failure  of  the  municipality  to
amalgamate has caused divisions among  the  councillors  and  staff,  mainly
based on the towns from which they come.

The provincial executive council of the North West province took a  decision
on 21 January to approve the dissolution of this municipality  in  terms  of
section  139(1)(c)  of  the  Constitution.  In  terms  of  this   piece   of
legislation, the MEC for development, local government and housing has  been
given the authority to appoint an administrator to conduct  the  affairs  of
the said municipality until such time as the new council is duly elected.

The North West provincial government is seeking  approval  from  this  House
for its intervention to  dissolve  the  council  in  order  to  achieve  the
following objectives: to develop good systems, policies and proposals  aimed
at restoring stability within the municipality;  to  ensure  that  there  is
good financial planning and management in order to enable  the  municipality
to meet its financial obligations; and to facilitate  the  election  of  the
new  municipal  council.  As  a  result  the  terms  of  reference  of   the
intervention will be  restricted  to  the  following  areas:  the  financial
situation of the municipality, governance  and  institutional  matters,  and
political problems.

As said before, the municipality of  Lekwa  Teemane  has  been  experiencing
financial difficulty for some  time,  as  a  result  of  the  aforementioned
political instability and poor  local  leadership.  Some  of  the  financial
difficulties can be summarised as follows. The annual  financial  statements
of the municipality reflect reserves of R12,5 million but there are no  cash
investments to back that up. This has led to  the  municipality  failing  to
meet its financial obligations to  its  creditors,  which  resulted  in  the
withdrawal of investments that  were  used  for  the  funding  of  operating
expenditure.

The outstanding account with the Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry
increased to R11,7 million due to nonpayment by the municipality.  This  has
also led Dwaf to contemplate reducing the water supply to the  municipality.
The defaulted loan repayment to the  Development  Bank  of  Southern  Africa
stands at R1,7 million. This bank is considering legal  action  against  the
municipality. The total outstanding  amount  owed  to  creditors  stands  at
R15,9 million, with the Auditor-General's account still unpaid at R146  291.
These amounts exclude the bank overdraft of the municipality  which  exceeds
R1 million.

This therefore demonstrates that there is  a  lack  of  management  strategy
regarding the  cash  flow  of  this  municipality,  which  in  turn  impacts
negatively on the operations of this municipality. The  lack  of  management
strategy to manage cash flow has meant that the municipality could  not  pay
the salaries of its staff, could not pay for bulk water  supply,  and  could
not pay its electricity account to Eskom. As a  result,  the  department  of
local government, in the province, had to intervene  and  provide  financial
assistance.

The total  account  for  salaries  for  this  municipality  stands  at  R4,6
million, which represents more than 45% of total  expenditure.  This  is  in
violation of the National Treasury norm which provides that salaries  should
not exceed 35% of the revenue of a municipality. The situation has  impacted
on the municipality's capacity to implement an indigent policy  and  compile
an indigent register. And, as a result of that, the municipality  could  not
implement the free basic services policy as needed.

The municipality has also failed  to  integrate  the  two  major  towns,  as
mentioned before, and as a result of this these towns still operate  as  two
separate  entities.  This  means,  therefore,  duplication  of  municipality
staff, which impacts negatively on the resources of the municipality.

The municipality has since commissioned Price Waterhouse Coopers to  compile
an organogram for the staff complement of the municipality. However, it  has
not implemented the recommendations of this company, since  the  councillors
could not meet to take decisions on the implementation of  this  organogram.
This therefore represents a fruitless expenditure.

Meetings  of  the  council  and  committees  do  not  materialise  in   most
instances.  Where  they  do  materialise,  the  meetings  do   not   address
operational matters or issues relating to  service  delivery.  Instead,  the
focus is placed on special meetings that deal with mineral rights and  other
nondevelopmental issues. There is therefore ineffective leadership  in  this
municipality and, as a result, crucial decisions could not be taken.

The section 105 investigation conducted by the department  in  the  province
found that the problems within  the  municipality  are  both  political  and
administrative.  Many  councillors  are  not  familiar  with  the   relevant
legislation  despite  workshops  and  other  measures  aimed  at   capacity-
building. The political  tensions  are  so  serious  that  there  is  little
cohesion within the council.

The ward committees are not working properly. The  ex-mayor  and  ex-speaker
have also fought  over  who  should  call  meetings  of  the  council.  This
resulted in a very difficult relationship between these two top  leaders  in
the  council,  which  in  turn  impacted  on  the  overall  running  of  the
municipality.

The ad hoc committee, as constituted by this House, is not in a position  to
make recommendations to this House at this stage since it would  still  like
to clear some issues which were  raised  by  stakeholders  and  role-players
before a final recommendation could be made to this House. I thank  you  for
your attention. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  that  concludes  the  debate.
Bells will be rung for three minutes to allow all provinces  to  be  present
in the House before we vote on the following Orders that have been read  out
by the secretary, ie the third, second and fourth Orders. Bells will now  be
rung for three minutes.

Debate concluded.

Business suspended at 17:22 and resumed at 17:25.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, we are going to start  with  the
second order of the day, ie the Annual Report of  the  Select  Committee  on
Land and Environmental Affairs. The question is that the report be  adopted.
As the decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I
shall first ascertain whether  all  delegation  heads  are  present  in  the
Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. Are all present?

In accordance with Rule 71 I shall first  allow  provinces  the  opportunity
make their declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to  the
voting on the question. I shall do so in alphabetical  order  per  province.
Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they  vote  in
favour, against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Before we vote on  the  fourth  Order,  I  shall  give  the  leader  of  the
delegation of the ad hoc committee an opportunity to speak to us.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon members,  I  wish  to  reiterate  the
recommendation of the ad hoc committee to this House. The ad  hoc  committee
is not in a position  to  make  conclusive  recommendations  to  the  House.
Therefore, the  committee  recommends  that  the  House  not  recommend  the
intervention at this stage to allow  the  committee  enough  time  to  clear
issues that were raised by stakeholders. I thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the amendment by  the  ad  hoc
committee. I shall now put the question. The question is that the report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first ascertain that delegation heads are  present  to

supported the ad hoc committee.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

     1.     Executive Committee


     The Assembly and  Governing  Council  meetings  were  preceded  by  the
     meeting of the 241st session of the Executive Committee, which  is  the
     administrative organ of the  Inter-Parliamentary  Union.  Ms  Mahlangu-
     Nkabinde took part in the session.  Its  proceedings  were  devoted  to
     discussing and making recommendations on agenda items to  be  addressed
     by the Governing Council.


     2.     Governing Council


     The Governing Council met on 1  and  3  October  2003.  It  approved  a
     request for affiliation by the Parliament of  Bahrain.  It  decided  to
     suspend the affiliations of Iraq, on the grounds  that  the  Parliament
     had ceased to function in that country, and of Guinea Bissau,  after  a
     coup d'état which resulted in the dissolution  of  the  Parliament.  It
     also suspended the membership of the Parliaments of  Georgia,  Liberia,
     Malawi, the Marshall Islands, Paraguay and the United States of America
     because all of them were more  than  three  years  in  arrears  in  the
     payment of their contributions.


     The Council heard a report of the  Executive  Committee  on  the  110th
     Assembly of the IPU, which had been scheduled to take place  in  London
     in March/April 2004. The IPU  concludes  an  agreement  with  the  host
     country for every meeting organized by  the  Union  which  includes  an
     article 5 which provides that the Assembly of the IPU can only be  held
     if all the IPU Members are invited and  if  their  representatives  are
     assured of receiving the necessary visas  for  participation.  However,
     the government of the United Kingdom informed the IPU that it could not
     issue visas to certain members of the Zimbabwean  Parliament  who  were
     subject to a European Union travel ban.  As  a  result,  the  Executive
     Committee recommended to the Council that the  110th  Assembly  not  be
     held in London and, instead, be transferred to another country.


     The delegation of Australia, seconded by the delegation of Ireland, put
     forward a motion  calling  on  the  Governing  Council  to  affirm  its
     decision taken in Santiago de Chile that the 110th Assembly be held  in
     London. Following a debate in which Mr Mahlangu spoke on behalf of  the
     South African delegation, the motion was put to a  vote.  Each  country
     was entitled to three  votes  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  the
     Governing Council. All the delegations present  and  entitled  to  vote
     were given an opportunity  to  do  so.  The  South  African  delegation
     recorded two votes against and one vote in favour of  the  motion.  The
     motion was defeated and the Governing Council thus endorsed the  report
     of the Executive Committee.


     The Governing Council was informed that the Parliament of Thailand  had
     agreed to consider hosting the 110th  Assembly  in  2004.  The  Union's
     members received the offer by acclamation  and  the  Governing  Council
     formally requested Thailand to assume the responsibility of hosting the
     event.


     The Governing Council approved the Executive Committee's recommendation
     for the membership of the  committee  that  would  prepare  the  Second
     Conference  of  Presiding  Officers  of   National   Parliaments.   The
     Preparatory Committee would hold its first meeting at IPU  Headquarters
     in Geneva on 26 and 27 January 2004.


     Elections were held  to  fill  the  nine  vacancies  on  the  Executive
     Committee. Following  consultations  in  the  Africa  Group,  the  four
     vacancies due to the Africa Group were filled by  candidates  from  the
     Libyan  Arab  Jamahiriya,  Namibia,  Kenya  and  Togo.  The   remaining
     vacancies were filled by other geopolitical groups. Elections were also
     held to fill vacancies  on  the  other  subsidiary  committees  of  the
     Governing Council.


     The Governing Council approved  the  following  agenda  for  the  110th
     Assembly:


     i.     Election of the  President  and  Vice-Presidents  of  the  110th
         Assembly


     ii.    Consideration of possible  requests  for  the  inclusion  of  an
         emergency item in the Assembly agenda


     iii.   General debate on the political, economic and  social  situation
         in  the  world  with  the  overall  theme  of  "Reconciliation  and
         Partnership"


     iv.     Promoting  international  reconciliation,  helping   to   bring
         stability to regions of conflict, and assisting with  post-conflict
         reconstruction


         Under  this   item,   the   First   Committee   will   debate   the
         responsibilities  of  the  IPU  and   the   broader   international
         community  in  peace-making  and  peace-building,  with  particular
         reference to  the  IPU's  mission  to  help  build  and  strengthen
         representative institutions.
         (Committee on Peace and International Security)


     v.     Working  towards  an  equitable  environment  for  international
         commerce: the issues of trade  in  agricultural  products  and  the
         access to basic medicines


        Under this item, the Second Committee will debate the role  of  the
         IPU and parliaments in following up the  parliamentary  declaration
         adopted in Cancun on the occasion  of  the  Fifth  WTO  Ministerial
         Meeting.
        (Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade)


     vi.    Furthering parliamentary democracy in  order  to  protect  human
         rights and encourage reconciliation among peoples  and  partnership
         among nations


         Under this item, the Third  Committee  will  discuss  the  role  of
         parliamentary democracy in defending  human  rights  and  promoting
         reconciliation. It will also look at issues  relating  to  justice,
         truth commissions, amnesties, pardons, reparations and other  means
         to bring reconciliation to parties riven by conflict.
         (Committee on Democracy and Human Rights)


     3.     Assembly


     The Assembly met on  1  October  2003.  The  President  of  the  Inter-
     Parliamentary Union was elected President of the Assembly. The Assembly
     proceeded to consider the following items on its agenda.


     Emergency item


     The Assembly had before it  two  proposals  for  the  inclusion  as  an
     emergency item. The first proposal,  submitted  by  the  delegation  of
     Chile, entitled "The political situation in Cuba",  was  ruled  as  not
     fulfilling the conditions for an emergency item under the rules of  the
     Assembly and therefore could not be considered.


     The second proposal was submitted by the delegation of  the  Parliament
     of  Indonesia  and  was  entitled  "Parliamentary   support   for   the
     implementation of the road map for peace  in  putting  an  end  to  the
     Palestinian-Israeli  conflict  and  achieving  a  comprehensive   peace
     process and justice in the Middle East".


     The delegation of Israel objected to certain paragraphs  of  the  draft
     resolution submitted in support of the proposal but did not oppose  the
     title of the  item  or  its  inclusion  in  the  Assembly  agenda.  The
     inclusion of the item was approved by consensus.


     Following the recommendation of the  Steering  Committee,  the  Council
     referred the item to the Committee on Middle  East  Questions  to  hold
     consultations among the members and to prepare a draft  resolution  for
     the Assembly.


     A debate on the emergency item took  place  and  was  followed  by  the
     adoption of the draft resolution by consensus. The delegations of Iran,
     Yemen, Palestine and Israel expressed reservations on certain parts  of
     the resolution. The delegation of South Africa abstained from approving
     the resolution.


     The text of the resolution is attached as annexure A.


     The role of parliaments  in  assisting  multilateral  organizations  in
     ensuring peace and security and in building an international  coalition
     for peace


     The First  Standing  Committee  on  Peace  and  International  Security
     considered this item. The Committee had before it a  report  and  draft
     resolution prepared by the rapporteurs as well as  proposed  amendments
     submitted  within  the  statutory  deadline,  including  the   proposed
     amendment submitted by Mr Gibson.


     During the debate on the item, Ms Mahlangu-Nkabinde took the floor. Her
     speech focused on poverty eradication and  underdevelopment.  She  said
     that the international campaign against terrorism should not  push  the
     eradication of  poverty  and  underdevelopment  off  the  international
     agenda and that it was crucial that countries should work  together  to
     find ways of improving people's access to food because the lack of food
     security inadvertently leads to a  high  incidence  of  lawlessness  as
     people are forced to use illegal means to get access to food.
     Following the debate, the  Committee  appointed  a  drafting  committee
     composed of delegates from 13 countries,  including  South  Africa.  Mr
     Gibson participated on  the  drafting  committee  on  behalf  of  South
     Africa.


     The drafting committee examined the draft resolution submitted  by  the
     rapporteurs and amended it. The  drafting  committee  then  prepared  a
     draft resolution, which was subjected to a  vote  and  adopted  by  the
     Committee. This decision was  endorsed  by  consensus  by  the  plenary
     sitting of the Assembly. The delegation of  the  Syrian  Arab  Republic
     presented reservations on the resolution.


     The text of the resolution is attached as Annexure B.


     Global public goods: a new challenge for parliaments


     The Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development,  Finance  and
     Trade considered this item. The Committee had before it  a  report  and
     draft resolution prepared  by  the  rapporteurs  as  well  as  proposed
     amendments submitted within the statutory deadline.


     During the debate on the item, Ms Dlulane took the floor. In her speech
     she pointed out that it was of concern that the  globalisation  process
     had  deepened  the  technological,  trade  and  financial  gap  between
     developed and developing countries and added that the central focus  of
     international development efforts should be the creation of an enabling
     environment where developing countries would be  able  to  acquire  the
     requisite capacities and resources in order to address  their  economic
     and social development problems in a sustainable manner.


     Following the debate, the  Committee  appointed  a  drafting  committee
     composed of delegates from nine countries.
     The drafting committee scrutinized the draft  resolution  submitted  by
     the rapporteurs and amended it. The drafting committee then prepared  a
     draft resolution, which was put to a vote and adopted by the Committee.
     This decision was endorsed by consensus by the plenary sitting  of  the
     Assembly. The delegation of  India  expressed  reservation  on  certain
     parts of the text.


     The text of the resolution is attached as Annexure C.


     The contribution of new information and communication  technologies  to
     good governance, the improvement of  parliamentary  democracy  and  the
     management of globalisation


     The Third Standing Committee on Democracy and Human  Rights  considered
     the above item.  The  Committee  had  before  it  a  report  and  draft
     resolution prepared by the rapporteurs as well as  proposed  amendments
     submitted within the statutory deadline.
     Following the debate, the  Committee  appointed  a  drafting  committee
     composed of delegates from ten countries, including  South  Africa.  Mr
     Van der Merwe participated on the drafting committee on behalf of South
     Africa.


     The drafting committee examined the draft resolution submitted  by  the
     rapporteurs and amended it. The  drafting  committee  then  prepared  a
     draft resolution, which was submitted  to  a  vote  and  adopted.  This
     decision was endorsed by  consensus  by  the  plenary  sitting  of  the
     Assembly.


     The text of the resolution is attached as Annexure D


     4.     Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians


     The Committee met on 30 September, with  its  President,  Ms  Mahlangu-
     Nkabinde in the chair.


     The Committee took stock of follow-up by women parliamentarians to  the
     IPU/UN Handbook on the CEDAW, which was launched in Santiago, Chile. It
     also took note of the actions taken by several members in support of Ms
     Amina Lawal, a  Nigerian  woman  sentenced  to  death  by  stoning  for
     adultery, which contributed to her acquittal.


     The Committee discussed the situation of women's participation  at  IPU
     Assemblies, and the IPU budget and efforts to ensure that it included a
     gender perspective. There was also a  debate  on  the  difficulties  in
     implementing article 23.2 of the IPU Statutes, which  seeks  to  ensure
     that at least three women sat on the Executive Committee.

ANNEXURE A


     PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROAD MAP FOR  PEACE
     IN PUTTING AN END TO THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT AND  ACHIEVING  A
     COMPREHENSIVE PEACE PROCESS AND JUSTICE IN THE MIDDLE EAST


     The 109th Inter-Parliamentary Assembly,


     Recalling its resolutions adopted at the 104th Conference, October 2000
     (Jakarta), at the 106th Conference, September 2001  (Ouagadougou),  and
     at the 107th  Conference, March 2002 (Marrakech), which called  for  an
     end to the tension and violence in the Middle East,


     Reiterating its  support  for  a  just  and  lasting  solution  to  the
     Palestinian-Israeli conflict  based  on  the  relevant  United  Nations
     resolutions,
     Recognising the full acceptance by the  Palestinian  Authority  of  the
     road map for peace proposed by the  Quartet  (the  United  States,  the
     United Nations, the European Union  and  the  Russian  Federation)  and
     noting the subsequent conditional acceptance of it by Israel,
     1.     Strongly urges the international community to exert pressure  on
         Israel to desist from any act aimed at the expulsion  of  President
         Yasser Arafat and to  cease  all  threats  to  the  safety  of  the
         legitimately elected head of the Palestinian Authority;


     2.     Urges Israel to halt the building of settlements in the occupied
         territories, which, along with the demolition of Palestinian  homes
         and property, is in contravention of the Fourth  Geneva  Convention
         and the road map, to abandon its  policy  of  erecting  fences  and
         imposing paralysing closures, and to stop using  its  regular  army
         to  police  the  civilian  population  and  conduct   extrajudicial
         killings in the occupied territories;


     3.     Demands  that  the  Palestinian  Authority  take  all  necessary
         measures to put an end to the violent attacks that  result  in  the
         deaths of large numbers of civilians and innocent people;
     4.     Urges Israel  to  withdraw  completely  from  all  the  occupied
         territories in order to achieve a comprehensive peace  process  and
         justice in the Middle East in accordance with  United  Nations  and
         IPU resolutions;


     5.     Calls on the UN Security Council and the  Quartet  to  guarantee
         the full implementation of  the  road  map,  including  by  sending
         international   observers    to    monitor    the    stage-by-stage
         implementation on the ground of  the  decisions  contained  in  the
         road map;


     6.     Calls on both parties to return to the negotiating table and put
         an end to the cycle of violence in order  to  save  lives  on  both
         sides, urges the parties  to  enact  confidence-building  measures,
         and  encourages  them  to  reach  an   accord   through   bilateral
         negotiations within the framework of the road map;


     7.     Calls also on both  parties  immediately  to  begin  considering
         building  a  lasting   peace   through   education   for   peaceful
         coexistence.

ANNEXURE B


     THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENTS  IN  ASSISTING  MULTILATERAL  ORGANISATIONS  IN
     ENSURING PEACE AND SECURITY AND IN BUILDING AN INTERNATIONAL  COALITION
     FOR PEACE


     The 109th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


     Noting the importance of parliaments as the  cornerstone  of  democracy
     and their role in promoting peace,


     Considering that peace and justice are  two  interdependent  issues  of
     fundamental importance to humankind,


     Noting that peace is not only a political issue defined by the  absence
     of violence and war and that it also  encompasses  cultural,  economic,
     social and educational issues,


     Recognising that not only physical violence but also increasingly acute
     social, cultural and ethnic tensions,  such  as  those  resulting  from
     severe pollution, impoverishment  of  the  environment,  corruption  or
     poverty, aggravate the threat to peace and security,


     Concerned moreover that the mass of weaponry  produced  throughout  the
     world is a threat to the human race, as well as an  enormous  waste  of
     resources in terms of human labour, financial investment, and the  cost
     of stockpiling and deployment,


     Recognising the fact that  terrorism,  including  State  terrorism  and
     State-sponsored terrorism, has affected many countries of the world  in
     a variety of ways for several decades,


     Observing that, in the final decade of the last century and  the  first
     years of the present one, peace and security worldwide are still  under
     threat from terrorism  in  all  its  forms  and  manifestations,  armed
     internal  conflicts,  aggression,   wars   between   members   of   the
     international community, occupation and weapons of mass destruction,


     Aware that terrorism and organised  crime,  especially  trafficking  in
     weapons, drugs and human beings, are often  closely  interrelated,  and
     welcoming in this context the recent entry into  force  of  the  United
     Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime,


     Drawing attention to UN Security Council  resolutions  1368  (2001)  of
     12 September 2001 and 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001,


     Mindful that, to prevent security from being threatened,  joint  global
     counteractive measures are required to combat environmental problems,


     Convinced that parliamentarians can play an  important  role  in  early
     conflict prevention,
     Reaffirming its position that internal conflicts in all  countries  and
     their spread into other countries can be averted through mutual respect
     and coexistence among the various religious and ethnic groups, as  well
     as through dialogue and openness and a comprehensive  and  anticipatory
     development  policy  comprising   political,   economic,   social   and
     environmental elements,


     Also  reaffirming  IPU  resolutions  Achieving  peace,  stability   and
     comprehensive development in the world and  forging  closer  political,
     economic and cultural  ties  among  peoples  (103rd Conference,  Amman,
     April-May 2000), Financing  for  development  and  a  new  paradigm  of
     economic and social development designed to  eradicate  poverty  (104th
     Conference,  Jakarta,  October  2000),  Securing  observance   of   the
     principles of international law in the interests  of  world  peace  and
     security (105th Conference, Havana, April 2001), Ten years  after  Rio:
     global degradation of the environment and parliamentary support for the
     Kyoto  Protocol  (107th Conference,   Marrakech,   March   2002),   and
     Importance of the non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
     weapons of mass destruction and of missiles, including  the  prevention
     of their use by terrorists (108th Conference, Santiago de Chile,  April
     2003),


     Convinced that strengthening  democracy,  promoting  human  rights  and
     supporting the peaceful settlement of conflicts are the most  effective
     means of combating terrorism,


     Concerned that the United Nations  system  has  often  been  unable  to
     prevent wars  between  members  of  the  international  community,  and
     reaffirming the paramount importance  of  all  States  abiding  by  the
     United Nations Charter and resolutions,


     Mindful  of  the  importance  of  international  instruments   on   the
     protection of fundamental human rights and liberties, for men and women
     alike,
     Welcoming  and  fully  supporting  United  Nations   Security   Council
     resolution 1325 (2000), entitled "Women and peace  and  security",  and
     bearing in mind the specific recommendations on women and war  made  in
     the Beijing Platform for  Action,  and  the  outcome  document  of  the
     "Beijing+5" Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly,


     Stressing that  education,  particularly  human  rights  education,  is
     essential, and recognising the positive role that children can play  in
     building a culture of peace,


     Aware of the significant roles played by  different  sectors  of  civil
     society and of the importance of their cooperation with parliaments  to
     foster democracy, peace and security,


     1.     Calls on governments and parliaments to  promote  reconciliation
         processes aimed at  achieving  sustainable  solutions  to  internal
         conflicts;
     2.     Also calls on all parliaments to do everything possible  at  the
         national  level  to  facilitate  the  establishment   of   standing
         mechanisms for conflict prevention and  resolution,  as  a  way  to
         promote action geared to achieving real peace;


     3.     Further calls on all parliamentarians to work hard to limit  the
         effects of war on civilians, whom they represent,  particularly  as
         regards the vulnerable situation of  women  and  children  and  the
         consequences of rape;


     4.      Emphasises  the  need  for  better  control  of   small   arms,
         encompassing the trading, trafficking and smuggling of small  arms,
         in order to reduce the risk of violent conflicts;


     5.     Unequivocally condemns terrorism as a criminal act, noting  that
         terrorism endangers the  territorial  integrity  of  countries  and
         their national and international security, destroys innocent  lives
         and the physical and economic infrastructure, and destabilises  not
         only legitimately constituted governments but society as a whole;


     6.     Emphasises the need for the Inter-Parliamentary Union  to  focus
         more closely on the issue of terrorism and its root causes, and  to
         work  with  the  international  community  on   a   definition   of
         terrorism;


     7.     Vigorously condemns all terrorist acts, methods  and  practices,
         and considers them criminal  and  unjustifiable,  wherever  and  by
         whomever they are committed;


     8.     Strongly urges all States and governments worldwide  to  refrain
         from funding or encouraging terrorist activity,  supporting  it  by
         any other means,  providing  training  for  it  or  allowing  their
         territory to be used for organising  terrorist  activities  against
         other States, individuals or groups of individuals;


     9.     Urges the Inter-Parliamentary Union to  cooperate  closely  with
         the Counter-Terrorism Committee established under Security  Council
         resolution  1373  (2001)  and  the  Vienna-based   United   Nations
         Terrorism Prevention Branch, and to promote the  implementation  of
         the Global Programme against Terrorism;


     10.    Invites all States to consider, if they have not  yet  done  so,
         acceding  to  and/or  ratifying   international   instruments,   as
         appropriate, in particular the Protocols additional to  the  Geneva
         Conventions and the Rome  Statute  establishing  the  International
         Criminal Court,  and  recalls  that,  in  establishing  the  crimes
         falling within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  International  Criminal
         Court, the latter's Statute defines rape, sexual slavery,  enforced
         prostitution, forced  pregnancy,  enforced  sterilisation,  or  any
         other form  of  sexual  violence  both  as  war  crimes  and,  when
         committed as part of a widespread  or  systematic  attack  directed
         against any civilian population, as crimes against humanity;


     11.    Reaffirms its deep apprehension at the increase in terrorism and
         therefore:


         (a)     Reiterates its call to the world's parliaments  to  promote
              consensus on the  United  Nations  conventions  on  terrorism,
              referring  in  this  connection  to  the  resolution  entitled
              Terrorism - a threat to  democracy,  human  rights  and  civil
              society:  the  contribution  of   parliaments   to   combating
              international terrorism and addressing its causes in order  to
              maintain international peace  and  security,  adopted  by  the
              107th Conference, Marrakech, March 2002;


         (b)     Stresses the need to confront the exercise  of  terror  and
              eliminate the causes that lead to its development,  and  urges
              all  States  to  enhance  cooperation  in  the  fight  against
              terrorism in all its forms and manifestations;


         (c)     Reaffirms its commitment to eliminate any  perception  that
              the fight against terrorism is also a fight against particular
              cultures, peoples or religions;


         (d)     Calls for the  enhancement  of  national  and  multilateral
              export administration systems as part  of  the  fight  against
              terrorism;


         (e)     Calls on each  country  to  ratify  promptly  the  relevant
              international and regional treaties, conventions and protocols
              against terrorism;


         (f)     Calls on  parliaments  to  support  the  elaboration  of  a
              comprehensive  United  Nations  convention  on   international
              terrorism,  and  of  an  international  convention   for   the
              suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism;


     12.    Calls on all parliamentarians  to  press  their  governments  to
         sign, accede to and ratify all  international  instruments  drafted
         to eliminate the world's arsenal of weapons;


     13.    Calls the international community's attention to  the  need  for
         best efforts to resolve these issues  as  peacefully  as  possible,
         and expresses the IPU's firm determination to  become  involved  in
         global cooperation  for  resolving  such  issues  through  dialogue
         among parliamentarians and cooperation with relevant  international
         bodies, thus contributing to world peace and security;


     14.    Calls on all countries to intensify efforts to prevent and  curb
         the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass   destruction,   and   to
         consolidate  policies  for  preventing  equipment,  materials   and
         technology which may possibly be  used  for  any  proliferation  of
         such weapons from being transferred, especially to terrorists;


     15.    Recognises the need for a  reform  of  the  United  Nations,  in
         particular by enlarging  the  Security  Council  to  make  it  more
         representative and effective in addressing issues of  international
         peace and security;


     16.    Agrees that peace at a global level can only be achieved through
         dialogue, within the framework of international law;


     17.    Calls on the United Nations to place peace, an  issue  of  grave
         human concern, on the agenda of its General Assembly meetings;


     18.    Calls on the Inter-Parliamentary Union to exercise its right  as
         an observer to the United Nations to speak during  security  policy
         debates in the United Nations General Assembly;


     19.     Views  with  great  concern  the   continuing   occupation   of
         territories belonging to  other  nations,  while  noting  that  any
         attempts to disrupt partially or totally  the  national  unity  and
         territorial integrity  of  a  country  are  incompatible  with  the
         purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;


     20.    Calls on the multilateral organisations to  support  efforts  to
         achieve the following:


         (a)     The immediate termination of all forms of occupation;


         (b)      The  formal  recognition  of  the  responsibility  of  all
              occupying  forces  for  the  remedy  of  all  ills  caused  by
              occupation,  including  the  misappropriation  of   resources,
              damage to infrastructure, deterioration of the environment and
              impediments to  economic,  social,  cultural  and  educational
              achievement;


         (c)     The qualification  of  occupation  as  an  infringement  of
              international law;


     21.    Stresses the importance for the United Nations  to  enhance  its
         involvement and play a key role in the  reconstruction  process  in
         Iraq, so as to allow the Iraqi people to  decide  independently  on
         the  measures  which  they  find  most  suitable  and   which   are
         compatible with their aspirations;


     22.    Further stresses that Article 2 of the  United  Nations  Charter
         should be observed in both letter and  spirit  and  that,  although
         the  IPU  and  other  multilateral  organisations  involved  should
         assist the Iraqi people in their endeavour to regenerate their  own
         State, no attempt should be tolerated  to  impose  upon  them  what
         they do not voluntarily accept;


     23.    Agrees that efforts to promote the concept and culture of  peace
         and  to  renounce  violence  should  be  encouraged  by   fostering
         intercultural and inter-faith  understanding  and  respect  and  by
         eliminating all forms of discrimination;


     24.    Calls on parliaments and governments to strengthen  measures  to
         combat poverty, corruption and  environmental  destruction  through
         international cooperation, and to devote attention  to  the  gender
         implications of conflict;


     25.    Also calls on governments to  ensure  that  education  seeks  to
         promote respect and understanding, free from  false  indoctrination
         and hatred in various forms;


     26.    Further calls on parliaments to  support  national  efforts  and
         international cooperation aimed at  promoting  education  for  all,
         while paying special attention  to  human  rights  education  as  a
         means of fostering the culture of peace;


     27.    Encourages all parliamentarians to urge  their  governments  and
         political parties to promote social justice as a guarantee for  the
         establishment of lasting peace;


     28.    Also encourages parliaments to  support  NGOs,  including  those
         which seek to promote peace through art in all its forms.

ANNEXURE C


     GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS: A NEW CHALLENGE FOR PARLIAMENTS


     The 109th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


     Recognising the increased globalisation and interdependence among world
     economies, and the enormous importance acquired by Global Public Goods,


     Stressing the importance of the United Nations  Millennium  Declaration
     in increasing political and economic stability and  reducing  worldwide
     poverty,


     Recognising the need for disseminating the  concept  of  Global  Public
     Goods as a new rationale for international cooperation,


     Emphasising  the  collective  responsibility  of  nations   to   debate
     resolutions to accelerate the  process  of  development  assistance  by
     helping determine,  with  the  appropriate  parliamentary  debates  and
     national consultations of constituent groups, the definition of  Global
     Public Goods and the way to finance them,


     Noting the emphasis placed on Global Public Goods by  the  World  Bank,
     the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union  in  tackling  the
     problem of world food security,


     Further noting that a definition of Global  Public  Goods  will  enable
     governments to have a greater influence on  the  development  of  their
     countries, especially with respect to provision of such  goods  at  the
     domestic level,


     Considering the impact of Global Public Goods on neighbouring countries
     and regions,


     Emphasising that the consumption of traditionally defined Global Public
     Goods by one  person  does  not  reduce  the  possible  consumption  by
     another, irrespective of income levels,


     Acknowledging  that  countries   have   differing   incomes,   economic
     structures and social priorities,


     1.     Calls on both developed and developing  countries  to  recognise
         that Global Public Goods have trans-national effects and  therefore
         require joint assumption of responsibility;


     2.     Calls on both developed and developing countries to  promote  an
         active  debate  among  public   policy   makers,   civil   society,
         businesses and academia, while stimulating further research on  the
         subject of Global Public Goods;


     3.     Urges governments, parliaments, international organisations  and
         donor agencies to channel financial resources  to  poor  countries,
         especially those in the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries  (HIPC)
         category, and to pay  special  attention  to  the  debt  burden  of
         developing countries, which  hinders  them  from  providing  Global
         Public Goods at the domestic level;


     4.     Emphasises the need for  close  cooperation  among  governments,
         parliaments, businesses, international organisations  and  NGOs  if
         Global Public Goods are to play a role in the pursuit  of  economic
         growth, which is necessary for the eradication  of  world  poverty,
         but  which  should  not  be  achieved  at  the   expense   of   the
         environment;


     5.      Urges  the  representatives  of  States  to  meet  to  evaluate
         preferences for Global Public Goods that cross borders;


     6.     Encourages governments jointly  to  identify  and  rank  various
         Global Public Goods in order of financial feasibility and  ease  of
         implementation in order to lessen friction arising from the  choice
         of alternatives;


     7.     Stresses the need to build financial solutions on the  principle
         that nobody should be able to gain from Global Public Goods at  the
         expense of another person and on the principles agreed upon at  the
         UN Summit Meetings, for example the "polluter pays" principle;


     8.     Urges the governments of developed and developing  countries  to
         ensure that Global Public Goods are not financed at the expense  of
         traditional sources of development finance;


     9.      Calls  on  governments  to  convene  in  a  forum  to  exchange
         information   about   various   financing   mechanisms,   including
         innovative use of private sources of funding, to be managed  within
         the framework of the World Solidarity Fund adopted  by  the  United
         Nations on 20 December 2002;


     10.    Calls on the IPU Member parliaments to encourage governments  to
         adopt, if  required,  the  legal  frameworks  needed  to  institute
         agreed  financing  mechanisms,  and  to  monitor  the  pursuit   by
         governments of the above-mentioned objectives.

ANNEXURE D


     THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION  TECHNOLOGIES  TO
     GOOD GOVERNANCE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF  PARLIAMENTARY  DEMOCRACY  AND  THE
     MANAGEMENT OF GLOBALISATION


     The 109th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


     Hoping that the new information and communication technologies  (NICTs)
     will help to build a more peaceful, more prosperous  and  fairer  world
     based on global public goods in all their diversity,


     Convinced  that  the  NICTs  can  bring  about  significant  political,
     economic and social changes that will reduce distances and generate new
     cultures and markets, although they give rise to concerns  as  well  as
     hopes,


     Also convinced that the NICTs play an increasingly  important  role  in
     socio-cultural,  economic  and  political  development  in  an  era  of
     globalisation,
     Mindful that the  NICTs  facilitate  the  sharing  of  knowledge  among
     peoples,


     Fully supporting  the  forthcoming  World  Summit  on  the  Information
     Society, as a unique opportunity to foster  the  global  consensus  and
     commitment required to harness the power of the NICTs to advance  human
     development,


     Mindful that the NICTs as such are not  the  solution  to  the  world's
     problems but rather tools, mechanisms and  opportunities  that  require
     the political will of society and cooperation among States in order  to
     ensure  that  they  serve  the  goals  pursued  at  the  national   and
     international level,


     Emphasising the many financial, economic and  social  restrictions  and
     barriers hindering the  use  of  the  NICTs  in  developing  societies,
     including inadequate financial resources to cover the huge  investments
     needed in this field, a shortage of  managers  and  skilled  personnel,
     weak demand for such services due to limited purchasing power  and  low
     incomes, and the rising costs of the services provided by the NICTs,


     Recalling that good governance requires, within each country and at the
     international level, an ethic for the management of the State  and  its
     resources based on principles and norms that  include  requirements  of
     transparency, accountability, communication, respect for  the  rule  of
     law, an independent judiciary and a liberal and democratic  State  that
     protects human rights, guarantees clear rules  for  the  free  play  of
     market forces and favours the unfettered development of  civil  society
     in all its  cultural,  economic,  societal  and  political  dimensions,
     enabling it to exercise a democratic power of initiative and oversight,


     Underscoring that traditional means of communication, transparency  and
     accountability, no matter how indispensable, can  be  enhanced  by  the
     NICTs to further good management of governance,
     Recalling that the NICTs facilitate the defence and promotion of  human
     rights and gender equality,


     Asserting that without an appropriate public policy, the  NICTs  cannot
     be a factor of shared progress,


     Noting that the majority of the developing countries have lagged behind
     the North in the economic and social field, fearing that the  extremely
     rapid development of the NICTs may further  widen  the  digital  divide
     between industrialised and developing countries,  and  recognising  the
     need to narrow the gap,


     Placing great importance on mutual cooperation  between  industrialised
     and developing countries for  further  promotion  of  the  NICTs  on  a
     worldwide basis,


     Acknowledging that the NICTs can enhance but do not obviate the duty of
     national parliaments to take responsibility  for  good  governance  and
     parliamentary democracy in their own countries,


     Mindful that if citizens are to fulfil their duties  and  assert  their
     rights, they must be able to access and utilise information,


     Aware that the NICTs can be a very useful tool  for  consolidating  and
     renewing parliamentary democracy by allowing  better  participation  by
     all citizens,


     Noting that the NICTs make it easier to manage and participate  in  the
     globalisation  process,  especially  as  far   as   the   international
     organisations are concerned,


     Hoping that the NICTs will be used  for  development,  and  noting  the
     importance of the NICTs as  an  integral  part  of  efforts  to  combat
     poverty and discrimination and achieve the millennium goals,


     Recalling that the NICTs  advance  education  and  training  which  are
     essential for development and gender equality,


     Mindful that each state has  a  duty  to  ensure  that  the  NICTs  are
     acquired and utilised properly,


     Regretting that the NICTs have to a large  extent  been  used  for  so-
     called spam mail and  destructive  purposes  involving  anti-democratic
     messages and degrading pornographic content and  including  unregulated
     weapons trading,


     1.     Calls on parliaments to support the successful completion of the
         World Summit on the Information Society and to take  the  necessary
         steps to ensure that their  representatives  are  included  in  the
         national delegations to the Summit;


     2.     Calls on parliaments and their members to make full use  of  the
         NICTs:


             to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency  and  transparency  of
              their activities and to better connect with the electorate;


             to expand inter-parliamentary relationships and cooperation  at
              bilateral   and   multilateral    levels,    thus    enhancing
              parliamentary democracy and diplomacy;


     3.     Urges the establishment of appropriate aid mechanisms, including
         an NICTs observatory for Africa and  other  disadvantaged  regions,
         and recommends the establishment of  a  network  of  correspondents
         among IPU member parliaments;


     4.     Recommends that each  parliament  put  in  place  the  necessary
         structures to follow up and monitor annually the development of  e-
         government in its country so as to guarantee its  transparency  for
         citizens and democracy;
     5.     Urges governments to take the necessary  steps  to  ensure  free
         community access to those NICTs that guarantee good governance;


     6.     Calls on the international community to seek  further  means  of
         closing the South's NICT gap;


     7.     Invites the international community to promote NICT training for
         managers and technicians from the South;


     8.      calls  on  international  organisations  and  NGOs  to  promote
         knowledge sharing in  this  area  and  the  establishment  of  NICT
         networks, in cooperation with partners from both the South and  the
         North;


     9.      Urges  governments  to  use  the  NICTs  to  broaden   distance
         education, which can reach groups of people  that  otherwise  would
         not have access to education;


     10.    Draws governments' attention  to  the  need  to  strengthen  the
         personal protection and security of the users of the NICTs  and  to
         strive for legislation on international range;


     11.    Urges governments to find ways to limit the use of spam mail and
         the use of the NICTs for destructive purposes;


     12.    Supports all NICT-related initiatives aimed  at  respecting  and
         promoting linguistic and cultural diversity;


     13.    Calls for the introduction of  national  and  regional  policies
         that incorporate the development of information  and  communication
         infrastructures and existing resources;


     14.    Calls on the international community to promote the use  of  the
         NICTs to enhance civic involvement in public decision-making;
     15.    Also calls on governments to  see  to  it  that  the  NICTs  are
         acquired and  used  properly  with  a  view  to  guaranteeing  good
         governance and avoiding all forms of discrimination;


     16.    Encourages States to put in place national strategies centred on
         education,  including  basic  and   digital   literacy,   for   the
         implementation of the information society;


     17.     Calls  for  strengthened  national  efforts  and  international
         cooperation in order to prevent and combat the  use  of  the  NICTs
         for criminal and terrorist ends;


     18.    Encourages national policies and international action  aimed  at
         ensuring that the NICTs serve gender equality and  the  empowerment
         of women;
     19.    Invites parliaments to take legislative action with the  aim  of
         providing  an   environment   conducive   to   the   dissemination,
         development and secure use of the NICTs;


     20.    Reaffirms the principle of freedom of expression in  cyberspace,
         with the restrictions required  by  the  fight  against  terrorism,
         pornography, trafficking in human beings, organised crime,  racism,
         revisionism and discrimination;


     21.    Stresses the need to facilitate Internet  hook-ups  by  breaking
         the monopoly of  the  telephone  companies  and  promoting  cheaper
         alternative solutions;


     22.    Considers that the  new  technologies  must  help  to  integrate
         generations and social groups;


     23.    Stresses that the IPU can  contribute  to  strengthening  North-
         South  and  South-South  cooperation  in   the   NICT   field   via
         appropriate mechanisms;


     24.     Urges  the  Inter-Parliamentary  Union  to  create  a   climate
         conducive to the advent of the information society by:
              Encouraging the use of  the  NICTs  in  the  organisation  of
              elections  so  as  to  guarantee   the   democratic   process,
              particularly in the countries of the South;


              Strengthening  the  role  of  parliaments  in  following   up
              decisions and resolutions relating to the information  society
              by monitoring and implementing commitments made by governments
              in the NICT field;


              Encouraging parliaments to  commit  themselves  to  knowledge
              acquisition, consultancy and assistance in the NICT field with
              a view to consolidating parliamentary democracy;


              Further helping parliaments  from  emerging  democracies  and
              developing countries to take full advantage of the  NICTs,  by
              means of its technical assistance programmes.

     Recommendations of the Joint  Ad  Hoc  Subcommittee  on  Oversight  and
     Accountability which were adopted by the Joint Rules  Committee  on  25
     March 2003:


         The Report of the Joint Rules Committee on  the  Implementation  of
         the Recommendations of the Joint Ad Hoc Subcommittee  on  Oversight
         and Accountability, dated 17 November 2003, was  published  in  the
         ATC of the same day. The Report did not contain  the  full  set  of
         recommendations of the Subcommittee.


         At its meeting held on 26 November 2003, the Joint Rules  Committee
         resolved that the full set of resolutions contained  in  the  final
         report  of  the  Joint  Ad  Hoc  Subcommittee  on   Oversight   and
         Accountability be published in the ATC.
         The following is  the  full  set  of  resolutions  including  those
         published on 17 November 2003:


         Developing an understanding of oversight


         Recommendation 1


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         1.1      Parliament  through  the  Joint  Rules  Committee   (JRC),
              compiles   a   document   "landscaping"   the   Constitutional
              provisions dealing with the inter-related themes of Oversight,
              Accountability, Transparency and responsiveness, and outlining
              international trends. Such  a  document  should  also  include
              inputs from key constitutional negotiators either in the  form
              of commissioned research or essays, (preferably both).


         1.2     Following  the  tabling  of  the  abovementioned  document,
              debates, workshops and discussions should  be  programmed  and
              organised within Parliament, first  amongst  MP's  themselves,
              and then later on  expanded  to  include  other  stakeholders.
              These debates and discussions should have as  their  objective
              the development of a broad understanding of the Oversight Role
              and Purpose of Parliament within our Constitutional democracy.


         Coordination between the Houses


         Recommendation 2


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         2.1     The JRC initiate a process  aimed  at  drafting  guidelines
              for portfolio and select committees to  allow  inter-alia  for
              joint planning of oversight work.


         2.2     A process should be initiated  to  establish  protocols  to
              ensure structured  communication  between  committees  through
              streamlining of the committee section, which would  allow  for
              more effective and formal communication between committees  of
              both Houses that embark on mutual interest oversight work  and
              briefing sessions.


         Building Parliament's Oversight Capacity


         Recommendation 3


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         3.1     The  Joint  Rules  Committee  begins  a  process  aimed  at
              producing  a  long  term  institutional  Vision  and   Mission
              Statement   aimed   at   building    Parliament's    oversight
              capabilities through adequate resourcing and capacity building
              in committees, Constituency offices  and  within  Parliament's
              administrative  support  structures  -   in   particular   the
              Committee section where a record-keeping system, and  tracking
              mechanisms are required to be established.


         3.2     Parliament adopts a policy requiring  each  new  Parliament
              to assess and review its oversight  capabilities  once  during
              its five-year lifespan.


         Institutions Supporting Democracy


         Recommendation 4


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         The matters of independence  of  the  ISD,  the  more  co-ordinated
         interaction between Parliament and the ISD,  the  effectiveness  of
         the oversight role of  the  ISD,  their  budgetary  procedures  and
         their accountability to  Parliament,  be  the  subject  of  a  more
         extensive  consultation  process  that  should  involve  all  role-
         players. This kind of process we believe  should  be  initiated  by
         Parliament and that it would be for Parliament to decide  how  best
         to engage in this process.


         Developing and Institutional Memory


         Recommendation 5


         The Subcommittee recommends that:
         Parliament, urgently takes measures  to  develop  a  Best  Practice
         Guide  to  capture  inter-alia  the  best  oversight  practices  of
         committees and the experiences of chairpersons  of  various  Select
         and Portfolio Committees.


         Fine tuning and development of Oversight Mechanisms


         Recommendation 6


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         6.1     Parliament commissions  an  audit  of  the  various  bodies
         exercising public powers pr performing public functions  and  which
         should  in  addition  be  clearly  delineate  which  line  function
         departments are  responsible  for  the  various  organs  of  state.
         Portfolio   and   Select   Committees   within   parliament    will
         consequently assume the necessary oversight responsibility.


         6.2     Parliament through the  JRC  develops  a  policy  aimed  at
         meeting its constitutional obligations set out in s 55(2)(b)(ii).


         6.3     Such a policy  should  consider  the  necessity  for  basic
         legislation giving effect to s 55(2) on  issues  of  oversight  and
         accountability  and  dealing  especially  with  organs   of   state
         directly accountable to Parliament.


         6.4     The JRC develops a policy  allowing  for  more  debates  on
         committee oversight reports to be programmed. These debates  should
         take the form of MPs raising issues of concern based on the  report
         tabled and Ministers responding to those issues.


         Introducing Oversight Mechanisms: Accountability Standards Act


         Recommendation 7*


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         Option 1
         Parliament  should  begin  a  formal  process  of  evaluating   its
         oversight activities as distinct  from  its  legislative  role  and
         developing a manual on Accountability and  Oversight  for  MPs  and
         Committees,  with  the  intention  of  constantly  developing   and
         refining such a manual.


         Option 2
         Parliament should adopt  the  recommendation  as  proposed  by  the
         consultant's that an Accountability Standards Act be enacted.


         (* Joint Rules Committee still has to decide  on  which  option  to
         adopt)


         Bringing Parliament's oversight role to bear on the Budget Process


         Recommendation 8


         The Subcommittee noting the  inextricable  link  between  effective
         Parliamentary  oversight  and  Parliament's  role  in  the   budget
         process recommends that:


         Parliament develops a formal process to enact legislation in  terms
         of section 77(2) of the Constitution.
