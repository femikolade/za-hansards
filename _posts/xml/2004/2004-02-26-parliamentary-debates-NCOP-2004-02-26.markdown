 THE NEED FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO REVISIT ITS POLICY OF QUIET DIPLOMACY TOWARDS
                                  ZIMBABWE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I move without notice:


  That the House notes -


  (1) that the European Union has agreed to renew sanctions imposed  on  an
       extended list of 95 of  the  ruling  elite  of   Zimbabwe,  including
       President Mugabe;


  (2) further notes the recent SACP statement reported in the Business  Day
       of 19 February 2004, that "a lawless, populist-inspired land-grab  by
       an elite in the inner circles of government was a cruel caricature of
       the kind of land reform that the rurul poor required";


  (3) recognises that some 34% of the  Zimbabwean  population  has  already
       been displaced from Zimbabwe and that this is worsening by  the  day,
       and therefore calls upon the Government to revise its policy of quiet
       diplomacy and inaction which is interpreted as tacit  acceptance  and
       support for President Robert Mugabe.

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  an
objection? [Interjections.] There is an objection. In view of the  objection
the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion  without  notice  will  now
become a notice of motion.

 DA MP'S SPEECH DEMONSTRATES DA'S REGRESSION TO THE "SWART GEVAAR" ATTITUDE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met kommer kennis neem van die feit dat die DA terug is  by  die  dae
       van swart gevaar;


  (2) ook kennis neem van die uitspraak  van  die  Wes-Kaapse  DA-leier  en
       -premierskandidaat Theuns Botha dat hy vermoed dat die  ANC  se  skim
       premierskandidaat swart is en dat die  ANC  die  identiteit  van  die
       kandidaat geheim hou omdat dit glo bruin stemme  kan  beïnvloed,  wat
       niks anders as laakbare rassistiese politiek is wat poog om ou  vrese
       van swart gevaar onder sekere gemeenskappe aan te wakker nie;


  (3) bevestig dat hy gister, 26 Februarie 2004, 'n besluit  aangeneem  het
       waarin 'n ernstige beroep gedoen is op alle Suid-Afrikaners om by  te
       dra tot die  bou  van  'n  nasionale  konsensus  wat  op  ware  Suid-
       Afrikaanse patriotisme gebaseer is en wat  as  'n  sleutel-instrument
       sal dien om ons samelewing werklik nie-rassig te maak, waarmee die DA
       in hierdie Raad saamgestem het; en


  (4) hierdie uitspraak dus met  minagting  verwerp  en  mnr  Theuns  Botha
       versoek om sy mede-DA-kollegas in hierdie Raad, asook alle welmenende
       Suid-Afrikaners om verskoning te vra vir sy laakbare optrede.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the fact that the DA has returned to the  days  of
       "swart gevaar";


  (2) also notes the statement by the Western Cape DA leader and  candidate
       for premier, Theuns Botha, that he suspects  that  the  ANC's  shadow
       candidate for premier is black  and  that  the  ANC  is  keeping  the
       identity of  the  candidate  secret  because  this  could  apparently
       influence coloured votes, which is nothing but  reprehensible  racist
       politics which attempt to stir up old  fears  of  "swart  gevaar"  in
       certain communities;


  (3) confirms that yesterday, 26 February 2004,  it  took  a  decision  in
       which a serious appeal was made to all South Africans  to  contribute
       to the building of a national consensus based on true  South  African
       patriotism as a key instrument to truly make our  society  nonracial,
       with which the DA in this Council agreed; and
  (4) therefore rejects this statement with contempt and requests Mr Theuns
       Botha to apologise to his fellow DA colleagues in  this  Council,  as
       well  as  all  well-meaning  South  Africans  for  his  reprehensible
       behaviour.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Is there an  objection
to the motion? [Interjections.] In the light of  the  objection  the  motion
may not be proceeded with. The motion  without  notice  will  now  become  a
notice of motion.

    MUNICIPALITY IN THE NORTH WEST, AND SUPPORT FOR FINDINGS OF COMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses unreservedly its gratitude to the ad hoc committee for  its
       oversight work carried out in the evaluation of the  intervention  in
       the Lekwa Teemane Municipality in North West;


  (2) supports the findings of the committee and agrees  that  intervention
       by the provincial government is in fact necessary;


  (3) resolves that the matter be referred to the committee to -


       (a)   pay  special  attention  to  the  nature  and  scope   of   the
           recommendation in respect of the intervention;


       (b)  engage and consult with the Department of Provincial  and  Local
           Government and other relevant stakeholders to ascertain what the
           appropriate intervention should be in terms of  section  139(1);
           and


       (c)  stipulate clearly the nature of the intervention;


  (4) requests the committee to  report  back  to  it  by  not  later  than
       Thursday, 4 March 2004; and


  (5) resolves that the relevant item be removed from the Order  Paper  for
       further consideration and report by the ad hoc committee.

I may add, Chairperson, that I  have  conferred  with  the  other  political
parties, except for Mr Durr, whom I could not reach.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          COMMUNAL LAND RIGHTS BILL

                 (Consideration of Bill and Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you very  much,  Deputy
Chairperson, hon members, ladies and gentlemen. It is  with  great  pleasure
that today, here in this House,  the  NCOP,  we've  got  an  opportunity  to
debate the most important legislation that  will  finally  create  a  better
land dispensation in our country's rural areas  and  ensure  that,  for  the
first time over the years, our people living in those areas can  have  their
land rights fully recognised by law.

You will recall, Chairperson and hon members, that for a  number  of  years,
communities living on communal land in rural areas always had the  state  as
a guardian,  the  state  having  nominal  trusteeship  over  their  land,  a
different dispensation to that which a number of us living  in  urban  areas
actually had - what choice we wanted  to  make,  and  what  type  of  tenure
rights we wanted to have. Indeed, this remained a  situation  in  which  our
rural communities, in terms of land ownership,  were  in  some  way  second-
class citizens.

The Constitution we passed in 1996 challenged us  to  make  everyone's  land
tenure rights secure. It outlines various mechanisms  of  how  we  would  do
that, by recognising the need for land reform as a critical process  in  our
democratic dispensation.

Land  reform,  therefore,  in  our   policy   included   land   restitution,
redistribution and tenure reform. Members will agree with  me  that  in  the
other areas of land reform, such as restitution  and  redistribution,  we've
laid the basis, and our delivery of land  to  those  who  were  historically
dispossessed speaks for itself.

Yes, we agree that there is a need for improvement. However, on  matters  of
tenure reform, this House, last year, when debating  the  land  Budget  also
acknowledged  that  more  still  needed  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  our
constitutional obligation with regard to tenure reform could be met.

In trying to deal with the issue of tenure reform, I think  it  is  possible
that when we examine, we can look and agree that, yes, some  work  has  been
done in this regard. We ensured that the rights  that  people  had,  however
informal, should be protected in terms of law; hence the Interim  Protection
of Informal Land Rights Act had to be promulgated.

The Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act was one such measure. The Extension  of
Security of Tenure Act was also put in  place  to  guard  against  arbitrary
evictions of people who work on farms, whose tenure rights,  linked  to  the
land on which they work, are also protected.

These measures, hon members, were some of the  mechanisms  that  we  put  in
place to secure the  rights  of  persons  and  communities  contemplated  in
section 25(6) of the Constitution. Clearly, they did little to  address  the
collective wish of our rural communities under communal areas to  have  full
ownership of their land. It deprived them of  administering  the  land  that
they belong to. It also did not create  enough  possibilities  for  them  to
have choices on how they would want to  utilise  that  land  for  their  own
development.

It also did not create an  opportunity  where  representation  in  terms  of
participation on the administration of land would  actually  encompass  more
people beyond  traditional  leadership  structures.  It  denied  them,  most
importantly, of an asset base that they could have used to gain an  economic
livelihood. We, therefore, as the state,  had  a  responsibility  to  ensure
that we  addressed  the  situation  and  thereby  honoured  our  promise  of
creating a better life for all our citizens.

The question may be asked, hon members, ``Why has it taken  so  long?''  Ten
years into our democracy, the plight  of  rural  communities  have  remained
somewhat unchanged, particularly when it  comes  to  legal  dispensation.  I
hope the answer to this question, Deputy Chairperson and  members,  will  in
some way address some of the concerns that have been raised, rightly so,  by
some members of the public about the consultation process.

Firstly, you will recall that the  Communal  Land  Rights  Bill  before  you
today represents nine years of research,  policy  formulation,  consultation
and legislative  drafting.  Between  1996  and  1998  the  concentration  of
research and policy work looked at how we could transfer  communal  land  in
ownership  to  communities  and  thereby  establish  accredited   democratic
structures to be  responsible  for  the  administration  of  such  land.  It
weighed heavily, particularly on the role of the  state  as  a  bureaucratic
administration to actually support such accredited structures.

Also during that period, in 1998, some case studies were  done,  looking  at
what had been done by  the  old  apartheid  government.  One  of  the  clear
examples which has always been cited, particularly  in  the  media,  is  the
case of Matlala in Limpopo. It's an area which used to be under  the  Lebowa
homeland where the state sought to transfer communal land ownership  to  its
rightful owners. One of the things that became clear during that process  of
research was that where the state seeks to transfer communal land  ownership
to its rightful owners, in some instances it activates social, cultural  and
political conflicts, including boundary disputes relating to  the  ownership
of the land in question.

One of the challenges which we looked at in this  case  was  the  nature  of
transfer and ownership  that  did  not  clearly  define  the  administrative
responsibility over the land in  question.  The  lack  of  this  clarity  on
powers and functions with regard to the administration soeiof such land,  as
well as the hands-off approach of the then government  created  a  situation
where the traditional authority in the area behaved like  it  was  the  sole
owner of the land in question.

I think one of the things  that  we  had  to  look  at  in  drafting  a  new
dispensation was: How do we  depart  from  that  past?  Two  things  had  to
happen. One of those was to create a framework that  defines,  clearly,  the
role and powers of traditional leadership. This is  what  was  done  by  the
legislation under the authority of the Department of  Provincial  and  Local
Government. Secondly, in looking at our land administration process, we  had
to clearly define to  whom  the  land  is  transferred  and  also  what  the
administrative structures thereof are.

In some way our response, through the Communal Land Rights Bill, was to  opt
for an approach that created a shift where the proposal was  for  a  blanket
creation of so-called `protected rights' which would  secure  existing  land
uses and so uphold the status quo.

However, when we looked at  it,  the  second  stage  of  dealing  with  that
administration was with regard to the registration of  rights  only  on  the
basis of demand, not as a norm. Also, the issue of  comparable  redress  was
to be dealt with on the same basis. In  reviewing  that  procedure  or  that
process, it  was  clear  that  it  would  not  be  sustainable.  We  had  to
acknowledge that that approach clearly does not take into consideration  the
need for the affirmation of the land rights to its rightful owners.

In some way the difference, therefore, between the  approach  we  had  taken
then and the one that we are proposing in this Bill is that  the  owners  of
such land in communal areas will have full  ownership  of  their  rights  in
land, recognised by law through a  title  deed.  Secondly,  the  legislation
defines the way in which such administration of land will take place.

I must say here, Chairperson, that a concern was raised.  It  is  a  concern
that, in our view as a department and I am sure in the view  of  this  House
as well, we will continue to be engaged in, maybe even after the passage  of
this Bill, including some of the concerns that have been raised by  some  of
the NGOs as to the nature  of  administration  of  such  land,  particularly
under the traditional councils.

Thirdly, the rights of women have, clearly, been recognised,  protected  and
enforced. Such rights, if I may say so,  Chairperson,  extend  to  the  role
that women will play in the administrative  structures  of  such  land.  The
rights of vulnerable members of the communities have been protected in  this
Bill that we are putting before you.

The most important element in this Bill is that it recognises the  need  for
migration out of the system of collective ownership of land should the  time
come when the community wants to move towards individual freehold  ownership
of land. There won't be a need for other new legislation to allow people  to
move to land ownership on a freehold basis.

In the same manner, the Bill recognises the fact that other communities  who
previously had freehold status, such as communities at Cala in  the  Eastern
Cape, communities in Mzimkhulu, the Kekane in Hammanskraal, and many  others
who had  their  freehold  status  before,  were  in  some  way  subsumed  in
collective ownership  by  default  during  the  social  engineering  of  the
apartheid government.

Therefore, this Bill makes it possible that after the  land  rights  enquiry
process has been undertaken, the freehold status can  actually  be  restored
to those communities with minimal disruption.

Given the fact  that  the  land  in  question  might  be  overpopulated  and
congested,  the  Bill  provides  for  comparable  redress.  This  comparable
redress, in my view, has a  redistributive  element.  In  ensuring  that  we
learn from the lessons of the past,  such  as  the  Matlala  case,  we  have
ensured that there  are  mechanisms  which  will  facilitate  oversight  and
intervention. The provincial land boards  are  such  structures  which  will
have the responsibility of ensuring that the management  and  administration
of communal land at local level are actually done  in  accordance  with  the
law.

We have also ensured that, as a state, we don't take an attitude  that  says
once we have delivered or given  the  land  to  their  rightful  owners  our
business is finished, and then go  away.  We  have  created  an  opportunity
where we have clearly defined the role of municipalities  and  other  organs
of state in order to continually  give  support  for  development  to  these
communities. We appreciate that this is just the beginning of  the  process.
As we move towards implementation, we will  learn  through  our  experiences
what more needs to be done to ensure that this  newly  created  dispensation
succeeds.

To this end, I want to thank the members of the  select  committee  here  in
this House who have worked with us starting from 2001, if I  may  say,  when
we had the National Land  Tenure  Conference  in  Durban,  where  we  looked
broadly at the issues around tenure reform in this country. They  have  even
sharpened our earlier drafts to ensure that it takes into consideration  the
views of many members of the public.

I also want to say, even at this late stage,  that  the  committee,  in  its
wisdom, has indicated to us that there are some things that need to be  done
to tweak the Bill so that it becomes  technically  sound.  I  want  to  say,
indeed, this is the role of legislatures. You would  recall  that  when  our
initial draft came before the National Assembly, it  actually  was  a  draft
that came out of a broad range of consultations.  However,  even  then,  the
portfolio committee in the National Assembly took  the  responsibility  that
they have as law-makers. They opened up the  process  of  listening  to  the
members of the communities, giving  them  more  chances  to  actually  raise
their  view  with  the  committee  where,  as  legislators,  the   portfolio
committee  could  listen  to  their  views  and  see  how  best  they  could
accommodate those views.

Again, in the NCOP, we know that there has been a number  of  consultations,
either directly or indirectly, that has helped the  process  to  improve  on
what it was. It is our view, Chairperson, that what we have  now  creates  a
balance and also serves as a basis to depart from our past and go  into  the
future. As we all know, the road is still long, and I am sure  you  will  be
with us, and support us continuously. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev  P  MOATSHE:  Hon  Chair,  hon  Minister,  hon  members  of  the  select
committee, hon members of this House and members of  the  department,  allow
me to place before you documents - that you have on your desk  -  which  are
amendments we have tabled before this House, as a  select  committee,  after
applying for permission from the  presiding  officers.  The  permission  was
granted  that  this  amendment  could  be  placed  before  the   House   for
acceptance. I hope that this House will accept this move.

[Chairperson, the Bill that is  being  debated  today  in  this  legislative
House is long overdue,  because  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs has taken nine years to compose it, as it deals with the subject  of
rural land ownership.

People have been waiting since then for this legislation.  People  who  were
adversely affected by separate development needed to have the rights to  the
land on which they had resided. Now they will never  again  be  regarded  as
people  without  any  rights  and  as  foreigners  in  the  land  of   their
forefathers.]

Allow me to show the House how people in the rural areas  have  been  denied
the right to own the land they use and occupy. They have  been  degraded  to
second class citizens in the country of their own birth. It  was  the  Black
Land Act of 1913 which pushed black people to  reside  in  areas  that  were
reserved  for  their  exclusive  occupation  and  use,  which  later  became
homelands.

In these homelands only 13% of land  was  allocated  to  70%  of  the  South
African population who were living in these  areas.  Thus  these  areas  are
characterised by overcrowding and poverty. People in  the  former  homelands
are  struggling  to  produce  food  for  their  own  survival.   They   were
marginalised, pushed to  the  periphery  to  be  unnoticed,  and  they  died
unnoticed.

Wat die situasie vererger het, was die feit  dat  hoewel  swartmense  sedert
1913 gemeenskaplike grond besit en gebruik het, hulle nie  toegelaat  is  om
die grond op hulle name te laat registreer nie.  In  stede  daarvan  is  die
grond geregistreer as staatsgrond, of geregistreer as grond gehou  deur  die
Minister  van  Grondsake,  of  dit  is  in  trust   gehou   vir   spesifieke
gemeenskappe.

Hoewel daar 'n oortuigende aantal  mense  is  wat  leef  in  die  sogenaamde
gemeenskaplike areas, en wat dus geen besitreg op  die  grond  het  nie,  is
daar steeds diegene wat onseker is of hulle besitreg het  al  dan  nie.  Dit
alles veroorsaak groot  onsekerheid  oor  die  status  van  grondregte,  wat
vererger word deur die gebrek aan beheer oor  die  grond  in  gemeenskaplike
areas. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[What aggravated the situation was the fact that although black people  have
possessed and used communal land since 1913, they were not allowed  to  have
the land registered in their names.  Instead  the  land  was  registered  as
state land, or as land held by the Minister of Land Affairs, or it was  held
in trust for specific communities.

Though there are a convincing number  of  people  living  in  the  so-called
communal areas, and who therefore have no tenure  of  the  land,  there  are
still those who are uncertain whether they have  tenure  or  not.  All  this
causes  great  uncertainty  about  the  status  of  land  rights,  which  is
exacerbated by the lack of control over the land in communal areas.]

Women's  rights  are  extremely  important.  One  of  the   most   important
provisions of this Bill is to protect the land tenure  rights  of  the  most
vulnerable  groups  in  our  society,   like   women   and   children-headed
households. It also ensures  that  these  groups  participate  in  decision-
making processes through their representation in the Land Rights  Board  and
land administration committees.

Women, particularly African women,  have  been  severely  marginalised  with
regards to access to land. Customary laws and traditional  practices  denied
women the right to be allocated land in  their  personal  capacity.  Women's
tenure was linked to their status in relation  to  male  members  as  wives,
mothers, sisters  and  daughters.  Women  often  became  victims  of  forced
evictions when they got divorced or separated from their husbands.

What  this  Bill  is  doing  is  changing  that.  It  gives  effect   to   a
constitutional entitlement to secure tenure  to  persons,  including  women.
The Bill confers the right of ownership  of  land  on  women  in  their  own
right. This means that single women, for  the  first  time,  are  given  the
opportunity to have land title deeds of their own. They  will  not  have  to
depend on the mercy of a male relative to  farm  and  feed  their  families.
This should be applauded, considering the fact that there is a large  number
of female-headed households in these areas.

The Bill also entitles women to the same legally secure  tenure  rights  and
benefits to land as men. It makes it compulsory for old order rights  to  be
held by both spouses in marriage, and thus, in terms of the Bill, they  will
be transferred to new order rights in the name of both parties. It does  not
matter whether they are married by means of a customary  marriage.  So,  the
criticism that this Bill confers second class status on women  is  baseless.
Instead, women are getting the same status as men.

Through this Bill, for the first time, women  will  be  able  to  use  their
title deeds as security for bank loans, which they can use to develop  their
land or farm more efficiently. This will eradicate poverty  and  ensure  the
economic  emancipation  of  women,  as  women  form  the  backbone  of   our
communities, and many are heading their households. Having new order  rights
will benefit the whole community. Those who still  question  the  protection
of women's rights in the Bill should  understand  that  women's  rights  are
already  enshrined  in  our  Constitution,  and   the   Constitution   takes
precedence over any legislation.

The  Bill  went  further  to  entrench   the   women's   representation   in
institutions which administer and help in the use of land, such as the  Land
Rights Board and the  land  administration  committees.  This  ensures  that
women would have a direct say on how their land is administered.
According to the Bill, at least a third of the total membership  of  a  land
administration committee and the Land Rights Board  must  be  women.  People
need to understand that 30% is just a minimum; there can be  more.  What  is
needed is for women  organisations  to  work  together  with  Government  to
educate women in communal areas on their  rights  so  that  they  can  fully
participate in these structures.

Traditional councils should act as land administration committees  in  terms
of this Bill. A number of people are opposed  to  this  arrangement  on  the
basis that the institution of traditional leadership is  undemocratic,  very
corrupt and will abuse this power. People need to understand that  the  role
played by traditional leadership  in  land  issues  has  been  part  of  the
African culture for a long time. That could  not  be  wished  away  by  this
Bill.

What the Bill has successfully done is  to  strike  a  balance  between  the
community norms and traditions, and  our  democratic  ethos  and  practices.
Democracy should not be used to  undermine  our  culture  as  Africans,  but
rather to improve our cultural institutions and make them accountable.

It is important to note that it is not within the jurisdiction of this  Bill
to change the composition of traditional councils. This Bill is  only  there
to  provide  a  framework  of  how  traditional  councils,  acting  as  land
administration committees, should function in administering  land  owned  by
communities.

Coming to provision of services, what I  should  acknowledge  is  that  this
Bill places local government at the centre of the development arena in  land
reform, particularly in section 37, where the Bill states that -


  ... no law must prohibit  a  municipality  from  providing  services  and
  development  infrastructure  and  from  performing   its   constitutional
  functions on communal land however held or owned.

This proves the fact that through this Bill  Government  is  not  abdicating
its responsibility to provide services in communal areas,  as  other  people
believe.

As already said by the Minister: There are other people who feel  that  this
Bill was not refined to the bone, and that it should  have  been  kept  back
for some time so that people could make their  input.  We  understand  their
concerns, but I believe that half a loaf is better than  no  bread,  because
the people of this country have waited for the  past  10  years  to  receive
this piece of legislation. Therefore, if  it  is  implemented,  it  implies,
like any legislation, that it can be returned to our tables to be looked  at
again and to be refined to the marrow.

In conclusion, let me say that through this Bill the ANC-led Government  has
shown its commitment  to  return  the  land  to  its  rightful  owners,  the
community. Mayibuye iAfrika is being realised today.

We have shown, yet again, that we aspire to equal treatment  for  all  South
Africans and believe in  full  participation  of  communities  in  decision-
making processes that affect their lives. Through this Bill  there  will  be
no more discrimination against women  and  rural  communities  in  terms  of
access to land, and they will have tenure rights  like  any  South  African.
Therefore, I place this Bill before this House for acceptance. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Deputy Chair, the objects of this Bill are set out very  clearly
in the memorandum. It aims to formalise the African traditional  systems  of
land tenure within the framework  of  the  Constitution.  This  it  does  by
legally securing tenure rights of communities and people within  the  tenure
system of their  choice.  The  transfer  of  ownership  from  the  state  to
resident communities is a major advance away from a century of inequity.  It
coincides  with  the  thinking  propounded  by  the  development  economist,
Hernand  de  Soto,  based  on  his  studies  in  South  America  wherein  he
recognised the fact that people who are often  considered  unbankable  -  to
use a common phrase - because they do not have formally  registered  assets,
may indeed be very bankable if their assets were registered.

This Bill has been very substantially  amended,  compared  to  the  original
Bill which was presented  last  year  and  which  was  widely  condemned  by
virtually all the political parties here and certainly by all of  the  civil
society organisations which have made it their  main  concern  to  see  that
women are treated fairly in the new South Africa. This  disjuncture  between
traditional law  and  practice  with  regard  to  women  and  the  wonderful
equality achieved for women in the Constitution, has long been a subject  of
debate. Thanks to the considerable effort of South African  women  from  all
walks of life, and it may surprise you to know that  the  hon  Minister  and
myself worked very closely to realise this ideal. [Laughter.]

The Constitution leaves no  ambiguity  as  to  the  position  of  women.  In
nothing may they be considered to be second  class  citizens.  The  equality
clause trumps all, but law and practice seem  to  divide  very  comfortably.
The  background  statement  in  this   Bill   spells   out   that   existing
paternalistic systems prevent  social  and  economic  advancement  in  those
areas despite our modern  Constitution.  It  is  not  clear  how  individual
people, particularly women, will be  able  to  effectively  communicate  and
exercise the choice provided for them in  the  Bill,  especially  when  this
choice does not coincide with that of the entrenched  establishment  of  the
community.

It therefore remains an open question whether the  latent  paternalism  that
exists won't continue to stall social and economic advancement. Here I  want
to turn to what happened in this House yesterday as an  example  of  actions
which fuel my fears that women still have a  long,  hard  fight  for  actual
equality ahead of them. I have been asking ad  nauseam,  you  may  say,  for
action on the shameful case of Ambassador Mashabane who seems impervious  to
the charges of  sexual  harassment  which  have  successfully  been  brought
against him. [Interjections.] Despite all our protestations of equality  for
women, he seems more equal than others and to be able  to  move  beyond  the
law. However, there was another incident yesterday  which  is  really  cause
for concern.

The  hon  Minister  Skweyiya,  who  is  roundly  admired  for   his   dogged
determination to expand social support to the poor,  was  fulsomely  praised
by one of our members, the hon Gouws, for these very attributes. Instead  of
responding to her speech, as can be expected from any  politician,  he  then
descended to totally unnecessay levels of chauvinism  and  chose  to  attack
the member in her personal capacity ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Order!  Hon
member, can we come back to the Bill that  we  are  debating.  If  you  make
mention of that in passing I have no problem, but that's not the subject  of
the debate. Continue.

Ms C BOTHA: I am pointing out exactly the implications that  this  Bill  has
for women. [Interjections.]

... inferring that she, a mere woman, could  not  have  written  her  speech
herself. I want to underscore this approach by male  members  of  Parliament
by quoting my own experience in the Free State Legislature where the FF  has
repeatedly used the same statement towards me. When it comes from them I  am
not  surprised,  as  they,   by   nature,   are   very   authoritarian   and
paternalistic, but when it comes from the ANC  then  I  am  really  worried.
[Interjections.]

What guarantee have women in the communal areas, away from the  public  eye,
that they will not be the target of similar action if men in power  tend  to
conspire, despite our wonderful laws, to do them down. What guarantees  have
we, considering the lack of action against ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Hon member?

Ms N C KONDLO: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is the hon member  prepared
to take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Ms  Botha,  are  you
prepared to take a question?

Ms C S BOTHA: If I have time at the  end  of  my  speech.  Thank  you.  What
guarantees have  we,  considering  the  lack  of  action  against  men  like
Mashabane, that the men in their powerful  traditional  positions  will  not
band together and undermine these tenuous advances?

Hon colleagues, I call on you to give serious  thought  to  this  situation.
The DA supports this Bill, but that does not mean that we  need  not  retain
vigilance over its implementation. This is not just a test  case  for  women
in communal areas. It speaks to the rights of all of us.

Mr K D S DURR: Chair, I would like to say to the hon  member  who  just  sat
down that I can give her the assurance today that an  ACDP  government  will
protect her rights. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Order!
Continue, Mr Durr.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, that Titanic is going to sink. Can  I  just  say
that I thought it was a brilliant speech by my hon friend,  Rev  Moatshe.  I
think it's the best speech he ever made in this House  actually,  and  I  am
very pleased to say that. I recognise this Bill as a  product  of  long  and
hard negotiation, and I want to congratulate the Minister on the outcome  of
what I know to be  a  very  difficult  negotiation.  We  welcome  the  Bill,
because it's absolutely vital that we address these issues and commence  the
process of building up these former homeland areas as these  areas  are  the
highest potential, most fertile, highest  rainfall  areas  in  South  Africa
with the highest agricultural and other potential.

The issues are complex and there are no quick-fix answers. What we are  sure
of is that if we are to succeed, the current homeland leaders will  have  to
buy into the process for the successful  changes  that  we  know  must  take
place. We simply cannot go on with more or less of the same.  However,  what
I also recognise is that what we have put in place is not a solution, but  a
process towards the solution, and that it is  important  that  that  process
continues in a dynamic way. I believe we need,  Minister,  more  imaginative
answers to the developmental challenges  which  are  also  opportunities  in
those areas. We  need,  in  my  view,  to  make  several  psychological  and
material leaps. We need to move from subsistence agriculture  to  high-value
organic food production primarily for export. We have the  soils,  the  pool
of labour, the climate and very often the rainfall.

There have been successes in the past with tea and  coffee  plantations  and
timber, but there are far higher value crop opportunities. There  will  have
to be a technology transfer  and  perhaps  joint  marketing  and  management
arrangements. The growing of herbs, rare spices, flowers, as well  as  high-
value fruits in related agro-industrial activities downstream come to  mind.
Also Minister, we should seek to shorten and jump the development  chain  in
these areas, attracting high-value and high labour content  industries.  Not
only that, but perhaps we can  consider  a  labour  regulation  holiday  for
those areas and perhaps even a tax holiday. I believe the Government  should
waive certain minimum wage and labour restrictions in these areas  and  give
them a labour regulatory  holiday  for,  say,  20  years  to  improve  their
comparative advantages and to give them an advantage over other areas.

However, as I have said earlier, traditional leaders must be  made  partners
in this reformation. They must feel inspired and not threatened by  what  we
are proposing to do. Finally, the  greatest  engine  of  reform  and  growth
will, of course, be all of the good reasons  that  my  colleagues  have  set
out, namely to unlock the value of the land and to  make  people  landowners
and home owners in these rural  areas.  Everybody  will  be  amazed  by  the
effect of this - holding of one's  own  title  deeds,  restoration  of  land
rights,  the  extension  of  property  rights  to  women.  These   are   all
fundamentally very, very important things. It will give homeowners  security
of tenure and put them on the first rung of the value  chain.  Nothing  will
do more for wealth creation in those areas than extending  property  rights.
The reformation of these areas will be and should be a process,  as  I  have
said, and not an event. It's a new beginning and an exciting  one  that  can
benefit the community and benefit our whole country. I wish  you  well  with
this legislation, Minister. The ACDP supports the legislation.

Mnr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, hierdie wet is 'n  beginpunt  om  die  probleem
van die grond wat ter sprake is, op te los. Dit is  hoogstens  'n  begin  om
die  proses  waardeur  hoëpotensiaalgrond  bestuur  word  te  ontwikkel   om
mettertyd sy volle potensiaal te bereik.

Gebruikers van die grond het tot op hede geen sekerheid gehad nie.  Dit  het
tot gevolg gehad dat broodnodige kapitaalbesteding nie plaasgevind het nie.

Dit is een van die redes waarom daar so baie skade aan  die  bodem  aangerig
is, veral omdat grondvoorligting nie aan die  opkomende  boere  voorsien  is
nie. Die Nuwe NP hoop dat ander elemente wat nodig is  om  armoede  te  help
verlig, spoedig in werking gestel sal word.

Kommunale boerdery was tot op hede nog nie 'n algehele sukses  nie.  Om  van
kommunale  boerdery  'n  sukses  te  maak,  vereis  'n   baie   sterk   wil,
selfdissipiline en liefde vir die grond. Sonder  hierdie  eienskappe  is  'n
mens op 'n pad na êrens, maar in werklikheid is jy na nêrens heen onderweg.

Dit is baie goed dat trustgronde onder gemeenskapsrade se  jurisdiksie  kom,
want hulle sal kan toesien dat individue gebruiksreg van die grond bekom.

Tradisionele  leiers  se  grond  moet  gemeenskapsgrond   word   sodat   die
gemeenskap kan besluit oor die  gebruiksreg  daarvan.  As  dit  kom  by  die
toekenning van grond, het tradisionele leiers se magte in  die  verlede  tot
misbruik gelei. Dit sal 'n groot fout wees indien  tradisionele  leiers  nie
betrek word nie. Hulle het groot invloed,  en  met  die  regte  gebruik  van
hulle invloed, kan hulle help om die proses suksesvol te maak.

Die kleinboer moet sekerheid kry oor die gebruik van die grond. Dit  is  die
enigste sekerheid wat hy kan gebruik om byvoorbeeld finansiering te kry.  Hy
het geld nodig om sy insetkoste te betaal. Ek wil weer  eens  pleit  dat  'n
skema geskep word wat bestaansboere, sowel as kleinboere, kan  bystaan.  Die
praktyk het bewys dat opkomende  boere  geen  finansiële  hulp  by  algemene
bankdienste kry nie, omdat sekerheid eerste van hulle gevra word.

Daar kan dalk ook bepaal word dat hulle vir  'n  jaar  of  twee  geen  rente
betaal nie. Daarna moet hulle 'n lae rentekoersprofiel  handhaaf  sodat  die
plafon vir die produksieleningsrekening nie  oor  'n  tydperk  van  'n  paar
maande nie, maar wel na etlike jare bereik kan word.

Vroueregte kry die nodige aandag in die wetgewing, maar dit mag  nodig  wees
om dit in die  praktyk  vorentoe  verder  te  verbeter.  Die  staat  het  'n
geleentheid om  sy  grondhervormingsdoelwitte  'n  groot  hupstoot  te  gee.
Hierdie wet leen hom daartoe, want hulle  wat  die  grond  bewoon  het,  die
regmatige eienaars, is nou wetregtelik die eienaars.  Hierdie  wet  bied  'n
uitdaging aan die Minister en die Departement van Landbou om dit  wat  hulle
reeds oor die afgelope tien jaar gedoen het, verder in 'n sukses te  omskep.
Dit is belangrik om te onthou dat  Suid-Afrika  oor  goeie,  sowel  as  swak
landboutoestande beskik. Dit is daarom  belangrik  dat  die  staat  dit  sal
oorweeg om staatsubsidies aan  die  landbou  te  voorsien,  anders  sal  die
opkomende boere nie die mas opkom nie.

Suid-Afrika is van die weinige lande  in  die  wêreld  wat  surplus  voedsel
produseer en uitvoer. Hierdie wetgewing leen hom  daartoe  om  produksie  in
hierdie land te verhoog. Die Nuwe NP steun die wet as 'n beginpunt, en  wens
die departement en die Regering in sy geheel sukses toe met  die  uitvoering
daarvan. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, this Act is a starting point  to  resolve  the
problem of the land under discussion. It is at  most  a  starting  point  to
develop the process through which high potential land would  be  managed  to
eventually reach its full potential.

Up to now, users of the land have had no security.  This  led  to  the  fact
that no imperative capital spending took place.

This is one of the reasons why so much damage has been  done  to  the  soil,
especially since emerging farmers were never  briefed  on  how  to  use  the
land.  The  New  NP  hopes  that  other  elements  necessary   for   poverty
alleviation will soon be put in place.

Up to now, communal farming has not been a resounding  success.  To  make  a
success out of communal farming requires a strong will, self-discipline  and
a passion for the soil. Without these characteristics you are  on  your  way
to somewhere, but you are in reality heading for nowhere.

It is a good thing that trust land  will  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of
community councils, because they will be able  to  ensure  that  individuals
will get the right of use of the land.

Traditional leaders' land must  become  community  land  in  order  for  the
community to decide on  the  right  of  use  thereof.  Traditional  leaders'
powers, as far as the allocation of land is concerned, led to abuse  in  the
past. It will be a big mistake if  traditional  leaders  are  not  involved.
They  have  huge  influence,  and  with  the  right  application  of   their
influence, they can help the process to become a success.

The small farmer must get security of tenure over  the  land.  This  is  the
only security which he can use to obtain, for  example,  finance.  He  needs
money to pay for his start-up costs.  I  would  once  again  appeal  that  a
scheme be established, which could assist subsistence farmers,  as  well  as
small farmers. It has been proved that  emerging  farmers  do  not  get  any
financial assistance at general banking services, because  the  first  thing
required from them is security.

Perhaps it can also be determined that they do not pay interest for  a  year
or two, whereafter they must maintain a low interest  profile  so  that  the
ceiling for the production loan account can be reached, not  within  a  time
span of a few months, but after several years.

The rights of women  do  get  the  necessary  attention  in  this  piece  of
legislation, but it may be necessary in the future to further  improve  this
in practice. The state has an opportunity to give its land  reform  goals  a
huge boost. This Act lends itself to this, because those who  lived  on  the
land, the rightful owners, are now legitimately the owners. This  Act  poses
a challenge to the Minister and Department of  Agriculture  to  change  what
they already have done over the  past  ten  years  into  a  success.  It  is
important to realise  that  South  Africa  has  good  and  bad  agricultural
conditions. For this reason,  it  is  important  that  the  state  considers
providing state subsidies to agriculture,  or  else  emerging  farmers  will
never be able to survive.

South Africa is one of the few countries in  the  world  that  produces  and
exports surplus food. This legislation lends itself to increased  production
in this country.

The New NP supports the legislation as  a  starting  point  and  wishes  the
department  and  the  Government  as  a  whole  all  of  the  best  in   the
implementation thereof. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chair, allow me to approach my debate in this  fashion:  God
created man out of dust, which is part of the soil - land, of  course.  When
he dies, his body will be returned to the soil.

We are told that Adam was the first man ever created  on  this  planet.  God
put him in the Garden  of  Eden  which  was  full  of  assorted  fruits  and
vegetables, birds, animals, insects, you name it. He granted  him  ownership
of this land, authority and control over everything for  the  sustenance  of
his life. Therefore land ownership has since become a crucial issue.

The racially discriminatory laws, such as the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts,  were
merely manifestations of man's greed for the  land.  These  laws  created  a
situation whereby land rights were inequitably accessed by the  citizens  of
this country.

This piece of legislation we are dealing with today,  together  with  others
already passed by this House, such as the Extension of  Security  of  Tenure
Land Act, land redistribution and restitution laws are  imperative  for  the
redress of past unjust practices. For  transformation  to  take  place,  the
passage of this legislation becomes, therefore, a must. Land ownership by  a
person means individual empowerment. Empowerment in this  sense  means  that
value will be added to the piece of his/her land, be  it  for  residence  or
business purposes.

Most emerging farmers own  plots  which  range  on  average  from  5  to  50
hectares under the  permission  to  occupy  status.  These  plots  can't  be
pledged for collateral in circumstances where the farmer intends  to  secure
a loan. Financial institutions only recognise title deeds. The intention  of
this Bill is therefore to, amongst other things, redress these anomalies.

The Black Administration Act of 1927 and the Black Authorities Act  of  1951
have placed traditional authorities in a difficult position  -  a  difficult
position  in  the  sense  that  a  perception   developed   whereby   tribal
authorities have since laboured under  the  impression  that  they  own  the
land, yet they were  merely  custodians  of  the  land  they  occupied.  The
Government remained the sole owner of these trust lands.  It  was  basically
for this reason that the Ingonyama Trust was established in 1994.

Why do I raise these issues? Individual  persons  and  emerging  farmers  in
possession  of  PTO  titles  might  face  problems  with   the   traditional
authorities when they apply for the conversion  of  these  PTOs  into  title
deeds, because disloyalty to the tribal authority might ensue.  Defaults  in
honouring tribal levies in favour of payment of  property  rates,  which  in
turn offer services, could occur.

One other issue I need to raise is  that  there  are  probably  millions  of
historically  disadvantaged  people  who  are   subjects   of   the   tribal
authorities that are party to Ingonyama Trust land. Do  these  people  stand
an equal chance to convert their PTOs into title deeds?

There are a few farms under the Vankuna Tribal Authority near Tzaneen  where
I stay and come from. This tribe  has  bought  farms  such  as  Burgersdorp,
Sedan and Juliesburg and the tribe is in possession  of  title  deeds.  What
happens in the situation where a tribe, as well as the Ingonyama Trust,  are
unwilling to shed portions of their land for personal ownership?

I raise these issues because problems similar to these might crop up  during
the application of this legislation. Otherwise, the UDM  has  no  reason  to
halt the process of transformation and we,  therefore,  support  this  Bill.
Thank you. [Applause.]

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson and the House at large, hon  Minister  of
the department, we as the IFP applaud this  Bill  under  discussion  and  we
hope that the traditional leaders will welcome it.

We have seen traditional leaders coming together in  solidarity  to  discuss
their land rights in the country. Today we need these  rights  to  keep  the
land in custody of traditional leaders and the nation. We  congratulate  all
traditional leaders throughout the country of South Africa for having  stood
up for what has been naturally theirs until today.

We, as the IFP, are well known  for  holding  traditional  leaders  in  high
esteem. The traditional leaders keep the land under their  jurisdiction  and
protect the culture on behalf of the nation. That is why  we  celebrate  the
Heritage Day holiday.

We look at this Bill as a means of  protecting  the  dignity  of  women  and
children  against  abuse  when  it  comes  to  matters  relating   to   land
distribution.

The IFP agrees with the departmental officials when  they  say  that  proper
functioning of this law depends on the return of  land  which  was  unfairly
confiscated from its rightful owners. We see  land  being  returned  to  its
owners and we hope this will be finalised in the near future.

All that we are saying is that the  land  in  question  involves  land  that
belongs to traditional leaders and their communities. After  all,  the  king
owes his throne to the people.  That  is  how  culture  operates.  A  nation
without culture has no knowledge of where it comes  from  and  where  it  is
going.

The rule of law is always essential to safeguard  people's  rights,  whether
they reside in rural areas or in the cities.

This law will also operate in these places in accordance with the  country's
Constitution to enforce ownership. In this case it even provides for  women,
the disabled and our youth.

We applaud this law, because it will be  applied  uniformly  throughout  the
country. There will be different variations in  terms  of  values,  culture,
etc.

Nothing is perfect in this world. When this law  becomes  operational,  only
then will some hiccups be identified, which is not a problem because  a  law
can always be amended if there is a serious need to do so.

We, on behalf of the IFP, support this Bill, especially because we  are  the
ones who have always  been  complaining  about  the  rights  of  traditional
leaders and about land,  demanding  that  the  Constitution  should  clarify
these issues.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE   NCOP   (Mr   M   J   Mahlangu):   Order!
[Interjections.] Order! Order!

Mr  M  A  SULLIMAN:  Chairperson,  Comrade  Minister  and  hon  members,  as
correctly stated by President Thabo Mbeki in his  statement  of  8  January,
the ANC-led Government has laid the basis in the past 10 years  for  further
improvement of the system of governance to ensure that it serves the  people
of South Africa even more effectively and efficiently and  that,  through  a
system of participatory governance, it should reflect the  translation  into
reality of the perspective that the people shall govern.

The Bill before us today, hon members, is  one  of  the  examples  of  those
perspectives on  reality  that  Government  has  set  up  to  transform  and
translate our people into governing themselves.  This  is  the  Government's
response to apartheid legacies under which mostly  blacks  in  South  Africa
occupied a very low percentage of our land.

What this Bill does, is to give secure  tenure  rights  to  communities  and
individuals living in communal areas.  For  the  first  time,  through  this
Bill, people living in the former homelands will have an opportunity to  own
their land like any other South African citizen.  Through  this  Bill  their
tenure rights will be protected by law and no one will take away their  land
without their consent. If the owner gives consent,  he  or  she  has  to  be
fully compensated.

The community, as the rightful owner of communal land,  will  have  all  the
rights, responsibilities and obligations associated with ownership. It  will
be able to use the land for the benefit of the community.
Registration  of  land  tenure  rights  in  the  name  of  communities   and
individuals will provide  an  enabling  environment  for  the  socioeconomic
development in communal land areas and the participation of communities  and
persons in the mainstream economy in order to create wealth, income and  job
opportunities in those areas.

The Bill itself realises the importance of development  in  communal  areas.
Section 28(1)(a) gives the Land Rights Board the  responsibility  to  advise
and  assist  the  community  generally  and,  in  particular,  with  matters
relating to sustainable land ownership and use.

We cannot talk about development  in  rural  areas  without  empowering  the
poor, and no empowerment will take place without security of tenure.  It  is
for this reason that this Bill is very important and has  to  be  passed  by
this august House.

This Bill also gives people in the communal areas the opportunity to  decide
on how they want their land to  be  registered  or  administered.  They  are
given  an  opportunity  to  decide  whether  they  want  their  land  to  be
registered in the name of the community, the household,  the  family  or  an
individual for full ownership. The intention is to  provide  people  with  a
range of choices to choose the one they are comfortable with and  to  design
the system to be flexible to accommodate change over time.

Furthermore, the communities are also given a choice of how their  land  has
to be administered. They are the ones  who  develop  community  rules  which
serve as guidelines to the land administration committee, which is  given  a
responsibility by this  Bill  to  administer  the  land  on  behalf  of  the
community.

I should emphasise the fact that the community owns the land, and  that  the
land administration is there just to administer the land. If  the  community
is not happy with the land administration committee, they have the right  to
relieve the committee of its duties in accordance with community rules.

All this proves the fact that the  ANC  Government  is  committed  to  allow
people to make their decisions on matters that affect them directly.  We  do
not just decide for people as the previous government did.

Hon members, it should be borne in mind - Mrs Vilakazi, she is not here  now
- that at all times that the ANC respects  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership and recognises that it has a big role to play in the  advancement
of the interests of our people within the context of a  democratic  setting.
That is why at all times there was an ongoing consultation process with  the
traditional leadership about this Bill, working with them also in  a  common
effort to improve the lives of our people in those rural areas.

In conclusion, we want to congratulate the hon  Minister  and  officials  in
the department for working very closely with the select  committee  on  this
particular Bill. We called them so many times  and  they  never  refused  to
come and assist us.

The introduction of this Bill  is  a  delivery  by  the  ANC  Government  on
promises it made to the people of South Africa  of,  amongst  other  things,
creating a better life for all. I would like to move  for  the  adoption  of
this particular Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,  hon
Chairperson and hon members, for participating in the  debate  and  also  to
those who were giving affirmation and applause for what we have done.

I would like to say, hon  Botha,  that  indeed  you  are  right.  We  worked
together in the women's coalition; you were  my  Deputy  Secretary  then.  I
just hope that one day you will come back home to the ANC.  [Interjections.]
Currently, I think, you are just on the road between two points. Maybe  it's
not bad, but at some stage you'll have to reconsider  where  you  are.  From
the way in which you participated in this debat today, except  for  some  of
the references that you made when you  diverted,  I  actually  thought  that
maybe at the end you were going to say you are now joining the ANC.
Angibonge kuwe Mphatsisihlalo nakuwo onkhe emalunga, ngisho  kutsi  lendlela

[I thank you, Chairperson, and all members. I also  want  to  say  that  the
manner in which we spoke and presented our proposals with regard to what  it
is exactly that we want to be done, will help us when the Bill becomes  law,
because it will be able to protect the people with  regard  to  land  tenure
rights.

In her speech, Mrs Vilakazi spoke abouth the fact  that  it's  a  long  time
since they, as the IFP, started to speak about the ownership of land by  the
traditional leaders. True, I agree with that. However, I,  as  a  member  of
the  ANC,  though  I  am  a  Minister,  want  to  point  out  that  we,  the
organisation, did not start yesterday.  We  started  in  1912,  and  at  the
inception of the ANC there were kings, chiefs and everybody.

I would mention only one, Chief Luthuli, who was one of our leaders  of  the
ANC. We did not reject him just because he was a natural  chief  or  say  he
could not lead us as we are the learned and highly respected.  We  respected
him for his position and leadership skills.

There are many other leaders who are kings whom I can mention, even here  in
Parliament and in this House, the NCOP. We do not just pay lip  service;  we
have appointed many chiefs and kings and we respect them. They speak  freely
in our midst as the ANC. Even when they don't agree with us,  we  don't  say
to them that since they have diverted from us, as  the  ANC,  we  will  also
reject them because of their status as kings or chiefs. We call them to  our
midst and sit down  with  them  and  discuss  these  issues.  What  is  most
important to us,  are  the  communities  that  they  lead,  and  we  follow.
[Interjections.]

One other important thing  about  which  I  should  maybe  remind  you,  Mrs
Vilakazi, is that we in the ANC spoke in our caucus meetings  in  1997,  and
we said since we have spoken on it in  our  interim  Constitution  of  1994,
what are we as a party going to do to discuss and include the importance  of
the kings' portfolio in our Constitution?

If I may speak in English, I wish to say one of the resolutions of  the  ANC
in 1997 clearly stated our determination that the ownership  or  the  powers
of the traditional leaders should be catered for in the law, even  over  the
constitutional powers. That is what we did.

We know that there are many people who were saying we are slow and we  don't
do things properly, but this party knows how  important  it  is  to  involve
everybody, giving opportunities to all, and that is why it took us  so  long
to come up with a procedure that clearly stated how and  what  the  role  of
the traditional leadership in our democracy is  that  is  so  widely  spoken
about.]

We did this, not because we were or wanted to be  fashionable,  but  because
we believed that the role of traditional institutions in  our  democracy  is
very critical for growth and development. Also,  we  have  unashamedly  said
that when the apartheid regime took power,  they  actually  interfered  with
the role of traditional leaders and the essence of who they are.  They  even
prostituted  our  customs  because,  as  we  know,  there  have  been   many
instances, we can all agree in  this  House,  where  things  have  not  gone
according to what our traditional customs are.

Therefore, part of the White Paper on Traditional Leadership was  to  really
redefine in accordance with our custom the role and place of  a  traditional
system in our society  and  thereby  define  the  role  and  powers  of  the
traditional leaders in our system.
Mrs Vilakazi, you have said correctly that the role of  traditional  leaders
is intertwined with their people. Therefore, when they hold land  in  trust,
they hold it on behalf of the people; it is  not  theirs.   Therefore,  what
this means is that the  authority  vests  with  the  communities  and  their
leaders. It's similar with all of us as members of our parties - we  may  be
elected representatives, but we don't derive our powers  out  of  ourselves,
but out of those members and communities that we represent.

Therefore, the manner in which we crafted the Bill was done in  such  a  way
that it reflects this relationship. It is for that reason that we make  sure
that even if it might be an  accepted  norm,  we  also  clearly  define  and
protect the rights of all, while at the same time not undermining  the  role
and  the  leadership  responsibility  of  traditional  leadership  in  those
communities. That is why, hon Durr, we have sought  not  to  antagonise  the
traditional leadership in this Bill. We have sought  to  hold  a  view  that
brings them into the equation.

I think it is important for us to share that the  process,  particularly  to
consult and work with  traditional  leadership,  was  a  long  one  because,
indeed,  we  did  not  want  to  create  tensions  and  conflicts  in  those
communities.

I want to say that even the amakhosi acknowledged that there is a  need  for
democratisation within their institution. They also acknowledged that  there
is a lot of work that we will have to do collectively to ensure that we  can
democratise the institution of traditional  leadership.  Also,  they  didn't
just say it in words; they reflected that through give and take.

We all know that not all the elements that are in the  Bill  are  acceptable
to traditional leadership. I am sure my chief here from the ANC  would  have
loved the Bill; he would have loved to have had all  the  powers  to  decide
who becomes members of the administrative structures, but we had  to  tamper
with some of these expectations. We also had to listen  to  the  communities
and civil society to ensure that we created a balance.
At the same time, as hon members have said, one of the challenges, like  any
challenge in law, is when it comes to the implementation of  the  Bill.  How
do we guard against the issues that hon Botha has raised to ensure that  the
participation of women in those structures is affirmed? We deal with  issues
of chauvinism where it arises, but  we  also  empower  those  women  through
capacities to ensure that they can effectively do their duty.

You will know, hon members, that even in this  House  and  in  the  National
Assembly, when women in their numbers came to Parliament for the first  time
in 1994 to be part of the public representatives, it was not an easy  thing,
even amongst our male comrades and patriots. It took some time for  them  to
accept that things have changed.  I  think  the  way  in  which  women  have
excelled in this Parliament and in  public  society  has  clearly  indicated
that there is a positive element in our Constitution  that  accepted  gender
equity.

It is our responsibility as women and men  in  this  legislature  to  ensure
that when  we  go  back  to  our  constituencies,  we  have  to  assist  the
traditional  councils,  the  administrative  committees  and   the   women's
organisations so that they can give the necessary  support  to  the  members
who will participate in these structures.

On the issue that Mr Nyakane raised about whether or not the people who  are
under Ingonyama Trust land will be able to convert, I  want  to  assure  you
that, in the discussions with the board and  Isilo  himself,  they  were  in
full support of what we are saying in this legislation.

I want to cite just a few  examples.  If  you  look  at  some  of  the  land
restitution claims that have been  in  the  Ingonyama  Trust  land  such  as
Mbangweni, Mbilamabaso, in KwaZulu-Natal, the Ingonyama  Trust  never  stood
in the way of those communities to get their land in title.

If you look at the Ingonyama Trust Act, even as it stands today, one of  the
provisions  of  that  Act  was  to  transfer  the  land  to  the  respective
communities. Therefore, in my view, I don't  foresee  that  there  would  be
difficulties in that regard.

You also raised a  question  regarding  whether  or  not  farmers  or  small
farmers and other individuals who want to convert to freehold title will  be
allowed to do so in those communities. I actually would  say,  in  my  view,
given what we've seen in the restitution cases, that  even  where  land  has
been transferred, there has been an agreement on demarcation  of  that  land
to households or homesteads where people will have the full rights to  their
land. As you yourself said, this is a process towards a solution -  I  think
it was Durr who said so.  I  think  that  this  is  a  process  towards  the
democratisation in rural communities.

However, that process will have to be  affirmed  by  a  change  of  attitude
regarding  our  financial  institutions.  There  should  not  be  too   much
pressure, because there is a lot of fear amongst  rural  communities  around
the issue of having individual titles, namely that  once  such  a  title  is
transferred, people will go and borrow against their titles  and  then  they
would lose their land immediately. I think, as part of  the  democratisation
of South Africa, and particularly with regards to issues of empowerment,  we
should ensure that, as members, in terms of the application of  the  charter
as well as our legislation, we are able also to  affect  a  change  of  mind
amongst  our  financial  institutions  to  look  at  new  ways  of  creating
confidence in those communities to be able to use their land as collateral.

I would also like to talk about the issues of property  rates.  I  know  you
will still debate this Bill in  this  House,  but  I  just  want  to  assure
members that, as part of the discussion in Cabinet and bilaterally with  the
Minister for local government, and as the Department  of  Land  Affairs,  we
made a requisition that all people who have benefited as a  result  of  land
reform, including through the Communal Land Rights Bill, would  have  to  be
exempted from paying rates for a period of at least 10 years. We said  that,
because we believe it is important to assist those  communities  to  develop
and have an economic livelihood  which  will  assist  them  to  be  able  to
advance the rates. It is therefore  important  that  we  do  not  abuse  the
system. I think uNkosi will assist me in order to ensure that  some  of  our
leaders don't abuse that system. Some of  our  leaders  may,  once  we  have
passed the Property Rates Bill, start to charge  homesteads  when  they  are
excluded in terms of the law.

Part of the Government's intervention, with regards  to  rural  development,
is that because we understand that unless we can  build  the  capacities  of
those rural communities, where else are they going to get the  resources  to
pay for the rates? So, that exemption for 10 years is to ensure  that  there
are many interventions that we must do in this period, within 10  years,  so
that at the time when we expect those members to pay for  rates,  at  least,
they would have  built  some  economic  and  asset  base.  It  is  our  hope
therefore that a lot of what we are doing today, is to  lay  the  foundation
for development. As you yourselves have said, unless we actually change  the
ownership patterns in our society by default, we are affecting development.

Tat'uMoatshe, I would like to  thank  you  for  your  intervention  because,
indeed, as  you  say,  this  has  helped  us  to  affirm,  in  reality,  not
theoretically, what we have said as the ANC in terms  of  ensuring  that  we
would secure the tenure rights of our citizens, regardless of who  they  are
and where they are. This is the commitment we made  and  it's  a  commitment
we'll continue to live by.

I would like to say, Chairperson, the role  that  you  as  a  chair  of  the
committee and your members have played in ensuring that you work with us  in
improving the quality of this  Bill  has  made  us  feel  that  we  do  have
legislators who can add value to the work that we as the  executive  do,  so
that, indeed, the product that our society receives, is a  product  that  is
improved.

Chairperson, I would like to thank your Whippery who have also  worked  with
our committee and ourselves to ensure that we arrive at  this  point  today.
We also want to thank you for the leadership that you have given.  I  trust,
therefore, that from now on our task will be to oversee  the  implementation
of this Bill.

Mama uVilakazi usho kahle  wathi  akukho  soka  lingenasici.  Ubuqinisile-ke
mama ngoba impela noma yimuphi umthetho  uma  siwudlulisa  lapha  kule  Ndlu
kuye kuthi uma ngabe  usubekwa  kube  khona  izinto  ezibonakalisayo  ukuthi
ukwenza nokucabanga akufani, bese-ke lokho kuveza isidingo sokuchibiyela.

Ngethemba ukuthi nathi, njengamalungu ale Ndlu, sizothi  uma  sesiwubeka  lo
mthetho uma kukhona lapho sibona khona ukuthi kunesici bese siphinda  sibuya
futhi kule Ndlu, sichibiyele. Lokho kuchibiyela kuyokwenza  ukuthi  ngempela
amava  ethu  esesiwatholile  asisize  ukuthi  senze  lo   mthetho   usebenze
ngendlela.  Ngiyabonga,  Sihlalo.   [Ihlombe.]   (Translation   of   isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Mrs  Vilakazi,  you  put  it
well when you said that no one is an angel. You  were  very  right,  because
with every Bill in this House that is  passed  and  implemented,  there  are
certain things that show that doing and thinking are not the same, and  that
raises the need to amend.

I trust that, as members of this House, when  we  implement  this  Bill  and
find out that it has flaws, we will come back to this House  and  amend  it.
Such amendments, together with the experience we have gained, will  help  us
make this Bill work perfectly. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Proposed amendments agreed to.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

 POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF PARLIAMENT AND PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES
                                    BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of ad hoc Select Committee on Powers
                    and Privileges of Parliament thereon)

Mr  T  S  SETONA:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  members,  fellow  colleagues  and
comrades, the passage  of  this  Bill  today  represents  another  important
milestone in the history of our country and its people in the  ongoing  task
of transforming and democratising our society.  When  our  people  spoke  on
that historic day, 27 April 1994, amongst others,  they  charged  us,  their
representatives, to shape and craft a Constitution that will  be  based  on,
amongst others, the principles and values of  transparency,  accountability,
democracy, nonsexism, nonracism and supremacy of law.

This august House  heeded  this  mandate  to  the  letter  by  crafting  and
drafting the most democratic and progressive Constitution that has not  only
inspired the people of  our  country  but,  more  importantly,  the  nations
beyond our borders and shores.

The adoption of the democratic Constitution on 8 May  1996,  which  repealed
the Interim Constitution of 1993, set our country on  an  irreversable  path
towards breaking ranks with the past. This was a past  in  which  Parliament
was  used  as  an  instrument  to  banish  Nomzamo   Madikizela-Mandela   to
Brandfort, a past in which Parliament was an  instrument  to  banish  Robert
Sobukwe.

We present this Bill this afternoon in the midst of the dawn  of  the  third
democratic elections, the decade of freedom and the 10th anniversary of  our
Parliament. We would, as a nation and  country,  fail  in  our  duty  if  we
forget that in the last days of his life,  the  late  Comrade  Peter  Mokaba
opted not to be with his family, friends and comrades  in  pursuit  of  this
Bill that we are dealing with today.

This House must acknowledge that in the last days of his life, Peter  Mokaba
was a Chairperson of the National Assembly Ad Hoc Committee  on  Powers  and
Privileges. It is therefore fitting  that  in  this  debate  we  once  again
honour  him  for  the  contribution  and  leadership  he  provided  to  this
Parliament and society in general.

This Bill took almost two years before being finalised,  unlike  many  other
Bills that we deal with. It was not an ordinary Bill, but  a  Bill  deriving
from the Constitution, the supreme law of our country.  This  Bill  attempts
to realign the  present  legislation  on  powers  and  privileges  with  the
Constitution, and to repeal the obsolete laws that deal with the powers  and
privileges of Parliament.

Chapter one of the Bill deals with definitions. We in the committee have  no
objections to the definitions as they are stated.  However,  we  acknowledge
that there are chronological and alphabetical  problems  with  the  sections
that deal with definitions. The view of the committee is  that  this  matter
must be handled at the level of the finalisation  of  the  printing  of  the
Bill. It is not a political matter. It belongs at that level.

Chapter two of the Bill provides for the description  of  the  precincts  of
Parliament. It goes further by saying that the Speaker  and  Chairperson  of
the NCOP exercise joint control over Parliament. This should be done not  in
the legislation, but  in  the  Standing  Rules  of  Parliament.  Members  of
security services enter into or remain in the precinct to  perform  policing
functions  only  with  the  permission  and  under  the  authority  of   the
Chairperson of the NCOP or the Speaker.

The execution and processing of warrants of arrest may  also  only  be  done
with the permission of the Speaker or the Chairperson. This  is  the  thrust
of Chapter two of the Bill.

Chapter  three  deals  with   privileges,   immunities,   independence   and
protection of members and Parliament. The Constitution provides for  freedom
of speech in Parliament and provincial legislatures, subject  to  the  Rules
and Orders of Parliament. The Bill therefore does not  deal  with  the  form
and manner in which this freedom  is  exercised.  The  committee  recommends
that the Rules of Parliament must provide for this particular provision,  as
the Constitution does not specifically provide for freedom of speech in  the
Joint Sitting of the Houses of Parliament. This is provided  for  in  clause
six. It is therefore  recommended  that  this  lacuna  be  referred  to  the
Constitutional Review Committee. Since this is a constitutional  matter,  it
cannot be addressed in the legislation or the Rules of Parliament.

A further lacuna is that the Constitution does  not  provide  for  a  Deputy
Minister having freedom of  speech  in  a  joint  committee  of  the  House.
Another matter is that an official in the national or  provincial  executive
has the freedom of speech in the NCOP and its committees,  but  not  in  the
National  Assembly.  We  believe  that,   constitutionally,   this   is   an
inconsistency. This matter should also be  referred  to  the  Constitutional
Review Committee for consideration.

Clause seven deals with the prohibition of acts  in  respect  of  Parliament
and members. Acts that are prohibited include the following:  A  person  may
not impede the functioning of  Parliament;  assault  or  threaten  a  member
because of his or her conduct in the House; cause a disturbance  whilst  the
House or a committee is in session, or fail to comply  with  an  instruction
by a duly authorised official.

Chapter eight deals with improper influencing of members. A person  may  not
by fraud, intimidation, force, insult, or threat of any kind or by offer  or
promise  of  inducement  or  benefit  influence  another   member   in   the
performance of his or her  duty.  Influencing  a  member  to  be  absent  or
compelling  a  member  to  be  for  or  against  a  particular  position  is
prohibited.

A member may not ask for or receive any  fee,  compensation,  gift,  reward,
favour or benefit for voting in a  particular  manner  or  for  not  voting.
Promoting or opposing anything pending or making  a  representation  to  the
House or a committee is also prohibited.

Clause nine deals with attendance in court. In  terms  of  this  clause  the
Bill provides that a member cannot be compelled to attend  a  court  hearing
on a civil matter or as a witness in a criminal matter when the  Speaker  or
Chairperson has not issued an authorisation in that respect. This is not  an
attempt to  undermine  the  independence  of  the  judiciary.  Some  learned
collegues will say  we  are  undermining  the  autonomy  of  the  judiciary.
However, we are dealing with matters where a House is supposed to deal  with
business that affects millions of  people  in  this  country.  Sometimes  we
require a quorum for the business of the House to proceed. It is under  such
circumstances that the presiding officers will consider whether to grant  or
not to grant this request. It will not be a free-for-all.

The chapter dealing with disciplinary action against members  provides  that
a House has all the  powers  that  are  necessary  for  inquiring  into  and
pronouncing upon any matter declared  by  or  under  section  13  to  be  in
contempt of Parliament by a member and taking disciplinary  action  provided
therefore.

A committee must be established to deal  with  this  enquiry.  This  enquiry
needs to be conducted in accordance  with  a  procedure  that  is  fair  and
reasonable. The ad hoc committee recommends that the rules  to  provide  for
these procedures should be in place when the legislation  takes  effect.  It
is the House that finds a member guilty of contempt, and provision  is  made
for sanctions, amongst others, that range from a formal warning, an  apology
to the House and the withholding of certain facilities provided  to  members
for a specified period. It will be at the discretion of the House to  decide
what facilities they are going to withhold.

A member occupying any Parliamentary position may be  removed  or  suspended
for a specified period from  any  Parliamentary  position  occupied  by  the
member. A fine which does not exceed the equivalent of  one  month's  salary
and allowances can also be imposed. It further provides for the  suspension,
with or without remuneration, for a period not exceeding 30 days,  and  that
a member may not be suspended unless the House has found that member  to  be
guilty of a serious or  repeated  contempt,  and  that  none  of  the  other
penalities will be sufficient. The committee also recommended  that  as  far
as it is possible, unparliamentatry behaviour be codified in the Rules,  not
in this legislation.

Chapter five sets out how witnesses are subpoenaed to appear before a  House
or committee. It provides that the person can  only  be  subpoenaed  by  the
Secretary  of  Parliament  on  the  instruction  of  the  Speaker   or   the
Chairperson or the chair of  the  committee  with  the  concurrence  of  the
Speaker or the Chairperson. It does  not  give  chairpersons  of  committees
powers. They must concur with the presiding officers.

A  very  important  aspect  is  covered  in  clause  16,  dealing  with  the
privileges of witnesses. Witnesses being examined under oath or  affirmation
may be required to answer any question or produce any document, despite  the
fact that doing so would incriminate themselves  or  would  tend  to  expose
them to criminal or civil proceedings or damages.  Provision  is  made  that
evidence given under oath or  affirmation  by  a  person  may  be  not  used
against that person in any court  or  place  outside  Parliament  where  the
person stands trial on charges of perjury.

This is a constitutional provision, as well. I think Mr Lever  will  explain
this thing far better. Clause 15 provides for certain limitations  regarding
the types of subject matter about which a witness may be  questioned,  or  a
type of document  that  the  witness  may  be  requested  to  produce.  This
limitation should be set out in the rules. This  could  deal  with  matters,
amongst others, such as classified documents,  sensitive  information  of  a
commercial  or  economic  nature,  private   affairs   of   individuals   or
institutions supplied in confidence, and matters which  are  or  may  become
the subject of sensitive negotiations with governments or other bodies.

Clause 17 makes it an offence for a person who has been  subpoenaed  not  to
appear or failing to remain in attendance. It is also an offence  to  refuse
to be sworn in  or  without  sufficient  cause  fail  to  answer  fully  and
satisfactorily all questions lawfully put.

Chapter six deals with publications and  broadcasting.  It  deals  with  the
broadcasting of proceedings, as well as the publication of the  proceedings.
This will be dealt with further by my colleagues. I think the  hon  Ramodibe
and the Chief Whip of the Council will deal with that.

Chapter seven, which is the last chapter, deals with the protection  of  the
members of the public. For the first time this Bill  gives  members  of  the
public  protection  against  immunities  and  privileges   of   Members   of
Parliament. It break ranks with  the  past  where  a  member  of  Parliament
could, in the House, make unfounded,  unwarranted  and  reckless  statements
about members of the public, and was protected by this immunity.

An entirely new and innovative provision is that of   providing  members  of
the public that are aggrieved by a statement or remark made by a  member  in
or before a House about that person,  to  have  a  response  recorded.  That
member of the public will have a right to respond to the statement and  that
response will be recorded in the documents of Parliament.

Chapter eight deals with provincial legislatures. In the main  this  chapter
makes provision for certain clauses to  be  made  applicable  to  provincial
legislatures and their members, and also recognises that  in  terms  of  the
Constitution, provincial legislatures are, in their  own  right,  autonomous
and independent. They must therefore  formulate  their  own  legislation  in
this particular respect.

There are a number of other matters that the committee has expressed  itself
on that I would not like to repeat, and I hope that members  who  are  going
to speak on this Bill will reflect on those matters.

In conclusion, I want to  thank  all  members  of  the  committee  who  have
participated in the process of consideration of this Bill. I  also  want  to
express special gratitude to a former member of this House, hon  Moosa,  who
was an inspiration to most of us with his expertise. He was  originally  the
chairperson of the subcommittee dealing with powers and  privileges,  and  I
hope all of us who were part of that committee learned  a  great  deal  from
that hon member. I thank you.

Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, dealing with this Bill has  been  a  very  long
and sometimes very frustrating process, but I must admit it was also a  very
thorough process,  which  will  always  serve  as  a  good  example  of  how
Parliament, and not the state, can prepare  legislation.  We  cannot  debate
and accept this legislation without properly thanking  several  role-players
who, over the years, provided us with very valuable inputs  with  regard  to
this legislation.

When acknowledging the contributions of role-players, one  always  runs  the
risk of excluding certain people. We must, however, think  of  the  valuable
contributions made by Professors Murray and  Soltau,  Mr  Fink  Haysom,  the
Human Rights Commission, our own law advisors and, specifically,  Mr  Palmer
and the Research Department of Information Services.

Al die lede van die komitee sal egter  saamstem  dat  ons  baie  groot  dank
verskuldig is aan adv Anton Meyer vir die uiters  waardevolle  werk  wat  hy
ten opsigte van hierdie wetgewing gedoen het. Telkemale moes  hy  maar  weer
teruggaan en groot dele van die wetsontwerp herformuleer. Hy  het  deurgaans
verseker dat die komitee op die regte spoor bly en het  spesifiek  toegesien
dat hierdie wetgewing in ooreenstemming met die Grondwet is.

In dié verband is dit belangrik om daarop te let dat hierdie  wetgewing  nie
'n herhaling of inperking van die voorregte oor vryheid van  spraak,  vervat
in artikel 58 van die Grondwet, behels nie. Dit  brei  egter  die  voorregte
uit sodat dit ook van toepassing sal wees in  'n  gesamentlike  sitting  van
die Nasionale Vergadering en die  Nasionale  Raad  van  Provinsies.  Hierdie
voorbeeld dien as 'n bewys van die belangrike  rol  wat  adv  Meyer  in  die
komitee vervul het, en daarom kan ons nie anders  as  om  ons  opregte  dank
teenoor  hom  uit  te  spreek  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[All the members of the committee will  agree,  however,  that  we  owe  Adv
Anton Meyer a huge debt of gratitude for the valuable work that he had  done
with regard to this legislation. He had  to  go  back  time  and  again  and
reformulate large sections of the  Bill.  He  ensured  throughout  that  the
committee remained on the right track and  specifically  ensured  that  this
legislation corresponded with the Constitution.

In this regard it is important to  note  that  this  legislation  is  not  a
repetition or limitation of the privileges relating to  freedom  of  speech,
as contained in section 58 of the Constitution. It extends  the  privileges,
however, so that it will also be  applicable  in  a  joint  sitting  of  the
National Assembly and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  This  example
serves as proof  of  the  important  role  that  Adv  Meyer  played  in  the
committee, and for that reason we cannot but convey  our  sincere  gratitude
to him.]
In analysing this Bill, the question  should  be  asked  whether  this  Bill
adheres to certain very clear established principles.  Firstly,  it  adheres
to the doctrine of the separation  of  powers  in  that  power  is  not  all
concentrated in one place, but Parliament has the power to regulate its  own
affairs without outside interference.

Secondly, democracy requires open and critical debate of matters  of  public
interest.  In  claiming  privileges,   Parliament   has   to   respect   the
Constitution, and this Bill further  ensures  that  open  debate  can  occur
freely.

Thirdly, this Bill certainly sets out which acts would  constitute  contempt
of Parliament. Broadly stated, contempt of Parliament is to  act  in  a  way
that imputes the functioning of Parliament. Contempt, as specified  in  this
Bill, includes bribing or  attempting  to  bribe  a  member  of  the  House,
failing to appear before a committee of the House on  request,  obstructing,
assaulting or threatening a member and disobeying the rules  and  orders  of
Parliament.
Die  verslag  van  die  komitee  wat  aanvaar  word,  dui  egter  'n   klomp
aangeleenthede aan wat nie in hierdie  wetsontwerp  gehanteer  word  nie  en
waaraan dringend aandag geskenk sal moet word. Hierdie  wetsontwerp  is  nie
die gepaste plek vir genoemde aangeleenthede nie, maar die  Reëlskomitee  en
die Grondwetlike Hersieningskomitee sal dringend na die  verslag  moet  kyk,
want na 10  jaar  van  parlementêre  demokrasie  is  hierdie  aangeleenthede
uiters  belangrik  vir  die  behoorlike  funksionering  van  die  Parlement.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The committee report that is being adopted nevertheless indicates a  number
of matters not dealt with in this Bill and to which attention will  have  to
be devoted urgently. This Bill is not the most  appropriate  place  for  the
aforementioned matters, but  the  Rules  Committee  and  the  Constitutional
Review Committee will have to look at the report urgently, because after  10
years of parliamentary democracy these matters are extremely  important  for
the proper functioning of Parliament.]
I am of the view that  this  Bill  represents  a  huge  improvement  on  the
present Powers  and  Privileges  Act  of  1963  and  is  in  line  with  the
provisions of our democratic Constitution.

I have no reservations in supporting this Bill on behalf of the  New  NP.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chairperson, comrades, members, ladies and  gentlemen,  the
Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial  Legislatures
Bill before the House is long overdue and long awaited.

Nakong tse fetileng tsa kgatello, ha melao e ne e etswa ke ba neng ba  laola
ka tshepe, Palamente e ne e le hodimo ho molao.  Kajeno  re  bona  molao  wa
demokrasi o sireletsa motho e mong le e mong,  o  sa  kgethe  ho  fapana  ha
mmala kapa yona Palamente. Ke ka moo re tshwanetseng ho hlompha  dilemo  tse
leshome tsa demokrasi. [During the erstwhile apartheid  period,  when  those
who ruled with an iron fist laid down the law, Parliament used to  be  above
the law. Today we see democracy protecting everyone, regardless of  race  or
what Parliament says. That is why we should respect 10 years of democracy.]

The Constitution of South Africa contains  various  powers,  privileges  and
immunities for members of Parliament, delegates to the National  Council  of
Provinces and members of the  provincial  legislatures  to  enable  them  to
execute their functions properly. It includes the right to speak freely  and
without fear in the legislature, as well  as  the  right  of  the  House  to
regulate its own affairs without any outside interference.

It provides that other  privileges  and  immunities  may  be  prescribed  by
national  legislation  or  the  rules   and   orders   of   the   respective
legislatures.  In  line  with  the   constitutional   mandate,   the   Joint
Subcommittee  on  Powers,  Privileges  and  Immunities  of  Parliament   and
Provincial Legislatures, at its meeting in April 2001, resolved that  an  ad
hoc National Assembly committee,  which  would  confer  with  an  equivalent
National Council of Provinces committee, be appointed by resolution of  both
Houses.

The National Assembly resolved on 4 April 2001 that  an  ad  hoc  committee,
hereafter referred to as  ``the  committee'',  be  constituted  to  consider
recommendations  of  the  joint  subcommittee  and  introduce  a   Bill   in
accordance with Chapter 13 of the National Assembly Rules. The  aim  of  the
Bill is to define and declare certain powers and immunities  of  Parliament,
provincial legislatures, members of the National Assembly, delegates to  the
National Council of Provinces and members of the provincial legislatures.

Chapter two of the Bill is about the precincts of Parliament as the area  of
land  and  any  building  or  part  of  a  building  under  the  control  of
Parliament, or provided or used for the purpose of the legislature.

[This shows that this place is ruled by Parliament, or  this  is  the  place
where Parliament works. We are talking  about  a  place  in  which  we  hold
parliamentary meetings and perform the procedural work  of  the  Government;
the areas around the parliamentary complex, the yard,  the  garden  and  the
open area next to Parliament, including the rooms and  Houses  in  which  we
meet to do the work of Parliament; and the building or part of the  building
that is used for running Parliament. The Bill also makes  reference  to  the
House or committees, with the exception of the sittings of Parliament.

The Chairpersons or Speaker of Parliament preside  over  committee  sittings
to facilitate Parliament's work, and the way in which  members  are  treated
in Parliament. The  Bill  prevents  anyone  from  submitting  court  papers,
summonses of  the  court,  in  Parliament  without  the  permission  of  the
Speaker's office or that of anyone chosen by the Speaker.

About the absence of those who provide  protection  around  Parliament,  the
Bill prevents members of our protection unit, which is from the  police  and
the army, from entering, occupying or  doing  police  work  on  Parliament's
premises, except with the permission of the Speaker or  whomever  they  have
chosen to represent them.

The Bill allows those who provide a protection  service  to  do  so  without
obtaining permission if it is to prevent any harm to come  to  the  life  of
any of the people in Parliament. However, they have to inform the  presiding
officers after the incident.]
Chair  of  Committees,  Chapter  three  is  about  privileges,   immunities,
independence and protection of members and Parliament. The Bill  here  seeks
to provide freedom of speech for Cabinet members, Deputy Ministers,  members
of the National Assembly and delegates to the National Council of  Provinces
in joint sittings of the National  Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of
Provinces.

This privilege exempts categories of people  mentioned  from  any  liability
for civil or criminal  proceedings,  arrest,  imprisonment  or  damages  for
anything they have said or produced before or submitted to a  joint  sitting
of the House, the relevant House or one of its committees.

The Bill only deals with freedom of speech  in  joint  sittings,  since  the
Constitution already provides  for  freedom  of  speech  in  the  respective
Houses of Parliament. The Bill also seeks to protect members  from  improper
interference and bribery. It prohibits  people  from  interfering  with  the
work of Parliament or any office committees or with the free performance  by
a member of his or her functions; threatening or obstructing a member  going
to a meeting, or from a parliamentary meeting or from a  committee  meeting;
assaulting or threatening a member or depriving  a  member  of  any  benefit
because of the member's conduct in Parliament or a  committee;  creating  or
taking part in a  disturbance  within  the  precincts  of  Parliament  while
Parliament  or  any  office  committee  is  sitting,  and  contravening   an
instruction by duly authorised  staff  members  regarding  the  presence  of
persons at a particular meeting or regarding the possession of any  article,
including a firearm, in the precincts of Parliament.

A person may not improperly influence a member in  his  or  her  conduct  by
means of fraud, intimidation, force or  threat,  nor  can  anyone  induce  a
member to be absent from Parliament or a committee or try to force a  member
to declare him or herself in favour ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the 1963 legislation which regulated  the  powers
and immunities of members of Parliament was no  longer  consonant  with  our
new Constitution, and the Bill before the House now corrects that. The  Bill
provides  the  legislative  framework  for  the   powers,   privileges   and
immunities of members of Parliament and the provincial legislatures.

The hon Setona gave a very comprehensive outline  of  the  contents  of  the
Bill, and I will try not to repeat and simply emphasise a few points that  I
think do need emphasis. Some of the powers  and  privileges  and  immunities
are set out in our Constitution, but others are  established  by  tradition.
This Bill provides the legal framework.  However,  it's  important  also  to
note that there is still a lot of work to be done to clearly  deliniate  the
full limits of these rights and immunities, and also  the  manner  in  which
they will be enforced.

Most of this work will have to take place in the  Rules  Committees  of  the
relevant Houses  and  legislatures.  Some  of  the  issues  that  the  Rules
Committees will have to deal with relate to the degree to which  a  member's
right to freedom of speech may legitimately be limited, the  adoption  of  a
procedure  setting  out  the  relevant  rules  for  inquiries  relating   to
disciplinary action against members for contempt, and the  question  whether
reflections on members of another House or  legislature  or  the  deliberate
misleading of the House or a committee should  constitute  contempt  of  the
House.

There are also issues relating to the loss of membership or other  sanctions
for nonattendance of meetings of the House or  its  committees.  Two  issues
have been referred to the Constitutional Review Committee, and these  issues
include the rights to freedom of speech in Joint Sittings of the two  Houses
of Parliament, as well as  the  rights  of  Deputy  Ministers  who  are  not
members of Parliament.

The Bill provides a good foundation for the work  that  still  needs  to  be
done and, therefore, the DA supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M E SURTY: Thank you, Chairperson of Committees. I think Mr  Lever  quite
correctly points out that the powers  and  privileges  in  this  legislation
derives from the Constitution, which is the supreme law of this country,  of
this land, and a Constitution  in  which  rights  such  as  the  freedom  of
expression are firmly entrenched.

It is this very freedom of expression that entitles me to say,  even  though
I'm a member of the ANC,  that  I  agree  with  the  DA  that  South  Africa
deserves better. I agree with them, because South Africa certainly  deserves
a better opposition. I  agree  with  them  that  South  Africa  requires  an
opposition that is neither regressive, nor against transformation.

So, I could agree with them, but I could  also  express  my  views  about  a
political party and  its  inclinations  towards  tendencies  which  seem  to
benefit a  privileged  few.  That  is  my  right.  It's  entrenched  in  the
Constitution, and I can certainly use this right for  various  purposes:  to
inform the public, to argue the  case,  to  argue,  very  strongly  so,  the
achievements of the ANC over the past decade, to say how well  the  ANC  has
succeeded in transforming our society, making it a nonracial  and  nonsexist
society. These are the rights that we  derive  from  the  Constitution,  and
these are rights the Constitution only limits  when  there  is  hate  speech
which is based on race, gender or religion.

Now, it's important to enjoy this right and to also  be  able  to  have  the
benefit, in a House such as this, to ask whether, in fact,  the  information
that we received, that Mr Raju, who is a black member of the  DA,  has  been
suspended,  and  the  only  other  remaining  member,  Ms  Sono,  has   been
withdrawn. [Interjections.]  Is it because they are black, or is it  because
of their lack of participation in the due processes of this Parliament?

Now, these questions can be asked, and I'm protected in doing so  by  virtue
of the Constitution and by virtue of the powers and privileges. I do  so  on
the basis that I would want to ask  the  opposition  why,  for  example,  Mr
Krumbock and Ms Antoinette Versveld, who  hardly  participate  in  meetings,
are still not withdrawn or suspended by the political party,  but  the  only
two members who are  diligently  involved  in  the  committee  work  of  the
various committees are either withdrawn or suspended. [Interjections.]  This
is my right, and as long as I do not impinge on the integrity of  a  member,
I'm entitled to enjoy this constitutional right, which is  conferred  on  me
through this Constitution.

I also  think  that  one  must  understand  that  in  the  context  of  this
particular legislation I use it as an example, and I think  that  the  right
is also available to the opposition to be able  to  respond  to  the  issues
that I've raised. For example, I would like to  say  and  I  would  like  to
recognise and acknowledge that Mr Lever has been a dedicated member  of  the
committee, has added value to the committee, notwithstanding the  fact  that
he's a member of the DA, and I would like to know and ask why it is that  Mr
Lever is leaving the DA? Is it because he's disillusioned with the  policies
of the political party? Is  it  because  he's  unhappy  with  the  state  of
affairs within the DA? I may ask these questions. It  is  my  constitutional
right.

Let me get a little more philosophical about this. I thought Mr Setona  had,
quite correctly, dealt very comprehensively with this - I agree  again  with
Mr Lever - Bill. I also think  what  this  Bill  does  and  what  we  should
understand, is  that  this  Bill  here  confers  powers  and  privileges  on
Parliament. It seeks to protect the dignity, the integrity and  the  decorum
of Parliament.

It  says  that   Parliament   and   its   representatives,   through   these
institutions, must be able to do their  work  without  any  obstruction  and
without any hindrance. It emphasises the importance of  ethical  conduct  on
the part of members. It states, also, that  Parliament  itself  derives  its
powers through the Constitution, which entitles  it  to  develop  rules  and
procedures which will govern its internal relationships.

So, we, as public representatives, must collectively be able to do that.  It
also says that we have this particular freedom,  and  I  see  that,  in  the
context of those powers that the Constitution has  conferred  on  us,  we've
done extremely  well.  We've  ensured  that  whilst  we  are  a  House  that
represents provincial interests,  we  did  not  marginalise  party-political
interests. That is a constitutional value which we've enshrined.

It also does another thing. This is what Mr Setona referred to and  I  think
it's important for the  purpose  of  understanding  the  rationale  and  the
philosophy underlying this particular Bill, namely that  it  allows  members
to exercise their functions in the best interests of  the  electorate.  That
means it will allow them to hold Ministers, the executive,  accountable  for
what they do, either in terms of policy, in action or in terms of  the  law.
That is the right that is conferred on Parliament as a whole.

It  also,  then,  entitles  these  committees  and  members   within   those
committees to investigate any statements, possibly  such  as  the  one  that
I've made in  relation  to  certain  inferences  that  could  be  drawn,  if
necessary and appropriate. It allows that kind of  latitude  for  Parliament
to ensure that, in  the  conduct  of  its  business,  it  is  able  to  best
represent the interests of this country  and  to  give  it  all  rights  and
powers to summon whomever  to  Parliament,  be  it  a  Minister,  be  it  an
official or any other person who may have information.  I  also  think  that
must not be lost.

As a round-up, I think I also have to mention two aspects. One is that  this
Bill here provides a framework for public representatives, whether they  are
in Parliament or whether they are in provincial legislatures;  and  it  does
not preclude, but in fact suggests that the provincial legislatures  develop
legislation  with  regard  to  other  aspects   that   fall   within   their
jurisdiction.

So, it's particularly important for us, as the NCOP, to ensure  that  we  do
not  transgress  or  infringe  on  the  integrity  or  independence  of  our
provincial institutions. This  Bill  does  exactly  that.  It  says  certain
provisions apply universally.

I would like to commend the committee, including  the  previous  chairperson
and  the  current  one,  for  basically  inviting  all   the   stakeholders,
provinces, local government and even the National  Assembly  to  a  workshop
where we put our heads together and tried to find out what the best  law  is
that we can develop which can serve the interests  of  this  Parliament  and
ensure, as Mr Lever correctly said, that it's consonant with the  provisions
of the Constitution. So, that is the point that I thought I  should  say  as
the penultimate point.

My last point, really, is to say that  this  Act  does  something  that  the
previous Act did not do, and it does  so  quite  meticulously.  It  ensures,
reinforces and re-emphasises the importance of ethical  conduct  of  members
of Parliament and that, as public representatives,  they  must  ensure  that
there is no conflict of interest, must ensure that they are neither  induced
by gifts or any other promises to act in a particular way.

So, while normal lobbying in  the  ordinary  cause  is  permissible,  if  it
occurs to enrich the particular member, it is unethical,  unacceptable  and,
in fact, has sanctions. I think we've gone a long way in achieving  what  we
believe is a very useful piece of legislation. The Bill has gone through  15
drafts, and I think the work of the  National  Assembly  and  its  committee
must be acknowledged. Mr  Hendrikse  and  his  team  of  members  have  done
extremely well. Also, the members who serve  in  this  particular  committee
have done admirably well, and I think we, as a House, must  acknowledge  and
recognise it.

We urge all  members  to  support  the  Bill,  notwithstanding  our  earlier
remarks. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The  question
is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule  63,  I  shall  first
allow political parties the opportunity to make their declarations  of  vote
if they so wish. There are none.
