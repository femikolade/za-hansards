ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I have been informed by the  Whips
that there will be no notices of motion -  the Whips have agreed to  this  -
nor any motions without notice at today's  plenary.  We  therefore  ask  the
secretary to read the first Order of the Day.

                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Madam Chairperson and hon  members,  and
I am glad to see amongst hon members a number of the distinguished  Premiers
- some who might have their swansongs present here as Premiers. So  clearly,
it is an emotional day. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

I think that members of the NCOP are by now well  aware  that  South  Africa
has one of the most transparent and equitable systems  of  intergovernmental
grants, with three-year allocations made per province and  per  municipality
from the National Revenue Fund.

Ten years ago, when we started  this  and  when  it  was  drafted  into  the
Constitution, I think we had no idea of how swiftly we would get on to  that
road.  Certainly,  we  have  taken  a  leaf  from  the  Australian   revenue
commission,  the  federal  tax  commission  in  India   and   the   Canadian
experience. We were aware of the difficulties that confronted them, and  the
FFC was set up with the view to being a regulatory body in  the  true  sense
of the word. But I think, as  we've  been  able  to  demonstrate,  that  co-
operative governance is  truly  alive  and  well  in  the  intergovernmental
fiscal system in this country.

The information that we published in the Division of Revenue  Bill  that  we
tabled on Budget day allows each province and municipality  to  include  all
grants in their budgets and to properly plan for their expenditure.

However, Madam Chairperson  and  hon  members,  we  must  constantly  remind
ourselves  that,  while   exceedingly   important,   transparency   in   our
intergovernmental system is not an end in itself. To fellow  South  Africans
what matters most is the extent to which we, as  political  office  bearers,
take advantage of the strengths of our system to  deliver  more  and  better
services for the improvement in the quality of life of all  South  Africans.
What matters to fellow South Africans is whether between the  executive  and
Parliament we hold each other accountable for the  appropriate  use  of  the
resources allocated in this Bill.

I am sure all of us, as we campaign, regardless of the parties that send  us
into the field, encounter people who say: Don't tell me  about  the  balance
of payments, tell me about my  life.  And  I  think  when  we  look  at  the
Division of Revenue Bill, it is to that that we must respond.  And  I  think
the key issue also  is  not  only  the  allocation  of  resources,  but  the
appropriate use of the resources as allocated.

This year's Bill, hon members, allocates  61,8%  of  national  resources  to
provincial and local  governments,  to  give  effect  to  this  Government's
priority of reducing poverty and vulnerability. In respect of  what  happens
to the resources right now, the situation varies from province to  province.
Some provinces have been able to plan to have the  debate  go  all  the  way
through the second reading, and some provinces have not  been  able  to  get
through anything beyond the tabling of the budget, and I think  it  is  with
that that we approach elections this year. It would set us apart.  It  would
create some pressure  on  the  production  of  an  intergovernmental  fiscal
review for the incoming members of the NCOP, but I think it is  a  situation
that we take account of in the context of this dynamic democracy of ours.

The core of  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  is  contained  in  the  seven
schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 provides a summary of  the  allocation  of
funds to the three spheres of government.  Of  the  R368,9  billion  in  the
budget for the first year of the MTEF, the national Government is  allocated
R201 billion.  This  includes  an  allocation  of  R52,9  billion  for  debt
servicing  costs  and  the  contingency  reserve,   leaving   the   national
Government  with  R120,6  billion  to  allocate  to  national   departments,
including conditional grants to provinces and local government.

Provinces, as I am sure hon members are aware, would  receive  an  equitable
share of R160 billion and local government  R7,6  billion  equitable  share.
Schedules 3 and 4 allocate the equitable share component  to  provinces  and
municipalities. Schedules 4 to 6  further  allocate  conditional  and  other
grants to provinces. The conditional grants to provinces this  year  account
for R21,2 billion and to local government R6,6 billion, in addition to  R7,6
billion of equitable share allocated to local government.

The 2004 MTEF builds on the sound policy framework  that  evolved  over  the
first  decade  of  democracy  and  provides  for   further   deepening   and
consolidation of social services, which  make  up  the  bulk  of  provincial
expenditure.

The allocation to provinces further reinforces spending  to  reduce  poverty
and vulnerability through an increased allocation  for  social  security  to
provide for further extensions of the social security net. The  emphasis  is
on completing the phased extension of the Child Support  Grant  to  children
up to the age of 14 years through a grant introduced in the  current  fiscal
year. It is a conditional grant provided for.

The allocation for  the  Child  Support  Extension  Grant  rises  from  R1,2
billion in the current fiscal  year  to  R3,7  billion  in  the  next  year,
further increasing to R9,2 billion in the fiscal year that ends on 31  March
2007.

I want to make the point, though, that the growth  of  the  social  security
transfers is quite unprecedented. It is the largest item of  growth.  It  is
growing at 13,5% in real terms, and it is  at  that  rate  of  growth  quite
unsustainable.

The Budget strengthens Government's response to HIV and  Aids.  It  provides
additional  funds  for  the  health   sector   to   implement   Government's
comprehensive response to HIV and Aids. It allocates R1,9  billion  more  to
the HIV and Aids  conditional  grant  over  the  three  years  to  roll  out
antiretroviral drugs. This brings earmarked spending to combat HIV and  Aids
to R3,5 billion over the next three years.

The 2004 Budget maintains strong  growth  in  the  allocation  targeted  for
provincial infrastructure development  and  maintenance,  rising  from  R2,3
billion in the current year to R4,1 billion in the third year of  the  MTEF.
As a result national transfers for infrastructure amount  to  R11,2  billion
over the next three years.

In addition to addressing backlogs in social  and  economic  infrastructure,
rising infrastructure allocations lay the basis for the expansion of labour-
intensive  projects  under  the  auspices  of  the  Expanded  Public   Works
Programme. The  grant  will  also  provide  for  agriculture  infrastructure
development to support farmers who acquire developing farmers,  particularly
the beneficiaries of our land reform programme. This has been recognised  as
exceedingly important - not only the land restitution  programme,  but  also
the LRAD  (land  redistribution  for  agricultural  development),  which  is
managed  by  provincial  agricultural  departments  and  has  been  a  vital
component.

I think that provinces  would  probably  reflect  and  say  that  the  money
budgeted for LRAD has often been  used  up  in  the  growth  of  the  social
security budget. We must try and earmark the LRAD funds,  but  in  addition,
we now have the Casp,  the  Comprehensive  Agricultural  Support  Programme,
which is a conditional grant to ensure that people on newly  acquired  farms
would be able to farm  because  there  is  working  capital  for  access  to
implements and a series of other things that make for  farming.  Phakiso  is
calling. [Laughter.]

In this year's Budget a new conditional grant is  proposed  to  support  the
implementation of a broad range of farmer  support  services  to  developing
farmers.

Over the next three years, municipalities will receive R47,3 billion, or  an
additional R3,9 billion. The substantial increase in  the  local  government
share is mainly targeted towards  provision  of  free  basic  services,  the
extension of services to areas  not  presently  serviced  and  job  creation
through investment in  labour-based  infrastructure  programmes.  In  total,
R7,8 billion over the 2004 MTEF is made available  for  water,  electricity,
refuse  removal  and  sanitation  as  part  of  Government's  commitment  to
providing free basic services. My only plea is that municipalities  actually
use it in the way which we intend and that we  will  not  have  to  go  into
areas where the poorest live, like Khayelitsha in Cape Town,  and  see  that
refuse is not even removed. [Applause.]

National allocations to the local  sphere  make  up  about  13,7%  of  total
municipal  budgets   in   2003-04,   but   this   varies   greatly   between
municipalities. This share is comparatively low for metro municipalities  or
the more urban municipalities in Gauteng and the Western  Cape,  where  they
comprise between 3% to 7% of the budget. They reach  up  to  92%  for  rural
municipalities.

Funding for free basic services is directed  through  the  local  government
equitable share, which rises from R8,5 billion in  the  first  year  of  the
MTEF to R10,4 billion in the third year. This unconditional equitable  share
component grows to 55% of national transfers to local  government  in  2006-
07, reflecting a shift to greater discretion at the local level as  capacity
is developed and fiscal reforms take hold. Compared to 8 years ago  when  it
was R1,5 billion in 1995-96, it will increase sixfold  to  R9,4  billion  in
2006-07.

The 2004 MTEF also takes a major step in streamlining funding,  through  the
consolidation of infrastructure grants  into  the  Municipal  Infrastructure
Grant. The MIGs, as they will now be called, total R16,6  billion  over  the
next three  years,  reflecting  an  additional  R1,7  billion.  This  grant,
together with other infrastructure grants being phased out, would be key  as
an instrument to support the infrastructure budgets  of  municipalities,  to
support the extension of  services  to  poor  households,  to  maintain  and
upgrade infrastructure and support urban renewal and rural development.

One  of  the  issues  that  we  have  to  come  alive  to  is   that   often
municipalities would request  access  to  something  like  the  Consolidated
Municipal  Infrastructure  Programme,  which  now  would  be  part  of   the
Municipal Infrastructure Grant going forward, but the system  works  on  the
basis that municipalities commit resources of their own. And we would  match
and sometimes exceed that  match  by  2:1.  But  municipalities  then  don't
commit resources because  they  consume  the  money  that  is  meant  to  be
earmarked for infrastructure. And  then  what  has  been  committed  in  the
Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure  Programme  is  then  not  drawn  down
against.

It is one of those issues that we would need to look  at.  We  must  sharpen
the instruments available to municipalities and ensure that we can  spend  a
lot more on infrastructure, because the money is there  at  national  level,
but I think it is, and will remain, premised on a matching grant system.

Finally, allocations for capacity-building and restructuring increase up  to
R750 million a year over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. This  is  to
encourage municipalities to build in-house capacity to  focus  on  planning,
project and  financial  management  and  budget  reforms  envisaged  in  the
Municipal Finance Management Act and Municipal Systems Act.
For those representatives of Salga and for  those  of  us  who  engage  with
municipalites from time to time, I would like to draw attention to the  fact
that there is a development fund in the DBSA which is designed  as  a  grant
to assist municipalities with capacity-building in areas such  as  financial
management that will be vital to ensuring  the  smooth  phasing  in  of  the
Municipal Finance Management Act when it is assented to.

Our system of grants is so transparent and  so  voluminous,  with  the  many
appendices on local government grants, that even our journalists missed  the
importance of publishing our consolidated tables on  the  total  grants  per
municipality, as set out in Table E22 in Annexure E in the Review  and  also
with the Bill. Perhaps, it  is  because  the  municipalities'  attention  is
drawn to the wrong stuff.

For example, it notes that the OR Tambo municipalities,  containing  Umtata,
will collectively receive the highest, at R823 million  in  the  first  year
... [Applause] ... followed by the Amatole municipalities at  R743  million,
and Amatole as we know, includes Buffalo City and all the  buffalo  soldiers
who live there ... [Laughter] ... Johannesburg at  R683  million,  eThekwini
at  R643  million,  Ekhurhuleni  at  R504  million  and  Vhembe,  containing
Makhado, at R445 million.

Waar is die Vrystaat? [Where is the Free State?]

I want to conclude  by  noting  that  the  first  decade  of  democracy  has
witnessed  remarkable   progress   in   the   development,   evolution   and
consolidation of South Africa's  intergovernmental  grants  system.  Looking
ahead, we need to improve this system to ensure that  it  is  able  to  deal
with the challenges facing us for the coming 10 years.  The  publication  of
Census 2001 results, together the restructuring  to  the  system  of  social
grants  and  electricity  distribution  industry,  provides  us   with   the
opportunity to undertake this review for the 2005 Budget.

So, regardless of who might be the government after 14  April  -  I  have  a
sense that it may be Nasionale Aksie or  some  large  party  like  that  ...
[Laughter] ... or  who  Cabinet  members  would  be,  I  think  that  it  is
important to  share  with  hon  members  in  this  House  that  Cabinet  has
committed  to  a  thorough  review  of  the  intergovernmental   system   in
preparation for the 2005 Budget. So it is something that we  must  undertake
thoroughly within the  new  Budget  Council,  and  this  might  improve  the
communication with the NCOP after the elections.

More importantly, we need  to  focus  on  how  to  improve  the  quality  of
spending in all spheres of government. Ten years on, we should  be  able  to
reap the benefits of any improvements in the delivery of services  over  the
second  decade  of  democracy.  To  do  so,  Parliament  and   all   elected
legislatures will need to improve their system of oversight  to  assess  the
performance of governments in all three spheres.

Madam Chairperson, hon members, thank you very much  for  listening  to  me.
[Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Thank you, Chairperson. I am supposed to speak  isiNdebele,
but I cannot speak the language.

Thank you, Chairperson, the Minister of Finance, Premiers and  MECs  present
here, special delegates and hon  members,  in  1998,  when  I  was  sent  by
Gauteng to come to the NCOP, it was said that I was coming to a dead  House,
and I was young, those kinds of things. But I have a different view  of  how
the NCOP has helped me as an individual to grow to be what I am  today,  and
also, many members of this House would attest to that. [Applause.]

I do want us to change our perception of the NCOP because I think if all  of
us took the NCOP for what it is supposed to be, I'm sure we  could  go  very
far in this country, particular in respect of monitoring issues  of  service
delivery and that kind of things.

First of all, I just want to thank the National Treasury. I think this is  a
view expressed by all members of the Select Committee  on  Finance,  without
any exception, that the Treasury has improved the Division of Revenue  Bill,
its content and many other things that  are  included  in  the  Division  of
Revenue  Bill  to  the  extent  that  in  the  framework  that  talks  about
conditional grants, mention is made of the fact that  the  select  committee
will hold departments accountable regarding conditional  grants  and  submit
reports to the Select Committee on Finance.

We would like to thank Treasury for this, because it has  been  our  concern
in the select committee that there is no  one  who  is  holding  departments
accountable around the utilisation of the conditional grants. We would  like
to thank the Treasury very much, not  because  the  select  committee  is  a
special committee, but because there was a gap in trying to  have  oversight
and holding departments accountable.

It has not only improved that element, but it has  improved  in  many  other
areas around how  funds  are  being  transferred  from  public  entities  to
municipalities, and also gives  responsibilities  to  municipalities  to  be
able to do their work in a proper manner.

Some concerns were raised, in particular by Salga. I must just  indicate  at
the outset that we had a  very  lengthy  discussion  yesterday  about  those
issues. The committee came to the  conclusion  that  some  of  those  issues
raised by Salga were issues which were supposed to be dealt  with  at  other
levels than the Budget Forum, where the discussion took place  between  MECs
of Finance  and  local  government,  and  also  at  technical  level,  where
officials were supposed to be meeting.

We would like to encourage the  discussion  to  continue  because  sometimes
issues are brought to the committee and we  then  have  a  dialogue  between
Treasury and Salga. I would also like  to  say  that  Salga  must  take  its
responsibility in the NCOP very seriously, because it is a  member  of  this
House. Invariably, you do not see that. But I think, going forward,  all  of
us who have been learning in the process would like to see that  change,  in
particular.
The Division of Revenue Bill  we  are  talking  about  -  the  Minister  has
alluded to this - is a very important piece of legislation for  this  House,
in particular because  it  deals  with  the  vertical  division  of  revenue
between the national, provincial and local governments, but, also, it  deals
with the horizontal division of revenue amongst provinces themselves.

What is important to note here is that  the  increase  in  funding  resource
allocation to provinces has been very drastic. We hope that the hon  members
of this House, and  the  provinces,  will  be  able  to  hold  provinces  or
departments  accountable  to  make  sure  that  these  moneys  are  utilised
properly and there is accountability and oversight over this thing,  because
we could be using the  resources  in  a  particular  way,  but  a  conscious
decision  of  giving  provinces  the  responsibility,  as  the  Constitution
prescribes, to deliver health, education and  housing  takes  cognizance  of
these points I am talking about.

The committee raised a particular concern after hearing several  departments
appearing before it. Some of the concerns relate to  the  issues  raised  by
the Department of Housing for not delivering  houses.  If  we  look  at  the
spending trends of Housing, North West has  spent  only  about  20-something
percent of its budget on housing, as well as the Western Cape  and  Gauteng.
And yet there is the contradiction  that  although  a  lot  of  people  need
houses, the departments are not spending.

We would like to indicate that as far as we as committee  members  know,  we
raised concerns that land issues and  environmental  impact  and  assessment
studies cannot be done whilst houses are being built. Those things  must  be
sorted out long before the building of houses starts, but Housing  keeps  on
raising some of these issues as reasons why they cannot build houses. We  do
think that committees in the NCOP and provinces must  make  sure  that  they
follow up those issues. In particular, the role of the Budget  Committee  in
this instance becomes critical.

Also, our concern revolves around the qualified audit opinions  and  reports
that are being given to the municipalities.  I  do  not  know  whether  they
cannot be given proper and unqualified reports, but this  remains  a  source
of concern and we hope that the conditional  grants  for  capacity-building,
as reflected in the Division of Revenue Bill, will try and address  some  of
these problems. Failing to do so, the Minister  has  talked  about  some  of
these issues, that is what  the  DBSA  is  doing  in  assisting  and  giving
capacity to municipalities. We took a study tour, last year,  to  Duduza  on
the DBSA and to some of the projects. Some of the things we saw in  KwaZulu-
Natal, working with the DBSA,  led  us  to  believe  that  this  partnership
between DBSA and municipalities will assist municipalities to build  further
capacity so that this grant becomes just an additional element.

Without  wasting  any  time,  I  just  want  to  talk  about  some  of   the
recommendations that the committee has made, because  I  do  not  have  much
time. One recommendation is that  the  next  Select  Committee  on  Finance,
amongst others, must pay more attention  to  special  audit  reports  to  be
conducted by the Auditor-General, in particular in relation  to  conditional
grants. We further propose that the Public Audit Bill,  which  was  supposed
to be considered by this House - we did not have time to  give  provinces  a
chance to look at the piece of legislation and to  factor  in  some  of  our
observations - is the right place for some of these issues to  be  taken  up
and we hope that the  third  democratic  Parliament  will  look  into  these
issues.

Also, noting that most of the auditing done by the Auditor-General's  Office
relating to financial auditing does not talk about performance auditing,  as
is envisaged by the PFMA, we hope that issues  of  performance  auditing  in
the near future are going to be playing  a  dominant  role,  instead  of  us
getting technical reports. These are the  issues  that  the  Auditor-General
has welcomed in the report that we  are  presenting  to  this  House  as  it
appears in the ATC.

Questions were raised around the data by the  FFC  and  other  stakeholders,
that the lack of data and the sector data that is being utilised,  vis-á-vis
the Statistics SA official data bodies that do not talk to  each  other.  We
further recommended that we  must  have  some  standardisation  and  working
together by these bodies so that we don't have data being  used  which  does
not have any authority and can be challenged from time to time.

 We  further  recommend  that  there  must  be  proper  utilisation  of  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review as tabled by the Treasury, almost every  two
years or so, and that that  report  must  be  utilised  as  a  tool  by  all
parliamentary committees at this level, but also at  the  legislature  level
so that we are able to utilise that report to be able to  improve  where  we
are and inform the process where we are going to.

In particular, on the issue of monitoring, how much do we spend per  capita,
including the equity issues which we are supposed to be looking  into  as  a
House? Also, the committee  wants  special  attention  to  be  paid  to  the
Finance and Fiscal Commission's recommendations that are tabled  every  year
in Parliament. Those  recommendations  are  supposed  to  be  informing  the
division of revenue, that is how resources are supposed to be allocated.  We
have recognised that we have done some work in this area, but  we  have  not
done much more than what we were supposed  to  do.  We  recommend  that,  in
future, parliamentary committees must make sure that that committee  follows
up these issues and that FFC processes fit  into  the  division  of  revenue
discussion so that we are able to have a linkage  of  that  process  to  the
process that we are dealing with today.

One of the other issues that we have noted in the committee is  the  earlier
tabling of the Division of Revenue Bill, which we did talk about earlier  on
in the previous activities  of  the  committee.  We  must  try  and  have  a
discussion with the National Treasury to see the feasibility of tabling  the
Division of Revenue much earlier than is the case  now,  so  that  we  allow
parliamentary committees an opportunity to have a discussion on  it  and  be
able to influence the MTEF. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Hon  Chair,  the  Minister,  Premiers,  special  delegates  and
members, the factors taken into account for the  2004  Division  of  Revenue
Bill have been informed by the Growth and Development Summit  and  the  Ten-
Year Review  published  for  discussion  by  the  Policy  Co-ordination  and
Advisory Services Unit in the Presidency.

The 2004 MTEF has a  renewed  focus  on  strengthening  investment  and  job
creation, reducing poverty and supporting vulnerable groups,  education  and
skills development, creating sustainable communities and  enhancing  service
delivery. This focus is in line with the  Ten-Year  Review,  which  promotes
four key ideas  for  the  next  ten  years:  a  framework  for  encompassing
interests, which is a social contract;  improving  the  performance  of  the
state; addressing the consequences of the social transition,  improving  the
regional environment and implementing Nepad.

The 2004 Budget Review sets out in detail how the constitutional issues  and
the Ten-Year Review  are  taken  into  account  for  the  2004  division  of
revenue. It focuses  on  the  economic  and  fiscal  policy  considerations,
revenue issues, debt and  financing  considerations,  expenditure  plans  of
Government and aspects of provincial and local government financing.

One of the key challenges facing all delivery programmes is to  address  the
problems of the second economy, to  deal  with  issues  of  income  poverty,
unemployment and social exclusion. These issues are  addressed  through  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, the expansion of the social safety  net  by
extending the child support  grant  up  to  the  age  of  14  years,  skills
development, agricultural support for  land  redistribution  programmes  and
various other policy initiatives as outlined in the 2004 Budget Review.

The Ten-Year Review, on the other hand, reflects on where we have come  from
since 1994. The majority of citizens were denied the franchise, society  was
divided along racial lines and the  social  exclusion  and  neglect  of  the
majority was a  matter  of  state  policy.  Economically,  the  country  was
isolated and in crisis, growth declined to below one percent  per  annum  in
the decade before 1994, and in the early nineties it came to  a  standstill.
Government was largely defined by national security  doctrine,  with  little
respect for the rule of law. Until after the 1994 elections,  parts  of  the
country lived under a state of  war  and  assassinations,  and  bombings  of
political opponents were rife.

 With reference to the  division  of  revenue,  the  Free  State  provincial
government receives R12,1 billion in the new financial year, which is  6,72%
of the total transfers to all provinces. The clauses in  the  Bill  relating
to the transfer of provincial equitable shares are very  explicit.  Relevant
laws stipulate that each province's equitable share must be  transferred  to
the province in weekly instalments in accordance  with  a  payment  schedule
determined by the  National  Treasury,  after  consultation  with  the  head
official of the relevant provincial  treasury.  The  payment  schedule  must
take reasonable account of the monthly spending  commitments  of  provinces,
revenue at the disposal of provinces  and  minimisation  of  risk  and  debt
servicing costs.

In addition, the  Minister  may,  under  certain  conditions,  determine  to
advance funds to a province in respect of equitable  share  which  have  not
yet fallen due to transfer  in  accordance  with  the  payment  schedule  in
respect of that province.

On the subject of  new  provincial  grants,  the  Department  of  Sport  and
Recreation has been allocated R9 million to promote  mass  participation  in
sport among historically disadvantaged communities. The new grant is  called
``Mass Participation in Sport''.

A new grant in Agriculture, called the ``Comprehensive  Agriculture  Support
Programme'', will provide on- and off-farm support and  effective  extension
services  to  developing  farmers.  An  amount  of  R750  million  has  been
allocated over the MTEF years.

The Free State receives 8,44% of the total allocation for the  Comprehensive
Agriculture Support Programme. The amount of R1,61  billion  which  is  Free
State's provincial share, constitutes a conditional grant  and  the  balance
is attributable to equitable share. In  other  words,  Free  State  received
7,62% of the total conditional grants allocated to provinces.

Municipalities in the Free State will  receive  a  total  of  R874  million,
which is 11,39% of the  total  allocated  to  all  municipalities.  In  this
regard, the Division of Revenue Bill stipulates that  a  municipality  must:
(a) submit to the  Auditor-General,  not  later  than  30  April  2004,  any
outstanding financial statements in respect  of  municipal  financial  years
preceding 2003 or from  the  current  financial  year;  (b)  submit  to  the
National Treasury by not later  than  30  June  2004,  its  budget  for  the
2003/04 municipal financial year and such  other  budgetary  information  as
may be required by the National Treasury, including,  but  not  limited  to,
information on the nature and extent of basic services to be  provided  for,
like water ... [Time expired.] Thank you. The Free State supports the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr M  SELOANE  (Gauteng):  Chairperson,  hon  Premiers,  hon  Minister,  hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, it is an  honour  and  privilege  for  me  to
deliver my maiden speech on  the  occasion  of  the  last  sitting  of  this
Council. [Laughter.]

Since this is my first speech, most of you might not  know  me.  I  am  Mike
Seloane from the Gauteng Legislature. [Laughter.] Let me make sure that  you
do not make a mistake in spelling my  name:  "S"  for  Psychology,  "E"  for
Internet, "L" for Element, "O" for Honest, "A" for Eight, "N" for  Knowledge
and "E" for India. [Laughter.]

On behalf of Gauteng province, the smart province, I would like  to  support
the principle and detail of the Division of Revenue Bill.  Having  supported
the Bill, we would like to  make  a  few  comments  on  two  issues,  namely
conditional grants and the comprehensive  review  of  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review (IGFR). We have  made  several  comments  in  the  negotiating
mandate and the final mandate, and I think the National Treasury  will  look
at that.

There are 19 conditional grants involving provinces. We regard  this  number
as high, considering the fact that provinces have to  deliver  the  bulk  of
the constitutionally mandated  basic  services,  whilst  at  the  same  time
national Government also expects of them to deliver on  the  19  conditional
grants. Conditional grants reduce  flexibility  in  spending  by  provincial
governments compared to the equitable share. The FFC summarises as follows:


  Whilst  national  Government  enunciates  policy  priorities,  provincial
  governments are free to modify or follow independent policy directions in
  the utilisation of the provincial equitable  share.  National  Government
  endeavours to influence the spending decisions of provincial  governments
  through its conditional grants.

We are also concerned about the quality of measurable outputs  required  for
each conditional grant.

Regarding the comprehensive review of the Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review,
the weighting of key elements of the provincial equitable share may  not  be
sustainable in future, taking into account spending pressure  on  provinces.
We, therefore,  are  looking  forward  to  a  comprehensive  review  of  the
formulae of the IGFR system, which must ensure  that  the  formulae  do  not
impact negatively on fiscal sustainability into the Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework. The existing deficiencies  in  the  data  used  within  the  IGFR
system should also be addressed in the coming comprehensive review.

Finally, I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  South
Africans for running an extra mile to reform  our  financial  system.  Today
our system is viewed as one of the best in the  world.  Many  countries  are
now taking lessons from South Africa, even though we are a young democracy.

Since this is my last speech, I would like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  for
steering and leading the NCOP in a progressive direction. I would also  like
to thank members for being good followers. To be a good leader, one must  be
a good follower. I wish you  all  the  success  in  the  election  campaign.
However, I would not be suprised  if  all  the  current  opposition  parties
grapple for only 20% of the seats. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: As a former teacher, I will not comment on  the
member's spelling ability. [Laughter.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon Premiers  and  special  delegates,
hon colleagues, section 214(1)  of  the  Constitution  requires  an  Act  of
Parliament to provide for, among others, the equitable division  of  revenue
raised nationally among  the  national,  provincial  and  local  spheres  of
government. The Division of Revenue Bill is  intended  to  respond  to  this
constitutional imperative.

The R327 billion revenue projection  in  this  Budget  is  to  be  primarily
located at provincial and  local  government  levels.  National  revenue  is
targeted at considerable spending on the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme,
via   conditional   provincial   infrastructure   grants    and    municipal
infrastructure  grants.  A  new  conditional  HIV/Aids  grant   is   to   be
administered  by  provinces  as  part  of  the  new  Comprehensive  HIV/Aids
Treatment and Care Strategy.

The Division of Revenue Bill takes  the  first  step  in  rolling  over  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, EPWP, with the considerable  allocation  of
R1,7 billion targeted at the Municipal Infrastructure Grant.  Section  11(6)
requires municipalities to provide specific  details  on  implementation  of
capital budgets as part of a  three-year  capital  plan.  National  Treasury
would carefully monitor compliance with such provisions.

The DA believes that though these  infrastructural  programmes,  if  closely
monitored, can contribute to addressing  backlogs  in  infrastructure,  they
will  not  arrest  the  unemployment  crisis.  Only   higher   savings   and
investments can provide  the  impetus  to  higher  income,  growth  and  job
creation.

The DA applauded the Minister of Finance on Budget Day when he allocated  an
additional R2,1 billion to fight HIV/Aids. The  DA  welcomes  the  shift  in
prominence which provinces and municipalities enjoy in key areas of  policy.
The Division of Revenue Bill's success in the roll-out of new  HIV/Aids  and
EPWP grants revolve around the capacity at provincial and  municipal  levels
to implement the programmes. We dare not fall short in this area.

Section 35 of the Division of Revenue Bill introduces  a  de  facto  amnesty
for underspending which really reflects capacity  constraints.  Again,  this
is  where  we  need  to  ensure  success.  There  should  be  no   case   of
underspending. The DA supports this Bill. I thank you.

Mr M I  MAKOELA  (Limpopo):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  Premiers
present, we have come a long way. This country, South Africa post-1994,  has
come a long way. This Parliament, this  post-1994  democratic  dispensation,
has come a long way.

 We in the Limpopo province believe that we have come a long, long  way  ...
[Laughter] ... from the days when we were classified as one of  the  poorest
provinces to today, when we have become one  of  the  fastest,  if  not  the
fastest-growing economy in the country.

It was not very long ago when provinces were regarded as being  not  capable
and lacking in efficiency and fiscal capacity.  There  were  large  economic
disparities  and  a  very  unstable  and  unpredictable  budgetary  process.
Nevertheless, step by step, we  went  about  rebuilding  the  shattered  and
dilapidated systems bequeathed to us by  the  apartheid  regime;  rebuilding
the shattered lives of our people and consolidating the  victories  so  hard
won. Today, in our 10th year of freedom, we can afford to  stop,  look  back
with pride, and deservedly celebrate our achievements, a work well done.

In the budget process, the allocation of resources to the three  spheres  of
government  is  recognised  as  a  very  critical  step.  For  the  national
Government, the nine provinces and each of  the  284  municipalities  to  be
able to carry out their constitutional mandates,  to  deliver  services  and
other developmental needs, the passing of the Bill before the  House  is  of
the utmost importance.

The Division of Revenue Bill has come  a  long  way.  Every  year  has  seen
changes and improvements on the Bill; improvements that are  geared  towards
the enhancement  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  and  co-operative
governance.

In this whole process the province of Limpopo is, and will remain,  a  vital
role-player, in partnership with its various communities, to strengthen  the
efforts of delivery and working for the improvement of the lives of all  our
people  through  job  creation,  the   fight   against   poverty   and   the
intensification of the fight against HIV/Aids, as  well  as  other  diseases
such as TB, diabetes and others.
We have come a long way and step by step we are  succeeding  in  dismantling
the shackles of the legacy of apartheid. Nobody - and I  mean  nobody  -  is
going to stop the tide, because  it  has  unreversibly  turned.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mnr H BEKKER (KwaZulu-Natal): Mevrou die Voorsitter, die  agb  Minister  van
Finansies het, soos in die verlede, weer  eens  'n  konstruktiewe  begroting
ter tafel gelê. Die verdeling  van  inkomste  word  inderwaarheid  deur  die
Finansiële en Fiskale  Kommissie  bepaal,  maar  die  Minister  se  hand  in
hierdie proses kan baie duidelik gesien word.

Natuurlik moet die  begroting  gesien  word  teen  die  agtergrond  van  die
komende verkiesing, en dit is logies dat daar suikerlekkers vir die  kiesers
sou wees, met die klem op maatskaplike uitgawes en  belastingbesparings  vir
individue. Die ouens wat egter 'n rokie rook en 'n  doppie  drink  gaan  nog
swaarder kry as in die verlede, en ons het  begrip  daarvoor.  Ons  het  ook
begrip daarvoor dat die sterker rand teenoor die dollar  beperkinge  op  die
Minister geplaas  het.  Die  laer  winste  van  uitvoerders  as  gevolg  van
verlaagde randinkomste, veral ten opsigte van goud en platinumuitvoere,  het
'n negatiewe invloed.

Ons is daarom dankbaar dat die Minister desondanks meer kon gee  as  wat  hy
geneem het van individue. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr H  BEKKER  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chairperson,  the  hon  Minister  of
Finance has once again tabled a constructive budget, like in the  past.  The
division of revenue is, in fact, determined  by  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission, but the Minister's hand in this process is clearly visible.

Of course, the budget should be viewed against the background of the  coming
elections, and it is logical that there should be carrots  for  the  voters,
with emphasis on social expenditure and tax  savings  for  individuals.  But
those who smoke and drink will suffer even more than in  the  past,  and  we
can understand that. We can also understand that the stronger  rand  against
the dollar has placed restrictions on the Minister. The  lower  profits  for
exporters as a result of a decline in rand revenue, especially  with  regard
to gold and platinum exports, had a negative impact.

Therefore we are grateful that the Minister could, in spite  of  this,  give
more than he has taken from individuals.]

The  NCOP  committee  and  the  finance  committee  of   the   KwaZulu-Natal
legislature studied the Division of Revenue Bill and, like other  provinces,
discovered certain anomalies  and  technical  deficiences  in  the  original
Division of Revenue Bill, which was approved by the National Assembly.

The NCOP thus had to make some minor amendments which  caused  a  frenzy  on
whether it  would  have  to  result  in  recalling  the  National  Assembly.
Fortunately, in co-operation with legal advisers and others,  and  with  the
co-operation, particularly, of the  NCOP  members,  we  have  been  able  to
provide this document before us, which  is  acceptable.  Certain  amendments
that could have improved the Division of Revenue Bill, however,  had  to  be
left out.

In order to avoid such a  recurrence,  the  programming  committees  of  the
National Assembly and the NCOP should streamline and  co-ordinate  in  order
to see to it that the rising of one of these groups should not occur  whilst
the other one is still in session.  I  think  this  could  be  addressed  in
future.

We also had worthwhile inputs from Salga, and one must  just  bear  in  mind
that, at this stage, it is a new event that is  happening  from  the  fiscal
side with regard to the financing of municipalities.

With regard to the financing of municipalities it must, however, be  pointed
out that no impediment is  being  laid  in  terms  of  income-generation  by
municipalities. They can still charge their rates and have their  fees  that
are coming in. Actually what is happening  is  that  additional  moneys  are
going towards these municipalities.

I think that the concerns are that there  could  be  interference  in  their
domestic affairs, which is unfounded.  We  would  indeed  warn  that  should
Treasury accept some of these  proposals,  then  the  position  of  Treasury
would be weakened. Now, I think that if some  of  these  municipalities  are
not able to do the necessary administrative work and render their  financial
statements timeously, or that type of thing, then something  is  wrong  with
those particular municipalities.

I would support Treasury's strong hand in this regard,  that  if  you  can't
supply what is required  of  you,  then  you  will  probably  forfeit  this.
Similarly, the district moneys could go towards the districts,  could  still
go to that particular region and that we, from our  side,  at  least,  would
see that proper controls are exercised.

We  thank  Treasury,  particularly,  for  this   fantastic   gesture,   that
municipalities can now be financed. It is a great new  development,  but  in
future we will still keep a tight hand on  this  because  this  could  avoid
administrative problems, particularly in cases of  corruption,  which  could
be  nipped  in  the  bud  right  at  the  beginning.  I  thank  you,   Madam
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Mevrou  die  Voorsitter,  agb  Minister  van  Finansies,  agb
Premiers hier teenwoordig en kollegas, veral in hierdie  verkiesingsjaar  is
dit baie belangrik dat  alle  provinsies  en  plaaslike  regeringsinstansies
deeglik bewus moet wees van die wekroep: "Jy verdien 'n billike deel."

Elke provinsie maak kragtens  artikel  214(1),  en  meer  spesifiek  artikel
214(2)(a)-(j) aanspraak op sy billike deel van die  land  se  inkomstebronne
wat jaarliks tydens die  Begroting  deur  die  Minister  van  Finansies  aan
regeringsinstansies toegedeel word. En tereg  ook  so,  want  in  veral  die
provinsiale toekennings in die Wetsontwerp op die  Verdeling  van  Inkomste,
2004, word 'n deurlopende verbintenis gereflekteer wat daarop  gemik  is  om
seker te maak dat elkeen die vereiste bronne het om uitvoering  te  gee  aan
nasionale beleidsrigtings en -voorskrifte, en hul verpligtings  ten  opsigte
van die lewering van noodsaaklike dienste na te kom. Sonder  dié  belangrike
bronne  kan  hulle  nie  beloftes  aan  die  volk  na  behore   nakom   nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister  of  Finance,  hon  Premiers
present here and colleagues, in this election year in particular it is  very
important that all provinces and local  government  institutions  should  be
thoroughly aware of the clarion call: ``You deserve a fair share.''

Each province claims, in terms of section 214(1), and more  specifically  in
terms of section 214(2)(a)-(j), its share of the sources of  income  of  the
country which are allocated annually during the Budget by  the  Minister  of
Finance  to  government  institutions.  And  rightly  so,  because  in   the
provincial  allocations  in  the  Division  of  Revenue   Bill,   2004,   in
particular, a continuous commitment is reflected,  aimed  at  ensuring  that
each has the necessary sources to implement  national  policies  and  policy
directives and honour their obligations  with  regard  to  the  delivery  of
essential services. Without these important  sources  they  cannot  properly
keep their promises to the nation.]

 Chairperson,  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment  with  strong  economic
growth,  which  reduces  income  poverty  through  low  unemployment,  which
eradicates social exclusion and develops a  sense  of  belonging  among  our
citizens, is brought about by broad-based programmes executed by  the  three
spheres of government.

The Constitution assigns exclusive and concurrent powers  and  functions  to
each sphere of government and the division of revenue provides an  equitable
share to Government departments, provincial  government  and  municipalities
to give effect to Government's commitment in progressively increasing  basic
needs.

Having  said  that,  one  should,  however,  also  realise   that   economic
disparities exist within  and  between  provinces  and  municipalities.  The
equitable share formula recognises that provinces  and  municipalities  have
different demographic and economic profiles, and markedly  different  levels
of economic development.  Therefore,  an  equal  share  to  each  Government
department, province and municipality is totally  out  of  place.  The  most
each of them can do, in their planning and budgeting,  is  to  realise  that
they deserve a fair share of the country's financial resources.

Chairperson, the compliance of the Division of Revenue Bill, 2004, with  the
requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, is noted. Also, the  fact
that legal instruments, such as  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Act are rendering more explicit  the  expectations  of  municipal
government and the fact that clauses contained in  the  Bill  to  take  into
account  the  Local  Gopvernment:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act   are
expected to improve local government performance and finances  in  the  area
of project planning and management.

Chairperson, before I conclude, I wish to make use of  this  opportunity  to
thank the hon Minister of Finance for the exemplary and astute  way  he  has
led, steered and commanded the good ship finance during  this  parliamentary
term, that caused South  Africa  to  gain  the  position  of  pride  in  the
international financial community that it deserves.

Also a word of thanks to Qedani Mahlangu,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Select
Committee on Finance, for her strong and  dedicated  leadership  and  to  my
colleagues in the committee for the friendship and the camaraderie in  these
past five years.

Ons het bande van vriendskap, onderlinge vertroue en respek gesmee  wat  die
toets van die tye sal deurstaan.  Die  NNP  steun  die  Wetsontwerp  op  die
Verdeling van  Inkomste,  B4B-2004.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[We have formed ties of friendship, mutual  trust  and  respect  which  will
stand the test of time. The NNP supports the Division of Revenue Bill,  B4B-
2004. [Applause.]]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Chairperson, my colleagues, somebody at  the  back  here
is teasing me.
Mhlalingaphambili,  okokuqala  mandibonise  okokuba  ndiya  kuhlonipha  kuba
umana usilumkisa,  nangokuthi  masithethe  iilwimi  zethu.  Yinto  ebaluleke
kakhulu leyo. Ndiyathembisa okokuba abaza kuza, baqalise kule Ndlu  kwithuba
elizayo, siya kuba nakho ukumana sibakhuthaza kuba sayandlala indlela  ukuze
sithethe iilwimi zethu apha. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, firstly I would like to say that I  respect  you  for  the
guidance and encouragement you always give us to use our languages. That  is
very important. I promise that we will guide the new members  that  will  be
joining us later in this House and encoruage them  to  use  their  languages
too, because we paved the way for the use of all languages as official.]

I also want to show my colleagues that I have pruned the speech  that  seems
to be thick to suit my day, because this is a special day, after I  received
that symbolic present last night. You know, it's a present  that  I'm  going
to share with my dear wife, who has been convulsing for five years.  It  has
been a hard time. But I must really say that  I  appreciate  the  support  I
received from all those members who understood my situation.

Hon Chair, it is worth noting that the Division  of  Revenue  Bill  and  its
underlying  allocations  are  the  culmination  of  extensive   consultation
processes between the three  spheres  of  government  in  a  spirit  of  co-
operative governance. Subsequent to that, cycling would be a  commitment  of
taking into account factors set out in the Constitution, section 214,  these
being national interest, provision for debt, national Government  needs  and
emergencies, and, indeed, to ensure that provinces  are  in  a  position  to
provide constitutionally mandated services, developmental  and  other  needs
of provinces, such as local government fiscal capacity,  efficiency  of  the
provincial  and  local  spheres,  reduction  of  economic  disparities   and
promotion of stability.

As from April this year, provinces' share  of  revenue  is  R181,1  billion,
which is R20 billion more than the  revised  estimate  for  last  year.  The
North West provincial government receives 8,21% of the  total  transfers  to
all provinces. Equitable shares make  up  88,3%  of  national  transfers  to
provinces and this amount grows at an annual rate of 8,8%.

Updates of data in the equitable share formula are  affected  on  an  annual
basis, depending on the availability of official data. Government  committed
itself to a major review of the formula for  the  2004  Budget.  Though  the
review process has begun, the process could not be completed  in  time.  New
data from Census 2001 and other data sources were published towards the  end
of the budget allocation process.

Government agreed to retain the structure of the provincial equitable  share
formula for the 2004 Budget, but to update for Census 2001 and  other  data.
A more wide-ranging review applies to the 2005 Budget. For the 2004  Budget,
a number of data updates were used in the formula. The  education  component
is updated by  replacing  average  enrolment  data  with  2000-02  enrolment
figures, and is to take account of early childhood  development,  while  the
remuneration data currently used  in  the  economic  activity  component  is
replaced with gross domestic product for the region.

Conditional grants have  also  helped  sharpen  the  description  of  policy
objectives and grant outputs, thus resulting in improved use  of  grants  in
speeding up delivery, and  the  strengthening  of  parliamentary  oversight.
However,  the  recent  reports  of  the  Auditor-General  for  the   2002-03
financial year indicate that a number of national departments do  not  fully
comply ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Cllr M G MVOKO (Salga): Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance, hon  Premiers,
hon members and special delegates, how I  wish  I  was  not  here  when  the
Chairperson of the Select Committee on Finance made her  comments.  However,
I must agree that she  is  correct  that  Salga  and  Treasury  should  find
mechanisms that would ensure that all the issues raised at the beginning  of
the Division of Revenue Bill processes  are  not  lost,  especially  at  the
Budget Forum. This would ensure that the discussion at  this  stage  of  the
process and all concerns are adequately addressed before we come here.

Secondly, I think in terms of participation  of  Salga  in  the  NCOP,  some
members might be aware of the fact that  Salga  is  being  restructured  and
some members have contributed to that document on restructuring.  When  that
has been executed, Salga will be in a position to participate  fully.  There
is also the  balance  that  has  to  be  found  between  being  a  full-time
councillor and coming to Parliament more often.

Salga  has  objectively  reviewed  the  2004  Budget  as   it   relates   to
municipalities  and  an  analysis  on  the  division  of  revenue  to  local
governments was undertaken. The analyses were performed when  the  equitable
share allocations at a microlevel and the equitable  share  formula  on  the
conditional grants and  the  data  was  extracted,  using  the  Division  of
Revenue Act, the Division of Revenue Bill and the  Budget  Reviews  of  2003
and 2004.

There are numerous changes between the equitable share  that  is  stated  in
the Division of Revenue Act and in the Division of Revenue  Bill.  There  is
no obvious trend with regard to the above changes. Some municipalities  have
seen the local government equitable share increase, while others  have  seen
theirs  decrease.  The  larger,  wealthier,  metros  have  all  seen   their
equitable share allocations increase, while this is not  the  same  for  the
less  wealthy,  poorer,  metropolitan  municipalities  such  as  the  Nelson
Mandela Metropolitan Municipality.

A commonality between the equitable share and the  municipal  infrastructure
grant is that an individual municipality receives a share of  funding  as  a
proportion of the  allocation  to  all  municipalities,  rather  than  their
allocation being based on needs.  The  MIG  introduces  a  requirement  that
municipalities should split infrastructure  expenditure  at  80:20,  between
new and rehabilitated infrastructure. This raises the  question  of  whether
20% will be sufficient to meet the very  urgent  needs  of  maintaining  the
existing infrastructure in municipalities. This ratio creates the  incentive
for municipalities to expand infrastructure, but does  not  ensure  that  an
adequate amount is provided for maintenance. There is little  discussion  in
the Budget Review 2004 as to why applications for the  restructuring  grants
were of a  poor  quality  and  standard,  and  this  should  be  researched,
especially since large resources are being allocated for  this  purpose  and
considering  the   need   for   capacity-building   to   ensure   successful
implementation of the Municipal Finance Management Act.

Nothwithstanding all these challenges, the majority  of  conditional  grants
to be transferred from national  Government  to  local  government  will  be
useful to integrate national priorities  into  municipal  budgets.  It  will
promote national norms and standards. It will continue to  address  backlogs
and regional disparities in municipal restructuring.

Infrastructure grants are also seen as a way to  stimulate  economic  growth
in underprivileged areas and  promote  job  creation.  Capacity  grants  are
given  to  local  government  to  enable  municipalities  and  other   local
government institutions to build their institutional capacity  in  order  to
deliver services in a more efficient, effective and  economical  way.  Salga
will continue to co-operate with all spheres in  order  to  ensure  that  we
achieve our objectives of developmental local  government.  We  support  the
Budget. Thank you.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, the Minister  opened  by  saying  that  indeed  co-
operative governance is alive and well, and that has been our experience  in
the Western Cape province also as far as this Budget is  concerned.  We  are
confident in saying that the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  for  the  2004-05
financial year is a much better drafted and crafted  piece  of  legislation,
when one compares it to those of the past. We must compliment  the  National
Treasury in this regard. The explanatory memorandum attached to the Bill  is
a tremendous service to members, and is especially informative and  explains
the division of revenue in the  most  understandable  manner.  We  are  also
grateful for that.

Our share in the Western Cape, along with everyone else, will be  a  subject
of  ongoing  negotiation  and  we  accept  that.  The  early  start  to  the
legislative process this  time  around  must  be  applauded  as  treasuries,
including our Western Cape one, were granted the opportunity to  comment  on
the initial  draft.  Generally,  I  understand  it  is  only  circulated  to
treasuries. I do not know whether the Minister circulated  it  more  widely.
It was distributed before 18 February, National Budget Day.

We in the Western  Cape  must  express  our  appreciation  to  the  National
Treasury, who accommodated most of our inputs - and we  had  several  -  and
are now included in this version of the Bill. We would like  to  think  that
it has improved as a consequence. This happened with the exception of a  few
technical proposals which were not accepted, but  which  we  can  live  with
and, perhaps where applicable, we can raise the next time around.

In the committee we also wish to thank the Treasury and  Sars  officers  for
their attendance, for their obvious dedication, for their skill,  for  their
co-operative attitude and their  sense  of  service.  What  has  struck  me,
Minister,  about  your  officials  is  their  sense  of  service  and  their
humility, and I really think  that  they  are  exemplary  and  I  have  been
constantly impressed by the level of support that we have had from them.

In general then, the Division of Revenue Bill is,  in  principle,  supported
by the Western Cape province. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank  you,  Chairperson,  hon  members,  for  your
contributions. Whilst I was listening very carefully  to  the  contributions
of hon members, I also received some very good news and  permit  me,  Chair,
to digress for a moment and share with you  the  good  news.  There  was  an
individual who called himself an organisation and all  kinds  of  things,  a
man called Terry Crawford-Brown. He went to court and sought an  application
to overturn a number of executive decisions, which our submission  has  been
and remains, were correctly taken with the  involvement  of  Parliament.  Mr
Crawford-Brown's application was turned down  by  the  court  this  morning,
with costs. [Applause.] This  is  very  important  because  this  individual
sought to continuously argue that we don't apply  our  minds  when  we  take
decisions. I want to be there when the costs are recovered from him.

Back to the business at hand. I think that one of the issues about  the  way
in which the debate on the NCOP was handled, this time round,  is  that  the
process was truncated so that we can all be deployed into  the  fields.  And
that truncation has, to some  extent,  limited  the  participation  that  we
would want to see of the NCOP and of the provincial  legislatures;  as  well
as each  municipality,  in  discussion  and  debates  around  the  NCOP.  We
understand that there was  the  acceleration  of  the  process  and  we  are
mindful of it. Notwithstanding that, let me  express  appreciation  for  the
support from across the board.

I would like to deal with some of the issues raised by some hon  members  in
their contributions. The first is  in  the  nature  of  the  criticism  from
Salga.  I  heard  the  hon  Mvoko  and  also  comments  made  by  the  other
councillors and by Mrs Mokotoko and Mr Sony. I  have  had  discussions  with
both the chair of Salga and with Ms Mokoena. It does not accord  him,  so  I
would like to understand what the decision-making processes are, so that  we
can be talking to one Salga. I know it is a difficult process, but  my  plea
is that we talk with one Salga throughout this.

The  hon  Mahlangu  expressed  concern  about  the  qualified   audits   for
municipalities. I am glad that they are qualified  audits  because  so  many
municipalities do not even bother to pay the Auditor-General,  in  order  to
avoid being audited. Now that there are qualified audits, at least you  have
something to work with. That is what we should celebrate today.

On the performance audits requested in a comment by  the  hon  Mahlangu,  in
the context of the legislation for empowering the Auditor-General, I have  a
deal with the Auditor-General. That is that I would like  to  see  his  golf
handicap improve, because he does not need  to  do  performance  audits.  He
does not need to be here, because we  have  legislation  that  empowers  the
oversight which, tragically, is not being used. The section 32  reports,  in
terms of the PFMA, are placed in the hands of this House every  month  as  a
tool for oversight. You can add to that the  nonfinancial  information  that
we gather for the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review. We place it in the  hands
of this legislature and then you can see a  matching  between  spending  and
performance. You don't need outside agencies. That  is  what  Parliament  is
about. My plea this morning is that even if there is less of an emphasis  in
the Public Audit Bill, it does not matter. If Parliament is doing its  work,
then its oversight  function  will  improve  on  the  quality  of  spending,
because we now have sufficient information available to  empower  Parliament
to do it. So I plead with you: Please do  what  the  law  asks  you  to  do.
Outside agencies can never feel it in quite the same way.

The hon Mahlangu raised, and perhaps not for the  first  time,  the  earlier
tabling of the Division of Revenue Bill. I find it a  strange  point  coming
from the hon Mahlangu, firstly,  because  she  participates  in  the  Budget
Council. Participants in that council would know that even the numbers  that
we table in the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  at  the  beginning  of
November  was  substantially  changed,  allowing  larger  transfers  to  the
provinces because our debt service costs were lower and  in  allocating  the
additional resources, we allocated the bulk of them to provinces. If we  had
tabled the Bill earlier, it would have been wrong. What we have done, and  I
make this plea to both the NCOP, provincial legislatures and to Salga:  What
we do with this Division of Revenue Bill is to table  three-year  indicative
allocations. If you want an early publication of the Bill, we give  you  the
Division of Revenue Bill to the fiscal year that ends on 31 March  2007.  We
cannot do it any earlier than that.

Sadly, in the comments there is nothing  in  the  debate  beyond  the  first
year. To both Salga and the NCOP, my plea is, help us steer the course  from
here. It is a big ship and we give you advance warning. We  filed  with  you
the path by which we seek to navigate.  If  you  want  us  to  veer  into  a
different direction, talk to us now.

My plea to Salga, councillor Mvoko, is that in the next engagement, it  does
not have to be in the Budget Forum later this year, go through it  and  tell
us, about the conditional grant to each local authority, what is wrong  with
the decisions. Talk to us and you know the allocations  there  are  done  by
the Department of Provincial and Local  Government,  in  collaboration  with
the Treasury. Talk to us and we can steer the ship from here to  get  there.
Once the Budget is tabled in February next year, it will be  too  late.  The
information is not a secret. It is made  available  at  this  stage  in  the
medium-term format to empower legislatures to  make  input  on  the  budgets
going forward.

 Again, I can do little else beyond plead that  the  information  available.
This information for this new fiscal  year  starting  next  month,  is  less
important than the outer years. In engaging with the issues,  I  plead  that
the outer years should be considered and earlier than that it  is  going  to
be very hard to publish. We don't publish it  just  to  spend  ink  or  fill
pages. We publish it so that we empower legislatures to talk to us and  help
us understand what the intention of the executive is in going forward.

Hon Seloane, I agree with the spelling of your name,  Sir.  [Laughter.]  One
of the important issues raised by you, Sir, is the  19  conditional  grants,
and this is a very high number. We are somewhat trapped. On the one hand,  I
think  that  everybody  in  the  National  Treasury  would  agree  that  the
provinces and  local  government  are  in  the  process  of  government  and
therefore should be empowered to take decisions about  their  own  spending.
On the other hand, we have  a  set  of  contradictions  that  arise  because
provinces find themselves dealing with statutory payments, such  as  welfare
grants and nonstatutory grants. Statutory payments are peremptory. There  is
no discretion vested in the province whether or not to  pay  social  grants.
In that environment, unless something else is ring-fenced, I think  that  we
may find ourselves going forward in a situation where  provinces  do  little
else but pay welfare grants. So there is a huge  contradiction  and  perhaps
we can resolve that, going forward. Among the issues that we  will  have  to
resolve is the establishment  of  the  social  security  agency  which  will
transfer out at least that which is currently  contained  in  the  equitable
share, leaving provinces then to deal with the core  functions  as  foreseen
in the Constitution.

Another important point raised by the hon Seloane is the  data  deficiencies
in the IGFR and all that we do is reproduce what  we  receive.  All  of  the
nonfinancial indicators we receive and I thought that we  are  much  better.
There is one province whose Premier is here today, and it is not  the  North
West or the Free State province. I forget which one it is. When the  section
32 returns were first received, in the first returns we received  from  that
province, welfare grants were treated as capital  expenditure.  It  took  us
some while to explain why it is not capital. Part of ensuring that  we  have
a better quality, of especially the  nonfinancial  information,  is  knowing
that the capacity is there in the provinces to deal with it.

I also want to thank the hon Seloane  for  his  valuable  contribution  over
many years to the NCOP. He delivered his maiden and swan  song  speeches  at
the same time.

The hon Raju correctly raised the issues  of  employment.  We  need  a  much
wider discourse and I think it is important to recognise that  the  Expanded
Public Works Programme is essentially about skilling. We  must  not  pretend
that it is going to be permanent jobs. There will be many more  people  than
the million that we anticipated passing through it.  It  will  make  a  very
significant contribution, going forward.

The hon Bekker's points about municipalities need to be well-taken. We  have
a hand, but I think we need a firm hand with  municipalities  and  violation
of the norms. I would like to see a firm hand when municipalities  say  that
they do not want to pay the Auditor-General. In that case we  must  actually
take very strong action to ensure that they  act  within  the  framework  of
accountability. For the rest, I think it  is  important  that  we  recognise
that municipalities are institutions of government and need to be  respected
and treated as such.

In respect of the one point raised by the hon Durr, yes, the the  draft  was
circulated to treasuries. I think that in  the  context  of  government,  we
treat the discussions with the Budget Council and between the treasuries  as
confidential. One of the things which has been one of those issues that  one
would cherish is that out of 10 years of co-operative  governance,  we  deal
with the information. There are actually quite a number of people  involved,
including the nine provincial treasuries and we have not had a  single  leak
of information before Budget Day. It says something about the  integrity  of
the people involved in  the  process  and  we  need  to  applaud  everybody,
especially the provincial treasuries, because the  information  is  actually
quite widely available.

Let me conclude by making three points on the improvement  of  the  role  of
the NCOP with regard to the Division of  Revenue  Bill  for  the  second  10
years of democracy. The first is that of building the capacity of  the  NCOP
to absorb and use the information  presented  in  the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill. Though this has improved every year during the past few  years,  there
is still not sufficient  participation  by  provinces  and  organised  local
government. This makes it difficult for national Government to  engage  more
directly  with  provincial  legislatures  and  municipal  councils.  In  the
process,  the  NCOP  must  be  taken  more  seriously   by   provinces   and
municipalities and reflected in better attendance  during  the  hearings  of
the select committee. My information is that when  the  briefing  was  done,
there was the chairperson and two members in the select committee.  Now,  it
is a big issue. We have to fly people down from Pretoria, get them to  leave
other things, but if that  is  the  level  of  participation,  it  makes  it
difficult for us to sustain it.

I want to emphasise the consultative process for the Bill.  Its  allocations
are  very  deep,  involving  all  key  political   stakeholders,   including
organised local government. The second point to note is that the NCOP has  a
critical role to play in monitoring the implementation of this  Act  and  to
ensure that the system of grants is transparent,  fair  and  equitable.  The
audit  process  must  report  whether  intergovernmental   grants   are   in
accordance with the Act and its schedules. It is important  for  our  system
of co-operative governance that the NCOP monitor the implementation of  this
Act during and after the financial year.

The last point I'd  like  to  make  involves  the  role  of  the  provincial
executive councils, in addition to the legislatures  in  the  processing  of
section 76 legislation. Last year and this year  the  NCOP  has  passed  key
section 76  legislation  on  health  and  social  grants.  These  will  have
significant fiscal implications for the provincial sphere.  Yet  it  is  not
clear what role the provincial excos have played in  the  process.  This  is
because once the legislation is approved in the  National  Assembly,  it  is
referred directly to the sector portfolio committee in  the  provinces.  The
Finance portfolio committees also play no direct role. This  narrow  process
of approval in provincial legislatures  opens  our  system  up  to  unfunded
mandates.

Just as we have joint Minmecs  between  the  10  treasuries  and  provincial
sectors, we need to have joint participation for key section 76  legislation
when it may  have  significant  budgetary  implications.  The  NCOP  has  an
important  role  to  play  in  building  co-operative  governance   in   the
legislative and Budget processes and  to  minimise  unfunded  mandates.  Our
system of intergovernmental relations has evolved in the past 10 years.  The
NCOP will need to assess its role with regard to section 76 legislation,  if
it is to meet the challenge in the next 10 years.

Finally, and since this is my last Budget Speech on this issue  during  this
term of Government, I'd like to thank the members of  the  select  committee
and members of the provincial finance committees, and MECs  for  Finance.  I
think we have undertaken a huge transformation and I would like  to  believe
that we would continue to make a very significant contribution to the  lives
of the poorer South Africans. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

                DROUGHT RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, the short title of this Bill reads as follows:


  To appropriate additional amounts of money for the  requirements  of  the
  Departments of Health, Social Development, Agriculture and Water  Affairs
  and Forestry in respect of the 2003-04 financial year.

So  reads  the  short  title.  Of  course,  it's  not  ultimately  for   the
requirements of the departments concerned, but for the needs of  the  people
that have been so badly hit by years of intermittent  drought,  particularly
severe in varying degrees over  the  past  few  years  in  different  places
affecting most provinces, if not all provinces.

The Bill provides for R35 million to the Department of Health in respect  of
the 2003-04 financial year to fund the prevention of communicable  diseases,
with special emphasis on malaria and cholera; to the  Department  of  Social
Development an amount of  R60  million  for  funding  emergency  relief  for
vulnerable communities; to the Department of Agriculture an  amount  of  R30
million to provide fodder for livestock and for  farming  communities;  and,
to the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry an amount  of  R125  million
for the provision of water for human consumption and  for  livestock  -  all
very commendable and very deserving.

This House is, indeed, grateful that also the  appeals  that  were  made  in
several debates in this House over the past  18  months  on  behalf  of  the
provinces, were in fact heard by  Government.  Intermittent  drought  stalks
our land and will continue to challenge us from time to  time.  We  need  to
organise ourselves so that we do not deal with this kind of  problem  on  an
ad hoc basis, but rather that we develop plans and procedures  that  can  be
triggered quickly in the event of drought.

There is no doubt in my mind that the longer we take to respond to  drought,
the greater the cost and suffering, and  the  greater  the  threat  to  food
security and rural social disintegration.  Sometimes,  also,  a  catastrophe
becomes irreversible the longer you wait.

The funds voted will help with emergency relief;  provision  of  fodder  and
water for both communal and commercial  farmers;  provide  water  for  human
consumption and prevent communicable diseases - highly deserving indeed.  It
is my pleasure to  commend  the  Drought  Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

               LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL PROPERTY RATES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy  Chair,  hon
members, today is the last sitting of this House, the  National  Council  of
Provinces, before the general election on 14 April.
Members of this House will look back with pride at the amount of  work  they
have been able to accomplish during their term  of  office.  Very  important
and progressive pieces of legislation have been passed by this  House.  Such
legislation has strengthened our democracy and consolidated our  new  system
of local government. Indeed, this House has  every  cause  to  celebrate  10
years of freedom and democracy.

We have so  much  to  celebrate  as  a  country  because  when  our  ANC-led
democratic Government came into power in  1994  it  inherited  a  system  of
local government that was completely dysfunctional. It was structured  along
racial lines that served to exclude and  marginalise  the  majority  of  our
people  from  participating  in  our  country's   economic   and   political
processes. Despite the fact that  there  were  over  1  000  municipalities,
there were still vast  rural  areas  that  did  not  fall  under  any  local
authority  at  all.  There  were  some  municipalities  that  did  not  have
financial statements or even a computer.

In 1995, municipalities were restructured along  nonracial  lines  and  many
parts of the rural areas were included. The  number  of  municipalities  was
reduced to 843 -  if  you  will  remember.  The  system  was,  however,  not
workable as there were too many municipalities for the size of our  country,
and the vast majority had  little  or  no  revenue  base  and  were  largely
dependent on grants from national Government.

In order to address these challenges and to create  financially  viable  and
sustainable  local  government,  the  country  was  redemarcated  into   284
municipalities and  these  were  the  wall-to-wall  municipalities  that  we
referred to. The creation of these municipalities allowed  us  to  bring  in
those rural parts of the country that were still  outside  the  system,  and
allowed us to achieve economies  of  scale  in  administration  and  service
delivery.

After the new demarcation and amalgamation, every municipality should  be  a
single economic unit to which both suburbs and  townships  contribute  their
labour, and from which both benefit. Under the new system, people  from  the
townships and rural areas have the opportunity to  share  the  revenue  they
are helping to  generate.  There  is  now  a  better  basis  for  allocating
developmental funding, which helps to create the conditions  for  attracting
investors.

In the past six years, national Government has worked on  creating  the  new
governing  structures  and  the  formulation  of  policy   and   legislation
frameworks for local government. The White Paper on  Local  Government,  the
Municipal Structures Act,  the  Municipal  Demarcation  Act,  the  Municipal
Systems Act and the Traditional Leadership Governance Framework  Act  create
the framework for governance within which a strong local  government  sphere
is built.

One of the biggest challenges  facing  us  as  a  country  is  the  area  of
municipal finance. Substantial progress has been made in  this  regard  with
the passage of the Municipal Finance  Management  Act.  The  property  rates
legislation  is  yet  another  important  building  block  in   this   local
government transformation process. Together,  these  pieces  of  legislation
seek to  broaden  the  revenue  base  of  municipalities,  and  improve  the
administration of rates and general management of municipal finances.

South Africa has what our President, Thabo Mbeki, refers  to  as  the  "dual
economy" - one advanced, skilled and  becoming  more  globally  competitive,
while the second is mainly informal, marginalised and unskilled.  Government
has pursued a dual policy of developmental programmes  and  Expanded  Public
Works Programmes aimed at redressing the needs of the second economy on  the
one hand, and, on the other hand, the modernisation of the first economy  to
create the necessary surplus needed to advance the second.

Although our Government succeeded in the first decade in providing  housing,
health care and social services directly to marginalised  communities,  many
still remain at the periphery of  the  mainstream  economy.  Government  has
adopted a deliberate policy aimed at stimulating the  economy  in  order  to
alleviate poverty. Through a programme of investing  in  infrastructure,  we
pursued twin objectives of  providing  basic  services  and  addressing  the
infrastructure backlogs we  inherited,  while  at  the  same  time  creating
conditions for sustainable development.

In the past 10 years, national, provincial and local governments  instituted
various programmes to address underdevelopment  and  poverty.  Implementable
strategies and programmes were put in place to address challenges  in  areas
such  as  food  security  and  basic  nutrition,   water   and   sanitation,
electricity  and  energy  provision,  housing  and  shelter,  land   reform,
transport, education,  health  care,  SMMEs  and  social  cohesion,  amongst
others.

These initiatives saw massive amounts of public sector resources  set  aside
for    service    delivery    and    infrastructure    investment    through
intergovernmental  programmes  and  transfers  such  as   the   Consolidated
Municipal Infrastructure Programme and the  equitable  share.  The  Ten-Year
Review shows that  the  majority  of  our  people  have  directly  benefited
through  greater  access  to  basic  services  such   as   shelter,   water,
electricity and basic sanitation.

Central to the success of all Government interventions in the second  decade
will be  a  robust,  sustainable,  effective  and  stable  system  of  local
government. Municipalities will need to  create  resilient  and  competitive
local economies that are capable of creating  long-term  work  opportunities
and a sustainable economic and revenue base. It is against  this  background
that the national Government has  allocated  R47,3  billion  over  the  next
three years to the local government sphere - and  this  is  an  increase  of
R3,9 billion.

It is within  these  past  10  years  that  we  have  also  established  and
consolidated all the core systems of developmental local  government.  These
systems  are  aimed  at  enhancing  community  participation  in  governance
issues, integrated planning, service delivery  and  performance  management.
Many of our achievements are attributed to this new system of  developmental
local government.

The Property Rates Bill seeks to balance the need for municipalities  to  be
able  to  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  perform  their   constitutional
objectives, and to stimulate local economic development  with  the  need  to
deal with the plight of the very poor. One  of  the  main  issues  that  the
White Paper identifies, with regard to property rating, is the treatment  of
the poor in the rating of their property.

In the 10 years of democratic governance 1,6 million houses have been  built
for the poor throughout the country. It is  important  that  we  retain  the
people within the formal housing market, and that we take measures  to  ease
the burden of the poor against the changes in  the  labour  market  and  the
economy in general.

The property rates legislation, thus specifically  excludes  the  first  R15
000 of residential property from rating. This is true  for  all  residential
properties irrespective of the value of the property. The value  is  subject
to review in order to take inflation into account to provide for  relief  to
the poor.  In  this  respect,  we  have  noted,  as  the  Ministry  and  the
department, the report of the select committee  requesting  that  a  further
investigation be conducted to assess the appropriateness of this  threshold.
The department undertakes to look into this matter. However,  any  amendment
to  the  legislation  will  be  determined  by  the  outcome  of   such   an
investigation and assessment.

The Bill has other aspects  that  deal  with  poor  individuals.  The  rates
policy must take into account the effect of rates on the  poor  and  provide
measures to alleviate the rates  burden  on  them.  Municipalities  may  use
exemptions, rebates or reductions to provide  relief  to  indigent  property
owners and pensioners.

In addition, the Property Rates  Bill  excludes  land  reform  beneficiaries
from the payment of rates for a period of 10 years,  provided  the  property
does not change hands. Even after the lapse of the 10-year grace period,  it
is highly unlikely that property in rural areas will be levied  as  the  R15
000 exclusion will still apply. It is therefore highly unlikely  that  rates
will be levied in rural areas where values of property are so low  that  the
cost of administration will outweigh the revenue generated.

Another exclusion provided for is 30% of the market value of public  service
infrastructure. This infrastructure is intended for the public good  and  is
essential for the delivery of basic services such as water and  electricity.
This  exclusion  will  thus  assist  national  Government's  objectives   of
delivering free basic services.

This Bill seeks to  strike  a  balance  between  the  need  for  a  coherent
national  framework  for  property   rates   that   will   foster   national
macroeconomic balance, and the need of municipalities to shape  their  rates
policies  by  consultation  with  major  stakeholders.   It   then   becomes
imperative for councillors and communities, in particular ward  councillors,
including  the  private  sector  and  the   civil   formations,   to   forge
partnerships to make  sure  the  Bill  is  implemented  in  the  way  it  is
visualised. People  have  to  get  involved  in  governance  issues  in  the
municipalities.

The  property  rates  legislation   requires   municipalities   to   consult
communities  when  formulating  their  rates  policies  that   will   inform
decisions on the treatment of the different  categories  of  property.  This
Bill does not mandate preferential treatment of any  category  of  property,
but leaves that to  the  individual  councils  to  decide,  based  on  local
conditions and circumstances and in consultation with their communities.

The Property Rates Bill is not a wealth  tax,  as  some  would  like  us  to
believe. It is founded on the principle of our system of  local  government,
which now has a much greater service delivery  and  developmental  role.  To
fulfil this role, it has to have adequate revenue, hence Government  decided
to review the local government financial system.

In conclusion, let me, on behalf of the Ministry for  Provincial  and  Local
Government and the department, thank the Chairperson and the members of  the
Select Committee on  Local  Government  and  Administration  for  their  co-
operation and speedy but meticulous manner in which  they  dealt  with  this
piece of legislation.

We also wish to  thank  officials  of  our  department,  representatives  of
various organisations as well as Salga, for their  invaluable  contributions
and insights which resulted in this sound piece of legislation, which I  now
commend to this House. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson,  our  hon  Premiers,  hon  Minister,  special
delegates and hon colleagues, the Bill before us this morning is one of  the
legal frameworks aimed at transforming local  government  and  at  the  same
time enhancing the economic viability of this sphere of government.

Looking back at the recent  promulgation  of,  amongst  others,  legislation
regulating municipal entities  as  well  as  the  recent  Municipal  Finance
Management Act, we can clearly see the strengthening of the economic  muscle
of municipalities, as well as the requisite instruments for sound  financial
management, transparency and accountability.

Running through all these initiatives and processes is  the  essential  vein
of public participation. The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Property  Rates
Bill before us has undergone intense public scrutiny throughout  the  stages
of its deliberation.

Without intending to diminish the sterling work done by the  department,  we
would not shy away from the fact that this Bill, in  its  present  form,  is
truly a product of dedicated deliberations by various stakeholders and role-
players in local  government  and,  in  particular,  practitioners  in  this
sphere of government.

We are, indeed, heartened by the total  dedication  displayed  by  organised
local government in this regard. We sincerely hope that this  momentum  will
be maintained. We are all alive to  the  fact  that  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Property Rates Bill is one of those  pieces  of  legislation  that
demands constant support in  their  implementation,  especially  considering
the complexities involved in this Bill.

We have noted, hon members,  with  much  appreciation,  the  commitment  and
goodwill displayed by some municipalities that improvise in  order  to  deal
with some unforseen complexities in implementing some of  our  policies  and
legislation.

We are positive that  this  trend  will  continue.  On  considering  various
pertinent clauses of this Bill, the committee would have  liked  to  propose
amendments to, particularly, clauses 17 and 18. However, it is  acknowledged
that the  envisaged  amendments  would  require  further  investigation  and
assessment before a specific proposal can be formulated and, therefore,  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government is  requested  to  investigate
and assess the appropriateness of the threshold of the amount of    R15  000
referred to in clause 17(1)(h), with a view to increasing  that  amount  and
to report back within 12 months on what should be the appropriate amount.

In view thereof, the said exclusion of  R15  000  should  also  consider  an
amendment to clause 18 that will omit the reference to  paragraphs  (g)  and
(h) of clause 17(1). It would also be appropriate for such an  amendment  to
be accompanied by an amendment to clause 84 that  will  make  provision  for
those regulations to be tabled in Parliament.

In  respect  of  clause  24(2)(b),  the  committee   recommends   that   the
department, by way of guidelines, provide  the  criteria  that  will  assist
municipalities  to  make  a  proper  choice  as  to  the   applicablity   of
subparagraph (i) and (ii)  depending  on  whether  the  circumstances  allow
this. These guidelines should be mindful of the relevant social issues  that
local government has to deal with.

Hon members, I will not go deeper into other clauses, lest I  take  out  the
cream that should be highlighted by my colleagues in the select committee.

In conclusion, we also put on record  the  sterling,  dedicated  performance
displayed by the department. For hours on end we deliberated on  this  Bill,
sometimes in unscheduled meetings. We have progressed to this stage  of  the
Bill because of their dedication.

I would be selfish if I did not also acknowledge  the  work  that  has  been
done by our colleagues in the Portfolio Committee in the National  Assembly.
Hon members, I commend the Bill with the schedules and suggested  amendments
for careful consideration. [Applause.]

Cllr J MOKOENA (Salga): Chairperson, Deputy Minister, hon Premiers,  members
and special delegates, we bring this morning  very  beautiful  greetings  to
you and, we say, at the outset, that we want to confirm that this  is  truly
a product that was characterised by very broad  consultations  organised  by
the department in April 2003 in Benoni, Gauteng.

Out of that process a spirit has flown throughout the consultations and  the
processes that caused us to say here, today, in this House, that  this  Bill
is truly for all of us. It is  truly  a  Bill  that  has  embodied  all  the
concerns that we have raised and we want to  assure  the  House  that  these
were actually addressed at an appropriate time and stage and, therefore,  we
truly say that it is also Salga's Bill. It has all the support of Salga.

Salga endorses this Bill as part of a broader financial strategy that  seeks
to build a self-sustaining  and  meaningful  local  government  system  that
shall endeavour to redress the inequalities pertaining  to  the  levying  of
property rates in South Africa. It is obvious from  the  current  provincial
ordinances that the system is grossly inconsistent in  the  manner  that  it
determines property rating. Hence, the intention of the Bill to  consolidate
the current plethora of property rating legislation is  fully  supported  by
us.

Currently  properties  are  taxed  on  the  value  of  the  land  alone  and
exemptions  are  being  applied  arbitrarily.  The  Bill  provides  for  the
determination of rates on the basis of the market  value  of  the  property,
taking improvements on the land into account and, thus, prescribe a  uniform
rating method. Municipalities shall, therefore, set their  own  rates  based
on the market value determined.

The Property Rates  Bill  provides  for  mandatory  exclusions  and  enables
municipalities to determine exemptions, rebates and reductions  on  a  given
category of properties within a predetermined framework based on the  rating
policy that each municipality shall have adopted.

The Bill provides for checks and balances, such  as  limiting  annual  rates
increases. It enforces consultative processes referred to in  Chapter  4  of
the Municipal Systems Act. Before a municipality adopts  its  rates  policy,
it further allows sectors with concrete concerns to be able to  consult  the
various relevant municipalities. But, most importantly, it allows Salga  and
the department to assist in dispute resolutions.

We further note the provisions  made  to  take  into  account  the  role  of
agriculture and the services that are provided in our  communities  by  this
sector, the need to consider environmental impact and the protection of bio-
diversity, the need to  complement  that  legislation  for  consistency  and
practicability of this legislation has been an important element.

We believe  that  as  organised  local  government  we  shall  uphold  these
principles  and  work  together  with   all   concerned   parties   in   the
implementation of the Bill once  enacted.  The  Bill  sets  up  a  mandatory
phasing-in  period  for  newly  ratable  properties.  This   is   important,
considering that some property has not been rated to this day.

As we have said, we would want to once more confirm what the chairperson  of
the select committee has said, that the R15 000 threshold  will  still  have
to be investigated. We would support that.

The last thing we would want to say is that we want  to  truly  commend  the
two committees, the select committee and the portfolio  committee,  for  the
support they have given to Salga, the leadership  of  those  committees  and
the  department  and  the  co-operation  that  has  emerged  throughout  the
processes of the Bill. We would ask that if that can be sustained,  it  will
help a lot in taking the process forward. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you very much, Deputy Chair. I want  to  start  by  saying
thank you to the House today for enabling me to do  something  that  I  have
not been able to do in the five  years  that  I've  been  here;  I  have  no
prepared speech. I am therefore going to speak off the  cuff  and  I  do  it
with the confidence that I know that you're not going to  laugh  me  out  of
the House. You have been forebearing, and this learning  process  that  I've
undergone by being with you in this House for the past five years  has  been
fantastic, and I thank you all very much for that. Thank you.  I  also  want
to comment today particularly on Rev  Chabaku,  who  should  be  getting  an
Oscar for her dress. [Laughter.]

The reason I do not have a written speech is not because I am  not  familiar
with what is going on with this Bill. As a matter of fact,  my  first  notes
stem from October 1999, when I got a report from the Land  Tax  Subcommittee
of the Katz commission, which I have here  with  me.  And  despite  the  300
hours, which I know have gone into  the  Bill  by  the  portfolio  committee
since then, or since its first draft - there are now about 20 or  so  drafts
- I feel  that  as  far  as  the  section  that  I  am  concerned  with  and
particularly interested in, which is agricultural  taxes,  has  not  changed
all that much from what was said in the report from which I  will  quote  to
you now.

It says that the subcommittee sees no reason in principle why a  rural  land
tax should not be given serious consideration  -  and,  obviously,  we  also
know that that conforms to what the Constitution now allows. It said that  a
national land  tax,  having  as  as  its  primary  target  the  taxation  of
agricultural land, was not a viable option for South Africa. The  weight  of
evidence from South Africa and abroad shows that the land  tax  would  have,
at best, a negligible effect  on  the  land  reform  programme.  I  feel  we
haven't moved much from there.

I do want to say that I miss the fact that  the  select  committees  in  the
National Council of Provinces do not have the opportunity  of  listening  to
the hearings, which add so much to the evaluation of the Bills before  them.
I don't know how, but in some way this would  facilitate  the  work  of  the
chair by making the process more efficient if we could combine  hearings  so
that we could have better insight into and know more  about  the  background
of the Bills we are dealing with.

I would like to say further that the ... Sorry, I thought  the  person  next
to me was speaking to me. I want to express some concern regarding the  Bill
about what I've seen in examples of what happened with land taxation  before
the property rates Bill was at this stage. In the Free  State,  as  you  may
know, several municipalities decided to levy  such  a  tax.  They  did  this
without proper consultation. A well-known court case has now shown  that  to
have been incorrect, not that they weren't allowed to do  that  or  that  it
wasn't legal, but they did this without consultation  and  in  a  way  which
showed no understanding of the actual situation of farming in  this  country
and its inability to contribute to the extent which seems to me most  people
expect of agriculture.

I also want to comment on services, or on the lack  of  services.  Taxation,
normally, is obviously an acceptable way of delivering services,  but  I  do
not see that municipalities have the capability of  delivering  services  to
rural areas in the way in which one expects them to  in  exchange  for  tax,
which is now going to be levied.

Services on farms have been delivered by farmers. I had a  question  to  the
Minister at one stage, on the R1 billion extra for services - free  services
- and the answer that I got was  that  it  was  the  responsibility  of  the
municipalities to determine strategies on how they  would  ensure  that  the
funds would be spent to benefit the people living on farms. Well,  to  date,
I am unaware of where this has actually happened, and this is a  real  cause
for concern.

I would like to say that another concern of mine - and  I  reread  the  Bill
this morning - is that you can appeal to the MEC. My  own  experience,  once
again with regard to the Free State, is that in June last year,  I  directed
a question and a request  that  the  MEC,  through  the  select  committee's
Chair, address this committee on the waste and  misspending  of  money  that
was taking place in municipalities. I have ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Your  speaking
time has expired, Ms Botha.

Yes, Mr Mokoena?

Cllr J MOKOENA (Salga): There's a point of order. [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Ms Botha's time  has  expired  anyway.
[Laughter.]
Mnr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van  die  Huis,  dié  stuk
wetgewing vandag hier vóór ons, wat alreeds in die ander  Huis  aanvaar  is,
is wetgewing  wat  nie  sommer  goedsmoeds  gehanteer  moet  word  nie.  Die
wetgewing maak  voorsiening  vir  munisipaliteite  om  eiendomsbelasting  te
eien, ook op eiendomme waarvoor nie voorheen belasting  betaal  is  nie,  en
dít is 'n aanvaarbare norm, want  nou  is  almal  verplig  om  belasting  te
betaal. Wat egter kommerwekkend is, is dat 'n munisipaliteit  nooit  hierdie
wetgewing mag sien as die hen  wat  die  goue  eiers  lê  nie,  en  sodoende
roekeloos daarmee handel om sy begroting te laat klop nie.

Landbou word ook nou deur die munisipaliteite belas. Wat egter  onthou  moet
word, is dat daar redelik met die landbousektor  gehandel  moet  word  sover
dit grondbelasting betref. Landbou is  die  grootste  werkgewer  en  ontvang
geen staatsubsidie nie. Daar is egter 'n  mate  van  sekerheid  dat  hierdie
wetgewing voorsiening maak dat die LUR vir plaaslike regering in  provinsies
'n  moniteringsmeganisme  in  plek  moet  hê  om  toe  te   sien   dat   die
munisipaliteite binne die profiel van die  wet  opereer,  want  dit  sal  'n
kwade dag wees as munisipaliteite nie omsigtigheid aan die dag lê nie.

Ook maak die wet voorsiening vir gemeenskapsbetrokkenheid. Dit  beteken  dat
die mense op die grond geken moet word. Elke eienaar het die  reg  op  appél
indien hy of sy nie tevrede is met die skatting van die  eiendom  se  waarde
nie. Dié wetgewing verplig munisipaliteite om hulle  kredietbeheerbeleid  in
plek te kry om sodoende te verseker dat  dienstegeld  en  belasting  ordelik
ingevorder word, en dat daar sover as moontlik toegesien word dat ons  mense
nie verder  in  skuld  gedompel  word  nie.  Agterstallige  dienstegelde  is
alreeds 'n blok aan die voet van munisipaliteite, en daarom kan sommige  nie
die mas opkom nie.

Ten slotte, agb Voorsitter, wil ek  die  voorsitter  van  die  komitee,  mnr
Mkhaliphi, bedank  en  ook  ons  tradisionele  regsverteenwoordiger,  kgoshi
Mokoena, vir die goeie bydrae wat hy gemaak het, én hoe hulle ons gelei  het
deur hierdie wetgewing, asook die departement. Alhoewel daar nog leemtes  in
die wet is, is dié wet 'n noodsaaklikheid en bewys van vordering wat  gemaak
is die afgelope 10 jaar.

Die  NNP  steun  die  wetgewing.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and members of  the  House,  this
piece of legislation here before us today, which has  already  been  adopted
in the other House, is legislation that should not be  handled  haphazardly.
This legislation provides for municipalities to claim property  taxes,  also
on properties on which no tax has been  paid  previously,  and  that  is  an
acceptable norm, because now it is compulsory for everyone to pay tax.  What
is, however, cause for concern, is that  a  municipality  may  never  regard
this legislation as being the hen that lays  the  golden  eggs,  and  in  so
doing deal with it carelessly to make its budget balance.

Agriculture is also now being taxed by municipalities. What should  be  kept
in mind, however, is that the  agricultural  sector  should  be  dealt  with
fairly with regard to land taxes. Agriculture is the  biggest  job  provider
and receives no state subsidy. There is,  however,  a  degree  of  certainty
that this  legislation  provides  that  the  MEC  for  local  government  in
provinces must have a monitoring mechanism  in  place  to  ensure  that  the
municipalities operate within the profile of  the  legislation,  because  it
will be a bad day if municipalities do not use caution.

The legislation also provides for community  involvement.  This  means  that
the people on the land must be consulted.  Every  owner  has  the  right  to
appeal if he or she is not satisfied with the estimation of  the  property's
value. This legislation compels municipalities to put their  credit  control
policy in place to ensure that service fees and taxes are collected  orderly
and that it is ensured as far as possible that our people  are  not  plunged
further in debt. Overdue service fees are already a weight around the  ankle
of municipalities, and that is why some cannot make it.

In conclusion, hon Chairperson, I would like to  thank  the  chairperson  of
the  committee,  Mr  Mkhaliphi,   as   well   as   our   traditional   legal
representative, Kgoshi Mokoena, for the good contribution he  has  made,  as
well as how they led us through this  legislation,  and  I  also  thank  the
department. Although there are still shortcomings in the  legislation,  this
legislation is a necessity and proof of progress that has been made  in  the
past 10 years.

The NNP supports the legislation. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  hon  MECs,  the  hon  Deputy
Minister and hon members, I rise on this occasion in  unconditional  support
of the adoption of the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates  Bill  and
commend the Bill to this House.

I commence by  endorsing  all  those  who  have  been  thanked  by  previous
speakers, especially the team of drafters and various stakeholders  such  as
representatives of Salga, public entities,  agriculture,  municipal  valuers
and others who assisted the committees.

As was noted on the White Paper on Local  Government,  a  simpler  and  more
uniform system is needed as part of local government reform, and  this  Bill
is endorsed today by the ANC as part of  a  comprehensive  local  government
reform process to do away with the discriminative and exclusive  systems  of
the past.

 The Deputy Minister for  Provincial  and  Local  Government  described  the
legislation as an instrument  to  assist  municipalities  with  their  local
economic development.

The ANC would like to take this opportunity today to highlight some  of  the
benefits that would derive from  a  uniform  municipal  system  of  property
rates regulation, with specific focus on the exclusions built into the  Bill
for the protection and advancement of previously disadvantaged communities.
Municipalities derive their power  to  levy  property  rates  directly  from
section 229(1) of the Constitution. But this constitutional power  conferred
on municipalities to levy property rates is, however, not unfettered power.

The Constitution does not allow municipalities  to  excercise  their  powers
solely at their own discretion, and therefore the Constitution,  in  section
229(2)(b),  specifically  allows  national  legislation  to   regulate   the
exercise of this power by municipalities.

The Local Government: Property Rates Bill is, accordingly,  not  the  source
of the power in terms of which municipalities may levy property  rates,  but
an instrument to give effect to section 229 of the  Constitution.  Care  was
nevertheless  taken  not  to   undermine   the   constitutional   power   of
municipalities in the drafting of this Bill.

This Bill will bring about reform benefits to local government with  a  view
to achieving  the  following  objectives,  firstly,  supporting  sustainable
local goverment by providing a stable, buoyant  revenue  source  within  the
discretionary   control   of   municipal   councils;   secondly,   assisting
municipalities in broadening their rates base  to  property  outside  former
municipal boundries and providing transitional rules to  phase  in  property
rates  in  these  areas,  and  thirdly,  providing  uniform  national  rules
regarding valuation and appeals, rating policy and rate setting.

This Bill provides for an enabling framework for municipalities, if they  so
decide, to  extend  the  levying  of  rates  to  categories  of  owners  and
properties that have until now been partially or fully excluded from  paying
rates. The financial implications of this Bill for local government will  be
quite positive with a broadened tax base. The  municipal  revenue  potential
will be significantly enhanced.

The Bill does not prescribe, and this is not envisaged for a very long  time
to come, that property rates will be levied in traditional authority  areas.
Each municipality will have to decide for itself. These property  rates  can
in any case not be levied unless there is individual ownership  of  communal
areas. Municipalities will also not be obliged to value or  rate  properties
for which, for instance, it is difficult to establish  a  value  because  of
past discriminatory laws and practices.

Even where there is individual ownership,  safeguards  are  built  into  the
Bill to ensure  that  the  reform  process  does  not  prejudice  previously
disadvantaged communities and land reform beneficiaries. This is ensured  by
providing that even where there is individual  ownership  of  property,  the
property has first to be valued, and where the property does not exceed  R15
000,  the  owner  is  not  liable  for  any  rates.  [Interjections.]  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Deputy  Chair,
thank you to all the members who made some input in this debate.

This Bill has been somewhat controversial, but during  its  passage  through
the portfolio committee, as well as the  select  committee,  it  has  really
been thoroughly looked at and refined in many ways  to  become  what  it  is
today.

There seems to be people who are still looking at the  first  draft  of  the
Bill and who do not understand the Bill in its current  form.  The  Minister
issued a statement in one of the newspapers, I think it was Business Day,  a
couple of days  ago,  and  again  we  get  the  media  misrepresenting  this
Parliament.

The critics of the Local Government: Municipality Property  Rates  Bill  are
questioning the use of market values as a  basis  for  valuation,  and  they
accuse the property rates as a hindrance to economic growth. They also  have
many other things to say, which I think are quite interesting.

Some of the critics who are proponents of the free  market  principles  have
criticised our decision to use the market value as a concept, and they  fail
to consider that the market value concept that  we  all  understand  is  the
only way that we can ensure equitable treatment of property owners.

I wish to thank all the members who have made a contribution,  but  I  would
advise that we take a good look at this piece of  legislation,  particularly
those  members  of  this  House  who  are   somewhat   misrepresenting   the
recommendations of the Katz Commission. The commission  recommended  that  a
land tax should not be levied at national level, but considered as  a  local
government tax.

The court case that is referred to was decided on technical  and  procedural
issues. I would suggest that we take interest in legislation that is  passed
by this House. One of  the  members  actually  admitted  that  she  was  not
familiar with this piece of legislation. Rather than misrepresent  what  the
Bill is actually trying to achieve, it would be better if we  really  attend
the select committee meetings to understand what this Government  is  trying
to achieve.

I wish to thank all the members who have contributed. I know that  the  Bill
took a much shorter time in the NCOP, but I do commend the  members  of  the
committee for the sterling work that they have done. Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

  CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE INTERVENTION IN
     THE LEKWA TEEMANE MUNICIPALITY IN TERMS OF SECTION 139(1)(c) OF THE
                                CONSTITUTION

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Premiers,  special  delegates,
hon  Deputy  Minister,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on
Intervention in  the  Lekwa  Teemane  Municipality,  having  considered  its
earlier recommendation to this Council, and the subsequent motion passed  by
this House on 26 February 2004, reports as follows.

Whereas municipalities are expected, inter alia, to give effect  to  objects
and duties stipulated in sections 152 and 153 of the  Constitution;  whereas
the provincial and  national  spheres  of  government  are  called  upon  to
support and strengthen the capacity of local government through  legislative
and other measures to enable that sphere of government to manage  their  own
affairs, exercise their powers and perform  their  functions;  conscious  of
the  caution  contained  in  section  151(4),  that  is  to  guard   against
compromising or causing impediments  in  the  local  sphere  of  government;
mindful of the call in Chapter 3 of the Constitution  that  all  spheres  of
government should observe the principles of co-operative governance  at  all
times; and, particularly sensitive to the unique position  of  the  National
Council of Provinces as the guardian of intergovernmental relations, the  ad
hoc committee recommends to this House not to support the  interventions  in
terms of section 139(1)(c), but to recommend an  intervention  in  terms  of
section 139(b) of the Constitution.

The ad hoc committee is still adamant that the  intervention  in  the  Lekwa
Teemane Municipality is urgently necessary and unavoidable, in view  of  the
outright defiance and absence of accountability displayed  by  some  of  the
councillors. The recommendation  by  this  committee  is  therefore  in  the
interest of intergovernmental relations, and especially in the  interest  of
the local sphere of government.

In conclusion,  the  ad  hoc  committee  is  aware  that  the  Minister  for
Provincial and Local Government is engaging with both the  council  and  the
MEC for local government in that province in order to  resolve  the  matters
as amicably as possible. It would be ideal  if  the  Minister  and  the  MEC
provided the National Council of Provinces with regular reports in  relation
to progress on this matter. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now  put
the question that the report be adopted. As the decision is  dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I  shall  first  ascertain  whether
all delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  their  provinces'
vote. Are we all present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. Is there  any  province
wishing to make a declaration of vote? None.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per  province.  Delegation  heads  must  please  indicate
whether they vote in favour, against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Eastern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

The PREMIER OF FREE STATE (Ms I W Direko): We support it.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Mr M SELOANE (Gauteng): Gauteng supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Siyavumelana. [We support it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?

Mr M I MAKOELA: Re a e thekga. [We support it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

 CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORT ON THE FIVE-YEAR REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
                         OF PROVINCES (1999 - 2004)

                          (Subject for discussion)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, hon Premiers, speakers,  special
delegates, members from Salga and colleagues, within a few weeks we will  be
celebrating a decade of our  freedom  and  democracy.  And,  as  we  journey
towards that point, I have to reminisce about an invitation that I  received
some 10 years ago from the hon Dr Molefe when he persuaded me  to  serve  in
the Senate, which was then a House representative of  provincial  interests,
certainly not as formalised as it is now in the Constitution.

At the time that we discussed the issue the hon Premier,  who  has  been  my
mentor, my leader, my comrade and my friend, indicated to me  quite  clearly
that the reason I should go to Cape Town - to the Senate  -  was  to  ensure
that the provincial interests are promoted, protected  and  that  there  was
close liaison between the North West province and Parliament.

He was also  concerned  about  the  fact  that,  as  spokespersons  for  the
province, we  should  ensure  that  what  we  achieve  is  a  people-centred
society,  and  always  be  in  close  contact  and  communicate   with   our
constituencies.

Whatever successes we have achieved as  an  institution,  I  think,  depends
largely on his contribution because during these 10  years  he  has  been  a
pillar of  support  and  has  given  us  unstinting  support,  not  only  as
individuals or delegates from the National Council of Provinces, but as  the
institution as a whole. We are indeed grateful for the kind of support  that
he and other Premiers from the provinces have extended to this  institution.


The transition from the Senate to the National Council of  Provinces  was  a
very critical and important one. It set  out  the  constitutional  framework
which highlighted two important tasks that confronted  this  House  -  tasks
which I know Premier Molefe and other Premiers are quite  conscious  of.  In
the case of  Premier  Molefe,  it  became  evident  as  he  dealt  with  the
challenges and achievements of the institution in the past decade.

These two tasks were, firstly, to promote the interests  of  the  provinces;
secondly, to support local government, the other sphere  of  government,  in
terms of its responsibilities and functions, and to ensure that there is  no
undue encroachment in the integrity  of  that  sphere  of  government;  and,
thirdly, to be part of the legislative process, and in doing so ensure  that
this institution becomes a platform where  we  could  raise  provincial  and
local government concerns as a forum for public debate.

Reflecting on these particular tasks, I can say without reservation that  as
a result of the commitment and contributions of members  of  this  House  as
well as the legislatures,  we  have  indeed  succeeded  in  these  difficult
tasks. I say this because from the perspective of  co-operative  governance,
which  is  central  to  our  responsibilities  and  sound  intergovernmental
relationships, we have shown through  our  engagement  with  our  provincial
legislatures, particularly with regard  to  the  oversight  visits  that  we
conducted in partnership with provincial legislatures and local  government,
and with the participation of the executive in the various  provinces,  that
intergovernmental  relations  and  co-operative  governance  can  indeed  be
achieved through this institution.

We were able to visit provinces to look  at  various  critical  issues  that
confronted this institution.  And  I  must  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces for always reminding us that the task of  this
institution is to respond to the constitutional obligation of ensuring  that
we improve the quality of the lives of our people.

It is no accident, therefore, that central to the work that  we  have  done,
the eradication of poverty was a theme  that  permeated  all  the  oversight
visits. A few examples could be useful. We visited various nodal  points  in
the provinces. Premier Molefe has spoken about Kgalagadi, which was  amongst
the nodal points that we visited to ascertain whether  in  fact  sustainable
rural development was taking place, whether urban renewal was  taking  place
and whether the challenges were being taken up by the  provinces,  and  what
the areas of difficulty were. We did so in a very co-ordinated and  cohesive
way, and we did so not as separate political parties, but as an  institution
of members committed to transformation and the eradication of poverty.
We similarly looked at issues such as the challenges faced  by  business  in
terms of SMMEs and  local  development,  both  at  the  provincial  and  the
municipal level. We examined, amongst  other  things,  the  issues  of  land
restitution and land redistribution,  and  the  challenges  confronting  the
agricultural community. We did so while being very, very few in  number.  We
were able to straddle nine provinces in a co-ordinated and cohesive way  and
managed through and with the support of the institution and  its  leaders  -
the Chairperson the Deputy Chairperson and all provincial Whips and  leaders
of delegations to these various quarters. I think  we  have  done  extremely
well in bringing to the public domain the challenges and  achievements  that
we have discovered through our oversight role.

We have taken on the constitutional  responsibility  of  ensuring  that  the
three spheres of government interact in a responsible way. Today we have  an
illustration of a decision which might not be very palatable to us from  the
North West, but which is a decision that was taken impartially,  objectively
and on the basis of what this Council  felt  was  appropriate  in  terms  of
intervention.

Not very long ago, fully and unconditionally we  supported  intervention  in
Mafikeng. Today we are supporting intervention, but we are saying  that  the
nature of the intervention is too drastic or dramatic and, therefore, we  do
not support the dissolution. However, we  support  intervention  wherein  an
administrator could be appointed to assume  the  executive  responsibilities
and address the challenges of a particular council. This  has  occurred  not
only in the North West province, but also occurred in other  provinces  such
as  the  Eastern  Cape.  And  I  believe  that  the  Council  itself,  as  a
collective, has responded very swiftly, efficiently and effectively  in  its
task.

I know I have limited time and  I  could  speak  forever  on  these  various
issues, but I think another important dimension is the manner  in  which  we
dealt with very current, topical and critical  issues  that  confronted  our
nation. This came  through  very  clearly  in  terms  of  the  subjects  for
discussion that we have had in the Council. We  dealt  with  gender  issues,
child abuse, crime, our democracy, nation-building and  reconciliation.  And
we did all that, not from the perspective  of  the  National  Assembly,  the
other  House  of  Parliament,  but  from  regional,  local  and   provincial
perspectives. And this has enriched the content of our debate.

In terms of the legislative process, we are heartened by the fact that  this
House has amended virtually every Bill that has come to it - be  it  section
75 or 76. We are also quite proud that most  of  these  amendments,  if  not
more than 90%, have been accepted by the other House.  This  tells  us  that
the committees of  this  House,  notwithstanding  that  they  are  fewer  in
number, have performed extremely well.

Let me conclude by saying that it is our opinion that the  National  Council
of Provinces has succeeded. It has succeeded because  it  has  worked  as  a
cohesive collective irrespective  of  party-political  identities,  and  has
shown commitment  to  transformation  and  sound  democracy.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  MPUMALANGA  (Mr  N  J  Mahlangu):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon
members, thank you for the opportunity once  again  to  share  a  few  ideas
about how we have fared in Mpumalanga since the ushering in of democracy.

Today security, pensions, disability and child support grants  are  paid  on
an equal basis to every qualifying citizen in the province, irrespective  of
colour, race or creed. The number of social grant  beneficiaries  has  grown
rapidly from 164 894 to 395 722. The  offices  of  traditional  leaders  are
being used as service points, with  trained  permanent  staff  available  to
assist grant applicants.

We have made good strides in dealing with the plight of farmworkers.  I  can
mention that on 9 December 2003 we entered into a milestone  agreement  with
the Agri-Mpumalanga Farmers Union in terms of which  we  paved  the  way  to
service delivery in our province.

We have established  petrochemical  projects,  and  wood,  forestry  mining,
agroprocessing and other projects valued at more than R2 billion,  providing
employment to more than 2 000 people. In  the  past  10  years  a  total  of
119 771 housing units were  built  and  transferred.  More  than  156 287,72
hectares of land are back in the hands of the rightful owners.

In this decade we have increased the  number  of  classrooms  by  more  than
4 800. We have transported more than 24 000 learners from our farm areas  at
a cost of R58 million. We have spent more than  R581 million  on  purchasing
learner-support material in this decade. We have built two modern  libraries
in the deep rural areas of  Daggakraal  in  the  Seme  Municipality  and  at
Maphotla in the Dr J S Moroka Municipality.

Over the past 10 years we have  managed  to  provide  free  basic  water  to
588 007 households and electricity to 78 000 households. In  order  to  deal
with the water scarcity problem gripping  our  province,  a  500 millimetre-
diameter pipeline  is  being  constructed  from  the  Rand  Water  Board  in
Mamelodi to the Ikangala Water Board  around  Ekandustria.  This  move  will
alleviate water problems in our rural areas of Thembisile  Municipality.  An
amount of R10 million is being utilised to bring water to the  rural  people
of Ntoane and to install meters in their  homes;  and  R4 million  is  being
utilised for the people of Kgobokwane. For the first time these  communities
will enjoy showering and bathing in their own homes.

Since 1994 more than 486 kilometres of tarred roads and  bridges  have  been
constructed at a cost of more than R372 million. Over  2 190  kilometres  of
gravel roads have been laid at a cost of R86 million, and 1  342  kilometres
of road have been repaired and resealed at a cost of R76 million.

We are currently constructing the first phase  of  the  Moloto  road,  after
having completed the second phase. We are  also  constructing  the  Mgobodzi
road in the Nkomazi Municipality and the  Kgobokwane-Dennilton  road.  These
are roads in rural area, where, generally, people never enjoyed such tarred-
road facilities.

In the current financial year, our Government has implemented  16  community
projects amounting  to  R13,4 million.  During  the  construction  of  these
projects, 485 job opportunities were created and 352 people were trained.

Great strides have been made in the provision  of  health  services  to  the
people of Mpumalanga, specifically in taking health care facilities  to  the
rural and poor areas of the province. We have  built  the  following  health
institutions  during  this  decade:  the  Moloto,  Mmamethlake,  Daggakraal,
Amsterdam and Perdekop Health Care Centres; and the Verana,  Lefiso,  Phake,
Seabe, Kaboweni, Moutse West and Nokaneng Clinics.

We have also upgraded and renovated the Mmamethlake, Kwamhlanga and  Witbank
Hospitals. We have spent more than R140 million  building  the  Piet  Retief
Hospital, which we hope to complete in the coming financial  year.  We  have
upgraded the Ermelo, Tonga, Shongwe,  Themba,  Embhuleni  and  Rob  Ferreira
Hospitals. In the Sekhukhune district we have upgraded the  Groblersdal  and
Philadelphia Hospitals. We have also started erecting  a  clinic  in  Moutse
East, at Kgobokwane.

Combating HIV/Aids is still one of our top priorities. That is why  we  have
budgeted more than R36,3 million to further strengthen  the  provincial  HIV
and Aids programmes. We have strengthened the  home-based  care  network  in
the province. Our plans to establish at least one  major  hospital  and  one
hospice per district are on course. Currently, we have identified  12  sites
to be used to pilot the antiretroviral programme.

 As our other health institutions become ready and  we  have  the  necessary
finances, we will expand the programme of  rolling  out  antiretrovirals  to
all corners of the province. We are, currently, at about a level of  80%  in
terms of rolling out of antiretrovirals to our health  institutions  in  the
province.

We are doing something about those who steal  from  the  poor.  To  date,  a
total of 1 375 incidents of  corruption,  malpractice  and  misconduct  have
been reported by whistle-blowers; 144 officials have  been  dismissed  after
disciplinary hearings  were  held  and  some  of  the  officials  have  been
criminally charged.

We continue to manage and service existing twinning agreements  signed  with
the province of Alberta in Canada, Chongqing  Municipality  in  the  Sichuan
province  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China  and  Maputo  province   in
Mozambique. The agreements are progressing well and yielding  fruit  as  per
the objectives.

We also renewed the Memorandum of Understanding with North Rhine  Westphalia
province in Germany. It has been a resounding success and  there  have  been
benefits for both parties.

That is, in short, the executive summary  of  our  progress  report  in  the
province. We acknowledge that more needs to be done in order to ensure  that
we create a better life for all our people. I thank you. [Applause.]

THE PREMIER  OF  NORTH  WEST  (Dr  P  S  Molefe):  Hon  Chairperson,  Deputy
Chairperson, the Chief Whip of the Council, hon members,  we  of  the  North
West province are humbled by, once again,  the  opportunity  to  present  to
this august House a review of  our  participation  in  the  NCOP  since  its
establishment in 1997. It is our pleasure also to reflect on  how  the  NCOP
has enhanced the legislative  process  in  our  province,  and  how  it  has
ensured that the  development  of  national  legislation  and  policies  are
sensitive to the unique conditions and needs of our provinces.

There is no doubt in our minds that the NCOP is, and will continue to be,  a
pillar of our democratic order. Through its work, the  NCOP  has  entrenched
the culture of democratic participation. In addition, it continues  to  play
a role in promotion of co-operative governance amongst the  various  spheres
of government. The NCOP has ensured that the provincial  needs  are  aligned
to the broader needs of the  country  in  a  manner  that  enhances  service
delivery and good governance.

We wish to thank our six permanent representatives in  the  NCOP  for  being
the vital link  between  the  North  West  provincial  legislature  and  the
national Parliament. Through their work, our permanent representatives  have
ensured  that  our  provincial  legislation  took  into   account   national
imperatives. They have  also  contributed  immensely  towards  building  the
capacity of portfolio committees in our provincial legislature.

Our  representatives  have  used  the  experience  they  gathered,  as  they
interacted with delegates from various provinces, to enrich our  legislative
process in our province. They have indeed influenced, in  a  large  measure,
the manner in which we began to review the legislation  in  the  North  West
province.  In  this  regard,  the  North  West  provincial  legislature  has
reviewed no less than 150 pieces of legislation and ordinances in  order  to
ensure that they complied with the Constitution of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, but also to ensure  that  they  facilitated  the  pursuit  of  their
democratic objectives.

The results of the hard  work  of  the  NCOP  are  clearly  visible  in  our
province. The NCOP has given us, as  a  province,  a  platform  to  exchange
views and experiences with other provinces on critical  areas  such  as  the
development of the code of ethics for members of the executive  council.  In
addition, the NCOP has given us  a  platform  to  exchange  ideas  with  our
counterparts in other provinces on the  development  and  implementation  of
the Batho Pele principles, both at provincial and local government levels.

Through  the  "Taking  Parliament  to  the  People"   campaign,   the   NCOP
contributed  towards  efforts  aimed  at  educating  our  people  about  how
Parliament works. More importantly, the campaign has  given  our  people  an
opportunity to have  their  say  in  the  manner  in  which  the  Government
conducts its business.

Last  year,  this  campaign  gave  the  people  of  Taung  and  Mafikeng  an
opportunity  to  raise  their   concerns   directly   with   their   elected
representatives. Similarly, the people of the North West province  benefited
immensely  from  the  NCOP's  provincial  weeks  programme.  This  programme
allowed members of the NCOP to carry out their  oversight  duties,  focusing
on specific provinces, with a view to gaining even better  understanding  of
the unique challenges facing the various provinces.

Partly through the work of the NCOP, we now have in place  legislation  with
the purpose of building strong developmental local government. In  addition,
interventions by the members of  the  NCOP  have  assisted  the  North  West
province in developing such critical Bills as the Disaster  Management  Bill
and the Bill  on  Promotion  and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities.

Through its oversight function and drawing from  the  experiences  of  other
provinces, the NCOP assisted us as a province to find appropriate  responses
with regard to the development and implementation of integrated  development
plans by municipalities. Only recently, the Council visited the  North  West
province to assess the  intervention  in  Mafikeng  and  the  Lekwa  Teemane
Municipalities, in terms of section 139(1)(c) of the Constitution.

In  both  instances,  committees  of  this  House  responded   swiftly   and
efficiently to their oversight responsibility. Whilst this  House  supported
the intervention in  Mafikeng,  I  notice  that  the  report  of  the  other
committee that visited  Lekwa  Teemane  Municipality  did  not  support  the
dissolution of the municipality.

This clearly illustrates that the Council  carries  out  its  responsibility
objectively and independently,  with  due  regard  for  the  spirit  of  co-
operative governance. However, I note that there are differences of  opinion
between the executive council and the  committee  and  the  Council.  Whilst
this clearly reasserts and affirms the independence of  the  NCOP,  it  also
poses a challenge for intensified communication early enough  to  allow  for
proper flow of information and reportage on critical  issues  affecting  the
municipalities, so that when a committee of the NCOP goes  to  a  particular
municipality, it has had sufficient information, thoroughgoing,  that  would
enable it  also  to  interact  with  the  executive,  and  where  there  are
differences,  that  such  differences  could  be   resolved   before   major
resolutions are taken.

I believe that such timeous communication of a detailed report  between  the
NCOP   and   the   provincial   legislatures   will   potentially    exclude
disagreements, and I think we will, therefore, need  to  creatively  address
this challenge as we move into the second decade  of  freedom.  The  Council
has also assisted with its programmes aimed at  capacity-building  of  local
government to ensure efficient service delivery.

In conclusion,  may  I  once  again  extend  a  word  of  gratitude  to  the
Chairperson of the National Council  of  Provinces,  the  Deputies  and  the
Chief Whip of this Council for the remarkable  manner  in  which  they  have
guided this institution, and to hon members for the robust manner  in  which
they have dealt with issues confronting our country and our provinces.

As all of us retire to go into the  campaigns  of  our  different  political
parties, may I also join those who wished you well in your campaigns, and  I
trust that we will return to this House as a House that  reflects  provinces
with vibrant multiparty activism in our provinces  and  therefore  enriching
democracy. Let us all, therefore, dear friends and  hon  members,  build  on
the solid foundations that we have laid as we confront  the  future  in  the
next 10 years. I thank you. [Applause.]

THE CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, hon Premier. May I  then
take this opportunity to call the Premier of the Free  State  and  apologise
that the ordering of the list  was  not  communicated  to  her.  My  sincere
apologies. I thought you had been informed  that  the  list  was  reordered,
hence your name has been placed lower down on  the  speakers'  list.  May  I
give you this opportunity, Madam.

The PREMIER OF FREE STATE (Ms I W Direko): Chairperson  of  Committees,  hon
members of the Council, special delegates, it feels like  it  was  yesterday
when we entered this House for the first time,  in  1994,  and  came  across
words  we  did  not  understand.  And  the  one  that  comes  to   mind   is
``interpellations'' which, with every  fibre  of  our  being,  we  tried  to
establish the meaning of and went to libraries, but nothing came up. It  was
with the passage of time that we began to realise what interpellations  were
all about.

The turn of the first decade of freedom presents us with an  opportunity  to
tell the story of the Free State. Our lesson throughout  this  period  is  a
profound one. We have learned that of importance is not how  you  start  the
race, but how you end that race. The people of Free State are indeed  making
a strong finish in the race to reconstruct and develop their lives. We  have
a story to tell and we will tell it with enthusiasm.

Despite what the cynics said,  despite  the  deeply  divided  past,  as  the
people of Free State we found unity through  cultural  diversity.  We  have,
despite these and other historical events,  emerged  as  a  unified  society
that is democratic and tolerant towards one another. Our  success  story  is
underpinned by the following important  tenets:  nation-building,  political
inclusivity, reconciliation, co-operation and politics of consensus.

In 2001 we made a call for a new Free State. This call was to  form  a  firm
foundation for a united and prosperous Free State. I have  been  humbled  by
the response we received in this regard. We made a call for  a  Free  Stater
who displays  hard  work,  perseverance,  excellence,  ethical  conduct  and
commitment to a better life  for  all.  The  ideological  onslaught  by  the
enemies of the people did not and could no longer succeed  in  dividing  our
people. The Congress of  the  People  in  1955,  in  Kliptown,  remains  the
foundation of the democratic dispensation we are enjoying today.

Driven by a strong need for a better life for our people, we  set  ourselves
milestones and we had to achieve them. We promised  our  people  accelerated
delivery of service and could not detract from that. The  high  expectations
of the majority of the poor masses for a better deal in this province,  amid
the critical shortage of resources, remain at the centre  of  our  programme
of action.

We are succeeding in building a reliable and accountable Public  Service  of
men and women dedicated and  committed  to  providing  the  best  for  their
people.  This  is  evidenced  by  both  international  and  national  awards
received by the Free  State  government  since  1994.  Among  others,  these
include  the  Commonwealth  Association  for   Public   Administration   and
Management's International Innovation Awards in recognition of  our  pension
payout system - all other provinces have since adopted our system; the  Gold
Award from the SA International Trade Exhibition, Saitex,  for  best  stalls
for  four  years  in  succession;  the  third-best  annual  report  of   the
department of local government and housing awarded by the SA Association  of
Government Auditors; the Nestlé floating trophy for improvement in  cataract
operations; and acknowledgement for improved  financial  management  by  the
National Treasury.

The transformation of the state  and  its  organs  was  a  priority  to  the
government  of  the  Free  State.  The  first   term   of   governance   was
characterised by the development of policies  and  strategies  to  meet  the
needs of our people. In the middle  of  the  second  term,  this  government
introduced the Free State Development Plan, amongst others, to  ensure  that
we provide responsive and efficient services to our people.

The Free State Development Plan is aligned to integrated  development  plans
of municipalities, commonly known as IDPs. It has  the  following  strategic
objectives: to enhance economic development and job  creation;  provide  and
facilitate   sustainable   infrastructure   development;   invest   in   the
development of the people of the  Free  State;  ensure  a  safe  and  secure
environment  and  good  co-operative  governance  with  sustainable  use  of
resources and environment.

The Free State Development Plan has gone a long way toward streamlining  and
measuring  the  performance  of  the  Free  State   government   since   its
introduction. Arrangements are now afoot to review the targets of  the  Free
State development programme more than ever before.  We  are  convinced  that
this is the best tool to help us provide a better life for  all  the  people
of the Free State.

One case in point is the improvement in the Grade 12 pass  rate  from  42,3%
in 1999 to almost 80% in 2003. This is a 90% increase in four years  and  is
way above our own expectations and our Free State  Development  Plan  target
of 65% in 2005. This achievement was made possible  through  the  successful
implementation of  the  holistic  intervention  programme  and  the  general
improvement of the culture of learning and teaching in the schools.
Special mention should be made of the performance of the township  and  farm
schools which are predominantly black. The number of black children who  are
among the top 100 students has  improved  tremendously  and  the  number  of
township schools that obtained 100% has now tripled. All  we  have  done  in
our department of education is to dip our buckets where we are and not  send
our children from the township  to  the  so-called  better-run  schools.  We
improve them exactly where they are. The number  of  township  schools  that
obtained 90% is up from 8% to 54% in 2003.  [Time  expired.]  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, forgive me for mentioning the way  in  which  the
subject for discussion came before  this  House.  It  came  generally  as  a
subject for discussion and it was marked  as  such  on  the  programme.  It,
somehow, transformed into a consideration of a report  on  the  subject  for
discussion. Now, I raise this matter not to be petty about it or  about  the
procedure or process, but because I regard it as an opportunity lost.
It was important for us to engage on a serious  analysis  of  our  strengths
and weaknesses because it's a resource for the future. With due  respect  to
whoever compiled the report, and I have no knowledge of who did  so,  it  is
more of a  narrative  than  a  serious  consideration  or  analysis  of  our
strengths and weaknesses. And I say this especially against  the  background
of the work of the committee on oversight and accountability,  which  raised
the issue of an institutional memory for this  particular  institution,  and
the institution of Parliament in general.

Everybody has mentioned this already and we are heading for  elections  very
soon. I am sure a number of us may come  back,  a  number  of  us  may  not,
others may be promoted, and others may not be so fortunate. But  I  am  sure
we will find a different team in the new Parliament. It  would  have  helped
them enormously if we could have had  a  report  that  attempted  a  serious
analysis and provided the institutional memory of  the  best  practices  for
oversight, for example, in this House.

If you would allow me, I would like just to reminisce a bit. We  arrived  at
this House and we were handed a very comprehensive academic  report  on  the
role that this House should play in its new  democracy.  And  I  think  it's
important that the new Parliament and the new NCOP get the same  report.  It
would have been instructive for them to sit with the  report  and  with  our
analysis of what we had done, and really assess where they should  be  going
in their term of office.

But we nonetheless arrived here and, as is said in the  report,  this  House
was a work in progress. I think it's important for us to still  regard  this
House as a work in process. It  needs  constant  refinement  on  how  we  do
things and how we approach things. Are we really delivering the best to  the
people we represent - the citizens of South Africa?

Now, regarding that, I would like to just mention that we really should  and
ought to have a serious analysis. And I think this debate, to  some  extent,
would provide at least the framework for it, because we should not make  the
mistake of just adopting  a  self-congratulatory  attitude  and  say  ``well
done'' and pat each other on the back and so on. We really need to take  our
efficiencies, our methods and the way we do things seriously,  and  look  at
them critically.

Another aspect of this House that I would like to draw  brief  attention  to
is that the  perceptions  of  the  role  of  this  House  tend  to  be  one-
dimensional and tend also to depend on who you are talking to. For  example,
provincial government understandably has a view of this House as  being  the
House that interacts between Parliament, the executive  and  the  provincial
government, and puts the provincial  perspective  on  any  legislation  that
comes through. This is,  of  course,  true,  but  it  is  not  the  complete
picture. Local government similarly focuses on our  interaction  with  local
government. The National  Assembly  focuses  on  our  interaction  with  the
National Assembly and the executive focuses on the way we interact with  the
executive. We are of course multidimensional because we deal with all  these
different dimensions.

I think one of  the  analyses  we  have  to  undertake  is  whether  we  can
sufficiently do justice to all of these dimensions, and  whether  we  aren't
really trying to be all things to  all  men  and  women  at  all  times.  It
remains really for me to say that I think the major aspect of  the  function
of this House that I think needs to be explored and expanded is in fact  our
oversight role, and the way the  committees  actually  interact  with  their
oversight roles.

I would not do justice to the four and a half or  five  years  that  I  have
personally served in this House if I didn't mention  that  there  have  been
some moments that, for me, have been really  been  important  milestones.  I
think, at this stage and in fairness, I have to commend the  Chair  for  her
foresight in her ``Taking Parliament to the People'' campaign. This  brought
to me, in a very real way, what I was trying to do in this House  and  in  a
personal way because it's only in really speaking to the people  and  seeing
for yourself that you can start to grasp the challenges that all of us  face
in every aspect of our work. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, at a time like this, when we  review  the  work
of our House, it is important to reflect on the perspective which guided  us
as we drafted the Constitution that gave birth to the NCOP. Two of the  most
important principles which were part of that perspective  were,  of  course,
participatory democracy and co-operative governance.

The NCOP was conceived as a critical vehicle for the  achievement  of  these
objectives. As President Mbeki - then Deputy President Mbeki - already  said
in 1998, the NCOP must, therefore, succeed, not  because  it  exists  as  an
institution, but because  the  vision  of  which  it  is  an  expression  is
fundamental to the success of the new democracy which we seek to fashion.

Voorsitter, wanneer 'n mens hierdie vyf-jaar oorsig vir  die  tydperk  1999-
2004 van die NRVP lees, kom 'n mens onder die besef van die reuse  werk  wat
deur die lede van hierdie Raad gedurende  hierdie  tydperk  gedoen  is.  Dit
sluit in die oorweging, debatering, wysiging  en  aanvaarding  van  verskeie
wette. Ek het probeer om net vinnig deur die verslag te gaan en kortliks  'n
opsomming te maak. Daarvolgens lyk dit  vir  my  of  ons  met  ongeveer  200
artikel 75-wette; ongeveer 58 artikel 76-wette en ongeveer  33  artikel  77-
wette en ook 'n aantal grondwetlike wysigings gehandel het.

Dit natuurlik, bo en behalwe  al  die  ander  baie  belangrike  debatte  oor
aktuele onderwerpe, werkswinkels en verskeie  provinsiale  besoeke  aan  die
provinsies, waarvan reeds melding gemaak is, die "Bringing of Parliament  to
the people" - wat ek ook, sonder om daarop in te gaan, beskou  as  'n  groot
sukses. Daar is natuurlik ook nog die debatte oor die  begrotingsposte.  Dan
praat ons nie eens van vraetyd en voorstelle wat ons behandel het nie.

In paragraaf  2  van  hierdie  oorsig  word  die  strategiese  doelstellings
bespreek en, myns insiens, korrek weergegee. Daar  word  egter  nie  melding
gemaak van die bykomende groot rol wat hierdie  Raad  speel  as  'n  tipiese
Tweede Huis van Hersiening  ten  opsigte  van  artikel  75-wette  nie.  Baie
belangrike wetgewing is in diepte gedebatteer in die komitees  en  ook  hier
in dié Raad en daar is verskeie wysigings aanbeveel wat ook aanvaar is  deur
die ander Huis. Ek dink dit is baie belangrik dat  ons  wel  konsentreer  op
die rol soos uiteengesit in hierdie sleuteldoelwitte.

Ons moet nooit vergeet dat ons ook hierdie ander belangrike  rol  speel  nie
en dat daar baie tyd daaraan gespandeer word. Ek  kan  vandag  sê  dat  daar
werklik in daardie komitees waarin ek dien, waar daar baie artikel  75-wette
behandel is, dit behoorlik gedoen is en daar  werklikwaar  in  geen  stadium
die rol gespeel is van 'n rubberstempel of alles bloot net aanvaar  is  nie.
Ek wil in daardie opsig ook aan die voorsitters  van  die  komitees  en  die
leierskap in hierdie Raad hulde bring, dat ons dit kon regkry.

In die boek Building Representative  Democracy  van  Christina  Murray  word
geskryf:


  The NCOP requires politicians to function in a manner  that  is  in  many
  ways very different from the traditional model. If they fail to adapt and
  develop the new roles required of them, the NCOP will fail.

En ek wil daarom ook hulde bring aan elke lid van hierdie Raad, wat  werklik
soms bomenslik gepresteer het om te sorg dat  hierdie  NRVP  slaag.  In  die
"1998 NCOP Needs  Assessment"  is  die  rol  van  permanente  afgevaardigdes
uiteengesit as: ``A very complex one and not easy to fulfil.''

Dit is so en ek dink baie keer ons kollegas in die ander Huis het geen  idee
nie van ons werklike rol en die baie belangrike rol wat  ons  hier  vertolk.
[Tyd verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, when one reads this five-year  review  of  the  NCOP  for  the
period 1999-2004, one realises what tremendous work has  been  done  by  the
Council during this  period.  This  includes  the  consideration,  debating,
amending and adopting of various pieces of  legislation.  I  have  tried  to
read the report quickly and attempted to compile a brief summary.  According
to this it would appear that we have dealt with  approximately  200  section
75 laws, approximately 58 section 76 laws and approximately  33  section  77
laws as well as a number of constitutional amendments.

This, of course, over and above all the  other  very  important  debates  on
topical subjects, workshops and various provincial visits to the  provinces,
of  which  mention  has  already  been  made,  there  is  the  "Bringing  of
Parliament to the people" - which I, without going into detail, regard as  a
huge success. There is, of course, also the debates  on  the  Budget  Votes.
Then we are not even mentioning questions and motions that we dealt with.

In paragraph 2 of this review, the strategic objectives are  discussed  and,
in my opinion,  correctly  stated.  However,  no  mention  is  made  of  the
additional major role that this Council plays as a typical Second  House  of
Review regarding the section 75 legislation. Very important legislation  was
debated in depth in the  committees  and  also  here  in  this  Council  and
various amendments were recommended, which were also adopted  by  the  other
House. I  think  it  is  important  that  we  concentrate  on  the  role  as
determined in these key objectives.

We should not forget that we also have this other  important  role  to  play
and that much time is spent on it. I can state today that  those  committees
which I serve on, where many section 75 laws were dealt with,  was  properly
done and veritably, there was no stage when the role of a rubber  stamp  was
played or where it was just merely accepted. In that regard I also  want  to
praise the chairpersons  of  the  committees  and  the  leadership  of  this
Council that enabled us to do this right.

In the book, Building representative democracy by  Christina  Murray  it  is
written:


  The NCOP requires politicians to function in a manner  that  is  in  many
  ways very different from the traditional model. If they fail to adapt and
  develop the new roles required of them, the NCOP will fail.

And therefore  I  want  to  praise  everyone  in  this  council  who  really
sometimes performed supernaturally to ensure that this NCOP  is  successful.
In the 1998 NCOP Needs Assessment the role of  the  permanent  delegates  is
explained as: "A very complex one and not easy to fulfil."

It is so and many times I think that our colleagues in the other House  have
no idea of our real and very important  role  that  we  fulfil  here.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr  G  H  AKHARWARAY  (Northern  Cape):  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson,  hon
Premiers, members of this House, for the opportunity  to  stand  in  for  my
Premier and say a few words this afternoon. We all know  that  10  years  is
not a long time. In fact, in the context of human history 10 years is but  a
blip in time. In the context of centuries of deprivation and  apartheid,  10
years is but a brief moment. But, it is exactly this brief moment  that  has
given us an opportunity to address the various  and  diverse  needs  of  our
people and to address the many backlogs.
In the Northern Cape we had a further problem. In 1994, when  we  came  into
government, we had no administration in place. We did not even have  offices
and the few offices that existed did not have tables and chairs in them.  So
it was quite a start from scratch. But the core approach was  simple:  Build
a caring administration.  Secondly,  focus  on  human  development.  Now  in
building the administration  we  have  taken  cognisance  of  the  fact  the
Northern Cape is a vast province. We  had  to  take  the  approach  that  we
needed to be innovative in whatever we did. And three examples indicate  how
we took this approach.

I heard today about ``Taking Parliament to the People''.  This  concept  was
actually born in the Northern Cape in 1995 and we took our cabinet  to  meet
the people. We would take the exco to every village in  the  province  where
people could interact with us and indicate  their  dilemmas.  We  created  a
facilitative government in that we  created  one-stop  shops  all  over  the
province so that people were not sent  from  pillar  to  post  because  they
simply wanted a pension form to be filled in. They would go to one stop  and
get their services there.

We introduced what is called the "flying doctor" programme, so  that  people
in fairly way-out rural areas would not have to drive 200 km to  go  to  the
clinic, but that the doctor and the special  services  would  come  to  them
where they live and give them specialised services.

In focusing on human development, we were guided by the need to address  the
backlogs, to restore the dignity and self-respect,  especially  of  our  old
people, and to create this enabling environment that  I  am  talking  about.
Hence we skewed our spending criteria  and  our  spending  of  resources  in
support of this objective, so much so that today  we  can  say  that  social
security in the network has been expanded.

More people have access to grants. No longer do our  people  have  to  start
queueing from four o'clock in the morning in order to receive their  pension
at four o'clock in the afternoon. No longer  do  people  have  to  wait  for
months for their pension. The processing time in the Northern  Cape  now  is
three weeks and the first pension to a person is given by  the  end  of  the
second month.

We consciously invested in education and skills, so much so  that  today  we
can say that the matric pass rate has moved up from around 60%  in  1993  to
over 90%. The percentage of people that can  be  considered  to  be  persons
without schooling has been reduced by 3,5%. In  fact,  3,5%  is  double  the
national average.

The economy, which was growing at negative  rates  prior  to  1994,  is  now
growing at 2,5%, with the projection of 2,7% over the next two years.  Also,
93% of the people living in the Northern Cape have access to running  water,
or are at least within 200 m of a tap with running water.

These are indications of how human  life  in  the  Northern  Cape  has  been
improved.  Access  to  health  care  has  been  deepened,   facilities   are
functioning well, the immunisation coverage  in  the  province  has  reached
slightly over 100%. And, as I said earlier on, health care  has  been  taken
to the remotest of areas.

Housing programmes  operate  effectively,  so  much  so  that  the  informal
settlements have  declined  by  37%.  The  result  of  all  of  this  is  an
indication of human development. Infant mortality rates  have  declined.  We
now have the  second-lowest  in  South  Africa.  The  incidences  of  severe
malnutrition have dropped from 2,5% to 0,5%.  And  the  life  expectancy  at
birth has risen from 55 years to 59 years,  which  means,  hon  Chairperson,
that when you come and live in the Northern Cape the chances  are  that  you
will live five years longer.

Agb Voorsitter, ter afsluiting wil ek graag sê dat wat ek vandag hier aan  u
voorgehou het, is aanduiding daarvan dat ons daarin geslaag het  om  op  die
ontwikkeling van ons mense te fokus. Ons het ook bewys dat ons die  wil  het
om mense se lewens te verbeter in die Noord-Kaap. Ons het ook  aangedui  dat
ons wel die vermoë het om dit ook te kan doen.

Namens die Premier en sy span wil ek graag hierdie  geleentheid  gebruik  om
die mense van die Noord-Kaap te bedank vir die  geleentheid  wat  hulle  ons
gegun het om hulle te dien. Ons weet ook dat hierdie mandaat wat  hulle  ons
gegee het op  14  April  hernieu  sal  word.  Soos  ons  in  die  provinsies
rondbeweeg, wil ek graag al  die  lede  van  hierdie  Huis  bedank  vir  die
samewerking wat hulle ons gegee het,  veral  die  permanente  afgevaardigdes
van die Noord-Kaap, vir die manier waarop hulle ons op hoogte gehou het  van
wat hier aangaan en vir die manier waarop hulle na ons geluister het as  ons
aangedui het waaroor hulle hier moes kom argumenteer  ter  bevoordeling  van
die Noord-Kaap se mense. Ons wil graag vir  hulle  baie  dankie  sê  en  die
voorsitters en die Swepe vir dit wat hulle gedoen het. Soos  ons  rondbeweeg
met die aanloop tot die verkiesing, wil ons graag hê  almal  moet  versigtig
wees.  Moenie  haastig  wees  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, in conclusion I would like to say that that which  I  have
presented to you today is an indication that we have succeeded  in  focusing
on the development of our people. We have also proved that we have the  will
to improve peoples' lives in the Northern Cape. We have also indicated  that
we do, indeed, have the ability to do this as well.

On behalf of the Premier and his team I would like to take this  opportunity
to thank the people of the Northern Cape for the opportunity  they  gave  us
to serve them. We also know that this mandate they have  given  us  will  be
renewed on 14 April. As we move around in the provinces,  I  would  like  to
thank all the members of this House for the co-operation  that  we  received
from them, especially the permanent delegates of the Northern Cape, for  the
way in which they kept us abreast of what was going on here and for the  way
in which they listened to us as we indicated  what  they  had  to  come  and
argue for here for the benefit of the people of the Northern Cape. We  would
like to thank them very much, as well as the chairpersons and the Whips  for
what they have done. As we travel around in the run-up to  the  election  we
would like everyone to be careful. Do not rush.]

Arrive Alive! It is better to be ten minutes late in this world than  to  be
ten years too early in the next. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, Northern Cape.  May  I  call  upon
the MEC for tourism and gambling, Mrs Joyce Witbooi.  Welcome  back  to  the
NCOP. This is a home where you will also be at home.

Mrs J WITBOOI (Western Cape): Thank you very much.

Voorsitter, agb lede, in 1999 is ek in hierdie Huis  ingesweer  as  lid  van
die NCOP. Ek sal nooit die waardevolle lesse vergeet wat ek hier geleer  het
nie. Hier, moet ek vir  u  reguit  sê,  het  ek  onder  die  besef  van  die
belangrikheid van hierdie Huis gekom; hoe hierdie  Huis  die  skakel  tussen
alle provinsies en die nasionale Regering is om die sake van belang  oor  te
dra. Vergun my dus om namens die Premier en die uitnemende span in die  Wes-
Kaap ons groot waardering oor te dra vir wat hier gedoen word.

Die jaar 2004 is inderdaad  'n  mylpaal  in  die  kort,  dog  indrukwekkende
geskiedenis van post-apartheid Suid-Afrika. Nie net vier ons 'n  dekade  van
konstitusionele demokrasie nie, ons herdenk  ook  die  geskiedkundige  keuse
wat ons politieke leiers gemaak het, naamlik om die pad  van  onderhandeling
eerder as konflik te kies. Hierdie keuse het  die  belange  van  die  gewone
Suid-Afrikaner bo dié van eng politieke kortsigtigheid geplaas.

Om dié rede moet die visionêre stap wat politieke leiers in die  NP  en  die
ANC in Desember 2001 in die Wes-Kaap geneem het, verwelkom word.  Die  keuse
wat gemaak is ten gunste van samewerking en  inklusiewe  regering  ten  bate
van alle gemeenskappe, is kennend van 'n provinsiale  regering  wat  daardie
belangrike breuk met die verlede gemaak het, en bereid is om die  uitdagings
van die nuwe Suid-Afrika  saam  aan  te  pak.  Ons  kan  nou  weliswaar  ons
nageslag in die oë kyk, en hoe lekker is daardie wete nie  vandag  nie.  Ons
kan nou weliswaar ons nageslag in die oë kyk en  met  reg  sê  dat  ons  die
fondamente lê vir hulle beter toekoms. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)
[Chairperson, hon members, in 1999 I was sworn in in this House as a  member
of the NCOP. I will never forget the valuable lessons I learned here.  Here,
I must tell you, I became aware of the importance of this  House;  how  this
House is the link between all  provinces  and  the  national  Government  to
convey matters of importance. Allow me therefore, on behalf of  the  Premier
and  the  excellent  team  in  the  Western  Cape,  to  convey  our  sincere
appreciation for what is being done here.

The year 2004 is indeed a milestone in the brief,  yet  impressive,  history
of postapartheid South  Africa.  Not  only  do  we  celebrate  a  decade  of
constitutional democracy, we are also  commemorating  the  historic  choices
made by our political leaders, namely to  choose  the  road  of  negotiation
rather than conflict. This choice  placed  the  interests  of  the  ordinary
South African above those of narrow-minded political shortsightedness.

For this reason we must welcome the visionary step taken  by  the  political
leaders of the NNP and the ANC in December 2001 in  the  Western  Cape.  The
choice that was made in favour of co-operation and inclusive government  for
the benefit of all communities is characteristic of a provincial  government
that made that important break with the past, and that is prepared  to  deal
with the challenges of the new South Africa  together.  Now  we  can  really
look our descendants in the eye, and how wonderful that knowledge is  today.
Now we can really look our descendants in the eye and honestly say  that  we
are laying the foundations for a brighter future for them.]

In  his  opening  of  parliament  speech  in  2003,  Premier  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk identified five pillars as strategic policy  imperatives  for  the
Western Cape provincial government, namely, the battle against HIV/Aids  and
other health challenges, real economic growth and job  creation,  excellence
in education, safety and security for our people and  our  environment  and,
lastly,  fighting  poverty  through  quality  basic  services   and   social
delivery.

He also identified ``iKapa elihlumayo'' [a growing Cape] as the best  policy
vehicle to achieve our goal of building a world-class  province  that  cares
for all its people. We face a tremendous  challenge  to  stem  the  tide  of
HIV/Aids in the province. It is, however, a challenge that we have  accepted
and which we are confident we will overcome.

Indeed, this province has  pioneered  the  administering  of  antiretroviral
medication  to  fight  the  scourge  that  ravages  our   communities.   The
commitment with which we are tackling  HIV/Aids  in  the  province  is  best
illustrated by the fact that when the announcement was made on  19  November
2003 by  the  national  Cabinet  that  it  had  approved  the  comprehensive
national treatment plan, the Western Cape stood ready. By World Aids Day  on
1 December 2003, we were able to announce that instead of the six  treatment
sites recommended by the plan for the Western Cape,  we  would  have  15  in
operation by the end of the financial year.

Thirteen of these sites are already in operation, and Premier Van  Schalkwyk
recently announced three new treatment sites in  Mitchells  Plain,  Beaufort
West and the Hottentot's Holland Hospital in Somerset West that  will  boost
our fight against Aids. This raises the number of  treatment  sites  in  our
province to 16.

Die Wes-Kaap beskik oor 'n ekonomie onder andere gebou op sterk landbou-  en
toerisme sektore. Met meer as 'n miljoen toeriste wat die  Wes-Kaap  verlede
jaar besoek het, is ons doelwit om 3 miljoen toeriste teen 2010 na die  Wes-
Kaap te lok glad nie meer so vergesog nie. Die opening  van  die  Kaapstadse
Internasionale Konferensiesentrum in Julie  verlede  jaar  het  ook  verdere
stukrag aan die Wes-Kaap as 'n  wêreldklas  sake-  en  konferensiebestemming
gegee.

Dat hierdie siening  inderdaad  deur  ons  internasionale  besoekers  gedeel
word, kan gesien word aan die talle internasionale  akkolades  wat  aan  die
Wes-Kaap toegeken word. Dit sluit onder andere  die  feit  in  dat  Kaapstad
nommer vyf is op die lys van die BBC se lys van vyftig  plekke  om  te  sien
voordat jy sterf. Dit is ook deur die World Travel Awards en die Condé  Nast
Global Awards as die beste stad in Afrika aangewys.

Uit gesprekke met sakelui, binne en buite ons  provinsie,  is  dit  duidelik
dat daar twee essensiële komponente is wat teenwoordig  moet  wees  alvorens
ekonomiese groei en investering 'n realiteit word. In  die  eerste  plek  is
dit stabiliteit ... [Tyd verstreke.] [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The Western Cape has an economy which  is,  inter  alia,  built  on  strong
agricultural  and  tourism  sectors.  With  more  than  a  million  tourists
visiting the Western Cape last year, our  target  of  attracting  3  million
tourists to the Western Cape by 2010 is not so  far-fetched  any  more.  The
opening of the Cape Town International Conference Centre in July  last  year
added further impetus to the  Western  Cape  as  world  class  business  and
conference destination.

That this view is indeed shared by our international visitors  can  be  seen
in the countless international accolades awarded to the Western  Cape.  This
includes amongst others the fact that Cape Town is number five on the  BBC's
list of fifty places to see before you die. It has also been nominated  best
city in Africa by the World Travel Awards and the Condé Nast Global Awards.

 From conversations with businesspeople, inside and  outside  the  province,
it is clear that there are two essential components that have to be  present
before economic growth and investment become a reality. In the  first  place
it is stability ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Ms  C  NKUNA:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Premiers,  hon  MECs,
Speakers, special delegates,  and  colleagues,  ``na  mikhentsa''  [I  thank
you.]

This is the last session of  the  second  democratic  Parliament  that  came
about as a result of 400 years of unbroken resistance  by  our  masses,  and
for the last nine decades the struggle has been led and guided by the ANC.

In 1994 our people made a vow not to go back to  apartheid  and  colonialism
where the Parliament and the executive were not  transparent.  Maybe  as  we
are busy deliberating right now the whole nation, or  the  whole  community,
is watching and listening attentively to the television.  In  the  next  few
weeks our people will go to the polls to affirm again their commitment to  a
democratic and transparent Parliament.

My focus will be on the oversight role that the NCOP is exercising  and  has
exercised for the past five years, and the impact it has  in  improving  the
lives of the ordinary citizens of our country.

What  oversight  function  is  exercised  by  the  NCOP?  Looking   at   the
Constitution, there are areas provided for where the NCOP  has  to  exercise
its oversight, areas where the NA has to exercise its  oversight  and  areas
where the  two  Houses  both  have  to  exercise  oversight.  The  oversight
function of this House is of crucial importance in monitoring and  reviewing
actions of the executive organs of Government.
It is not only about being critical when performing the oversight  function,
but it is also about remedying the defects,  like  what  the  committee  has
been doing when making an intervention. The NCOP has to  exercise  oversight
over the national aspects of  the  provincial  and  local  government.  This
House is bound by the Constitution to provide a  linkage  between  provinces
and the national Government, and ensuring that  there  is  co-operative  and
effective governance - as provided for by Chapter 3 of the Constitution.

Section 100(2) of the Constitution provides for  the  national  Government's
intervention where  the  provincial  government  is  unable  to  fulfil  its
constitutional mandate, and that such notice of  the  intervention  must  be
tabled  in  the  NCOP  within  14  days  of  its  first  sitting  after  the
intervention began. Over the past five years we have  not  had  a  situation
where the national Government was forced to  intervene  drastically  in  the
running of the provinces; which indicates the  capacity  of  our  leadership
deployed in those areas.

Section 139(2)(b) provides for the provincial government's  intervention  in
a municipality. The same applies where the local councillors are  unable  to
adhere to their constitutional mandate.

The NCOP plays an oversight role  over  international  agreements  that  the
Government enters into with multilateral institutions and organisations.  We
have ratified  conventions  and  so  on,  except  those  conventions  of  an
administrative or critical nature which rest with the executive.

It is the NCOP that has the capacity to take pieces of  legislation  to  the
people for them to make an input  during  the  NCOP  cycle,  and  by  taking
Parliament to the people. The NCOP has to  exercise  an  oversight  function
over some sections or  pieces  of  legislation,  for  instance,  section  74
legislation, which deals with constitutional amendments;  regarding  section
75 legislation, the compentency  lies  with  the  national  Government,  and
section 76 legislation awards concurrent powers to the  national  Government
and provinces. We also have section 77 Bills which deal  with  the  division
of revenue. They are at times referred to as money Bills. The NCOP  provides
an oversight function in their medium-term  expenditure  framework  process,
ensuring that the taxpayers' money is spent properly. It provides  oversight
for these Bills for three years or more.

I would like to thank  all  members  in  this  House  for  the  intellectual
engagements we have had over the last five years. It  was  enriching  and  I
would like  to  proudly  say  that  I  have  grown.  I  am  a  grown  person
intellectually. Thanks. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon  Premiers,  special  delegates
and the House, today  is  a  memorable  day  in  which  we  are  offered  an
opportunity to look back with admiration or disappointment at  the  road  we
have travelled over the past five years. From my own perspective,  the  NCOP
has enriched and broadened my horizon in respect of government issues.

The NCOP is the second House of Parliament, but it is not the Senate,  which
it was known as. It is unique and unlike any  Senate.  Although  certain  of
its functions are similar, it differs from  the  Senate  by  virtue  of  the
intermediary role and  functions  that  it  performs  between  the  national
Parliament, the provincial legislatures, and at local government level.

One other interesting aspect of the House is its links with  the  provinces.
This is seen when members of the House have to do briefings  on  section  76
Bills in the provinces or where certain teams intervene in  instances  where
municipalities are encountering financial problems.

Another very interesting aspect of the  functioning  of  the  House  is  the
holding of public hearings at provincial level.  This  is  consultation  and
participation of the constituencies at grass-roots level in  the  law-making
process. To me, and to us all, this is what democracy is all  about  and  it
is unequalled.

[One of the things that  are  appeasing  in  this  House  is  the  love  and
friendship that there is amongst the members.  We  have  different  opinions
and we agued, not because of hatred or enmity, and  it  is  one  thing  that
flows from the kind of honest leadership, which is  not  imposing,  that  we
have in this House. We will enter the next season after the  elections  with
vigour and with more experience. [Applause.]]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I remember when I came to  this  House  five  years
ago there was much scepticism, I have to say, about the role of this  House,
about how it functioned, about its complex mandate, about  the  very  nature
of the House and about the very future of  the  House.  People  were  asking
whether it would survive. That kind of talk one heard in the corridors.

The role of this House is a complex one. It is one of review and  oversight.
The House also has a  legislative  and  presentational  role,  with  diverse
constituency duties, diverse demands, diverse skills  and  talents  required
from its members. There was much doom and gloom about, and the  verdict  was
out on this Place. But as we have worked over the years, as we  have  sought
to fulfil our duty and our mandate, I have heard less and less of this.

As a matter of fact, now I hear people talking of expanding  the  House  and
that it is too small. I have to say that I agree  with  that.  I  think  the
demands on 54 members of dealing  with  an  oversight  role  with  what  400
members in the Other Place are  producing  is  simply  an  impossibility.  I
think it is remarkable how we have improved legislation and its volume,  and
how we have  done  this  has  been  wonderful.  But,  I  think  that  it  is
unsustainable and that we should have more members in this Place.
May I say that it is my view if we do that or when we do that, that we  look
again at the name of the House. We should consider renaming this House  "The
Senate of the  Provinces".  I  say  that  because  it  would  make  us  more
understandable constitutionally, around the world, in our  own  country  and
in the parliamentary tradition.

Chairman, I also have to thank you and your assistants and also the  capable
and distinguished Chairperson that we have had, Mrs Pandor. If we  have  had
successes, it was through her ability to vocalise our needs,  our  strengths
and so on, often stepping on toes - often our own toes, I have to  say.  But
she has done so with courage, great ability, great authority  and  gravitas.
She has given status to this House and she has  vocalised  our  aspirations,
our needs, our problems and our self-criticism and done so  extremely  well.
[Applause.]

I can think of some improvements as a member of the smallest party  in  this
House. I think proportionality could be less strictly applied when it  comes
to speaking time, but I am sure that might fall on deaf ears. [Laughter.]

I think that we could spend more time in the provinces. I do not  mean  that
in terms of provincial  weeks  as  we  have  now,  but  actually  physically
sitting  and  participating  in  our   legislatures   ourselves   with   our
colleagues, building a greater sense of  collegiality  in  those  Houses  so
that we pick up more of the aspirations and the vibes of those Houses.

We have done, by a process  of  debate,  questions  and  answers,  oral  and
written; motions; hearings; discussions;  our  committees;  joint  hearings;
joint sittings; mediation procedures; and interventions.  We  have  done  so
very much.  Then,  of  course,  we  have  had  vital  interaction  with  our
constituencies and our constituency offices.

I'd like to say, finally, that I have seen all my colleagues  here  grow  in
the past five years. I have seen you all grow. I have seen you all  grow  in
stature. I have seen you all grow in ability, and I have had  the  privilege
of also enjoying the collegiality of all our colleagues here. I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. That concludes the  debate.
[Interjections.] Ngiyabonga. [Thank you very much.]  I  call  upon  the  hon
Chairperson of the NCOP, Mrs Pandor.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Ngiyabonga  Sihlalo.  Bese  ngimangele  ukuthi
kazi ngikwenzeni. [Thank you, Chairperson. I was just wondering what I  have
done to you.]

Hon members, I thank all those who have participated in the debate  on  this
report. We thought  it  important  that  we  have  a  report,  whatever  its
imperfections. I agree with the hon Lever that it does  not  go  as  far  as
perhaps it should in terms of the review and analysis  that  are  necessary.
But, I believe, the practice of  debating  a  report  of  that  nature,  and
really reflecting on what form of modification or improvement  we  may  wish
to make to the institution, is an important exercise and  record,  which  we
leave to the next Parliament.

Members have referred to the role of the National Council of  Provinces  and
to the various features of our work over the past five  years,  and  I  will
not repeat these.  I  believe,  however,  that  we  should  table,  as  this
opportunity gives us, a set of issues for future review  and  consideration,
and I proceed to do so. This is in  line  with  the  views  that  have  been
expressed that we require a much more fundamental analysis of  our  practice
as well as the structure and function of Parliament,  the  National  Council
of Provinces in particular, for ourselves, and, I believe, the  other  House
as well, as well as all institutions of governance in our country.

We have had eight years of our Constitution and  10  years  of  the  current
model of governance in our country. This record, while it would not  presume
the need for fundamental change, does in a timeframe  present  us  with  the
opportunity to reflect on changes or improvements that we may wish  to  make
to the structure of governance.

A systematic analysis of governance is a project that, I believe,  the  next
House should certainly undertake. We would need to ask that  institution  to
examine, for example, the  form  of  devolution  of  powers  and  a  greater
clarity with respect to the definition of national norm and standard.

Members would recall we all say that in  terms  of  concurrent  powers,  the
national norm and standard is elaborated  at  the  national  level  and  yet
actual implementation could  be  set  out  in  the  form  of  regulation  or
legislation at the provincial level. It is never clear how the test is  done
of the associated link between the provincial  roll-out  and  that  national
norm and standard. Therefore, there  is  a  need  for  us  to  examine  more
closely this aspect.

Also important, given the size  of  legislatures,  is  that  we  develop  an
understanding and perhaps a  model  of  a  differentiated  devolution.  Some
legislatures are fairly large and able  to  cope  with  a  large  number  of
powers assigned to them. Others are rather small and may find  it  difficult
to  cope  with  the  full  ambit  of  powers,  as   assigned   through   the
Constitution. Therefore there may  be  a  need  to  look  at  whether  there
shouldn't be differentiation.

I think, in reviewing our practice in history at this time,  we  would  find
that administrative ability has proven  to  be  quite  firmly  tied  to  the
ability to act on policy. Given this link then,  it  is  important  that  we
consider carefully how we could  recraft  the  structure  of  governance  to
ensure action on policy and improvement in the lives of all  the  people  of
our country.

The time may also have come to examine whether the  provincial  legislatures
should be political institutions shaped in the same way as Parliament or  as
institutions, rather, established to ensure that the  programmes  of  social
and economic development are implemented. The  question  has  to  be  asked:
Should these structures be  the  same,  or  should  they  have  a  different
connotation both in form and function? I think such a shift would  certainly
assist in avoiding  the  possible  disruption  in  progress  that  is  often
implied by, for example, two-term Premiers and so on.

At the moment, because we have constructed the  legislatures  in  a  similar
guise to Parliament, we have similar provisions  in  the  Constitution  with
respect to these institutions. Is it really appropriate that  Premiers  who,
primarily, would be administering implementation  and  roll-out  of  policy,
have two-term limits in the same way that the President at a national  level
has such limits? We seem to be connoting the two as  the  same  rather  than
distinguishing the different roles that they play. These  are  aspects  that
the next lot should examine.

I believe such a review would  clearly  have  implications  for  a  National
Council of  Provinces.  It  would  certainly  ensure  greater  attention  to
determining  what  we  have  called  "the  provincial   interest"   in   our
Constitution. Also, it would certainly require, in my view, a  strengthening
of an institution of this nature to provide for more members who would  then
do the increased oversight work that would be the outcome of any  change  in
the terms I have suggested.

The National Council of Provinces has shown that it is able  to  respond  to
new demands. I believe that a reshaping of  the  institution  in  the  guise
referred to earlier would certainly  allow  it  to  continue  to  show  this
responsiveness. It has shown that it can be innovative, that it is  able  to
work well with all spheres of government. We are  able  to  work  well  with
local government, as was illustrated in the  debates  that  we  had  earlier
today,  in  the  committee  work  that  led  to  some  of  the  reports  and
legislation that we have debated today.

We have also been innovative in programmes such as our  initiative  to  take
Parliament to the people. I think it  is  important  to  indicate  that  all
these innovations do not come from one individual; they  are  part  of  this
collective of members of the National Council of Provinces. The  ideas  come
from  the  expression  of  concerns  by   members   about   whether   public
participation is at a sufficient level to allow us to really understand  the
impact of our policy and practice on  the  people  of  our  country.  So,  I
really would urge us to avoid the notion that it is this individual and  not
the collective that gives rise to these innovations. I  believe  all  of  us
are responsible and have been party to the forms of  decisions  and  actions
that we have taken.

Our members, who are permanent delegates, have in their  manner  of  working
given provinces and local government a voice. I am aware that  many  of  our
permanent delegates do spend a  great  deal  of  time  in  their  provincial
legislatures even, I am told by members of  the  North  West  province,  the
Chief Whip. So, although we may regard the Chief  Whip  as  somewhat  of  an
expert on matters of justice and safety and security, I am told  by  members
of the legislature that he has a very  deep  understanding  of  tourism  and
environmental  affairs  in  the  manner  that  these  are  communicated   in
committee hearings at the provincial legislature level.

So we have developed  an  expertise  that  certainly  is  reflected  in  our
interaction with provincial legislatures. I  believe  that  any  review  and
reshaping of institutions of governance  would  have  to  ensure  that  this
interaction between national, provincial and local spheres of government  is
maintained. It is absolutely vital that we have  that  kind  of  interaction
and co-operation.

I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate the hon  members  on  the  hard
work that they have done over the years. The report that we have  before  us
provides an accurate record of the nature of the  work.  Hundreds  of  Bills
have been passed by this House, fully  considered,  fully  deliberated  upon
and amended in a wise fashion a great deal of the time, as has been said  by
the Chief Whip.  I  think  we  have  also  ensured  that  we  pursue  public
participation.

We have also grown in the way in which we work  more  efficiently  with  the
National Assembly. I recall in the years before 1999 that we often found  it
difficult to work in a partnered fashion with the committees  of  the  Other
House, but certainly there has been a great  deal  of  improvement  in  this
period of five years. I  believe  that  this  is  something  we  should  all
welcome. I believe we have also done rather better at focusing on  provinces
and the provincial interest. We have provided  empowerment  and  support  to
members. Through the Parliamentary Support Programme and other  initiatives,
we have been able to ensure that members become  better  at  the  work  that
they have to do.

I sincerely thank, in particular, all provincial office bearers for the  co-
operation that they have shown in our work  over  the  past  five  years.  I
believe that if we carry out a deep analysis of our  system  of  governance,
South Africa will be poised to build a democratic set of  institutions  that
will indeed advance a better life for all in South Africa.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Now  the
debate has been concluded. I shall now put the  question.  The  question  is
that the report be adopted. As the  decision  is  dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
It seems as if they are all present.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. There is none. We  shall
now proceed to voting on the question.  I  shall  do  this  in  alphabetical
order per province. The delegation heads must please indicate to  the  Chair
whether they vote in favour of or against or abstain  from  voting.  Eastern

Parliament, there  will  be  now  an  opportunity  for  members  to  deliver
farewell speeches.

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

Mr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, agb lede,  agb  premiers,  en  ander  belangrike
gaste wat hier is, ... [Chairperson, hon members,  hon  Premiers  and  other
important guests here ...]

... on behalf of the NNP, I want to thank the administration  of  the  NCOP,
the Table staff, the floor staff, Hansard, the technical staff,  the  media,
the SA Police Service, the Presiding Officers,  committee  chairpersons  and
everybody involved in the functioning of this Council,  for  the  efficiency
and dedication shown in the past five years. From our  side,  the  NNP,  two
members are retiring from the NCOP, namely Dr Phillip Nel and I.

Dr Nel has already said his farewell in this Council and in  his  committee.
All I can add is that his contribution over the past five years will not  be
easily matched. We honour him for that and we wish him well for the  future.
God bless you. [Applause.]

My loopbaan in die politiek het in Maart 1973 begin. Ek is 31  jaar  in  die
politiek. Van die 31 jaar in die politiek  was  ek  10  jaar  lank  lid  van
hierdie agbare Raad. Om na 10 jaar afskeid te neem, is nie  maklik  nie.  Om
na 31 jaar afskeid  te  neem,  is  nog  baie  moeiliker.  My  gedagtes  gaan
onwillekeurig terug na vroeg Mei  1994  toe  die  destydse  Senaat  bymekaar
gekom het. Almal was vreemd vir mekaar en het mekaar  met  agterdog  bejeën.
Almal het die vraag gestel: sal hierdie Raad demokrasie oorleef?

Vandag het ons ons rol gevestig, danksy die harde werk van ons  gewaardeerde
kollegas. Daar is nog net vyf agb lede oor wat vanaf die  begin  in  hierdie
Hoërhuis was. Hulle was naamlik: die  agb  lid  Van  Niekerk,  die  agb  lid
Surty, die agb lid Sulliman, die agb lid Lubidla en ek. Ons is bevoorreg  om
10 jaar van demokrasie te kon beleef in hierdie belangrike Raad.

Ek wil vandag hulde bring aan wyle Kobie Coetzee en Govan  Mbeki,  asook  dr
Motsuenyane, Alec van Breda, Attie Jooste, Bulelani Ngcuka, dr  Org  Marais,
Lawrence  Mushwana  en  ander  gewaardeerde  kollegas  wat  die  Senaat  met
onderskeiding gedien het. Die Senaat, vanaf 1994  tot  1996,  was  'n  groot
sukses danksy bogenoemde kollegas en ander se harde werk. Ek  was  bevoorreg
om deel te wees van die  onderhandelinge  met  die  totstandkoming  van  die
Nasionale Raad van Provinsies. Dit sal my altyd in my lewe bybly.

Daarom wil ek vandag ook hulde bring aan Pravin  Gordhan,  Bulelani  Ngcuka,
Johnny de Lange en ander met wie ek ten  nouste  saamgewerk  en  onderhandel
het om die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies tot stand  te  bring.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[My career in politics started in March 1973. I have been  in  politics  for
31 years. Of those 31 years in politics I was a member  of  this  honourable
Council for 10 years. To take one's leave after 10 years  is  not  easy.  To
take one's leave after 31 years is even more difficult.  The  thoughts  that
involuntarily come to mind are those of early in May 1994  when  the  former
Senate  met.  Everyone  was  a  stranger  and  regarded  one  another   with
suspiciom. Everyone asked the question: Will this House survive democracy?

Today we have established our role, thanks to the hard work  of  our  valued
colleagues. There are only five members left  who  had  been  in  the  Upper
House from the beginning. They were in fact  hon  member  Van  Niekerk,  hon
member Surty, hon member  Sulliman,  hon  member  Lubidla  and  me.  We  are
privileged to have been able to experience 10 years  of  democracy  in  this
important Council.

I want to pay tribute today to the late Kobie Coetzee and  Govan  Mbeki,  as
well as Dr Motsuenyane, Alec van Breda, Attie Josste,  Bulelani  Ngcuka,  Dr
Org Marais, Lawrence Mushwana and other valued  colleagues  who  served  the
Senate with distinction. The Senate, from 1994 to 1996, was a great  success
thanks to the hard work of the aforementioned colleagues and others.  I  was
privileged to be part of the negotiations concerning  the  establishment  of
the National Council of Provinces. This I shall remember for the rest of  my
life.
It is for that reason that today I  also  want  to  pay  tribute  to  Pravin
Gordhan, Bulelani Ngcuka, Johnny de Lange and others with whom I worked  and
negotiated closely to establish the National Council of Provinces.]

Chairperson,  the  necessity  of  the  second  Chamber  in  a  parliamentary
democracy cannot be underestimated. In fact, the  second  Chamber  is  vital
for good legislation, oversight and accountability.  It  also  broadens  the
scope of democracy in our country, and in any other country.

I want to pay tribute to Mr Lekota for  his  contribution  as  the  previous
Chairperson of the NCOP. However, the hon Pandor was the cherry on top.  She
was formidable. I have only  the  highest  regard  for  her  leadership  and
dedication.

I also want to pay tribute to my Chief Whip, Mr Van Niekerk, and  especially
to the Chief Whip of the Council, Mr Surty, for their  hard  work.  The  hon
Surty deserves everyone's respect.

Ek verlaat u met 'n glimlag om die mond. Die Nasionale Raad  van  Provinsies
het my wildste drome oortref. Mag dit nou  net  verder  van  krag  tot  krag
gaan. [I leave you with  a  smile  on  my  face.  The  National  Council  of
Provinces exceeded my  wildest  dreams.  May  it  in  future  just  go  from
strength to strength.]

God bless you all. I will miss you. I will miss your friendship. Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, to borrow the words of an hon  colleague  in  one
of the earlier debates: "All of us have come a long  road  together  in  the
past five years. And a time has come  when  we  greet  each  other  and  say
farewell, and acknowledge the roles that we played in each other's  personal
growth, and the contributions we have made to this House."

I think the key issue that needs to be highlighted in this House is that  we
have a different ethos and a different atmosphere from the  Other  House.  I
think we still represent the views of our different political  parties,  the
perspectives of our different provinces, without having to  resort  to  some
of the conduct that takes place in the Other House.

I value this aspect of the House and I have the greatest admiration for  all
of my colleagues here, many of whom will be retiring out  of  choice  -  and
I'm one of them - and many of whom will be allocated to different  areas  by
their respective parties, and many of whom will, in the democratic  process,
not be coming back. But nevertheless, personally, I will remember  each  and
every one of you, and I thank you for the interaction  we  had  during  this
trying period. I believe I say that on behalf of all  of  my  colleagues  in
the DA. It only remains to  thank  each  and  every  one  of  you  for  your
contribution in this regard. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, we meet to part, and part to meet. On  behalf
of KwaZulu-Natal delegates, we wish a happy campaign and  every  success  to
all of us, so that we meet again as a family in this House. It is  indeed  a
wonderful House, as my colleagues have expatiated.

Those who may not return, for one reason or another, we  wish  you  all  the
best in your new sphere of activity. Sinifisela  ukusebenza  okuhle.  Nivote
kahle.  [Good  luck  with  the  elections.]  Have  a  safe   journey   home,
ndlelanhle, hambani kahle. [Go well.]

Elections or no elections, do not worry,  there  is  life  after  elections.
Mphathisihlalo ohloniphekile, ngiyabonga kakhulu. [Hon Chairperson, I  thank
you, very much.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Thank you, Chair. I would like to take this  opportunity  to
say thanks a lot. I don't want  to  repeat  what  other  people  have  said,
especially with reference to our Chairperson. A  lot  has  been  said  about
her. I think what has been said about her carries a lot of weight.  However,
I would like to thank, from the UDM's point of view,  committees,  oversight
teams, as well as this House, for having accommodated us.  We  are  a  small
party, with no experience, but you  managed  to  accommodate  our  political
aspirations.

I know that personally I have a problem with ANC friends.  [Laughter.]  They
always torture me and so on, but I  would  like  to  say  thanks  because  I
survived up to this particular stage. [Laughter.] I just hope that  even  my
leadership is going to consider my loyalty. I contributed on behalf  of  the
party towards this House.

On a serious note, I must say thanks a lot, really. We were trying  to  make
big plans within the ANC, especially at committee level.  But  what  I  have
observed is that we were accommodated. Eventually I felt very much  at  home
with the ANC, to my  surprise,  I  must  say.  However,  I  must  assure  my
colleagues that I won't join them, because it  is  very  important  that  we
have opposition. [Laughter.]

We cannot all think alike. This  is  very  important,  in  the  interest  of
democracy. We will have to differ, but not to differ so as not to,  perhaps,
come together at the end of the day. Last, but not least, I  would  like  to
thank the four  permanent  delegates  from  Limpopo:  Prof  Makoela,  Kgoshi
Mokoena, Puleng Mashangoane and Connie. I would  like  to  thank  them  very
much, because I was the only guy in that team.  Whenever  we  went  out  for
oversight activities,  I  was  accommodated  a  lot.  We  never  had  party-
political differences whenever we were out there in the community.

Most of the time I was out there I posed as a member of  the  ANC,  for  the
sake of respect from the community. [Laughter.]  Definitely,  on  a  serious
note once more, I want to say thanks very much. I have  gathered  a  lot  of
experience in this House and, of course, from committees. I'm not  going  to
drop you. Because I have realised that the party listing  process  has  been
unfair to some of us, including me. But, given the experience  that  I  have
accumulated from this particular  House,  I'm  going  to  continue  with  my
commitment to work for my people, particularly considering that the  poorest
of the poor still have problems on the ground.

If I don't come back, I'm not going to throw in  the  towel.  I'm  going  to
continue  working  to  serve  my  people,  irrespective  of  party-political
issues. Once more, thank you very much. [Applause.]

(Translation of Setswana speech follows.)

[Mr O J TLHAGALE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Premiers  present,  and
the august House, it is with  great  joy  that  I  wish  my  colleagues  and
friends all the best today, a day on which we are  saying  goodbye  to  each
other. We were used to each other, working together and even if our  parting
of ways will be for a short time, it brings  us  sadness,  because  we  love
each other.

We are going to prepare ourselves for the elections on a day  that  the  hon
the President has confirmed. Even we from the UCDP  are  ready,  like  other
political parties, to take part in these elections. We are prepared to  work
harmoniously with other political parties and to uphold  the  laws  relevant
to elections. With these words, I give my best wishes to this House. I  also
wish our leaders who have been in the chair,  Mrs  Pandor  and  the  hon  Mr
Surty, all the best until we meet again. [Applause.]]
Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I just want to say,  particularly  to  those  of
you who are going out, that we wish you Godspeed and all the  very  best.  I
don't say farewell, but au revoir, because it is my  declared  intention  to
come back. I have to make an apology today. I want to apologise  in  advance
to all those members who are going to be displaced by the ACDP  members  who
are going to come here after the election. [Laughter.]

May I just say thank you for the collegiality and  for  the  friendship.  On
behalf of the ACDP, to all who've worked with me and with us, who served  us
in this Parliament in whatever capacity, we  appreciate  every  service  and
every kindness. We appreciate all those people  who  work  unseen,  such  as
Hansard and so on. We really do appreciate them. In particular,  I  want  to
thank  the  Chair  -  our  distinguished  Chair,  may  I  say  -   and   our
distinguished Chief Whip and the other distinguished Whips who  have  worked
with us for all their consideration towards us.

I believe that we have enriched one another's lives. I'd like to think  that
we've enriched the life of this nation. Whatever the  future  may  hold  and
wherever the future may take you, may God hold you in the palm of  His  hand
and may you feel the wind at your back until we meet  again.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Chairperson. It seemed as  if,  since
the time  we  worked  together,  arguing  very  vigorously  for  freedom  of
expression in the Constitution, we were destined to work  together  at  some
future time, and I believe that this partnership that  we've  had  as  Chief
Whip of this House and as presiding officer was  certainly  beneficial,  not
only to ourselves, but to the institution as a  whole.  I'd  like  to  thank
you, Chairperson, for  the  creative,  innovative,  resolute  way  in  which
you've managed the affairs of this  House.  Obviously,  we  all  noted  your
eloquence and your articulate ability in terms of dealing with issues.

The Constitution has brought many  people  together,  as  Mr  Ackermann  has
quite correctly pointed out. Mr Mahlangu, who is  sitting  there,  was  also
part of the team. I remember the very interesting times when we sat  in  the
secretariat, debating many great issues. I would also  like  to  acknowledge
his role as Deputy Chairperson on behalf of all the members of the  National
Council of Provinces. In a very short space of time he was able to adapt  to
this new environment, dedicate himself to the task at hand and make  himself
extremely accessible and popular. Our thanks to you for that.

Certainly, my task would not be complete and as efficient as  it  should  be
if I did not have the support of the Whips.  To  the  programming  Whip,  Mr
Sulliman,  thank  you  for  your  assistance  in  terms  of  the   technical
arrangements. I  always  subjected  you  to  the  onslaught  at  programming
committee meetings although the decisions were  mine,  but  thank  you  very
much for standing by me.

Thank you, all the Whips; each one of the provincial Whips from the  ANC  as
well as the Whips from the other political parties. I  must  say,  as  Chief
Whip, many a time it was easier to conduct a multiparty Whips' meeting  than
to conduct a meeting of the ANC Whips. [Laughter.] So  I  certainly  believe
we accommodated each other wonderfully well.

The Chairperson of Committees, Joyce Kgoali, has  been  extraordinary  in  a
short space of time. You've done extremely well.  Thank  you  very  much  on
behalf  of  all  the  members.  The  chairpersons  of  the  various   select
committees have been just great. If you've always  risen  to  the  occasion,
thank you very much for that.

The Table staff  ...  What  can  I  say  about  you?  Jodi-Anne,  Benny  and
everybody else, you've just been extraordinary and part of the  family.  The
difficulty of saying farewell in a small institution such as  this  is  that
you develop such  close  relationships.  It's  extremely  difficult  to  say
goodbye. If I look at our Premier from the Free State, I can only  think  of
the fond memories that we shared when she was in this  institution,  in  the
Senate and in the NCOP, and how she taught me how and wherever  I  would  be
able to assist her in certain areas. But I think those are  the  foundations
of very, very good relationships and they've contributed to the  development
of our democracy.

The Secretary to Parliament, the Secretary to the NCOP, the media,  Hansard,
the translators, the liaison officers, other staff, Elmarie  van  der  Horst
sitting up there, you've all contributed to this. It's  extremely  difficult
to say goodbye.

I think we should also remember some of our colleagues  who  have  left  us,
for  example  Comrade  Senorita  Ntlabati,   the   former   Chairperson   of
Committees, who had contributed so meaningfully in such a distinguished  way
to this House here, Willem Booi, who'd persistently  raised  the  issues  of
persons  with  disabilities  and  did  so  very  ably.  Then  we  also   had
Commandant, our very popular staff member  who  would  tell  me:  "Chief,  I
direct: This is where I'm going to be working and this is what you  have  to
do," and I said, "So it is said, and so it shall be done". But we miss  them
all.

We cannot say farewell without saying  farewell  to  our  Premiers,  to  our
representatives,  our  MECs,  our  Speakers  and  everybody  else  from  the
provinces. Whilst we are a small family  here,  we  also  have  an  extended
family, and our extended family is in the provinces  as  well  as  in  local
government. Our institution would not have been successful had it  not  been
for the support that we've received from them.

I do believe that I've committed myself to this  institution  for  the  past
five years to the best of my ability. I would like to ask  forgiveness  from
those members  to  whom  I  might  have  been  unfair.  I  tried  to  be  as
accommodating as possible and  promote  the  multiparty  democracy  that  we
have. I would also like to recognise the contribution, as  you've  correctly
indicated, of the National Assembly, in terms of making  the  task  of  this
House a successful one.

All this would not have been possible had  I  not  had  the  support  of  my
family. I think I've deprived them of a lot in terms of what I  do  and  the
time I have to spend over here. I think my wife and my three daughters  have
been extremely understanding and  supportive  in  terms  of  assisting  this
House.

To the ANC - I cannot belong anywhere else - I  say  thank  you  very,  very
much. You know how to vote and you know what to do when you go out of  here.
[Interjections.]  Let's  hope  we  have  a  very  successful  election,  and
farewell to my friends.

As I round up, may I just say to  Neels  Ackermann  -  I've  had  a  10-year
association with him - I remember the very  vigorous  and  rigorous  debates
that we've had out here. I was instructed by the ANC to mark  three  people:
Alec van Breda, Adriaan van Niekerk and Neels Ackermann.  I  was  a  sweeper
for the ANC - you would remember that, ma Winkie - and my job was really  to
cut them down to size. He's become much more timid.  The  position  is  much
more nuanced, and I  think  it's  the  character  of  this  House  that  has
contributed to that. So, whilst you don't have the ideological debates,  you
have debates about real issues as they affect people on the ground.  Perhaps
that is the characteristic of this House,  this  cohesiveness,  this  unity,
that we should take with us. So thank you to you as well.

Dr Nel, your sense of humour will be missed. Thank you very, very much,  not
only for your contribution in this House, but also for  your  caring  nature
outside the House in terms of the issues  that  affect  members.  We  really
appreciate that.

Lawrence Lever from the North West, you've been wonderful. All the  best  to
you. Nyakane, I do hope you come back. This  is  your  political  home,  the
ANC. [Interjections.] Come back here and be  part  of  us.  [Interjections.]
Come back here and be part of us. [Interjections.] It's understood!

Piet Matthee, thank you for your contribution.  Everybody  else  -  I  can't
actually single out anybody - everybody has done a wonderful job. Thank  you
very, very much and farewell. Have a good journey back home, but work  hard,
because this is an important election ahead of us. We've got to  come  back,
not with a two-thirds majority, but with  a  70%-plus  majority.  Thank  you
very much. OK, bye-bye! [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Thank you, hon members.

[I am happy because there is no complaint that I can talk  about  today.  We
have been working together harmoniously as this House. My wish is  that  the
next House will also work like we have worked. The Chief Whip is right  when
he says that it is difficult to call people  by  name,  because  all  of  us
sitting here have worked together harmoniously. I thank you all.

However, it is proper that  one  should  call  some  by  name  when  one  is
speaking about them. You would not be doing the right thing if you  did  not
do that. You will bear with me there.]

I think it is important always  to  remember  and  accept  that  parting  is
indeed sweet sorrow. It must come. It is sometimes painful. At  other  times
it can be a happy moment, and I believe while  we  do  indeed  express  some
sadness at the fact that we may lose touch with one  another,  we  also,  in
the context of sweet sorrow, expect happiness in that we part with  a  view,
which I believe is accurate, that this has been  a  job  rather  well  done,
that we have made our best attempt at it. [Applause.]

I believe that if we were to review the contributions that we have  made  to
many of the debates that we have had in this House, if  we  were  to  review
the questions that have been posed by members, if  we  were  to  review  the
interaction members have had with legislation in their committees, we  would
say, indeed, it is a job that  has  been  well  done.  This  week  has  been
interesting in that, despite the large volume of work members  have  had  to
cope with, we have had a number of important debates and discussions in  the
House, again exemplifying this commitment to hard work.

I would like to begin by thanking those whom we  have  worked  closest  with
and they are the permanent delegates of the National Council  of  Provinces.
The 54 members have been an incredible team of 54, showing a great  deal  of
detailed attention to their work; an interest in ensuring that the  National
Council of Provinces functions efficiently and has its place  in  Parliament
and in the overall constitutional design of  our  system  of  governance  in
South Africa.

They would not have been able to be successful, were it not for the  support
of the members of the provincial legislatures who  attended  proceedings  as
special delegates to this House. Nor would we have  been  successful  if  it
were not for the participation of members of local  government  representing
organised local government, Salga. Members of  Parliament,  members  of  the
provincial legislatures and representatives of Salga make up the whole  that
is  the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  and  that   whole   has   worked
collectively in co-operation, and has worked well.

I also must acknowledge all the Premiers of the  nine  provinces,  who  have
been  so  amazing  in  ensuring  that  they  do  respond  to  our  calls  to
participate  in  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  I  also  thank   my
colleagues, the presiding officers of the legislatures,  for  ensuring  that
the business that the House transmits to the legislatures  is  indeed  dealt
with in an orderly and considered fashion, and  that  the  legislatures  are
able  to  respond  timeously  to  mandate  provision,  to  ensure  committee
attendance and other  areas  of  participation  that  rely  on  decision  by
provincial office bearers.
I  also  must  thank  office  bearers  who  head  the  National  Council  of
Provinces' business  committees,  as  they  are  called  in  the  provincial
legislatures. I have had occasion in the first part of  the  five  years  to
seek to visit the various provincial  legislatures  to  try  and  develop  a
closer working relationship. The nature of our work is proven  by  the  fact
that I could only visit four out of the  nine  provincial  legislatures  and
many remain unvisited up to this day.

But in the contact that I had had with the four and with the members of  the
NCOP business committees, I was impressed  by  the  seriousness  with  which
matters  emanating  from  national  Parliament  were  dealt  with   at   the
provincial legislature level, and therefore the  role  and  contribution  of
provincial  legislatures  in  national  policy   deliberation   were   taken
extremely seriously and I always appreciated that work and support.

I must also thank office bearers whom I've worked most closely with  in  the
National Council of Provinces, in the National  Assembly  as  well.  In  the
National Council of Provinces I, of  course,  would  begin  by  thanking  my
colleague  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  hon  Mahlangu.  I've  been   very
fortunate in my  colleagues  the  Deputy  Chairpersons,  Deputy  Chairperson
Mushwana and then Deputy Chairperson Mahlangu.

I think the Deputy Chairperson would confirm,  and  so  would  Mr  Mushwana,
that we've never had a quarrel where we concluded we wouldn't speak to  each
other at any particular time. We've had differences  of  opinion  and  we've
had different opinions on matters, but never have we stopped being  able  to
engage and work together in co-operation as a team,  and  I  believe  Deputy
... [Applause.] I believe Deputy Chairperson Mahlangu has actually taken  to
his job in an incredible fashion and I congratulate him on  that  and  thank
him. [Applause.]

I must then also thank my colleague the Chief Whip of the  National  Council
of Provinces, the hon  Surty.  We  have  worked  hard  together.  We've  had
interesting and sometimes tough discussions and views on the  way  in  which
we would see the institution's matters being dealt with,  but  again,  we've
never ended up throwing each other out of an office, and I congratulate  you
for the manner in which you've carried out your role, but I also  thank  you
for the hard work you've done to ensure that we have speakers'  lists,  that
we are deliberate in terms of the legislation that we must deal  with,  that
the committees are able to function effectively  with  the  support  of  the
Chairperson of Committees and your presence everywhere. One  of  the  things
I've noticed about the hon Surty is he walks very quickly, and I  know  why;
he's got to run to ensure that the whole job is done! We  really  thank  you
for that. [Applause.]

The Chairperson of Committees,  both  Miss  Ntlabati  and  Ms  Kgoali,  have
carried out their tasks with  resolute  confidence,  and  have  steered  our
committees to ensure that their work is effectively  done.  The  hon  Kgoali
has had to take on a mantle at rather short notice  and  has  again  carried
out this role in an exemplary manner.

I also thank the Deputy Chairperson of Committees for  always  being  there,
being supportive and, quietly and in a dignified way, carrying out the  role
that has been assigned to him by this House, but I  must  complain  that  he
always forgets to call me when I'm on  a  list  to  speak!  [Laughter.]  Hon
Bhengu, we thank you for your contribution and for your work in the House.

What can one say about the  committee  chairpersons,  carrying  out  a  very
difficult job, steering committees, while yet at the  same  time  themselves
being permanent delegates and therefore members of other select  committees.
We congratulate you for the sterling work that you have done.

There is the hon Majodina who  speaks  with  a  great  deal  of  passion  on
matters of taxis and transport, and  the  hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena,  who  hasn't
really insisted that we bow  to  traditional  leaders!  [Laughter.]  I  also
think of the hon Nkuna who took on a tough mantle from the former  chair  in
the Select Committee on  Economic  Affairs,  the  hon  Moosa,  and  the  hon
Mkhaliphi who took on the tough role led by the hon Bhabha.

So we have excellent histories of good example, but what has been  of  great
significance in the institution is that people  are  able  to  take  on  new
roles and make a success of them, and I think the House has  been  exemplary
in that regard and I congratulate all committee chairpersons  for  the  work
that they have done.

I would not be fair if  I  were  not  to  refer  to  members  who  serve  as
colleagues  in  the  National  Assembly;  the  members  of   the   portfolio
committees, the various chairpersons and the members of Parliament  who  are
members of the National Assembly. I mentioned earlier that we've  been  able
to develop a much more positive working relationship and I  think  it's  due
to the fact that we  are  all  beginning  to  more  clearly  understand  our
different roles.

I  must  come  then,  having  thanked  hon  members,  to  the  Secretary  to
Parliament and his entire staff,  including  the  Secretary  to  our  House,
without whose support we would not have been able to do  much  of  the  work
that we have done. Hon members, I'm sure you would agree  with  me  when  we
ask the Secretary to Parliament to convey our  thanks  to  all  those  staff
members who work closely with the National  Council  of  Provinces  and  who
provide support to Parliament in its entirety. Secretary, we wish  you  well
in all your future endeavours and in your  future  working  with  ourselves,
but we thank you for the five years and the  successful  way  in  which  you
have carried us in the management and administrative support role.

I must then, of course, thank my colleagues whom I've  worked  very  closely
with; the Speaker of the National Assembly and the  Deputy  Speaker  of  the
National Assembly. Our joint and co-operative way of  working  together  has
been, I think, for many parliaments, somewhat of an exemplary  co-operation.
It's not often that you have  persons  occupying  office  who  are  able  to
recognise the need for joint work and to ensure that it is in the  interests
of the institution that this is carried out.
I would wish, in conclusion, to say to  all  members  I  hope  you  have  an
active, democratic and peaceful election campaign, a  campaign  that  builds
democracy and one that instills confidence in  political  organisations  and
leaders among the people of our country. We  must  not  disappoint  them  by
conducting ourselves in a negative fashion in the next five weeks.

I wish each and every one of you well and I must say that  I  am  amused  at
those of you who already know that you are not coming  back  and  those  who
already know  you  are  coming  back.  You  are  most  fortunate  to  be  so
predictive in your analysis of our political terrain,  but  let  me  say  to
you: Go out, campaign, persuade and let the polls  tell  us  whether  you'll
return. My thanks to each one of you. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 14:00.
