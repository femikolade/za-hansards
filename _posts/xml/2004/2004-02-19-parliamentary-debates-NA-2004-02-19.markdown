                  FAST-TRACKING OF DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The Chief Whip of the Majority Party, moved:


  That the House ratifies the decision the Joint Subcommittee of the  Joint
  Programme Committee adopted on 18 February 2004 in accordance with  Joint
  Rule 216(2), namely that the Division  of  Revenue  Bill  [B  4  -  2004]
  (National Assembly  -  sec  76)  be  fast-tracked  by,  where  necessary,
  shortening any period within which any step in  the  legislative  process
  relating to the Bill must be completed, in order to make it possible  for
  the Bill to  be  passed  by  both  Houses  during  the  current  term  of
  Parliament (Announcements, Tablings and Committee  Reports,  18  February
  2004, p 214).

Agreed to.

                        R200 MILLION FOR ELECTRICITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, the recent decision by  the  ANC-led
Government to allocate a further R200  million  for  the  implementation  of
free basic electricity is commendable indeed. The 50  kilowatts  free  basic
electricity per household will provide much-needed social  relief  to  those
people whose earnings fall on the lowest end of the  scale  including  those
who earn nothing at  all.  In  the  light  of  the  apartheid  socioeconomic
backlog which cannot  be  wiped  out  overnight,  the  steps  that  the  ANC
Government continues to take demonstrate that the dawn of a better  tomorrow
is steadily approaching.

Those  incremental  expenditures  on  the  lives  of  our  people  by   this
Government are further proof of the ANC's commitment to  winning  the  fight
against poverty and restoring the dignity of our people.

We  call  on  all  our  people  at  various  government   levels   to   work
conscientiously to ensure that all deserving members of our communities  get
access to free basic electricity as soon as possible. We must do  this,  not
only as part of our work, but also as a way of giving practical  meaning  to
our humanness. [Applause.]

                    DA'S POLICY PROGRAMME ON JOB CREATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K M ANDREW (DA): Madam Speaker, the DA's policy  programme  for  positive
change has received a  ringing  endorsement  from  Otto,  Count  Lambsdorff,
former Minister of economic affairs in the Federal Republic of  Germany.  He
reserved  particular  criticism  for  the  ANC's  policies  on  labour   and
economics, describing them as having no hope of producing  growth  and  jobs
in South Africa. [Interjections.]

Under ANC rule unemployment has risen, and over  8  million  South  Africans
are now without jobs or work. The DA understands that South Africa  deserves
better and has developed policies that put  job  creation  first.  The  DA's
campaign and policies were  also  enthusiastically  endorsed  by  Mrs  Helen
Suzman, human rights  campaigner,  and  for  13  years  the  only  voice  in
Parliament speaking out against the NP's oppression.

South Africa needs real change, now. Thank you. [Applause.]

                           HIJACKING OF AMBULANCES
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP has  learnt  with  shock  that
two paramedics in Imbali  township,  Pietermaritzburg,  were  hijacked,  and
forced to have sex with one another. A female paramedic was raped by one  of
the culprits. They also robbed them of their belongings and  fled  with  the
vehicle. According to media reports, this was the ninth  hijacking  incident
of an ambulance  in  eight  months,  and  seven  other  cases  of  attempted
hijacking of provincial  ambulances  have  been  reported  during  the  same
period.

The IFP believes that this is the most traumatic  and  degrading  experience
any human being can be subjected to. The fact is these paramedics  now  have
to face their families, colleagues and the public knowing  that  a  part  of
their dignity has been taken away from them. This is also  a  huge  blow  to
the public service, especially the  health  sector,  knowing  how  important
their role in the community is, especially the task of saving lives.

It is also a wake-up call to us as a nation to remember that certain  people
in our midst had to sacrifice their  lives  and  dignity  to  save  people's
lives. These kinds of incidences show the high level of  moral  degeneration
and lack of respect for human dignity in our society. It also shows that  we
still have a long way to go before we can fully say  that  we  are  a  truly
free country, free from fear of one's life,  dignity  and  possessions  that
are forcefully taken away from one. It  is  a  clear  sign  that  the  fight
against women's exploitation and abuse is far from over.  We  still  have  a
long way to go before the most vulnerable  people  in  our  communities  can
truly say they are safe.

                              INCOME TAX RELIEF

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof B TUROK (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, last year our economy  grew  at  a
slower rate than the forecast growth rate. Also, the  strengthening  of  the
rand, coupled with the impact of  drought,  led  to  decreased  company  tax
receipts. Despite all these negative developments, in this years's  national
Budget, the ANC-led Government has decided to provide a R4 billion  personal
income tax relief. This will come as a very welcome intervention,  and  will
lighten the burden on especially those of our people who  occupy  the  lower
rungs of the earnings ladder.

We commend the ANC-led Government  on  its  intelligent  management  of  our
economy, as this has allowed  us  space  to  pursue,  consistently,  poverty
alleviation programmes even under these difficult economic times.

With these steady but sure steps, we are continually giving meaning  to  our
quest to progressively expand the frontiers of  human  fulfilment,  inspired
by the vision of creating a people-centred society. [Applause.]

                                   BUDGET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (NNP): Adjunkspeaker, die Nuwe Nasionale  Party  wil
die Minister van Finansies gelukwens met sy Begroting  wat  soos  elke  jaar
van uitstaande gehalte was. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Soos gewoonlik, is hy weer op die oomblik die mees gewilde persoon in  Suid-
Afrika na die Begroting. Hy kan verseker weet dat  die  kanse  dat  die  agb
Cassie Aucamp hom moontlik kan vervang as Minister van Finansies,  soos  die
Minister self in 'n onderhoud oor die radio vanoggend  genoem  het,  net  so
vergesog is as die moontlikheid dat die  agb  Douglas  Gibson  die  volgende
Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit sal wees.

Gun die Nuwe Nasionale Party egter die geleentheid om een saak aan  te  roer
wat nie in die Begroting ter sprake gekom het nie. Dit is  die  kwessie  van
pensioenarisse en dat die R125 000 belastingvrye perk die afgelope  15  jaar
dieselfde gebly het. Hierdie bepaling  het  glad  nie  tred  gehou  met  die
stygende inflasiekoers nie, en die  NNP  voel  dit  het  tyd  geword  om  'n
verhoging in hierdie verband te maak.
Pensioenarisse trek reeds  noustrop  as  gevolg  van  'n  verlaging  in  die
rentekoerse,  en   Suid-Afrika   kan   nie   bekostig   om   die   wat   nog
selfonderhoudend is ook afhanklikes te maak nie.  Daarom  doen  die  NNP  'n
dringende beroep op die Minister om hierdie belastingvrye perk  as  'n  saak
van dringendheid aan te spreek.  Ek  dank  u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr  A  Z  A  VAN  JAARSVELD  (NNP):  Deputy  Speaker,  the  NNP  wants   to
congratulate the Minister of Finance on his  Budget  which  was,  as  it  is
every year, of excellent quality. [Interjections.]

As usual, he is once again at present  the  most  popular  person  in  South
Africa after the Budget. He may rest assured that the chances that  the  hon
Cassie Aucamp could possibly replace him as the Minister of Finance, as  the
Minister himself mentioned in a radio interview this  morning,  is  just  as
ludicrous as the possibility that the hon Douglas Gibson would be  the  next
Minister of Safety and Security.
Afford the NNP the opportunity, however, to touch on  one  matter  that  was
not raised in the Budget. It is the  matter  regarding  pensioners  and  the
fact that the R125 000 tax-free limit has remained the same for the past  15
years. This provision did not in the least  keep  abreast  with  the  rising
inflation rate, and the NNP feels that the time has come for an increase  in
this regard.

Pensioners are already suffering financially because of a  decrease  in  the
inflation rate, and South Africa cannot  afford  also  to  render  dependent
those who are self-sufficient. For this reason the NNP urgently  appeals  to
the Minister to address this tax-free limit as a matter of urgency. I  thank
you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

                       ACDP'S GROWTH IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP):  Deputy  Speaker,  the  ACDP  notes  with  interest  the
results of the recent by-elections  held  on  11  February  in  ward  12  in
Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal, in which the  ACDP  increased  its  share  of  the
votes by 200%. That is an increase from 4,1% in the year 2000 to 13,7%.  The
ACDP notes that the DA vote decreased  from  62,98%  in  the  year  2000  to
44,29%, and that the ANC did not field a candidate, but  opted  instead  for
telling their voters to vote for the New  NP.  Despite  Ladysmith  being  an
historical New NP seat, the New  NP,  together  with  the  ANC,  could  only
muster 22% of the vote. Seeing the ANC function as a heart-lung machine  for
the New NP is a curious sight.

The increased share  of  the  vote  for  the  ACDP  indicates  an  increased
awareness among the electorate to turn to policies promoting family  values,
social stability and economic growth. The ACDP  would  like  to  acknowledge
the active participation of all  those  who  came  out  to  vote  for  their
prospective parties and all officials involved in making this by-election  a
success. Thank you.

                              BUDGET INCREASES
                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M N OLIPHANT (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Budget proposal tabled  yesterday
by the Minister of Finance tells the story of the  ANC-led  Government  that
is deeply committed to creating a better life for  all.  The  tabled  Budget
continues to expand housing, water and community services.  It  extends  and
improves spending on health services.  Education  continues  to  make  up  a
larger component of our Budget. Continued investment in these areas  strikes
at the heart of the second economy,  characterised  by  inadequate  shelter,
poverty, disease, uncertain incomes and  unemployment.  The  impact  of  all
these ills are felt more by women and children.

The African National Congress commends Government on  this  balanced  Budget
which expands social services, and at the same time strengthening  prospects
for economic development, thus extending the frontiers of freedom.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

                             SPENDING OF BUDGET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M F CASSIM (PJC): Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you very much. In over  300
years, for the very first time, the poor, the destitute and the  jobless  in
our country can look forward to real  expectations  of  jobs  and  a  better
life. Yesterday the Minister of Finance  announced  an  enormous  amount  of
money to alleviate the situation of the poor and  the  down-trodden  in  our
country.

I would like to ask this House to do what Malaysia  does,  and  that  is  to
allow each  member  of  Parliament  to  take  responsibility  in  a  certain
geographical area for oversight of development in order that this  money  is
not left in the hands of bureaucrats alone who may not be able to  give  the
projects the desired  drive  that  would  be  needed.  If  we  followed  the
Malaysian example, we would be able to utilise  the  full  Budget  that  the
Minister has allocated in order to make  sure  that  that  which  has  never
happened in our country can happen, and that the  paternalism  that  has  so
far infected this country's politics can be overthrown and people can  enjoy
liberty, not only in  politics,  but  also  in  terms  of  money,  jobs  and
opportunity. Thank you.

            SECURITY GUARDS KILLED DURING CASH-IN-TRANSIT HEISTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms J T NTULI (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, a spate of cash-in-transit  heists
hit the Lowveld on Monday  and  Tuesday  this  week.  In  the  process  four
security guards  have  been  killed  within  14  hours.  On  Tuesday  police
arrested a suspect in connection with this crime near White River.

The ANC is deeply saddened by such unnecessary and painful loss of life.  We
call on the  Police  Service  to  work  tirelessly  to  bring  to  book  the
perpetrators of these heinous criminal acts. We also call on communities  in
the area to assist police in their investigations.

Crime, particularly violent crime,  has  no  place  in  the  people-centered
society we are working to create. Let us unite in the people's  contract  to
create  a  safe,  secure  and  peaceful  country  together.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

                        WESTERN CAPE DESERVES BETTER

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr W P DOMAN (DA): Adjunkspeaker, sedert die NNP kiesers  in  die  Wes-Kaap
in die steek gelaat het deur die provinsie aan die ANC  uit  te  lewer,  het
die slaagsyfer vir graad 10-leerders met 12% gedaal teenoor toe  die  DA  se
Helen Zille in beheer van onderwys was.

Minister Asmal staan daarop dat leerders doelbewus nie in  grade  10  en  11
teruggehou word nie. Die NNP/ANC-regering in die Wes-Kaap  moet  dus  voluit
verantwoordelikheid vir hierdie agteruitgang neem.

Ook wat behuising betref, vaar die Wes-Kaap die tweede slegste  van  al  die
provinsies. Die provinsiale ANC-minister, LUK Hangana,  gaan  nie  eens  40%
van die begroting bestee nie. Dit sal die eerste keer sedert 1994  wees  dat
die  Wes-Kaap  nie  sy  volle  begroting  bestee  nie.  Eerstens,   moeilike
nasionale regulasies en, tweedens, die munisipaliteite van die Wes-Kaap  wat
nie oor die vermoë beskik nie, laat 'n mens jou hande in die lug gooi.

Maak die ANC dan nie die regulasies nie, en regeer die NNP/ANC dan  nie  nou
die meeste munisipaliteite in die Wes-Kaap nie? Die Wes-Kaap verdien  beter.
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN (DA): Deputy Speaker, since the NNP have let down  the  voters
in Western Cape by handing the province over to the ANC, the pass  rate  for
Grade 10 learners has declined by 12% as opposed  to  when  the  DA's  Helen
Zille was in control of education.

Minister Asmal insists that learners should not deliberately  be  held  back
in Grades 10 and 11. The NNP/ANC  government  in  the  Western  Cape  should
therefore take full responsibility for this degeneration.

Also, as far as housing is concerned,  the  Western  Cape  is  doing  second
worst of all the povinces. The provincial ANC Minister, MEC Hangana, is  not
even going to spend 40% of the budget. It will be the first time since  1994
that the Western Cape does not spend its entire budget.  Firstly,  difficult
national regulations and, secondly, the municipalities of the  Western  Cape
that do not have the capability, makes one want to throw one's hands  up  in
the air.

Is it not the ANC that makes the regulations, and  is  it  not  the  NNP/ANC
that is now governing most of the municipalities in the  Western  Cape?  The
Western Cape deserves better.]

                      EMPLOYMENT IN NORTH WEST PROVINCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE (ANC): Madam Speaker, on 13 February  2004  the  government
of the North West province recommitted itself to the implementation  of  the
Expanded Public Works Programme. The provincial  government  reiterated  its
commitment to the use of labour-intensive  methods  in  the  development  of
this infrastructure.

The fact that the government of that province  has  put  the  issue  of  the
fight against unemployment at the top of its agenda is a reflection  of  the
broader commitment of the ANC to addressing the basic needs of  our  people.
We share the view of the North West province that to improve  on  the  gains
we made during the first decade of freedom, we  must  now  focus  even  more
attention on the challenge of creating work and fighting poverty.

We urge the provincial government and all the people of the  North  West  to
unite in a people's contract to seek speedy  movement  in  implementing  the
programmes to which they have committed themselves. We furthermore urge  the
leadership of all the social partners, business, the workers of our  country
and community organisations to move more speedily  towards  the  realisation
of the goals of the Growth and Development Summit. I thank you. [Applause.]

                  CONSERVATIVE PARTY'S RETURN TO PARLIAMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker,  allow  me  the  opportunity  to
congratulate  the  Conservative  Party  on  their  excellent   comeback   to
Parliament through the  DA.  The  DA  is  becoming  a  haven  to  right-wing
politicians.  One  only  has  to  look  at  their  list  of  candidates  for
confirmation of this  fact.  At  this  stage  six  previously  prominent  CP
members are on the DA's list. [Interjections.]

In Mpumalanga, Rosier de Ville, former CP MP,  is  fourth  on  the  national
list. In Gauteng, Manie van Wyk,  former  CP  member,  is  in  ninth  place,
better than a lot of DP liberals like Ryan Coetzee, Mike Waters and  Vincent
Gore. On the Gauteng provincial list the two former CP  members  are  Philip
de Wet and Danie Erasmus, respectively in fifth  and  nineteenth  place.  In
the Eastern Cape Gustav Rautenbach, a far-right CP member, is eighth on  the
national list, while Victor Strong, former CP/FF member, is currently  a  DA
member of Parliament.
So, Madam Speaker, the DA list speaks volumes with regard  to  their  "fight
black"  strategy.  Furthermore,  most  of  the  black  people  in  electable
positions on the DA list were put there by Tony in  a  show  of  affirmative
action, but the  former  CP  members  were  chosen  to  electable  positions
without any help from Tony.

The New NP can only hope the notorious Boeremag is not the military wing  of
the DA. I thank you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  OPPOSITION:  On  a  point  of  order,  Madam  Deputy
Speaker. The hon member is an  experienced  member  of  this  House  and  he
should know that if he refers to  the  hon  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  he
should refer to him in those terms. He is not "Tony"  to  that  hon  member.
[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, please remember that when we refer  to  one
another, we do refer to one another as hon members.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I do apologise. It was an omission on my side.

              RESTITUTION OF LAND TO THE PEOPLE OF RIEMVASMAAK

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M GREEN (ACDP): Madam Deputy Speaker, since there is no debate  in  the
House today regarding the approval by Parliament of the  exclusion  of  land
from the Augrabies Waterfall National Park, I propose that the House  agrees
to debate the issue which is close to  the  hearts  of  the  people  of  the
Northern Cape.

The restitution of land to the Riemvasmaak people in the Northern Cape is  a
genuine victory,  having  gone  through  legitimate  court  processes  which
resulted in the finding that the claim is valid. The ACDP congratulates  the
community and wishes them well.

Nature conservation is of course of critical  importance  and  part  of  the
deal concluded was an assurance that this aspect would not be  neglected  or
frustrated. Naturally there are some concerns  but  provided  the  community
chooses to put this responsibility  in  responsible  hands,  these  concerns
will cease to be.

The ACDP calls on the community to honour their agreements and maximise  the
value of  the  leisure  and  hospitality  potential.  We  support  fair  and
reasonable solutions to issues  surrounding  land  restitution.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

     INCREASE IN PENSION, DISABILITY AND CHILD SUPPORT GRANTS INCREASED

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K M MOEKETSE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the  ANC  welcomes  the  decision  by
Government to increase pension, disability and child  support  grants.  This
demonstrates  the  continued  commitment  by  the  ANC-led   Government   to
addressing  meaningfully  the  plight  of  the  vulnerable  sectors  in  our
society.

We  commend  Government  on  its  consistent  pursuit  of   achievable   and
sustainable goals, as we work to  achieve  the  objectives  of  freedom  and
improved standards of living and the quality of life  for  all.  We  believe
that the latest increment in grants and pensions, taking  effect  in  April,
is one reason among many for  us  to  celebrate  the  first  decade  of  our
freedom with pride. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The time for statements  has  expired.  I  now  come  to
Ministerial responses. Does any Minister wish  to  respond  to  any  of  the
statements? No.

               LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL PROPERTY RATES BILL

   (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Local and Provincial
                                 Government)

There was no debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move that  the
report be adopted.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any objections?

Mr M J ELLIS: What did he say?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: He moves for adoption of the report. [Interjections.]

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

               LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL PROPERTY RATES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Deputy  Speaker  and
hon members, the Bill which is before the House today was  characterised  by
some as a controversial piece of legislation. Those who  argue  against  its
introduction have advanced a detailed critique of the provisions which  seek
to bring into the rates base areas which  were  previously  excluded.  Their
altruism impels them to denounce this uncaring  Government  for  wanting  to
rate the already impoverished people in rural  communities  and  the  former
black townships.

The poverty which pervades these areas,  which  the  opportunist  demagogues
are apparently concerned about, has sociopolitical  origins  which  must  be
properly explained. The pre-1994 political  dispensation  adopted  a  policy
which amounted to a strict enforcement  of  residential  segregation  and  a
placement of severe limits to the extent  to  which  the  resources  of  our
country would be shared. Property rates, then,  were  essentially  an  urban
mechanism for raising local revenue.

Although the then so-called central government  did  have  the  capacity  to
collect taxes from people, it had no intention  of  reversing  the  economic
exclusion of those of our people who lived in the townships, as well  as  in
the Bantustans.  What  transfers  from  the  national  fiscus  went  to  the
Bantustan  regimes  and  the  urban  Bantu  councils  were  meant  to  yield
disproportionate economic benefit to those who were  running  the  Bantustan
machinery and the discredited urban Bantu  councils.  The  majority  of  our
people were left with no access to revenue that could  be  used  to  provide
them with shelter and affordable amenities such  as  water  and  sanitation,
electricity and refuse removal.

Calls for the retention of the status quo serve as little more  than  loaded
shorthand for maintaining the legacy of poverty and  gross  inequalities  of
the past. As hon members  are  aware,  yesterday  the  Minister  of  Finance
announced an allocation of R47,3 billion to the local  government  sphere  -
an increase of R3,9 billion  over  the  next  three  years.  This  is  local
government's share of nationally raised revenue and it will  be  distributed
to individual municipalities on an  equitable  base.  The  raising  of  this
revenue by national Government is  possible,  thanks  to  our  Constitution,
which concentrates sufficient power at the centre to collect  resources  and
distribute them for the developmental good  of  our  people  throughout  the
length and breadth of our country.

As the President said in the state of  the  nation  address,  in  the  short
space of ten years, we  have  been  able  to  provide  1,9  million  housing
subsidies  for  the  poor;  electrified  more  than  70%  of  our  country's
households; provided access to  clean  water  to  an  additional  9  million
people, and provided access to sanitation to 63% of the  households  in  the
country. In addition to this, we have created a social  security  net  which
benefits the most  vulnerable  sectors  of  South  African  society,  namely
people living with disabilities, the aged, and  children  whose  parents  do
not have the means to support them.

These measures attest to the functional efficacy of the key elements of  the
redistributive polity which we have been creating  and  strengthening  since
1994. Our three spheres of Government are tied together by a  fiscal  system
that guarantees the transfer of resources  from  surplus  areas  to  deficit
areas. Not only is the idea to tackle the problem  of  income  poverty,  but
also, we want to give our people in their local areas, assets without  which
their communities cannot become livable and sustainable entities.

This explains why we have always insisted that our  legislative  initiatives
must be seen within the  context  of  our  ongoing  efforts  at  building  a
developmental state. The ensemble of poverty  alleviation  programmes,  such
as  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme,   the   Integrated   Sustainable   Rural
Development  Programme,  the  Local  Economic  Development  Fund   and   the
Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant  is  meant   to   create   conditions   for
sustainable  development  in  the  hitherto  marginalised  areas  and,  more
importantly,  to  progressively  create  a   platform   for   the   balanced
development of our national economy.

It is when programmes like  these  come  to  fruition  that  we  shall  have
created  sources  of  municipal-owned  revenue  to  supplement  what   local
government currently  receives  by  way  of  an  equitable  share  from  the
nationally collected revenue. The process of cultivating a revenue base  for
poorer municipalities will receive a major boost from  the  more  than  R100
billion  which  Government  has   set   aside   for   the   development   of
infrastructure. It is expected that the public investments we are making  in
the poverty-stricken areas will throw up new business opportunities for  the
private sector. As the private sector makes use of these  opportunities,  it
will also be focusing its energies on areas  of  Government  priority.  Such
infrastructure as we shall have created in these areas  will  be  maintained
through the contributions made by residents, individual or corporate.

As I have said earlier, we have witnessed  increased  flows  of  allocations
from the national fiscus to  local  government.  Municipalities  have  their
responsibility of taking advantage  of  these  allocations  to  improve  the
infrastructural capacity and to accelerate local economic  development.  The
Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill is a legislative  instrument
for use by them to mobilise community  contribution  to  this  process.  For
this instrument to be used effectively, community members must get  together
with  their  public  representatives  and  municipal   managers   to   adopt
implementation approaches which are appropriate to their local conditions.

The  drafters  of  this  Bill  were  acutely  sensitive  to  the  fact  that
municipalities have different sizes of rates bases and are  differential  in
their administrative capacity to raise revenue due to them. This  calls  for
steadfast  adherence  to  the  norms  mandated  by  the   legislation,   and
innovation and flexibility with respect  to  implementation.  For  instance,
whereas  it  may  be  prudent  to  exempt  certain  categories,  either   of
properties or people from rating, in order to  stimulate  economic  activity
in a particular municipal area, such exemptions  may  not  be  necessary  in
another municipal area. It is only  when  we  understand  these  intricacies
that we shall desist from characterising this Bill as  controversial.  There
is nothing controversial in the Government's call on people to  join  us  in
partnerships which are meant to bring about a better life for all.

Allow me to conclude by  thanking  the  Chairperson,  Mr  Yunus  Carrim  and
members of the Portfolio Committee for Provincial and Local Government;  the
Deputy Minister for Provincial and Local Government,  Ms  Ntombazana  Botha;
officials from the department, representatives  from  various  organisations
and my colleagues - both in the Cabinet  and  in  the  South  African  Local
Government Association. If it was not for  their  sterling  contribution  of
energy and insights, we would not have such a  sound  piece  of  legislation
before the House today. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  comrades  and  friends,  since  the
December 2000 elections, a fundamentally new system of local government  has
begun to come into effect. Municipalities now have a  much  greater  service
delivery and developmental role. To fulfil this  role,  they  have  to  have
adequate revenue. The  local  government  financial  system  is,  therefore,
being reviewed. There are many aspects to this review. The  recent  adoption
of the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act  is  part  of  the
process of shaping a new local government financial system.

The Local Government: Municipal  Property  Rates  Bill  is  another  crucial
aspect. In fact, local government currently  raises  over  90%  of  its  own
revenue. About 20% of this comes from  property  rates.  Of  course,  having
revenue is not all. It's how you manage and spend  it  that's  crucial.  The
more productive and efficient municipalities are in managing their  revenue,
the more their case for increased revenue is strengthened. It  is  in  terms
of the need for both  more  revenue  and  its  better  management  that  the
portfolio committee approached  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Property
Rates Bill.

It is certainly the most challenging Bill, technically  speaking,  that  the
portfolio committee has had to deal with since 1994.  To  process  the  Bill
effectively, the portfolio committee, as  we  explained  in  our  report  in
yesterday's ATC, held extensive  public  hearings,  workshops  and  briefing
sessions, and established several subcommittees to  facilitate  the  ongoing
participation of key stakeholders, especially from the public.

The portfolio committee deliberated on the Bill for  about  320  hours,  and
about half  of  this  involved  the  active  participation  of  a  range  of
stakeholders, including  the  representatives  of  Salga,  public  entities,
agriculture, religious, welfare and  charitable  organisations,  independent
schools, municipal valuers and others. The Bill is an outcome of  protracted
negotiations with a range of key stakeholders.

From the response we've received so  far,  we  believe  there's  significant
consensus on the core aspects of the Bill. Certainly, the major  differences
that surfaced at the first public hearings have largely faded.  At  present,
municipalities use very different  rates  systems,  based  on  the  pre-1994
provincial ordinances.

With our new system of  co-operative  governance  and,  in  particular,  our
intergovernmental fiscal relations system, the need for a certain  level  of
uniformity  has  become  necessary.  A  national  framework   within   which
municipalities shape their own policies is the  answer.  This  is  what  the
Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill provides.

The Constitution gives municipalities the power to levy rates  on  property.
However, it allows Parliament to regulate this power. So, we  have  provided
for a national framework, without undermining the  constitutional  power  of
municipalities. We constantly engaged with Salga over this and  are  pleased
to report that they fully endorse the approach in the Bill.

In terms of the Constitution,  municipalities  may  extend  the  levying  of
rates, as the Minister explained, to categories  of  owners  and  properties
that have, until now, been partially or fully excluded  from  paying  rates.
Examples of this would include the properties of  public  entities,  farmers
and others in rural areas, religious, welfare and charitable  organisations,
independent schools and conservation bodies.

Stakeholders from these and other sectors made strenuous representations  to
the portfolio committee for  the  retention  and  even  extension  of  these
benefits. Some of them presented formidable arguments.

The portfolio committee's response was to find a balance  between  the  need
for   municipalities   to   have   adequate   revenue   to   fulfil    their
constitutionally mandated responsibilities and the  need  to  avoid  levying
rates in a way that debilitates categories of property owners.

The portfolio committee also sought to strike a balance between  recognising
the valuable developmental goals served by  certain  categories  of  owners,
for example the public entities and welfare organisations, and the  need  to
ensure that it is national and provincial government, not local  government,
that bear the major cost of the role served by these agencies.

The committee sought, too,  to  find  a  balance  between  the  need  for  a
coherent national framework for property rates  that  will  foster  national
macroeconomic balances and the need for municipalities to  shape  their  own
rates policies through consultation with key stakeholders. So  it  is  that,
while  municipalities  have  considerable  latitude  to  decide   on   rates
according to local circumstances, there are provisions in the Bill  for  the
national  Government  to  sensitively  intervene,  should  a  municipality's
decisions on rates undermine national economic  policies.  The  Constitution
allows for this.

Examples of this include the right of the Minister for Provincial and  Local
Government, in consultation with the  Minister  of  Finance,  to  limit  the
percentage of rates increases. This  could  apply  to  all  or  to  specific
categories of properties. Moreover, any sector of the economy  could,  after
consulting with municipalities and  Salga,  approach  the  Minister  to  cap
rates increases if they can  prove  that  their  rates  bills  are  entirely
unreasonable. The onus is on them to make an irrefutable case.

Municipalities may also not rate  nonresidential  properties  unduly  highly
compared to residential properties, nor can  they  ureasonably  discriminate
between categories of nonresidential properties. In  consultation  with  the
Minister of Finance, the Minister for Provincial and  Local  Government  can
prescribe ratios in  this  regard,  if  necessary.  The  Minister  also  can
provide guidelines for municipalities to levy rates in a way that  does  not
undermine national  economic  policies.  He  may  also  provide  a  national
framework, consistent with  the  Bill,  on  rates  exemptions,  rebates  and
reductions.

Of course, all these interventions have to be done after  consultation  with
Salga. While the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill provides  a
coherent national framework, many of the concrete  decisions  on  rates  can
only be made  at  municipal  level.  The  committee  feels  it's  important,
therefore,  that  stakeholders  are  active  in  their  municipalities   and
contribute to shaping their rates  policies.  Engaging  with  Parliament  to
shape the content of the Bill or rushing to the Minister for  relief  cannot
be a substitute for engaging with the municipalities.

The committee gave considerable attention to what should be  the  basis  for
valuation. Among the options explored were a land-only valuation,  land  and
improvement at variable rates, land and improvement at a  uniform  rate  and
annual  rental  value.  The  department  was  asked  to  undertake   further
empirical studies regarding these options, and they were  discussed  with  a
wide range of stakeholders and academic and other  technical  experts,  both
South African and others.

The inputs by the department  and  the  vast  majority  of  those  consulted
supported the basis for valuation as being the  market  value  of  land  and
improvements at a uniform rate. The  majority  in  the  portfolio  committee
agreed with this. In any case, this is a trend internationally.

Instead of providing for blanket exclusions from  rates  for  categories  of
owners of properties, the portfolio  committee  strengthened  provisions  in
the  Bill  dealing  with  the  phasing-in  of  rates;  the  requirement  for
municipalities to consider, in their rates policies, the  effects  of  rates
on categories of owners and properties; negotiations between  categories  of
owners and properties and the municipalities  and  Salga,  and  consultation
between the Minister and Salga on the effects  of  rates  on  categories  of
owners and property.

The committee stresses that the Bill does not prescribe that property  rates
must be levied  in  traditional  authority  areas.  Each  municipality  must
decide for itself on this. However, it will be difficult  to  levy  property
rates in communal areas, unless property is registered in  the  name  of  an
individual or community.

Even where there is individual ownership,  the  property  has  to  be  first
valued. The owner is  not,  in  any  case,  liable  for  rates,  unless  the
property exceeds R15 000 in value. Land reform beneficiaries, moreover,  are
excluded from rates for 10 years. Thereafter, municipalities have  to  phase
their rates in over three years.  With  the  MEC's  approval,  this  can  be
extended to six years.

For most municipalities, the cost of valuation and administration  of  rates
will exceed  any  revenue  derived  from  these  properties.  The  portfolio
committee  does  not  believe  that  the  levying  of  property   rates   in
traditional authority areas is significantly on the agenda for a long  while
to come.

As the range of properties to be valued, in terms of this  Bill,  have  been
significantly increased, questions have been raised about  the  capacity  of
property  valuers  in  this  country.  Moreover,  with   the   advances   in
technology, there are constant changes in valuation techniques and  methods.
The portfolio committee  believes  that  the  department  and  Salga  should
inquire  further   into   this,   facilitate   greater   awareness   amongst
municipalities and take appropriate steps to facilitate the  development  of
the requisite capacity of valuers.

The Bill specifically excludes properties, in  part  or  whole,  from  being
subjected to  property  rates.  For  example,  the  first  R15  000  of  all
residential  properties  and  30%   of   the   value   of   public   service
infrastructure are  excluded  from  rates.  Land  reform  beneficiaries,  as
explained, are also excluded from  rates  for  a  substantial  period.  That
represents revenue foregone by municipalities. The committee  believes  that
the national Government should, over time, consider this  when  deciding  on
the allocation of money to local government from the national fiscus.

The Bill represents a significant shift  from  the  current  property  rates
regime. The DPLG  and  Salga  are  asked  to  embark  on  a  massive  public
education programme on the content and the implications of  the  Bill.  Many
municipalities do not have the capacity to implement  this  Bill.  The  DPLG
and Salga will have to pay considerable attention to this.

Ultimately, decisions about levying rates reside with  municipalities.  This
Bill will bring into effect a new property rates system. As with  much  else
of the new local government system, the new property rates system has to  be
phased in appropriately through consultation with a range of stakeholders.

The committee has sought to strike a series of balances  between  the  needs
of municipalities and a range of key stakeholders. Municipalities are  urged
to exercise their power to levy rates both in the spirit and the  letter  of
the law. The department and Salga have  a  crucial  role  to  play  in  this
regard, and we urge them to do so. Members of  our  porfolio  committee  and
MPs generally can also play a role, and must do so.

The portfolio committee expresses appreciation for the  manner  in  which  a
range of stakeholders interacted with us in finalising the Bill. We  express
our gratitude to the Minister and Deputy Minister, and express  our  sincere
appreciation to Ms Jackie Manche, Mr Mzilikazi Manyike,  Dr  Peter  Vaz,  Mr
Gerrit Grové, Mr Joe Dube and Dr Petra Bouwer of the department, and Mr  Ben
Dorfling and Ms Shiva Makotoko of Salga for the considerable work  they  did
in processing the Bill through their  interaction  with  the  committee  and
many stakeholders.

The committee also acknowledges the assistance of Mr Nico McLachlan  and  Ms
Zora Ebrahim of ODA. I think they are somewhere in the  gallery.  Also,  our
thanks, as ever, to our outstanding committee secretary, Mr Llewellyn  Brown
and his assistant Ms Bulelwa Madikane, and a person who is never  mentioned,
actually, the ANC study group secretary, Ms Gadijah Salie.

Finally, I should tell the Minister, I don't know  what  he  or  the  Deputy
Minister were doing on Valentine's  Day,  but  his  entire  department,  not
least Ms Jackie Manche, was here processing the Bill.  They  have  performed
outstandingly, and we are deeply grateful to them. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G A J GROBLER: Deputy Speaker, we spent many hours on this Bill,  but  if
it wasn't for our chairperson being such a long-winded person we would  have
saved over 50 hours of what we spent on the Bill. The report you  read  here
was well read, Mr Chairperson.

On a more serious note,  the  committee  gave  ample  opportunity  to  these
stakeholders, who have an interest in this difficult  and  highly  technical
Bill, to offer their inputs. At times emotions ran a bit high, but  show  me
a person or organisation that will volunteer to pay rates and taxes  -  it's
obvious. As with any Bill, it is difficult to satisfy everybody.

The first draft of the Bill could not be described as an example of  a  well
thought-through Bill. The Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government,
but with the guidance of the  portfolio  committee  and  the  many  valuable
inputs from stakeholders, we as a team managed to  arrive  at  a  much  more
acceptable Bill than the one that originally landed on our desks.

Salga is not the most  efficient  organisation  I  have  ever  come  across,
except for arranging the  so-called  workshops  in  every  corner  of  South
Africa with the main purpose of squandering rates and  taxpayers'  money  on
outings, as we recently discovered in Cape Town. However, I  must  say  that
officials  of  the  body   contributed   beyond   expectation   during   the
deliberations on this Bill, and I see  some  of  them  in  the  gallery.  At
times, I got the impression  that  the  department  was  at  a  total  loss,
because changes to clauses were made on a continual basis, presumably  under
pressure from certain stakeholders, but I think  more  from  politicians  in
the ruling party.

This Bill has many positive elements regarding property rates;  well-debated
and well thought-through clauses  that  objectively  consider  every  sector
that  is  operating  within  the  boundaries  of  municipalities.  Literally
hundreds of inputs and discussions took  place  between  the  committee  and
stakeholders, as well as with experts from overseas  and  local  experts  on
property rates, ranging from  agriculture,  religion,  welfare  and  public-
sector infrastructure institutions, to name but a few. Nobody can produce  a
perfect Bill, and this Bill is no exception. However, this Bill is not  cast
in stone, I believe, and I think that, as with other Bills,  amendments  can
be looked at in the future.

On a positive side, religious  organisations  received  a  very  sympathetic
from the portfolio committee. Not only is the actual  place  of  worship  of
religious organisations excluded from paying property rates,  but  also  the
official  residence  of  an  appropriate  office-bearer  of  that  religious
community. I can just mention here that for election purposes, the DA  tried
to include Ellis Park, FNB stadium and Newlands as places  of  worship,  but
we were unsuccessful in that regard.  [Laughter.]  Other  organisations  and
institutions were looked at, and I think they  will  be  dealt  with  by  my
colleagues later in this debate.

Die DA het reeds gedurende die bespreking van die wetsontwerp  aangedui  dat
ons  nie  ten  gunste  van   sekere   toegewings,   soos   vervat   in   die
konsepwetgewing wat voor ons dien, is nie.  Derhalwe  kan  die  DA  nie  die
wetsontwerp in sy huidige vorm ten volle steun nie. Die toegewings  aan  die
openbare sektor-instellings, waar 'n korting van 30%  toegestaan  kan  word,
gee in onregverdige  voordeel  aan  dié  instellings  teenoor  andere,  soos
privaatinstellings. Telkom is 'n voorbeeld. Telkom betaal  reeds  nie  enige
vergoeding op die grond waarop hulle  byvoorbeeld  hul  torings  oprig  nie,
maar instellings soos MTN, Vodacom en  al  die  ander  moet  ongelukkig  die
vergoeding betaal. Ons is derhalwe teen dié gedagte gekant. (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The DA has already indicated during the discussion of the Bill that we  are
not in favour of certain concessions as contained in the  draft  legislation
before us. Therefore the DA cannot fully support the  Bill  in  its  current
form. The concessions made to public sector institutions, where a rebate  of
30% can be granted, unjustly benefit these institutions  over  others,  such
as private institutions. Telkom is a case in point. Already  Telkom  doesn't
pay any compensation for the land on which  they  erect  their  towers,  for
example,  but  institutions  such  as  MTN,  Vodacom  and  all  the   others
unfortunately must pay the  compensation.  We  are  therefore  against  this
idea.]
The DA, as well as the agricultural sector, are particularly concerned  with
the problem which may arise in devising a proper definition  of  "bona  fide
farmer". We believe  that  reverting  to  farmers  only,  coupled  with  the
application of, I think, clause 3(2)(a), would be more acceptable.  However,
this request from the DA and the agricultural sector was accepted at  first,
but at a later stage rejected by the  majority  party's  committee  members.
Unfortunately, special treatment in terms of the Bill has consequently  also
excluded game farming as an agricultural activity. It's  mind-boggling,  but
it happened.

The DA disagrees  with  the  prescription  of  rates  based  on  either  the
improved value of the property or a  flat  rate  for  a  property  within  a
specified valuation band. The  DA  believes  in  allowing  municipalities  a
local option with regard to determining the tax base to be  used,  including
the improved capital value, the land and the annual  rental  value.  The  DA
disagrees with the implementation of a flat rate, given  that  it  does  not
encourage the development of a property market in those  categories.  It  is
notoriously difficult to phase this out, but we agree with the proviso  that
when a flat rate is applied, it should only be applied at the lowest end  of
properties valuated.

However, a major concern, hon Minister, apart  from  the  problems  that  we
have with some clauses in the Bill as the DA, is still the  fact  that  many
municipalities  do  not  have  the  capacity,  or  sometimes  the  will,  to
implement a Bill; a problem with many  other  laws  too.  We've  seen  that.
Stakeholders will have to make use of the  necessary  mechanism  built  into
this  Bill  to  safeguard  their  interests.  Therefore,  they  must  become
actively involved in the  activities  of  their  respective  municipalities.
Provision is made for mechanisms such  as  petitions  to  the  MEC  and  the
Minister if they feel that the municipalities have not fully  complied  with
the norms and standards  provided  in  this  Bill.  Therefore,  it  is  very
necessary for them to participate in the ward committees, etc.

Die gebrek  aan  belangstelling  van  die  ander  politieke  partye  in  dié
belangrike wetsontwerp was opvallend. Nie een opposisieparty - ek sê weer  -
nie een, behalwe die DA, het die afgelope maande aan die  proses  deelgeneem
nie. G'n wonder dat die NNP se leier, Van Schalkwyk,  'n  growwe  onwaarheid
oor 'n radioprogram gaan staan en kwytraak het  as  gevolg  van  sy  onkunde
nie, want sy man, Durand, was nie daar nie.

Volgens hom, dis nou Van Schalkwyk, het die NNP daarin geslaag  om  die  ANC
te oorreed om die wet - luister na die woord "wet"  -  op  eiendomsbelasting
"geammendeer" te kry - wat 'n verkragting van Afrikaans in die  eerste  plek
- om die boere, nie boerderygemeenskap nie, teen onnodige  eiendomsbelasting
te vrywaar. Asseblief, mnr Van Schalkwyk, ek hoop u  luister.  Daar  is  nog
nie 'n wet nie, en  ons  is  nog  besig  met  die  konsepwetgewing,  en  ons
debatteer dit eers vandag. So asseblief moenie ... Laat ek  dit  liewer  nie
sê  nie.  As  daar  wel  'n   party   is   wat   werklik   omgee   vir   die
boerderygemeenskap   -   luister,   mnr   Odendaal   ...   [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The lack of interest by the other political parties in this important  Bill
was remarkable. Not a singe opposition party - I repeat -  not  one,  except
the DA, participated in the process during the past few  months.  It  is  no
wonder that the leader of the NNP, Van Schalkwyk, uttered a blatant  untruth
on a radio programme because of his ignorance, because his man, Durand,  had
not been there.

According to him, that is Van Schalkwyk, the  NNP  succeeded  in  convincing
the ANC to have the law - listen to the  word  "law"  -  on  property  rates
"amended" - what a violation of Afrikaans in the first  place  -  to  exempt
the farmers, not the farming community,  from  unnecessary  property  taxes.
Please, Mr Van Schalkwyk, I hope you are listening. There  is  no  law  yet,
and we are still busy with the draft legislation, and we are  only  debating
it today. So please don't ... Let me rather not say it. If there is a  party
that is really concerned about the farming community -  listen  Mr  Odendaal
... [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members!

Mnr G A J GROBLER: ... en die ander organisasies, dan is  dit  die  DA.  Ons

Mr J M NGUBENI: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, municipalities  derive
their powers to levy  property  rates  directly  from  section  229  of  the
Constitution. However, these powers are subject to regulation  in  terms  of
national legislation.

The Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill before  us  today  is  a
perfect instrument that progressively gives effect to  these  constitutional
provisions. The transformed developmental  system  of  local  government  is
geared towards a more efficient and responsive system of governance that  is
transparent, accountable and delivery-orientated.

In addressing the huge challenges faced by  municipalities,  property  rates
represent a  significant  and  a  major  source  of  revenue  that  supports
sustainable municipalities to fulfil  their  priorities  and  constitutional
obligations. It is unavoidable that the current system  of  property  rating
is characterised  by  the  four  different  ordinances  of  the  old  order.
Provinces must be reformed in  order  to  allow  municipalities  to  broaden
their tax base and have a  stable  predictable  revenue  source  within  the
discretionary control of municipal councils.

This Local Government:  Municipal  Property  Rates  Bill  will  bring  about
stability, sustainability, certainty, a uniform rating system  and  promotes
local economic  development.  This  will  enable  us  to  push  further  the
frontiers of poverty and adequately intervene to address the  imbalances  of
the apartheid system.

 Historically,  property  rates  were  levied  differently  in  the  various
provinces. Even today, provinces have their own  systems  of  valuation  and
rating.  Currently,  municipalities  use  different  valuation  and   rating
methods, that is land only or land and land  improvements  at  the  same  or
different rates.

The Local Government: Municipal  Property  Rates  Bill  mandates  a  simpler
uniform rating system in the whole country and  a  general  basic  valuation
that is market-related, that is the amount the property will  have  realised
if sold on the date of valuation in the open market by a willing  seller  to
a willing buyer.

This system of rating is progressive as it will guarantee every category  of
owners of properties to receive the  same  fair  treatment  with  regard  to
their properties.  This  Bill  will  not  necessarily  effect  any  dramatic
increase or decrease, as that is influenced by the normal  regular  property
revaluation and actual rating municipalities set. In fact, there are  checks
and balances that protect all categories of  properties.  For  example,  the
rate  policy  of  the  council,  at  its  formulation,   demands   community
participation and consultation with all stakeholders; the rate  policy  also
takes into account  the  impact  of  rates  on  property  owners;  there  is
limitation  on  levying  of  rates;  constitutionally  impermissible  rates;
limits on annual increases of rates; compulsory phasing in of certain  rates
and representation to the Minister if any sector is adversely affected.

Apart from the checks and  balances  mentioned,  municipalities  will  still
exercise their constitutional  right  to  grant  exemption  or  rebates  and
reductions. Whilst the right to levy property  rates  is  derived  from  the
Constitution, the  Constitution  restrains  municipalities  from  exercising
their fiscal powers in a way that will materially and  reasonably  prejudice
the national economy, economic activities across municipal  boundaries,  the
national mobility of goods, services, capital or labour.

Taking into account this provision of the Constitution  to  demonstrate  the
progressiveness of this Bill, let us pay  special  attention  to  these  two
important categories, that is the  Public  Service  infrastructure  and  the
category of agricultural property. Public Service infrastructure,  according
to the present rating system, was either not rated  in  some  municipalities
and inconsistently rated in others. In this proposed uniform rating  system,
Public Service infrastructure will be subjected to property  rating.  It  is
morally incorrect to rate public schools and hospitals,  for  instance,  and
exclude entities such as power stations or railways.

Public Service infrastructure, such as  public  roads,  water,  dams,  power
stations,   liquid   fuel,   national   railway    systems,    communication
infrastructure and runways at airports are meant to service the  public.  As
you may have noticed, these are very important and critical elements of  our
economy.

This Public Service infrastructure is linked  to  entities  such  as  Eskom,
Telkom, Umgeni Water, Rand Water and the  others,  including  municipal  and
Government entities.

The portfolio committee has for the past  eight  months  engaged  all  these
stakeholders, including organised agriculture. Workshops,  public  hearings,
private and direct meetings were held. In  fact,  representations  continued
until this past Sunday. These extraordinary maximised  engagements  resulted
in a Local Government: Municipal  Property  Rates  Bill  that  has  balanced
concessions. These concessions demonstrate the  commitment  of  the  ANC  to
stabilising and growing this economy. And truly so, as the ANC leads, it  is
obliged to enter into a contract  with  the  people  to  fight  poverty  and
create jobs.

Taking into  account  the  representation  made  by  the  stakeholders,  the
committee agreed to the following: That 30%  of  the  market  value  of  the
publicly controlled Public Service  infrastructure  will  be  excluded  from
rating. The definition of  Public  Service  infrastructure  was  widened  to
include ``additional aspects of  water,  energy,  communications  and  court
infrastructure''. The  Bill  allows  the  Minister  to  prescribe  valuation
methods if the the market value of Public Service infrastructure  cannot  be
determined.

We do not have to forget the role of  these  stakeholders  in  ensuring  the
provision of free basic services such as water, electricity and  sanitation.
The ANC is committed to the provision of free basic services such as  water,
electricity and sanitation. That is the reason we are consciously  excluding
the 30% market value  of  the  Public  Service  infrastructure,  which  will
enable these entities to continue to provide these basic  services.  At  the
same time, we need to ensure that the tariffs from these  entities  are  not
unduly passed to  consumers  because  there  are  checks  and  balances  and
concessions that ensure that undue burden is not placed on them.

It is interesting and ironic  to  note  that  the  DA  is  opposed  to  this
exclusion. The President is correct - the DA wants the democratic  state  to
stop providing such basic goods and  services  to  the  people.  The  DA  is
opposed to this exclusion because  the  recipients  are  largely  the  poor,
black and marginalised. [Interjections.]  Yes,  the  President  is  correct.
What these clowns  want  is  the  faithful  return  to  the  old  system  of
unregulated capitalism. They hide their agenda of reversal  of  change  with
phrases  such  as  ``flexible  market,  free  market,  and   minimal   state
interference''.
Just imagine,  the  so-called  champions  of  unfettered  free  markets  are
opposed  to  the  general  basis  of  valuation  when  it  comes  to   their
properties, which is simply a market value. They hide  their  true  colours,
yet they are simple right-wing conservatives.

Organised agriculture and forestry was concerned that  municipalities  might
impose an undue rates burden on them, as this would affect their  viability.
In addressing this concern raised by this sector, as well  as  the  need  to
broaden the rates base of municipalities, the committee made  the  following
concessions: That municipalities need to take into account  the  effects  of
the rate on the contribution by agriculture; that the Bill  prescribes  that
annual crops and grown timber that have not yet been harvested at  the  time
of valuation must be  disregarded;  that  any  sector  of  the  economy  can
request the Minister to evaluate evidence that the  rate  levied  on  it  by
municipalities  is  materially  and  unreasonably  prejudicing  the  matters
mentioned earlier.

These  are  the  results   of   constructive   engagement   with   organised
agriculture, represented by Agri-SA,  National  African  Farmers  Union,  SA
Allied Workers' Union, Grain-SA and others. The importance  of  this  sector
in food production  cannot  be  overemphasised.  However,  the  agricultural
sector should not pretend to be a generic of do-gooders. They  must  impress
upon their constituency that  farmworkers'  rights  and  wellbeing  are  not
negotiable. Proper housing and health  facilities  are  taken  into  account
when formulating rates policies. This Bill  is  of  mutual  benefit  to  all
stakeholders and municipalities and will ensure a better life for all.

In conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, interestingly,  the  DA  is  explicitly
opposed to a minimum wage for farmworkers. However,  they  were  unashamedly
pestering the committee to give concessions to game farmers.  To  them  game
is more important  than  a  minimum  wage  for  farmworkers.  I  thank  you.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA:  Hon  Madam  Deputy  Speaker  and  hon  members  of  the
National Assembly, when our democratic system of government was  ushered  in
in 1994, there were certain things that the people of South Africa  did  not
anticipate would change negatively in  their  lives,  but  there  were  also
quite a number of expectations.

The people were excited about this freedom they had  achieved.  Some  people
even believed it when they were told that the time for  manna  had  arrived;
some  people  even  thought  that  freedom  would  come  with  free  service
delivery.

Political parties promised a number of things. People were told  that  their
areas would be developed by Government free of charge, especially  those  in
rural areas, the most underdeveloped. They were made  to  believe  that  the
ushering in of wall-to-wall municipalities would put them on par with  urban
areas  in  terms  of  development  and  service  delivery,  and  that  their
Government would be footing the bill for them.

 Now that we are debating this piece of legislation, the cat is out  of  the
bag. If the people in the rural  areas  want  their  areas  developed,  they
themselves will have to foot the bill  by  paying  rates.  This  is  clearly
stated in the memorandum to this Bill, and I quote:


  Property rates represent a major source of revenue for local  government,
  and is  as  such  the  main  source  of  discretionary  tax  revenue  for
  municipalities. Property rates are especially important in  urban  areas,
  and historically rates were levied only in towns and cities. Rating  was,
  historically, done differently in the  various  provinces.  Each  of  the
  former four provinces had their own legislation and their own  system  of
  valuation and rating. As noted in the White Paper on Local Government,  a
  simpler and more uniform system is needed as  part  of  local  government
  reform.

Traditional communities in the past were able to put  their  hands  together
and start a project. That is how schools, clinics and  crèches  were  built.
After completing a particular project, they would stop paying until  another
need for a facility arose. However, now they are going to be paying  forever
should the municipality convince them to pay rates.

This Bill  deals  with  both  urban  and  traditional  areas,  and  this  is
deliberate. We said communal land could not be valued, let alone  at  market
value, which is the basis of the rating system,  because  by  definition  it
could never have a market value since it could never be sold.

The Bill provides that municipalities need not rate properties on  which  it
is impossible to establish the  market  value.  We  also  said  that  rating
communal land would be highly problematic in that it often houses  the  very
poorest of the poor. The idea that they  should  pay  rates  purely  because
they have been granted PTOs on  communal  land  is  absurd,  and  the  Bill,
likewise, addresses this in part by  way  of  an  automatic  R15  000  rates
exemption on the value of property. We support the provision that  this  sum
be adjusted upwards as required.

We objected to the notion that a municipality could  be  compelled  to  rate
communal land. The Bill provides that in terms of the rates  policy  arrived
at by way of a transparent process, a municipality can exempt categories  of
property or of owners from the rates net.

In respect of exemptions, we were not happy with the published  draft  which
made precious little provision for  people  whose  circumstances  were  such
that they were  problematic,  even  though  they  were  owners  of  property
perhaps  worth  a  fair  sum,  such  as  pensioners  or  people  temporarily
unemployed. Indeed, there  were  occasions  on  which  the  department  came
across as callous  and  hardhearted.  We  are  pleased  that  the  Bill,  as
adopted, expresses a more humane vision and trust that  municipalities  will
take heed of the discretion they have in which to craft a fair rates  policy
rather than one which seeks to grab every cent possible.

There are matters which,  in  our  view,  did  not  prevail  in  respect  of
valuation systems. For example, we took issue with the notion that the  only
way  to  rate  property  was  by  way  of  the  market  value  of  land  and
improvements. Copious evidence was  presented  to  us,  none  of  which  was
sufficiently forceful to discount the notion that a variety of  systems  are
equally valid. We would have preferred local or provincial  choice  in  this
matter, but the notion  of  national  uniformity  at  all  costs  prevailed,
unnecessarily, we believe.

In the  final  analysis,  there  are  pros  and  cons  to  most  Bills,  and
compromises are the  order  of  the  day.  Having  weighed  up  our  earlier
objections to the earlier version of  the  Bill  and  comparing  it  to  the
present version, we believe there has been sufficient progress  for  us  now
to support it. I thank you.

Ka 1977 e re: (Translation of Sotho paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S A MSHUDULU: I would like to greet the  hon  Speaker  and  this  House.
Today I would like to speak to the nation more than I  will  speak  to  this
House. Municipalities make  money  through  property  rates.  Municipalities
have the power of determining the rates according to our  Constitution.  The
Constitution prevents municipalities from charging rates  that  are  against
the policies of the country's economy.

In order to deliver the services to all the  people,  and  not  disturb  the
general management, the rates should be paid in the same  way  according  to
the  categories  and  areas  where  our  people  live.  This  Bill  prevents
municipalities from setting rates too high or too low.

This Bill includes those areas and people who were able to pay, but did  not
pay, that is, those who are not poor, like those who are  complaining.  This
Bill compels municipalities to  use  the  same  methods  when  dealing  with
evaluations, appeals  and  complaints,  policy  ratings  and  rate  settings
throughout the country. In the second  chapter,  the  Bill  deals  with  the
powers that municipalities have in setting rates,  especially  according  to
the democracy set in place by the ANC.

We all know that we cannot have rate  policies  without  the  input  of  the
public. Rates are paid according to the market  value.  This,  according  to
the English language, means the amount that one gets when  one  sells  one's
property. It is the amount that shows how much it costs.  The  rates  policy
should be approved by the council after the public has been given  a  chance
to make inputs.

The fixed rates would apply in areas where their  value  is  less  that  R15
000.  The  property  rates  Bill  is  not  being  introduced  to   let   the
municipalities abuse other  areas  or  certain  people.  It  is  also  being
introduced in order that things should be transparent, as well as to  assess
the ability and capacity of  the  municipality  in  dealing  with  financial
issues.

If the municipalities experience problems with people who do  not  pay  even
if they can, and those who  cannot  pay  because  of  unemployment,  certain
methods of exemption will be used for rebates  and  reductions.  Exemptions,
rebates,  and  reductions  should  be  dealt  with  in  a  transparent   and
accessible manner, which also appears on the  budget  of  the  council.  The
council's resolution should be displayed  at  the  municipal  offices  where
everybody can see.

Chapter two also shows methods or ways  of  including,  step-by-step,  those
areas which were not included. This Bill also includes the  ability  of  the
special voting areas, in certain areas that have the capacity, so that  they
can have the necessary supplies. This cannot happen unless  the  communities
are able to take part through the ward committees or their subcommittees.

Chapter 3 shows the importance of the responsibility of the owner in  paying
the rates, whether he or she is there or not. Those who share  the  property
should also take the responsibility. In other areas which  are  divided,  it
will be called a sectional title scheme. It will be necessary that  everyone
pays for his or her unit.

Chapter four shows the valuation roll that includes all the  areas  in  that
municipality. It includes those areas that are supposed to pay  as  well  as
those that are not supposed to pay. It is therefore important that today  we
do not have the valuation because we never had the right  to  own  property,
since those days when our land was taken  from  us.  That  is  why  the  ANC
ensures that we get our dignity back. We therefore  plead  with  the  public
that when the people who value properties come to our  places,  between  7am
and 7pm, they should co-operate with  them.  When  they  come  and  ask  for
documents of proof of ownership, we should be  able  to  help  them.  It  is
important to know that the valuation  roll  will  be  implemented  from  the
beginning  of  the  financial  year  on  the  first  of  July.  It  will  be
implemented for four years. This means that it will be  in  place  for  four
years. It is important to know that throughout these four years, there  will
be a supplementary valuation roll which will be updating  information  every
time a new property is sold or renovated.

Chapter five describes how  property  rates  are  valued,  as  I  have  just
explained. The gentleman who just spoke here said that  the  property  rates
Bill was not necessary in the rural areas, because it is not  necessary  for
properties to be evaluated. However, if it will be necessary for them to  be
evaluated, the 15 000 will be useful.

If we look at Chapter six again, we see how the areas that are  supposed  to
pay, should be  listed  on  the  roll,  as  well  as  the  area  or  owner's
information. When the valuation roll is completed, it should  be  publicised
in the media, in newspapers or on the radio, and everywhere where  everybody
can see that it's completed. If a complaint is lodged - because  this  would
be done so that people can lodge their  complaints  -  the  complainant  can
also appeal.

It also deals with the Valuation Appeals Board. I am  speaking  in  Sesotho,
because  there  are  people  who  were  affected  because   there   was   no
transparency. They are scared to come out. Now the ANC is appealing  to  all
those who have properties to come forward so that their  properties  can  be
evaluated. I would also like to elaborate more  on  what  the  Minister  has
talked about. Which are the properties that are not included?  They  include
churches, places of worship, community organisations, as  well  as  schools.
This also includes those people who got RDP houses  according  to  the  land
reform. Those are the people who, because of the ANC  Government,  have  the
dignity to fight for their rights. However, if things are  not  transparent,
they will not be able to fight for their rights.

Before I conclude, Madam Speaker,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  the
committee has agreed that places of  worship,  like  churches,  as  well  as
residential places for church ministers, should not be expected to  pay.  If
there is still time, I would like to  quote  from  the  ANC  strategies  and
tactics, because they think that the ANC  does  not  have  Christianity.  In
1977 it said:]

The ANC is actually aware that the overwhelming majority of  South  Africans
and, indeed, its own members who adhere to religious beliefs are  people  of
faith who do not practise any faith from this point of view. Indeed,  within
the context of profound moral ethics, empathy towards those in need and  the
human  fellowship  that  most  religions  preach,  the  ANC  recognises  the
critical  role  the  religious  community  can  play   as   a   partner   in
reconstruction and development, nation-building and reconciliation.

We shall continue to promote joint efforts within the sectoral  contribution
by the  religious  community  in  pursuit  of  a  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
democratic society.

Ke boele hape ke kgutlele hae, ho bohlokwa hore  re  tsebe  hore  ho  ya  ho

(Translation of Sotho paragraphs follows.)

[Let me come back home again. It is important to know  that  in  Chapter  8,
under miscellaneous, it explains that while we are awaiting the  passing  of
this Bill, life will still go on for municipalities.

They will use the information that is on the voters' roll  that  they  have.
However, areas that were not  included,  that  still  need  to  be  included
before the passing of this Bill,  will  be  included.  Ultimately,  all  the
apartheid laws will be removed. All the apartheid ordinances will no  longer
function. Amandla! [Power!] [[Applause.]]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Department of  Provincial  and  Local
Government and the parliamentary committee should be commended  on  the  way
in which they engaged with all stakeholders during the  processing  of  this
Bill. The committee has succeeded in finding a balance between the need  for
municipalities to have enough revenue to fulfil their  responsibilities  and
the need to avoid levying rates in a way that harms categories  of  property
owners.

This Bill aims to  introduce  a  uniform  municipal  rating  system  and  to
broaden the rate base. The international trend  for  market  value  of  land
reform and improvements at a uniform rate was followed.

The New NP  is  extremely  pleased  that  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
property  rates  Bill  has  now  been  finalised,   especially   with   some
municipalities  which  impose  levies  on  agricultural  land  without   the
guidelines set out in this Bill. There have been many  grievances  and  some
farmers have taken municipalities to court. The new system  will  be  phased
in through consultation with stakeholders.
Where traditional areas are concerned,  the  Bill  does  not  prescribe  the
levying of rates, but does insist that while municipalities must decide  for
themselves, they cannot rate property that is communally owned or  that  has
not been valued. Land had to be worth more than R15 000 before it  could  be
rated.

The New NP, however, would like to see a move towards  more  land  in  South
Africa being privately owned. Land ownership is the key to economic  wealth.
With regard to organised agriculture, municipalities will have  to  consider
the contribution made by agriculture before levying a rate on  farms.  Crops
on the land would also not be included  in  the  valuation  of  agricultural
land.

The New NP is especially pleased  that  the  beneficiaries  of  land  reform
programmes will be exempt from  paying  rates  for  a  period  of  10  years
following the return of their land.

Local government has come a long way since 1994 when it was  still  racially
defined. The people of South Africa can be proud  of  the  transition  local
government has made in  the  past  10  years.  They  have  moved  from  only
providing a service to the privileged few to  providing  basic  services  to
all  people,  including  the  poor.  Local   government   has   successfully
established new infrastructure in rural areas and maintained  infrastructure
in developed areas. The challenge now is to maintain a healthy balance.

Electricity has been installed  in  rural  areas  where  people  never  have
dreamt of the day when they would be  able  to  turn  on  a  switch  and  be
provided with light. Women no longer have to walk miles  to  get  water  for
their families.

Local government has increased the quality of life  of  many.  Now  all  our
children are able to study at night. The streetlights in  areas  also  serve
as a deterrent to crime as criminals are unable to prey on innocent  victims
in dark alleys.

The Local  Government:  Municipal  Property  Rates  Bill  will  ensure  that
property rates will be charged according to  the  provided  guidelines,  and
home owners and farmers will no longer lose their properties.

Local government must now address  the  culture  of  nonpayment.  Clear  and
understandable accounts must be sent to people to ensure that  there  is  no
miscommunication. Local government must now become the vehicle in  terms  of
which transformation is driven.

The New NP would like to thank the DA  and  Gerald  Morkel  for  setting  an
example of how not to do things. How the DA reigned in the Western  Cape  in
2002 is a good example of how local government should not  be  managed.  The
DA has proven repeatedly that they are incapable of governing.  With  Gerald
on the throne, they awarded hefty bonuses to  top  management,  even  though
the city was scrambling to cut budgets after miscalculating revenue.

The electric fence the DA wanted to erect in Kraaifontein to  separate  poor
black communities from rich communities - the fact was that they  wanted  to
introduce a wall - shows exactly what the DA thinks of  poor  black  people.
[Interjections.] Fortunately, there is no chance of the DA ever coming  into
government. The DA-IFP coalition in  KwaZulu-Natal  is  a  clear  indication
that the DA misses the days of apartheid when a fortunate few benefited  and
the rest lived in poverty.

Let us have a glimpse of what one can  expect  under  the  DA-IFP  coalition
government. It is important that  we  look  at  this  because  South  Africa
deserves better. The KwaZulu-Natal  government  this  year  is  heading  for
overspending of more than R2 billion, about twice the debt that  forced  the
national Government  in  1999  to  step  in  to  take  control  of  the  KZN
administration. [Interjections.] Twice in five  years  -  not  the  sort  of
changes that South Africa deserves.

Can it be coincidental that the finances now, again, are spiralling  out  of
control since the DA joined the IFP, with  its  MEC  for  economic  affairs,
Burrows? It is, after all, the DA administration in Cape Town that  managed,
during their very short term, to move the  city's  finance  from  a  healthy
credit balance to billions in the red. This is not the sort of  change  that
South Africa deserves. [Interjections.]

The MEC for social welfare in KwaZulu-Natal, Prince  Gideon  Zulu,  in  2000
managed to squander over half a million rand on  hotel  bills,  choosing  to
live in luxury in the Royal Hotel, the Beverly Hills and the  Hilton,  while
so many in this province suffer. He spent 107 days of one year in  five-star
luxury hotels. How can that be? South Africa does not deserve that.

Not to be outdone, his colleague, the Rev Mthethwa, MEC  for  public  works,
spent more than R300 000 in six months on  accommodation  at  the  five-star
Royal Hotel. This is not the sort of  change  that  South  Africa  deserves.
[Interjections.] Then, we have the Speaker in  KwaZulu-Natal  who  allegedly
purchased 50 new tyres for his official vehicle in a  space  of  20 000  km.
That is not what South Africa deserves.

Then the DA has the cheek to complain about the presidential jet, but  there
is no problem with  Premier  Matsotsi,  I  mean,  Mtshali.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] He is the only premier with a private jet,  a  lear  jet,  which
ferries him  from  his  house  in  Durban  to  his  offices  in  Ulundi  and
Pietermaritzburg at R12 000 a trip, a cost in  excess  of  R1,5 million  per
year. He also spent more  than  R2,5 million  to  improve  security  at  his
private house. Who is he scared of? This change is the worst. This is not  a
change that South Africa deserves.

And listen to this spendthrift extravagance. In  a  province  with  so  much
poverty, where Aids is out of control, where  infrastructure  is  crumbling,
the IFP-DA coalition is planning to build yet  another  office  complex  for
the premier, with a special conference hall,  at  R80  billion,  and  a  new
plenary chamber for the House of Traditional Leaders. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! There is a point of order.
Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, will you remind  the  speaker  that  he  is
talking on the rates Bill. [Interjections.]

Mr  J  DURAND:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  about  revenue  and   the
redistribution of revenue to supply services. This is what it is all  about.
[Applause.]

... and a new plenary chamber for  the  House  of  Traditional  Leaders  for
another R50 million. This, whilst the former  Ulundi  parliamentary  chamber
is unused. Come on, come on! This is not  the  sort  of  change  that  South
Africa deserves or wants. Yes, South Africa  deserves  better,  better  than
the DA, better than the hon Tony Leon, the evangelist of doom  and  despair.
[Interjections.]

The New NP supports the Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy  Speaker,
fortunately I will now give a boring speech. I have a very  simple  function
which I will gladly fulfil, and that is to express our  thanks  and  support
for this Bill on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Affairs.

We are especially  grateful  that  the  portfolio  committee  had  extensive
consultation with agriculture and land-related bodies. We are very  grateful
for that, because, I think, they sorted out the  problems  and  everyone  is
satisfied now. I am especially referring to clause 3(4) of the  Bill,  which
gives the different categories municipalities must take  into  account  with
respect to agricultural properties or producing properties.

It is very interesting, actually, the way this has been  worded.  The  first
part of it refers to the fact that the municipality must take  into  account
the extent of services provided by  the  municipality  in  respect  of  such
properties. Obviously, if you read it in context it is not the same as  what
in taxation theory is called "taxation according to benefit",  because  that
is relegated to history.

Taxation according to benefit means that a person must pay so much  tax,  or
can be called upon to pay tax, as you would in private enterprises  in  that
you pay according to what you  receive.  That,  of  course,  can't  work  in
modern  times.  It  is  actually  a  thing  which  came  before  the  French
Revolution in the 18th century when the tax-exempt  nobility  and  the  tax-
exempt clergy did not pay any tax, but all the state's resources were  spent
on them. Of course, that is a clear injustice.

I think there is a certain phase  in  which  this  type  of  parity  between
services rendered and taxation or rating is justified. However, it  is  only
at a certain time in history that it can be done,  because  the  moment  you
want to bring in differential taxation of individuals, then you  can't  work
according to the principle  of  taxation  according  to  benefit.  This  is,
obviously, because the  state  is  giving  or  expending  its  resources  on
developmental  purposes.  It  is  made  for  the  general  benefit  and  the
principle leads nowhere at all.

However, I think the way in which it was built into  this  Bill  is  to  the
satisfaction of all. I think the main  effect  of  this  will  be  that  the
farming community will start taking an interest in municipal affairs,  which
is an extremely healthy occurrence. They  must  do  that.  Previously,  they
were used to distance from the dorpies, villages and cities, and it is  only
when  they  really  become  involved   in   municipal   affairs   that   the
developmental functions of municipalities in these rural arrears  will  grow
by leaps and bounds.

Regarding land reform, we are also very satisfied  with  the  provisions  in
the Bill - basically that land reform beneficiaries will  be  excluded  from
paying rates for  the  first  10  years  after  acquiring  property  rights.
Interestingly, I can say, by the way, that if you  look  carefully  at  your
definition of land reform beneficiary - I only saw it today - it might  just
be possible that by accident you have excluded the receivers of land  tenure
reform.

Land tenure reform, in terms of the  Constitution,  is  done  by  virtue  of
section 25(8), and you only exclude sections 25(6)  and  25(7).  So  it  may
just be possible that some of the areas where new  order  rights  are  being
acquired and old order rights in terms of  the  Communal  Land  Rights  Bill
have slipped through here, and I don't think that that is  the  intention  -
that  this  10-year  period  must  also  be  applicable   to   land   reform
beneficiaries of tenure rights, of tenure  reform,  which  is  going  to  be
implemented under the Communal Land  Rights  Bill.  [Interjections.]  No,  I
don't think they slipped up with this. This is a  very  good  Bill  that  we
have here. I have read that some 300 hours of discussion  in  the  portfolio
committee  was  devoted  to  it.  The  way  in  which  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Deputy Speaker, property rights  are  a  taxpayer's
right to ownership and economic freedom. A taxpayer  indirectly  engages  in
the country's economy by creating a market value for his or  her  assets.  A
taxpayer employs his or her socioeconomic rights to  purchase  property  and
improve upon it to gain maximum economic benefits out of such  assets.  Such
engagements in the country's  economy  should  be  an  inalienable  or  non-
negotiable right.

Unfortunately, the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill seeks  to
minimise the taxpayers rights, and impose a property tax that is  skewed  in
relation to property value, even  though  the  Bill  provides  for  property
rates to be determined by  market  value,  since  the  rate  regime  offered
within the Bill  is  actually  an  added  tax  that  will  be  difficult  to
recapture in real economic terms by property owners. Property  rates  should
be levied according to the service rendered by the  Government  and  not  an
enforced tax.

Although the flat rate for property has been deleted from the current  Bill,
uncertainty exists whether market forces will have a free hand  in  property
valuation, since the municipality has been given superior  powers  to  those
in the market to determine what equitable market value ought to mean.

The ACDP feels that the  Bill  will  have  an  adverse  effect  on  property
valuation, as improved value of property will be  taxed  causing  owners  to
disinvest in property development.

The ACDP agrees that municipalities  ought  to  remain  solvent  to  operate
effectively, but  not  at  the  expense  of  overtaxing  its  citizens.  One
principle that is close to the ACDP's  values  is  that  land  and  property
should not be in the control of the state, or  manipulated  in  such  a  way
that it will impoverish or control property owners.

The Bill makes provision that  all  property  owners  will  be  included  in
contributing to municipal revenue; this  includes  rural  areas,  townships,
farms, etc. However, the danger exists that  municipalities  may  enforce  a
tax regime where there will be those who will pay more  taxes  than  others,
which will on the one hand diminish wealth accumulation, and  on  the  other
hand perpetuate the poverty cycle.

The Bill may have its merits in that  municipalities  will  benefit  from  a
broader tax base, but in terms of providing an equitable and  agreeable  tax
structure, the prospects are dim for some property owners.

The ACDP believes that this Bill errs on creating  a  redistributive  regime
that will not contribute to real economic stimulation, and therefore  cannot
support this Bill. I thank you.

Mr A G LYLE: Comrade Deputy Speaker, the Portfolio Committee  on  Provincial
and Local Government has taken note, with dismay, of the  character  of  the
institution of valuers.

The demographics and the gender aspects need to be addressed.  We  urge  the
institution to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  rectify  this  unacceptable
situation.  During  our  interaction  with  the  property  valuers,   as   a
committee, not a single black valuer or a  woman  valuer  was  present.  The
current situation is hopelessly skewed. The truth  of  the  matter  is  that
this situation does not answer the call of our democratic  revolution.  This
is a challenge to the institution. They  must  move  in  tandem  with  other
progressive institutions and sectors in this country. There are hundreds  of
black estate agents that could be brought into the fold.

To the institution we say, the ball is in your  court.  This  committee,  as
mandated  to  exercise  its  oversight  role,  will  certainly  review   the
situation in the near future.

In the past, each of the former four provinces  had  their  own  legislation
and system of valuation and rating. The system was extremely cumbersome  for
establishing valuation rolls. This Bill addresses these differentiations  by
introducing a more uniform and simple system. In terms of the  new  process,
a municipality intending to levy a rate  on  property  must,  in  accordance
with this piece of legislation, cause a general  valuation.  All  properties
must be valuated.

Each municipality must appoint  a  municipal  valuer,  who  will  value  all
rateable properties in the municipality and prepare a  valuation  roll.  Two
or more municipalities may  by  agreement  appoint  the  same  person  as  a
municipal valuer. A person who is not a municipal official may be  appointed
as a municipal valuer only through  an  open,  competitive  and  transparent
process.

Chapter 11  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act
outlines this process. The municipal manager may designate officials of  the
municipality or persons in private practice as assistant  municipal  valuers
to assist the valuer of the municipality. A municipal valuer may  not  be  a
councillor of the  designating  municipality,  if  that  municipality  is  a
metropolitan  or  district  municipality,  or  of  either  the   designating
municipality or the district municipality in which that municipality  falls,
if the designating municipality is a local municipality.

A municipal valuer, or  assistant  municipal  valuer,  must  disclose  to  a
municipality any personal or private business interests that the  valuer  or
any spouse, parent, child, partner or business associates of the valuer  may
have in any property in the municipality and may not use  the  position  for
private gain or improperly benefit another person.

A municipal valuer or assistant municipal  valuer  may  require  the  owner,
tenant or occupier of a property which the valuer must value, or  the  agent
of the owner, to give the valuer access to any document  or  information  in
possession of  the  owner,  tenant,  occupier  or  agent  which  the  valuer
reasonably requires for purposes of valuing the property.

Chapter 5 of the Bill provides for the criteria  under  which  the  property
must be valued. The property must be valued according to its  market  value,
that is, the amount the property would realise if sold in  the  open  market
by a willing seller or  willing  buyer.  In  the  case  of  sectional  title
schemes, each sectional title unit must be separately valued.
Chapter 6 regulates the contents and processing of the valuation  rolls.  It
requires all rateable property to be  listed  on  the  roll,  together  with
relevant details about each property and the owner.

Upon completion of the valuation roll, the municipal manager must within  21
days publish in the prescribed form in the provincial Gazette,  and  once  a
week for two consecutive weeks advertise in the  media  a  notice  that  the
roll is open for public inspection, and that any person who wishes to  lodge
an objection against any entry in  the  roll  may  do  so  within  a  stated
period.

If an adjustment in the valuation of a property is more than 10% upwards  or
downwards, the matter must be referred to the  valuation  appeal  board  for
review. The lodging of an objection does not defer liability for payment  of
rates.

However, if an adjustment to the  valuation  roll,  following  a  successful
objection, affects the amount  of  the  rates  payable  by  the  owner,  the
municipal manager must calculate the difference and either repay or  recover
the difference from the owner.

The municipal valuer's decision on any objection is not final.  An  objector
who is not satisfied with the decision may appeal against  the  decision  to
the valuation board. The municipal manager must assist an objector to  lodge
an objection if that objector is unable to read or write.

In conclusion, Comrade Deputy Speaker, our committee would  want  to  see  a
situation in which property valuers, and  the  public  at  large,  own  this
piece of legislation.

It is an instrument that will be  used  to  introduce  positive  changes  in
property  valuations  and  fundamentally  transform  the  manner  in   which
municipalities apply their rates policy. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker, the UDM has  the  following  concerns
to place on record with regard to this Bill.
This Bill will increase the burden on poor people by introducing a new  form
of taxation. Groups who will be especially hard hit will be the  rural  poor
and the agricultural sector.

There is currently no universally accepted land tenure  system.  Many  areas
have little or no services, and charging rates in  a  community  where  vast
numbers still share a single tap would be supremely unfair. Similarly,  many
of these areas that will now suddenly  be  liable  for  this  new  tax  have
little by way of even the most basic infrastructure such as access roads.

Many local governments have become notorious for their lack of  capacity  to
administer their existing systems. How will they cope with the  massive  new
task of implementing this system, and extending it into  more  remote  rural
areas and congested squatter camps?

For the commercial farmer this new tax poses a significant threat  to  their
livelihoods, and to the livelihoods of the thousands of people they  employ.
Commercial farmers have to compete,  as  it  is,  in  international  markets
against heavily subsidised foreign farmers. More  taxation  could  therefore
have catastrophic effects.

The UDM believes that the issue of property rates is far too complex  to  be
sufficiently addressed by the Bill in its current format. We propose that  a
commission be established to investigate all the complexities before  a  new
Bill is drafted. I thank you.

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Speaker, vir 80 jaar lank word erfeienaars van  dorpe  en
stede belas deur munisipaliteite. Die wet bepaal  dat  eiendomwaardasie  die
basis van erfbelasting vorm.

Ons vra waarom moet die woonerfeienaar bydra tot die  diens  en  fasiliteite
wat almal in die metro, die dorp of die  stad  benut.  Waarom  moet  hierdie
erfeienaars, wat dikwels pensioenarisse is, betaal vir die ontwikkeling  van
'n dorp of stad se woonbuurte, parke, sportfasiliteite en paaie,  terwyl  'n
groot aantal inwoners wat dit gebruik nie bydra nie, bloot omdat  hulle  nie
eiendom  daar  besit  nie?  Die  President  en  al  die   ministers   betaal
byvoorbeeld nie eiendomsbelasting in Kaapstad of in Pretoria nie.

Die FA het voorgestel dat die Regering  'n  gedeelte  van  inkomstebelasting
oormerk en oorbetaal aan plaaslike owerhede  en  wegdoen  met  erfbelasting.
Dit sal meebring  dat  alle  verbruikers  van  alle  plaaslike  owerhede  se
dienste en  fasiliteite  bydra  tot  die  totstandkoming  en  benutting  van
daardie  dienste  en  fasiliteite.  (Translations  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follow.)

[Mr J P I BLANCÉ: Speaker, for 80 years property owners of towns and  cities
have  been  taxed  by  municipalities.  The  law  stipulates  that  property
valuations form the basis of property rates.

We are asking why the property owner should contribute to the  services  and
facilities that are used by everyone in the metro, town or city. Why  should
these property owners, who are often pensioners, pay for development of  the
town or city's residential areas,  parks,  sporting  facilities  and  roads,
while a great many residents use it do not contribute, simply  because  they
do not own any property there? For example, neither the  President  nor  any
of the Ministers pay property taxes in Cape Town or Pretoria.

The FA suggested that the Government earmarks a portion of the  income  tax,
pays that over to the local authorities and does away with  property  rates.
This will ensure that all consumers of all local authorities'  services  and
facilities contribute to the establishment and use  of  those  services  and
facilities.]

That means that we tax all the users of municipal  services,  not  only  the
property owners. Madam Speaker, that is  fair  in  a  democracy.  That  will
ensure that taxi owners contribute to the road,  the  taxi  rank  and  other
facilities they use. So  will  migratory  labour,  especially  foreign  mine
workers, contribute to the facilities of a town or a city - think of  Welkom
and other cities. Even the employees of Correctional Services  and  military
bases will then, through their taxes, contribute towards the  city  and  the
town treasury where they are employed, which they presently do not.

Ons  wil  die  Regering  oorreed  om  weg  te  beweeg  van   hierdie   soort
gronddiskriminasie  teen  die  grondeienaars.  Ons  wil  hulle  oorreed   om
Ministers te laat betaal. Ons wil dit ook  wegvat  van  die  grondwaardasie,
want dit kos oneindig baie om grond te  laat  waardeer  terwyl  ons  met  'n
toegewyde belasting vanaf die  inkomstebelasting  dit  makliker  kon  gedoen
het. Maar nee, die ANC het geglo hulle sal voortgaan op die  ou  paaie.  [We
want to persuade the  Government  to  move  away  from  this  form  of  land
discrimination against landowners. We want to  persuade  them  to  make  the
Ministers pay. We also want to remove it from property  evaluation,  because
it is infinitely expensive to have land valued while we could do it so  much
more easily with a dedicated tax from  the  income  tax.  But  no,  the  ANC
believed that they would continue along the old ways.]

Madam Speaker, my party will vote against this Bill.

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members  in  the  House  and
Ministers present, part of the statement made by the NEC of the ANC  on  its
92nd anniversary on 8 January 2004 reads thus:


  During the first decade of freedom, we paid close attention to  the  task
  of ensuring that we transform a declining  economy  encumbered  by  wrong
  policies and practices of the apartheid years. At the same time  we  also
  made certain that we transform public finances to facilitate the  further
  growth of the economy and its capacity to generate the resources we  need
  to fight poverty and work to meet the needs of the people.

Indeed, people are on track. Mosito o tswela pele. [Life goes on.] With  the
introduction of the new legislation in the form  of  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Property Rates Bill, there will always be  a  need  for  capacity-
building. This challenge is not only that of the department and  Salga,  but
there is a need that everyone of us here be involved. Everyone  of  us  here
should participate in this process.

The Bill provides for  a  three-year  phase-in  period  for  newly  rateable
properties. It also requires each municipality to adopt and annually  review
its rates policy in consultation with the local  community.  When  designing
the public participation process, it is required that attention be  paid  to
disadvantaged groups like women.

The new rates regime also includes appropriate  measures  to  alleviate  the
rates burden on poor households; it should also be a tool to promote  local,
social and economic development. This is made possible by section  15(2)  of
the Bill  that  grants  exemptions,  rebates  or  reductions  to  owners  of
properties such as indigent owners, owners dependent on pensions  or  social
grants, owners temporarily without income, and owners of  property  situated
within an area affected by disaster.

This legislation requires the municipalities, the department  and  Salga  to
play an active role and dedicate considerable time and effort  to  both  the
process of valuation and, just as importantly, to  developing  a  policy  in
partnership with the residents in terms of which rates will be levied.

This envisaged system of rating is perhaps the most important  strategy  for
local economic  management,  and  its  implementation  will  guarantee  that
municipalities conform to a single approach to  property  rates.  This  will
make it possible to determine the fiscal capacity of municipalities.

[Among other things, countrymen, let us  take  note  of  the  following,  in
terms of which  the  department  and  Salga  will  investigate  whether  our
municipalities, which are not on the same level, are on the right  track  in
taking our people forward to their new future.

Some of the things we have to bear in mind are  taking  care  of  the  poor,
taxing the rich appropriately; paying attention to  what  complainants  have
to say; making it easier for the youth to be rated for three  years;  rating
the youth's goods or property; and giving each municipality  the  powers  to
take decisions on how to tax people and review that every year.

Nobody will be forced to do anything. We are  in  a  democratic  Government.
Life goes on. The people are also given an opportunity to take part in  this
evaluation. Countrymen, nobody is being forced to do anything.  At  the  end
of the day, the objective of this Bill is to bring  about  developments  and
to improve the economy.

 There is no discrimination. There is no oppression. The  aim  is  to  steer
the preparations for a new future in the right direction. Now is  the  time!
Now is the time! Farewell, my countrymen.]
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr W P DOMAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, one Oscar Ameringer said:


  Politics is the gentle art of getting votes from the  poor  and  campaign
  funds from the rich, by promising to protect each from the other.

This is exactly what this Bill does. Take,  for  example,  the  stakeholders
from welfare organisations and independent schools who made  representation,
with strong arguments, for exclusion from paying property rates.

The committee's response  was  to  find  a  balance  between  the  need  for
municipalities to have adequate revenue  to  fulfil  their  constitutionally
mandated developmental responsibilities and the need to avoid levying  rates
in a way that will debilitate these categories of property owners  who  also
play an invaluable developmental role.

So it must be true what somebody said:
  A politician is an animal who can sit on a fence and yet keep  both  ears
  to the ground.

The ANC members would pride themselves on the saying:


  There are two sides to every question and a good politician takes both.

We in the DA would rather advocate what William Gaylin said:


  The translation of values into public policy is what politics is about.

Daarom sou die DA wou sien dat privaatskole, waarvan die totale  leerlingtal
al 58% swart  leerlinge  is,  vrygestel  moet  wees  van  eiendomsbelasting.
Staatskole se eiendomsbelasting word deur  die  staat  betaal.  Privaatskole
bestaan beslis nie om wins te maak nie, maar moet hulle boeke  balanseer  in
die proses om gehalte onderwys te verskaf. Ouers by  privaatskole  dra  deur
hulle belasting by tot staatskole en sal nou nog die  eiendomsbelasting  ook
moet betaal  terwyl  hulle  alreeds  ekstra  betaal  vir  privaatskole.  Die
Regering behoort waardering vir hulle bydrae tot onderwys te toon.

In dieselfde asem is dit teleurstellend  dat  welsynsorganisasies,  wat  ter
wille van die gemeenskap 'n ekstra myl loop, ook  nie  uitgesluit  word  van
eiendomsbelasting nie. Dit is immers die  publiek  wat  bo  en  behalwe  hul
persoonlike inkomste-, eiendoms- en  ander  belasting  'n  bydrae  maak  tot
welsyn van die gemeenskap waar die staat tekort skiet.

Die DA wil 'n beroep op munisipaliteite doen om hulle goeie oordeel  toe  te
pas en hierdie twee kategorieë tegemoet te kom.

Die DA verwelkom die vrystelling van ten minste die eerste R15 000  van  die
waardasie om arm huiseienaars tegemoet te kom. Gegewe die behuisingsnood  in
Suid-Afrika, en die wyse waarop die Regering aan arm mense huise  gee,  maak
dit nie sin dat sulke  mense,  dikwels  werkloses,  die  volgende  dag  weer
uitgesit word omdat hulle nie eiendomsbelasting kan betaal nie.

In plaas van om 'n bedrag te noem, sou 'n koppeling aan die bedrag  van  die
behuisingsubsidie beter gewees het. In hierdie  verband  het  Kaapstad  twee
jaar gelede onder DA-bewind  die  leiding  geneem  in  Suid-Afrika,  en  die
vrystelling op die eerste R50 000 van 'n waardasie gemaak.

Dit wys net weer: die DA gee om vir  arm  mense.[Tussenwerpsels.]   En  deur
goeie bestuur is dit altyd die DA-munisipaliteite wat werklik iets  vir  arm
mense doen. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[For this reason the DA would have liked to see that private schools,  where
the total number of Black pupils already amounts to 58%, should be  exempted
from property rates. The property rates of state schools  are  paid  by  the
State. Private schools definitely do not exist to make a  profit,  but  must
balance their books while providing quality education.  At  private  schools
parents contribute to state schools by way of  their  rates,  and  will  now
have to pay the property rates as well while they are already  paying  extra
for private schools. The Government should show its appreciation  for  their
contribution to education.

In the same breath, it is  disappointing  that  welfare  organisations,  who
walk the extra mile for the sake of the community,  are  not  exempted  from
property rates as well. It is, after all, the public  who,  over  and  above
their  personal  income  tax,  property  rates  and  other  taxes,  makes  a
contribution to the welfare of the community where the State falls short.

The DA wants to appeal to municipalities to apply their sound judgement  and
strike a compromise with these two categories.

The DA welcomes the  exemption  of  at  least  the  first  R15  000  of  the
evaluation to accommodate poor home-owners. Given the  housing  scarcity  in
South Africa, and the way in which  the  Government  gives  houses  to  poor
people, it does not  make  sense  that  people  such  as  these,  often  the
unemployed, are being evicted again the next day  because  they  cannot  pay
property rates.

Instead of mentioning an amount, linking this to the amount of  the  housing
subsidy would have been better. In this  regard  Cape  Town,  under  the  DA
administration, took the lead in South Africa two years  ago  and  made  the
exemption on the first R50 000 of an evaluation.

This only goes to show again: The DA cares for  the  poor.  [Interjections.]
And through good governance it is always the DA municipalities which  really
do something for the poor. [Applause.]]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Deputy Speaker, Mr Doman says that  the  DA  cares  for  our
poor. That is far from  the  truth.  As  far  as  the  Western  Province  is
concerned, they did absolutely  nothing.  Mr  Grobler  complains  about  the
hours we spent on the Bill, but more than half of the 330 hours  were  spent
in negotiations with stakeholders, including the constituency of the DA.

They came to the ANC with their problems. They know that Mr Grobler and  the
DA are powerless. From Mr Grobler, all we heard  were  complaints  and  even
more  complaints.  He  complained  that  we  were  going  too  fast  and  he
complained that we were going too slow. Sometimes he complained about  both.
Mr Grobler, you cannot have your cake and eat it!

The DA supports the land value and flat rate, and not land  improvements  as
envisaged in this Bill, for the simple reason that the former  valuation  is
going to cost them less in terms of  rates  payable,  because  they  do  not
support delivery to the townships, and still they say they support the  poor
people. The DA might  be  liberal  in  their  outlook,  but  they  are  very
conservative in their actions. [Applause.]

The hon Southgate says that property rates minimise the  rights  of  people.
This is far from the truth. I am sorry to say that the hon member  does  not
know what she is talking about. The  Bill  makes  provision  for  people  to
exercise their rights. This Bill, on the contrary, will bring about  a  just
and equitable rating system in South Africa. She also  says  that  the  Bill
will perpetuate the poverty cycle. The hon member hardly attended  committee
meetings and she is misleading the House. Rates, for one, will not  be  paid
in rural and traditional areas.

We believe that there is wide agreement  on  this  Bill,  which  is  a  very
balanced one indeed. Should anyone be discontented with this final  product,
and we believe there are those, then they would be the people  who  want  to
see a free market system in place, but who  detest  market  value  on  their
property for valuation purposes. So, in short, they do not want to  pay  the
applicable rates due by them. What they do want is land value on a  property
and thus paying less in terms of rates. So what we make of it is  that  they
do not want to see municipalities forging  ahead  with  their  programme  of
delivery,   with   this   much-needed   revenue   generated   through    the
implementation of this piece of legislation. The fact of the matter is  that
without this important source of revenue, the IDP is going to remain a  wish
list for most municipalities.

It therefore goes without saying that revenue generated  from  the  affluent
communities will be utilised for services in the poorer areas. There  is  no
other way in which we can eradicate the inequalities in society. The  system
allows for cross-subsidisation between wealthy and  poor  areas,  so  as  to
build stable communities as well as redress past imbalances. The tables  are
now turned. The days when Grassy Park and Mitchell's Plain had to  subsidise
those residing on the Atlantic Seaboard are past. We now have entered a  new
era, where people must pay whatever is  due  by  them.  There  are  ways  of
lodging objections and appeals to be heard, but South Africa  now  needs  to
move to another level of  development  in  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. That is the right thing to do, and  now  is  the  time  to  do  it.
[Applause.]
For those, like Mr Madikiza, who was saying  that  property  rates  will  be
levied on traditional authority areas, we are saying  that  is  "illogically
inexact". The portfolio  committee,  for  a  number  of  reasons,  does  not
believe that the levying of property rates in  traditional  authority  areas
will be on the agenda for a long time to come. The Bill is very specific  on
the  effect  of  rates  on  the  poor  and   on   charitable   and   welfare
organisations, and therefore  requires  the  municipality  to  quantify  the
costs and  benefits  of  all  exemptions,  rebates  and  reductions  to  the
municipality.

An important objective of the Bill is to shift the  rates  burden  from  the
poor,  taking  into  account  the  effect  of  rates   on   public   service
infrastructure, and for  the  municipality  to  promote  local,  social  and
economic development.

Properties will first have to be valued by the municipalities  before  rates
will  become  applicable,  and  this  is  not  going  to  happen  overnight.
Municipalities need to capacitate themselves as to what the Bill is  saying.
They will have four years to do  their  valuation  rolls  as  a  first  step
towards generating revenue through property rates.

In the event of property owners being dissatisfied  with  the  valuation  of
their property, they can first of all raise objections  with  the  municipal
valuer, and should they not succeed, they then have access to the  Valuation
Appeal  Board  which  is  specifically  established  to  hear  appeals  from
disgruntled owners. The board  will  no  doubt  be  sympathetic  to  appeals
lodged with them, and will do everything in  their  power  to  give  a  just
hearing and endeavour to make a fair judgment in each  case  brought  before
it.

The board will consist of people who have the necessary  expertise  to  hear
appeals. The  chairperson,  for  instance,  must  be  a  person  with  legal
qualifications and sufficient experience in the administration  of  justice.
He will be assisted by two to four other members with  sufficient  knowledge
of/or experience in the valuation of property.

The conduct of members makes it clear that they must  perform  their  duties
in office in good faith and without fear or prejudice. Their functions  will
be to hear and decide appeals against the decision of the  municipal  valuer
concerning the objections and to review decisions of a municipal valuer.
Once the appeal board has reached a decision on  an  appeal  brought  before
it, the chairperson of an appeal board and the valuer  of  the  municipality
must ensure that the valuation roll is adjusted or added  to  in  accordance
with the decision taken by the board.

If an adjustment in the valuation of a property ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Rev A D GOOSEN: Thank you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  We  support  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,
allow me once more to thank all the hon  members  who  participated  in  the
work of the portfolio committee, the work that has brought us to  the  point
at which  we  are  today;  and  also  to  thank  all  the  hon  members  who
participated in the debate, amongst whom were the hon  Mr  Grobler  and  the
hon Mr Doman.

Mr Grobler had the privilege to participate in the  work  of  the  portfolio
committee and, indeed, his impressive grasp of the provisions  of  the  Bill
attest to this. He, unfortunately, failed to convince his  own  party  about
the merits that are inherent in the Bill which explains why the DA,  in  his
own words, has decided not to support the Bill. [Interjections.]

The hon Mr Doman gave us a queer definition of a  politician  which  happens
to be an apt description of his fellow DA member, the hon Mr Grobler.  Quite
clearly, Mr Grobler and Mr Doman deserve each other. [Applause.]

The hon Inkosi Hlengwa spent a bit of time giving us his own  interpretation
of the provisions of this Bill. What he betrayed was the fact  that  he  did
not have the benefit of exposure to the work  of  the  portfolio  committee.
Perhaps he needs to take advantage of the emerging alliance for  change  and
try to spend a bit of time with the hon Mr Grobler. That will  help  him  to
justify the support which his party is giving to  the  Bill.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

                  SOUTH AFRICAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  the
Department of Home Affairs has,  in  its  attempts  to  realign  legislation
under  its  administration  with  the  Constitution,  identified  the  South
African Citizenship Amendment Bill as one of those pieces of legislation  to
be brought into line with the Bill of Rights and also the democratic  values
of human dignity, equality and freedom enshrined in our Constitution.

The provisions of section 9(1) of  the  South  African  Citizenship  Act  of
1995, as amended by the South African Citizenship  Amendment  Act  of  1997,
conflict with section 20 of the Constitution, which stipulates that  no  one
may be deprived of his or her citizenship.  Furthermore,  this  section  can
hardly be justified in terms  of  section  35  of  the  Constitution,  which
stipulates the limitation of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights.

The South African Citizenship Amendment Bill therefore seeks  to  bring  the
South African Citizenship Act of  1995  in  line  with  section  20  of  the
Constitution as far as dual citizenship is concerned.

It repeals the provision that allowed the Minister to deprive a  citizen  of
his or her citizenship for having used the  travel  document  of  a  foreign
country to enter or depart from the Republic, or to enter or depart  from  a
country that issued such passport or any other third country.

This  provision  was  also  problematic  in   that   it   called   for   the
extraterritorial application of South African law.  In  fact,  in  terms  of
such provision, a South African citizen, who is also a  citizen  of  another
country, stands to be deprived of his or her South African citizenship  even
if he or she uses his or her foreign passport to enter or  depart  from  the
foreign country which issued it  or  to  enter  or  depart  from  any  third
country.

The problematic nature of this provision was  not  mitigated  by  the  power
which until now vested in the Minister to issue authorisations  to  citizens
with dual citizenship to use their passport abroad as until now set  out  in
section 9(2) of the South African Citizenship Act.

In terms of such  provisions,  such  exemptions  can  only  be  given  under
"exceptional circumstances". In fact, to obviate  the  difficulties  arising
out  of  this  application,  we  were  forced  to  issue   such   exceptions
effectively to anyone who applied for  it.  Such  exemptions  expire  on  an
annual basis in November.

In the past they have been renewed amidst great  distress  on  the  part  of
holders of dual passports, many of  whom  use  their  foreign  passports  to
enter foreign countries to avoid the need of visa  requirements  imposed  on
South Africans.

The intention was  always  that  of  punishing  citizens  who  used  foreign
passports to enter or depart from the Republic of South  Africa  or  act  as
non-citizens while they  are  within  South  Africa.  Therefore,  the  South
African Citizenship Second Amendment Bill makes provisions for such  conduct
to be severely punished by imprisonment.

I do not believe that it would be  constitutionally  permissible  to  punish
such violation of law with the deprivation of citizenship, which  is  not  a
sanction which attaches to any other crime.  It  is  also  not  possible  to
construe the use of a  foreign  passport  facility  in  the  Republic  as  a
voluntary relinquishment of South African citizenship.

This Bill will punish those of our citizens who,  in  their  relations  with
the South African state, act as if they were foreigners,  while  creating  a
rational and comfortable regulation of the situation of  those  who  hold  a
dual citizenship, consistent with the  fact  that  throughout  our  history,
dual citizenship has been recognised and protected.

The Bill therefore introduces the following provisions: Clause  1  seeks  to
repeal section 9 of the South African  Citizenship  Act,  Act  88  of  1995.
Clause 2 provides for the insertion of section 26B,  after  section  26A  in
the South African Citizenship Act, Act 88 of 1995. It will provide  for  the
imposition of penalties on citizens using a foreign  passport  to  enter  or
depart from the Republic or for utilising his  or  her  foreign  citizenship
while in the Republic in a fraudulent manner.  Clause  3  provides  for  the
short title of the Bill being the South African Citizenship Amendment Bill.
Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge that  this  House  accepts  the  South  African
Citizenship Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Thank you very  much,  Chairperson.  Minister,  hon  members,
comrades and friends, the South African Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks  to
bring the South African Citizenship Act of 1995 in line with section  20  of
the Constitution as far as  dual  citizenship  is  concerned.  It  seeks  to
repeal the provision which allowed  the  Minister  to  deprive  citizens  of
their rights for having used the citizenship of a foreign country  to  enter
or depart from the Republic, or to enter or depart from  the  country  which
issued such passport or any other third  country.  The  Bill  replaces  that
provision with one which imposes penalties on  a  citizen  using  a  foreign
passport to enter or depart from the Republic or utilising his  or  her  own
foreign citizenship while in the Republic to gain an advantage  or  avoid  a
responsibility or duty.

South Africa is one of the few countries in the world  that  tolerates  dual
citizenship. Dual citizenship is a phenomenon that stems  from  the  initial
citizenship regime that existed  in  a  number  of  states  in  the  British
Commonwealth.  Apart  from  South  Africa,   the   situation   has   changed
dramatically  after  those  member  states  became  independent.  Today  the
citizenship legislation of these states, including the UK do not allow  dual
citizenship. It is only in South Africa where dual citizenship is allowed.

Nevertheless, the Bill that is before  us  today  addresses  those  problems
that the department is not able to deal with and that they  are  faced  with
on a day-to-day basis. When people enter the  country,  or  even  when  they
leave the country, the department is unable to accurately record the  number
of people who are in the country and the number of people  who  are  leaving
the country. This problem is much more common with regard to people who  are
travelling overseas.

One of the problems that the department has encountered  and  which  we  are
trying to address on a day-to-day basis is the provision of ID documents  to
citizens of the country. What we found is that a number  of  South  Africans
who are still not in possession of the green bar-coded ID books  are  living
overseas.  When  they  travel  to  South  Africa  they  mostly  use  foreign
passports to enter the country. I think this is one of the  areas  in  which
the  department  should  immediately  begin  with  a  campaign,  namely   to
encourage those South Africans who  are  overseas  to  start  to  apply  for
proper South African citizenship, which is  the  green  bar-coded  ID  book.
It's one challenge that I think this Bill is seeking  to  address.  This  is
the challenge that we need to begin to address;  those  South  Africans  who
don't have proper ID books.

Furthermore, one of the problems that we are faced with is  that,  even  now
during the elections that we are going into, most  of  the  South  Africans,
some of whom reside in the country, who don't have green bar-coded ID  books
- I think there are even some of them in the DA - happen to be  white  South
Africans. Most of them are white South  Africans  who  were  not  registered
like Africans were when they applied for their ID books. Their  fingerprints
were not taken. White people's fingerprints were not taken; it's only  black
people whose fingerprints were taken.

So, as we address this issue, it's a challenge that the department needs  to
start a campaign again to assist these hon members on this side here to  get
the green bar-coded ID book. On that note, Minister,  thank  you  very  much
for this short piece of legislation. [Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Agb Voorsitter, dis nou baie duidelik dat ons  voorsitter
van die portefeuljekomitee daarvan hou om twak  te  praat  as  hy  hier  kom
staan. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil graag vir u sê dat dit vir my  aangenaam  is
om aan hierdie debat deel  te  neem.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS:  Hon  Chairperson,  it  is  now  very  evident  that  our
chairperson of the portfolio  committee  enjoys  talking  nonsense  when  he
stands here. [Interjections.] I would like to say to you that I  am  pleased
to participate in this debate.]

The hon Minister explained at length why we  should  support  this  amending
Bill. The Bill which we are debating today seeks to  amend  the  Citizenship
Act of 1995 so as to repeal an  existing  provision,  namely  to  deprive  a
South African of his or her citizenship if such a person uses a passport  of
a foreign country to enter or depart from the Republic of South Africa.

I would like to emphasise the following, namely  that  it  only  applies  to
South Africans who may have dual citizenship. The DA, as I've  said  in  the
beginning, supports the amendment because  it  brings  our  Citizenship  Act
into line with section 20 of our Constitution.

'n  Land  se  burgerskap  bring  regte  en  verpligtings   mee.   Die   mees
fundamentele reg waaroor 'n mens beskik, is natuurlik  die  reg  om  te  kan
stem. Burgerskap bring ook verpligtings mee, en die Minister  van  Finansies
het gister in  die  Raad  inderdaad  'n  bevel,  as  ek  dit  so  mag  noem,
uitgevaardig waarvolgens alle belastingbetalers gedurende die volgende  jaar
sekere verhoogde belastings sal moet betaal.

Die reg om te kan stem, soos ek reeds gesê het, is 'n  fundamentele  reg  en
ek hoop van harte dat die kiesers hulle met die verkiesing op  Woensdag,  14
April in groot getalle by die DA sal skaar. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit  is  veral
in die Wes-Kaap waar ek 'n spesiale beroep op die kiesers wil doen en  hulle
versoek om die opportunistiese en rigtinglose Nuwe NP en die onbevoegde  ANC
in die provinsie te verwerp. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Voorlopige werwingsyfers dui daarop dat die kiesers van die Wes-Kaap die  DA
in groot getalle gaan steun. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die DA staan  'n  baie  goeie
kans om die provinsie weer terug te wen.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Daarom  sê  ek:
gee die DA 'n  kans  om  die  provinsie  te  regeer.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die
kiesers verdien 'n beter regering  in  die  Wes-Kaap.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek
dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Citizenship  of  a  country  entails  rights  and  obligations.  The   most
fundamental  right  which  one  has  is,  of  course,  the  right  to  vote.
Citizenship also entails obligations, and the Minister of  Finance  actually
issued an order, if I may call it that, in  the  Council  yesterday  whereby
all taxpayers will have to pay certain increased  taxes  in  the  course  of
next year.

The right to vote, as I have  indicated,  is  a  fundamental  right,  and  I
sincerely hope that with the election on Wednesday, 14  April,  voters  will
join the ranks of the DA in great numbers. [Interjections.] I want  to  make
a special appeal to voters, particularly in the Western Cape, and  ask  them
to reject the opportunistic and directionless New  NP  and  the  incompetent
ANC in the province. [Interjections.]

Provisional recruitment figures indicate that  the  voters  of  the  Western
Cape are going to support the DA  in  great  numbers.  [Interjections.]  The
odds are greatly in favour of  the  DA  winning  the  province  back  again.
[Interjections.] Therefore I am  saying:  give  the  DA  an  opportunity  to
govern  the  province.  [Interjections.]  The  voters   deserve   a   better
government in the Western Cape. [Interjections.] I thank you.]

Mrs I MARS: Deputy Speaker,  hon  Minister,  and  colleagues,  in  terms  of
actual words, this amendment to the 1995 South African Citizenship  Bill  is
very small indeed. However, these very few words  are  of  significance,  as
they amend the current Bill in terms  of  constitutional  requirements.  The
current South African Citizenship Bill permits the Minister  to  revoke  the
South African citizenship of a person involved  in  unauthorised  use  of  a
foreign passport.

Madam Speaker ... Oh, I'm sorry,  Deputy  Chair,  we  are  aware  that  many
states throughout the world do  not  allow  dual  citizenship.  However,  as
South Africa has chosen to permit  such  dual  citizenship,  this  amendment
seeks to clarify the conditions under which a person can make  use  of  dual
citizenship, in other  words,  a  second  passport  and,  more  importantly,
defines the sanctions that can be imposed if such a person uses  the  second
passport to leave and re-enter the Republic of South Africa. Such  sanctions
consist of a fine  or  imprisonment,  if  found  guilty,  not  exceeding  12
months.

We note with interest that this amendment has positive implications for  the
grossly understaffed Department of Home Affairs, as it removes  the  onerous
requirements  for  Home  Affairs  personnel  to  process  applications   for
exemption for the use of a second passport.

The IFP supports the South African Citizenship Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr S PILLAY: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. The New  NP  supports  the  Bill
and accepts that it is  in  line  with  the  Constitution  and  other  legal
provisions. It is good to have such legislation passed in Parliament.

However, our concern lies in its implementation. At present, the  Department
of Home Affairs is understaffed, lacks basic resources and the equipment  at
almost every office where they exist. In many areas, like Phoenix,  Lenasia,
KwaMashu and Katlehong, there are only service points. Some are  in  a  very
shabby and disreputable condition. How  will  the  department  enforce  this
legislation under such trying conditions?

There is some hope with the introduction of the turn-around strategy  as  it
is being implemented by the  Director-General.  Serious  efforts  should  be
made by the department to adequately resource and staff the offices as  well
as the service points. We trust that the Minister will  urgently  deal  with
such critical and outstanding issues. On a recent  visit  to  the  Katlehong
service point, we found over 150 people waiting to be  attended  to  by  one
official and one  volunteer.  That  is  certainly  not  acceptable.  At  the
Lenasia service point, we found over 250 people waiting to  be  attended  to
by two officials and three volunteers.

There has to be an urgency in addressing the matter of staff and  resources.
If this matter is not attended to, additional stress  is  visited  upon  the
officials,  some  of  whom  are  very  dedicated  and   diligent.   At   the
Johannesburg Airport, the computers went offline for various  time  periods.
A definite effort must be made to address this.
Deputy Chair, in conclusion, we state again that such  legislation  is  only
as good and effective as its implementation. I thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY: Hon Deputy Chair, the ACDP is in favour of  the  South  African
Citizenship Amendment Bill, the object of which, as the Minister  has  said,
is to bring the Act in line with section 20  of  the  national  Constitution
that reads as follows: ``No citizen may be deprived of  citizenship''.  This
is positive legislation and is welcomed by the  ACDP  and,  hopefully,  will
free up Home Affairs to be dealing with the many priorities that it  has  to
deal with.

Currently the Minister could deprive a person of South  African  citizenship
by virtue of the use of the citizenship of another country.  This  provision
will be repealed and deprivation of citizenship will now  be  replaced  with
the sanction as specified in the Bill, namely, ``is  guilty  of  an  offence
and liable on  conviction  to  a  fine  or  imprisonment  not  exceeding  12
months''.

The ACDP is also supportive of the suggestion  that  a  record  be  kept  of
persons who, for whatever reason,  were  deprived  of  their  South  African
citizenship, bearing in mind however that the  department's  legal  advisers
were unaware of any such cases since 1996. We will vote in  favour  of  this
legislation. Thank you.

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Deputy Chair, I rise in support of the input  made  by  the
Minister, as well as the chairperson of the portfolio committee, but I  will
further elaborate as to why we seek an amendment of the citizenship  Act  of
1995. We are doing this in the spirit of Batho Pele, which is our  motto  to
always put people first. We do this to repeal a provision in terms of  which
a person may be deprived  of  citizenship  by  virtue  of  the  use  of  the
citizenship of another country. In our  view  we  saw  this  as  unjust  and
unconstitutional. Wisdom should at all times prevail.
Instead of deprivation we are providing for other penalties,  not  the  loss
of citizenship, and for matters connected therewith. Be it enacted  by  this
Parliament that section 9 of the South African Citizenship Act,  Act  88  of
1995 is hereby repealed. Therefore we insert section 26B of Act 88  of  1995
after section 26A. We are now saying the usage - which is  the  core  reason
for this amendment  -  of  foreign  citizenship  by  people  who  enter  the
Republic or depart from the Republic making use of  a  passport  of  another
country or, while in the Republic makes use of his  or  her  citizenship  of
another country in order to gain advantage  or  avoid  a  responsibility  or
duty - that  is  an  offence  and  liable,  on  conviction,  to  a  fine  or
imprisonment for a period not exceeding 24 months.

I would have loved to hear people who  spoke  about  the  dual  citizenship,
thank this Government and this House because right around  the  world  there
are almost none who provide  for  dual  citizenship.  It  is  only  in  this
country where we still provide for dual citizenship, which is  all  done  in
the spirit of people first. So I would love, when we close here, for  people
to honour and always remember the one thing we have learned from this  House
and this movement, the ANC; Whatever we do, we put people  first.  It  would
be worthwhile to have said: I was once  in  Parliament.  In  your  life  you
carry that along with you, more especially the people whom we  have  dragged
over the years - the DA. They have never learnt a thing  but,  in  the  end,
after 10 years they might have learned something. Thank you very much.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Deputy Chairperson and members, I  would  like
to thank all the members for their contributions, although  I  must  confess
that it is obtuse to me why  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee
thinks that I should start a campaign to help those who  haven't  got  their
IDs because it is actually  imperative  that  they  should  apply  for  them
themselves. I don't see that it is  my  function  to  start  a  campaign  to
assist them.

Furthermore, I would like to say, in relation to the  hon  Mr  Pillay,  that
yesterday when our  Minister  of  Finance  presented  this  House  with  the
Budget, he mentioned that Home Affairs is one of the departments  that  were
given quite a bit of that portfolio, and  he  mentioned  the  importance  of
infrastructure creation. Home Affairs, in fact, was  depleted  of  resources
as far as the majority of this country  is  concerned,  because  it  catered
only for the minority of this country. It's not my fault that there was  one
person at the Market Street branch and one volunteer and so on. I mean I  do
not know. I have said this ad nauseam here, standing at  this  podium,  over
the past 10 years  that  the  resources  that  were  made  available  to  my
department were limited. I have said it over and  over  again,  and  it's  a
fact of life. I would like to thank members for their  contributions.  Thank
you.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                    FILMS AND PUBLICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Hon Deputy Chairperson and  hon  members,  the
Films and Publications Amendment Bill has been motivated by prosecutors  and
police. Having in the  past  highlighted  the  frustrations  experienced  in
investigations and the prosecution of recent  child  pornography  offenders,
noting in particular that the accused often escape penal  sanction  provided
by the Act on grounds which they did not apply to offences  of  a  similarly
serious nature, the Bill seeks to  make  amendments  to  the  definition  of
"child pornography", because the present definition is limiting, in that  it
does not cover all aspects relating  to  child  pornography.  The  Film  and
Publication Board will be empowered  to  regulate  publications,  containing
visual presentations or descriptions referred to in Schedules 1 or 2, so  as
to prevent access to such materials by children.

The creation, production, possession and distribution of child  pornography,
as well as the failure to report it, are offences  punishable  in  terms  of
this Bill. The  Bill  also  includes  amendments  to  increase  the  maximum
penalty for offences involving child pornography to 10 years.

The  Bill  introduces  the  following  provisions:  Clause  1(a)  seeks   to
substitute  the  present  definition  of  "child  pornography"  with  a  new
definition. Clause 1(b) will delete the definition of  the  word  "degrade",
because it is unnecessarily limiting to the extent that it is  gender-biased
and does not take into  account  the  violation  of  human  dignity  in  its
totality. Clause 1(c) substitutes the  present  definition  of  "distribute"
with a new definition, so as to  include  the  failure  to  take  reasonable
steps to prevent access to pornographic material by children.

Clause 1(d) defines "internal  address"  and  "internal  service  provider",
which is necessary, since the Bill  also  brings  the  Internet  within  the
jurisdiction of the Act, in  so  far  as  child  pornography  is  concerned.
Clause 1(e) defines "possession", which is  necessary,  since  the  Act  now
also covers the Internet. Clause 1(f) substitutes the definition of  "sexual
conduct" as is defined in Schedule 11,  for  the  reason  that  the  present
definition is not only too limiting, but is also  restricted  only  for  the
purpose of the Schedules.
Clause 2 introduces the office of the chairperson of the board,  which  will
also be the  chief  executive  officer.  It  also  be  the  chief  executive
officer. It also deals with the manner in which decisions of the  board  are
taken.

Clause 3 amends subsection 2 of  section  5  of  the  Act  which  refers  to
"President", whereas it should refer to the "Minister".  Clause  4  provides
for the reporting by the board on all its activities during  that  financial
year.

Clause 5 deals with the manner of convening the meetings  of  the  board  or
the executive committee. Clause 6 amends section 17 of the Act to allow  the
board  to  more  effectively   regulate   publications   containing   visual
presentations or descriptions referred to in Schedules 1  or  2,  so  as  to
prevent access thereto by children.

Clause 7 amends section 18  of  the  Act  to  make  recreational  films  and
interactive  computer  games  more  effective  in  the  interests   of   the
protection of children. Clause 8 amends section 20 of  the  Act,  so  as  to
remove the limitation of the powers of the Review Board.

Clause 9 is a necessary amendment following the amendment of section  17  in
clause 3. Clause 10 amends section 26 of the Act to include the  offence  of
broadcasting any film which  has  been  classified  XX  in  accordance  with
Schedule 6 or 10.

Clause 11 amends section  27  of  the  Act  by  making  clearer  what  would
constitute the offence of "child pornography", as well  as  introducing  the
offence of failing to report child pornography and removing the  requirement
of the authority of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions for the issue  of
a search warrant in cases involving child pornography, so as  to  bring  the
investigation and prosecution of child pornography offenders  in  line  with
the requirements of other serious offences.

The amendment also  addresses  the  problem  of  child  pornography  on  the
Internet by requiring Internet service providers to register with the  board
and by making noncompliance an offence.
Clause 12 deletes subsection 3 of section 28 which unnecessarily delays  the
prosecution process. Clause 13 amends subsection 1 of section 29 to  include
a prohibition on the broadcasting of publications covered by  section  29(1)
as an offence.

Clause 14 is an amendment of section 20 of the Act, which is  the  penalties
provision for consistency with amendments to the offence provisions  of  the
Act. The amendments also provide for  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  the
maximum penalty for child pornography offences, from  the  present  five  to
ten years.

Clause 11 also introduces an admission  of  guilt  provision  for  the  less
serious offences in the Act,  as  well  as  providing  for  extraterritorial
jurisdiction in cases where South African citizens commit acts  outside  the
country which would  constitute  offences  under  the  Act,  had  they  been
committed inside the country. This amendment also provides for  presumptions
and proof to facilitate more effective prosecution.

Clause 15 seeks to amend Schedule 1 of  the  principal  Act  in  so  far  as
including  incest  or  rape  as  additional  grounds   for   classifying   a
publication as XX. Clause 16 amends Schedule  2  of  the  principal  Act  in
order to cover those cases provided for  in  Schedule  1  or  2.  Clause  17
provides for age restrictions for publications. Clause 18 deletes clause  1,
as the clause is unnecessary.  Clause  19  deals  with  the  prohibition  of
promotion of hatred. Clause 20 deletes section 11 of the  principal  Act  in
total. Clause 21 provides for the short title of the Bill,  this  being  the
Films and Publications Amendment Bill.

As  the  incumbent  Minister  who  has  introduced  the  original  Bill   to
Parliament, I am required to  urge  this  House  to  accept  the  Films  and
Publications Amendment Bill. However, I feel duty-bound to place  on  record
a number of concerns which have been raised in representations made  to  me,
as the incumbent  Minister,  and  to  the  portfolio  committee,  that  have
remained unaddressed.

Since I introduced the Bill to  Parliament,  certain  amendments  have  been
made to it and additional considerations were brought  to  the  fore,  which
raised concerns about its constitutionality, and policy desirability.  There
is no doubt that the fight against child pornography is  a  righteous  cause
which requires our full and unqualified support.

However, it may happen that at times one does the wrong thing for the  right
reason, and I am not satisfied that some of the concerns raised  about  this
Bill by the public do not make this Bill fall inside that category.

The concern has been expressed that the Bill  is  unconstitutional,  because
it interferes with the matters which in terms of the Constitution  ought  to
be left to the independent institution  that  is  established  in  terms  of
section 190 of the Constitution. I received credible legal opinions in  this
sense. However, I received  no  advice  from  my  department  confirming  or
denying this concern and its import.

There is  also  the  constitutional  and  policy  concern  that  by  forcing
Internet service providers to verify the  contents  of  web  sites,  we  are
effectively asking the mailman, as it were, to open the envelope  to  verify
that it does not contain illegal material, which violates the  most  ancient
notion of freedom of communication.

An additional concern is that the Bill, albeit to  a  very  limited  extent,
reintroduces the notion of  pre-emptive  censorship  prior  to  publication,
which in 1994 we committed ourselves  to  forever  expunge  from  our  legal
system, because it is repulsive to the values of our democratic and  liberal
Constitution.

I have considered withdrawing this Bill to enable the serious issues  raised
about its constitutionality and desirability to be addressed, so that we  do
not end up doing the wrong thing for the  right  reasons.  However,  I  know
that had I done so, a political furore would have been generated,  ascribing
to my action a political agenda and motive. Therefore I have chosen to  rely
on the wisdom of this House, and let the  House  decide  whether  this  Bill
should be proceeded with at this juncture. I thank you.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I  am  not  going  to  deal
much with my speech now. I will put it  aside,  and  begin  to  address  the
issues that the Minister has raised  regarding  the  unconstitutionality  of
this Bill. Firstly, I  think  a  workshop  needs  to  be  arranged  for  the
Minister to understand the parliamentary procedures when the Bill is  before
Parliament.

This Bill was brought  to  the  portfolio  committee  by  the  Minister.  In
Parliament, we have what we call Government  legal  advisers  who  help  the
portfolio committees and the parliamentary legal advisers  who  are  in  the
portfolio committee. We arranged what  we  call  public  hearings  where  we
invited the public to come and make submissions to the portfolio  committee,
which they did. When they came, we allowed them to make  submissions.  After
they left, we then considered those submissions and looked at which ones  we
could take up. From there, the Bill comes to Parliament, which is this  very
exercise. If the Minister  is  not  happy  about  the  Bill,  the  Rules  of
Parliament allow the Minister to withdraw the Bill. He  can  take  the  Bill
and state that he is withdrawing the Bill. If  he  doesn't  and  allows  the
process to carry on, the President will then decide to withdraw the Bill  if
he finds it unconstitutional.

Now, the Minister has raised a number  of  issues.  We,  together  with  his
department - Rufus Malatji, Sam Mogotsi and others - engaged on  this  Bill.
They were part and parcel of the public hearings. Last year, when we took  a
decision to refer them back to meet with other  stakeholders,  it  was  very
clear that some of the issues were not addressed. We then sent them back  to
meet with other stakeholders, together with the Film and Publication  Board,
to refine this Bill and bring it back to us.
Now, they have done that. They consulted with everybody. That was  confirmed
by your department. Today, after we deliberated on the  Bill,  the  Minister
says he is not happy and intends withdrawing  the  Bill,  because  this  may
cause a political row. I am not sure if that is the  truth,  Minister;  it's
not being honest. The portfolio committee has done its work.  We  have  done
our work wonderfully. This is one very important piece of  legislation  that
deals with child pornography. All of us are aware of that.  Today,  we  have
gone into great detail on the  content  of  this  Bill,  Minister.  I  don't
understand why, at the end  of  the  day,  the  Minister  should  make  this
particular statement. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister,  are  you  rising
on a point of order?

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: I wasn't trying  to  criticise  the  portfolio
committee. I was merely stating what some people  have  said.  I'll  explain
the reason why, in fact, there is a  political  dilemma  about  that,  about
whether I'll take this or not. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. I think the hon member  has
the opportunity now to respond to some of the statements that were made  and
I think that is what he is doing. [Interjections.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: The Minister raised the issue that the people have  raised  a
concern with him. If it's Internet service providers you are  referring  to,
Minister, your department,  together  with  the  portfolio  committee,  have
interacted with all of  them.  The  association  that  deals  with  Internet
service providers made their presentation together with  Cell  C,  MTN,  and
Vodacom. All of them made their presentation  to  the  portfolio  committee.
The Bill now simple says ``knowingly'' or knowing that  your  Internet  line
is being used to download child pornography, and if you were made aware  and
you don't act, that's where the Bill then comes into  enforcement,  which  I
think is a wonderful thing.

I don't understand the  argument  that  the  Minister  is  putting  forward,
because if it's politics, Minister, then let us not  use  this  platform  to
deal with politics ... [Applause.] Let's allow the process of this  Bill  to
go on, because we are addressing a very serious problem here.

Let me tell you something that I want to share with the Minister.  Maybe  he
is not aware of it.  The  day  we  voted  on  this  Bill  in  the  portfolio
committee, we waited for about 15 minutes for the hon Waters, who  was  busy
consulting with your political adviser, hon Mr Ambrosini, who even  came  to
the portfolio committee that day and instructed Rufus  Malatji  and  Mogotsi
to withdraw the Bill without even  talking  to  the  chairperson.  Now,  all
along, Waters and the DA were in support of the Bill. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Waters.

Mr H P CHAUKE: The only problem is that intervention of Mr  Ambrosini's  led
to the DA no longer supporting the Bill. All along they had been  supporting
it. [Interjections.]

We definitely have to be very honest. The problems that  we  are  addressing
here are very serious problems and definitely, Minister, you have gone  into
detail on what this Bill is addressing. The other issues are just  political
issues, Minister, put them aside. Let's carry on with the Bill  and  address
the problems that are facing the country. [Applause.]

Mr M  WATERS:  Thank  you.  Deputy  Chair  and  hon  Minister,  the  initial
intentions of the amendments to the  Films  and  Publications  Act  were  to
tighten control over child pornography. However,  in  its  quest  for  ever-
increasing centralisation and  control,  the  ANC  has  slipped  into  these
amendments censorship that can only be compared to  that  of  the  apartheid
NP. [Interjections.] We concur with the hon Minister in that regard.

These amendments have very little to do  with  combating  child  pornography
and have more to do with what  adults  can  and  cannot  see.  The  original
intentions of the amendments were to close loopholes that existed  regarding
child pornography. These amendments have been in the pipeline for  over  two
years and were ready for tabling in Parliament over a year ago. The  DA  has
called for them to be tabled on  numerous  occasions.  However,  the  Deputy
Minister of Home Affairs, who is responsible for the  Film  and  Publication
Board, only tabled these amendments in September last year.

Currently, Deputy Chair, there are over 1 million images of child  abuse  in
circulation on the Internet, and  it's  estimated  that  about  90%  of  all
paedophile-related activities involve the Internet. According  to  a  Sunday
Times report, there are over 100 000 websites that offer child  pornography.


The DA welcomes any steps that will combat  this  awful  crime.  Let  us  be
honest with ourselves: Child pornography is a sick crime and to me it's  the
sickest of all. It is hard to imagine how the sight of a child  being  raped
and  tortured  hold  any   sexual   appeal.   If   we,   as   the   people's
representatives, fail to act in stopping this  crime,  then  we  shall  have
failed dismally in our duties.

I would like to touch on the positive aspects of  the  amendments.  Firstly,
under the current  law,  possession,  creation  and  distribution  of  child
pornography are all lumped together as one offence. The proposed  amendments
separate these offences for the purposes of  sentencing.  This  would  allow
the courts to hand down stiffer sentences for more serious crimes.

Secondly, clause 27(2) of the Bill proposes to  make  it  an  offence  if  a
person who knows or even suspects that a crime is  taking  place  pertaining
to child pornography fails to report the crime. This is a special  provision
as a general duty in terms of the law to report  a  crime,  which  currently
does not exist. A person will only be prosecuted with the written  authority
of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.

Lastly, there was initial concern from the cellphone companies,  Telkom  and
the Internet Service Providers Association regarding  the  broadcasting  and
distribution of child pornography. It would be impossible  to  expect  these
organisations to monitor every  piece  of  information  that  flows  through
their systems on a daily basis. This would be like asking  the  Post  Office
to open  every  piece  of  mail  that  passes  through  their  system.  It's
basically impossible.

However, after inserting the words "knowingly" before the words  "broadcasts
or distributes", their concerns seem to have been addressed to some  degree.


This brings us  to  the  clauses  that  the  DA  is  opposed  to;  and  it's
unfortunate that the ANC took this opportunity  to  use  the  back  door  to
bring back good old-fashioned apartheid-style  censorship.  [Interjections.]
I will focus on two amendments which are  frightening,  to  say  the  least,
that have absolutely nothing to do with child pornography.  I  repeat:  They
have nothing to do with child pornography, but with everything  to  do  with
censorship.
  Firstly, the Film and Publication Board, under clause 29, wants to expand
  its authority over broadcasting which has serious implications. According
  to section 192 of the Constitution, broadcasting is the sole jurisdiction
  of Icasa. Section 192 states that:


National legislation must establish an  independent  authority  to  regulate
broadcasting in the public interest, and to ensure fairness and a  diversity
of views broadly representing South African society.

These amendments trample on that independence. Both Icasa and  the  National
Association of Broadcasters have  objected  to  this  amendment  but  to  no
avail.

In the past, the DA and the IFP have had a number of broadcasting laws  sent
back and amended on the same points when Government tried to  usurp  Icasa's
powers. No doubt, hon Minister, you'll be back here later  this  year  doing
the same again, amending these amendments to bring them back  in  line  with
the Constitution.

Icasa is an independent  body,  established  through  the  Constitution  and
appointed by Parliament while the Minister of  Home  Affairs,  whoever  that
will be at the time, appoints a Films and Publication  Board.  There  is  no
guarantee that the board will remain  independent  and  it  could  become  a
political appointment.  This  amendment  would,  clearly,  encroach  on  the
independence of broadcasting in our country.

Secondly, under clause 10, which deals with the  promotion  of  hatred,  the
board wants to take  jurisdiction  presently  resting  with  the  courts  to
include "race, ethnicity, or gender'' as  criteria  for  banning  films  and
publications if, when judged within context,  advocates  hatred  on  one  or
more grounds." This has nothing to do with child pornography but it does re-
introduce censorship on political grounds by an administrative body.

Currently, section 29 of the Act makes provision for the  courts  to  decide
whether  a  film  exceeds  bona  fide  literary,  artistic,  political,   or
scientific free speech  and  constitutes  hate  speech.  The  court  process
allows for appeals up to the Supreme Court of Appeal based on the merits  of
the  case  while  the  suggested  option  would  mean   that   a   statutory
administrative body would have the authority to ban films and publications.

Currently, the only material banned in our country, and thus  classified  as
XX and forbidden to be broadcast - which everyone agrees with,  I  certainly
hope - is child pornography,  bestiality,  explicit  sexual  material  which
includes violence,  material  that  degrades  and  certain  forms  of  awful
violence. What we are opening the door to, Deputy Chair,  is  a  potentially
political board becoming the conscience  of  our  nation,  rather  like  the
thought police. It is a sad day when the ruling party uses a  serious  issue
such  as  child  pornography  to  reintroduce  apartheid-style   censorship.
[Interjections.] Perhaps the ANC is learning a  lot  more  from  its  junior
alliance partners than we first imagined.

The DA wholeheartedly supports the original intentions and many  aspects  of
this  Bill.  However,  because  of  the  ANC's  additional  unconstitutional
amendments and the reintroduction of political censorship in  South  Africa,
the DA cannot support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Colleagues, the Films and  Publications
Amendment Bill before the House today calls  for  the  stricter  control  of
child pornography in all its ramifications. We  in  this  House  acknowledge
our responsibility to protect our nation's children - I will focus  on  this
as our major concern - and therefore we acknowledge the difficulties  we  as
legislators experience in tightening  up  matters  involving  the  ever-more
sophisticated information technology available to those who are abusing  our
children, particularly through the medium of the Internet.

It is for this reason that we are seeking to amend the Act by tightening  up
on the definition of child pornography to improve the terminology  used  and
to bring greater clarity to specific aspects of the Act. A major  aspect  of
the  amendment  deals  with  the  Internet,  namely  the  insertion  in  the
principal Act thus,
  Every Internet provider shall register  with  the  Board  in  the  manner
  prescribed by regulations made under this Act, and  take  all  reasonable
  steps  to  prevent  the  use  of  their  services  for  the  hosting  and
  distribution of child pornography.

The onus is on the service provider, once he is aware that  his  service  is
used for the distribution of child pornography - and this, to us, is a  huge
improvement on the previous provisions - to report the existence of  such  a
site to the South African Police Service and to preserve  any  evidence  for
investigation on and/or prosecutions.

I do not see this as a return to previous legislation and interference  with
freedom of expression, because the children of our country  are  our  future
and  we  have  to  do  everything  we  can  possibly  do  to  protect  them.
[Applause]. Users, if so requested by the  South  African  Police  Services,
have to be identified. Non-compliance with these requirements constitute  an
offence and sanctions are defined under section  12.  These  provisions  are
essential if we want to curb the abuse  of  children  via  the  Internet  by
those perverts who get pleasure in degrading children,  as  I  said  before,
our nation's greatest asset.

Terminology, such as  service  providers  "unknowingly"  distributing  child
pornography has been changed to "knowingly", thereby no longer allowing  the
service provider to hide behind the term "unknowingly".  Once  reported  and
made aware, as we said before, prosecution may well follow.

This amendment deals  with  many  of  the  issues  the  portfolio  committee
grappled with before agreeing to the principal Act in 1995, and those of  us
who were around will remember the intensive debate that took place  at  that
time. To me, it was re-assuring to note that problems raised  at  that  time
have not been ignored, and that we have an amending Bill that  answers  many
of the concerns we as legislators and parents needed to  have  addressed  to
protect our children from those that prey on their innocence  and  rob  them
of their childhood.

The IFP, in supporting the Bill, would also like to state that the Film  and
Publication Board falls under the Deputy Minister. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Deputy Chair, hon Minister Shenge,  hon
members and dear friends, in July last year James McNeil  was  found  guilty
and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for possession of 4 200 images  of
child pornography and 10 video clips of  the  same  material  in  the  much-
publicised "Father Christmas case".  He  is  now  serving  his  sentence  at
Pollsmoor Prison where, at least for five years, he will not  have  anything
to do with our children.

The case of McNeil, who was 72 years old at  the  time  of  his  sentencing,
shows the seriousness of  the  problem  that  we  are  encountering  in  our
country in dealing with the abuse of children  through  the  medium  of  the
Internet. That even a man old enough to be  a  grandfather  to  most  of  us
could be involved in these acts of cruelty shows the level  of  sickness  of
certain people in our society. It shows that the danger  is  real  and  that
the solution can no longer continue to be only academic.

The many cases that have been reported  recently  also  bring  to  the  fore
another reality, that demonstrates that problem is well and alive  in  South
Africa. Pornography is not just  something  that  is  happening  across  the
shores, but it is a crime with real  victims  who  are  South  African  and,
therefore, the law  needs  to  make  it  possible  for  us  to  protect  our
children.

After many years and a repeated public outcry, the work that has  been  done
has finally resulted in the Bill being presented  before  this  House.  This
work  has  involved  consultations  with  law  enforcement   agencies,   the
prosecutors, child protection units  of  the  police,  academics,  community
activists,  NGOs,  the  Internet  service  providers,  and  before  it   was
finalised, the Bill itself had to go through many  versions  of  redrafting.
We are certain that the product that is presented before you  today  is  the
one that takes into account all the  contributions,  and  that  every  role-
player is satisfied that this is the best way to approach the problem.

As has already been hinted at, the Bill itself aims to  make  it  much  more
easier for law enforcers to bring to book the online paedophiles;  it  seeks
to bring under the regulation of the Act the Internet service providers  and
to create liability or obligations on their part to help reduce the  scourge
of child abuse online.

We intend, through this Bill, to increase  the  maximum  sentence  for  such
crimes from five years to 10 years, while at the same  time  removing  child
pornography from the category of classifiable material,  both  in  the  film
and the Internet, so that it is purely regarded as criminal in terms of  the
law.

In line with the recommendations of the King Report, we also intend to  make
structural changes to the composition of the  Film  and  Publication  Board.
Additional to fighting child pornography  on  the  Internet,  we  will  also
ensure that children are protected from harmful material.  In  this  regard,
we will make it punishable for adults, including parents, who  do  not  take
reasonable steps to ensure that  if  they  are  in  possession  of  ordinary
pornographic  material,  children  do  not  have  access  to  such   images.
[Applause.]

We are of the opinion that this law is more than long overdue. We  are  also
very optimistic about the possibilities for a much  more  vigorous  approach
in our fight against these paedophiles as a result of these amendments.

One of the immediate benefits of these amendments is that we  will  be  able
to work hand in hand with the Internet  service  providers  in  launching  a
public hotline through which the public can report violations of  this  Act,
both on  the  Internet  and  in  film,  including  other  material  such  as
interactive games, magazines and DVDs. We are happy to announce, as part  of
this process, that the hotline will be up and running by the  end  of  April
this year, and I have been given the  undertaking  by  the  board  that  all
preparations are being made to ensure that we meet this deadline.

Deputy Chair, I would like to emphasise in  particular  the  amendment  that
deals  with  section  27  of  the  Act,  the  area  in  which  we  had  some
difficulties  during  our  consultation  process  with  other  role-players,
particularly the Internet service providers. I'm also happy to say that  all
these difficulties have now been ironed out. The section itself  deals  with
the definitions of possession and the creation of child pornography.

I am singling this one out for the reason  that  there  are  others  in  our
society who have argued that simply because they are  in  research  or  art,
they should be allowed the constitutional right to keep  child  pornography,
as if these amendments were to deny them that right. In that case the  state
would be trampling on the Constitution of our country.

In line with the judgment of the Constitutional Court in the De Reuck  case,
we are of  the  view  that  such  restrictions  do,  in  fact,  satisfy  the
limitations analysis stemming from the provisions of our Constitution,  that
the protection of our children  should,  in  terms  of  the  law,  supersede
everything else. [Applause.] That is what  Government  has  in  mind  as  we
present this Bill to you here today.

Let me reiterate our commitment to the protection of such  important  rights
as the right  to  freedom  of  expression  and  the  right  to  privacy,  as
enshrined in our Constitution. I must, however, stress  that  we  feel  that
the  limitation  of  these  rights,  which  is  also  provided  for  in  the
Constitution, is clearly justifiable when it comes to the protection of  our
children. [Applause.]

Currently, the department of education in the Gauteng province is busy  with
the final roll-out of computers in  schools,  through  the  Gauteng  on-Line
Project. This is going to make  computers  and  the  Internet  available  to
thousands of students in the schools, making each  one  of  them  and  their
teachers possible victims of cyber crime, including  access  to  pornography
or as subjects of child abuse online. Owing to these and other  developments
in the homes and at workplaces,  we  have  decided  that  the  board  should
conduct Internet Safety for Schools Programmes in all provinces.

Child pornography or abuse of children online is but one  of  the  pervasive
and deep-rooted problems of sexual abuse of children. The protection of  our
children needs to be holistic, hence our belief  that  Parliament's  support
of legislation, such as this piece of legislation, is paramount.  It  should
be important for us that children should feel safe and be allowed the  right
to grow up in a society free from violence,  abuse,  hunger  and  injustice.
Children are the most vulnerable in our society. The  only  protection  that
they can ever know is that which we as parents can provide them.

I am sure that in our conscience, it should count a lot that we  can  go  to
sleep today, knowing that  we  made  a  difference;  that  the  humiliation,
suffering and pain of a child, even if it is one child, can be avoided as  a
result of what we are doing here right now. I make a plea to all of us  here
in appreciation of our duty to society, not only as public  representatives,
but as parents as well.

Bantu beNkosi, ndifun' ukuthi, mhlawumbi le  ndaba  yemifanekiso  yabantwana
enamanyala, ichild pornography, ayikaqondakali kubanye bethu kuba  singenabo
abantwana. Kambe bazali, le ngxaki ayikho  kwiikhompyutha  kuphela.  Ndifuna
ukucela kakhulu kumzi omnyama ukuba uqwalasele ngoba  thina  asizazi  ezinye
zezi zinto. Abantwana bethu bafotwa  singazi.  Ngelinye  ixesha  umfota  eze
umntwana wakho ungazi, ukuba kuza kubakho igqwirha eliza kuthi  xa  lidibana
nelo foto lomntwana  wakho  oze,  lilithabathe  liye  kulisebenzisela  zinye
iinjongo ezingcolileyo nezimdaka.

Kanti  kukho  enye  into  ekhulileyo  apho  sihlala  khona:   Abantu   abeza
ngokungathi bandwendwele  njengabakhenkethi,  bafike  bathabathe  abantwana,
babanike imali bahambe,  baye  kubafota  emacaleni  beze.  Okanye  abantwana
benziswe izinto ezithile ezimdaka,  ezingcolileyo,  ekungafanelekanga  ukuba
bazenze, nanjengoko bengabantwana. Aba bantu bafota abantwana  bethu  bemile
benganxibanga  ngezantsi,   baze   babanike   iimali   -   abantwana   bethu
bayahlupheka, bafun' iimali zesidlo  sasemini  esikolweni.  Ezo  foto  zithi
zithatyathwe  ziye  kusetyenziswa  ngezinye  iindlela.  Ingeyiyo  laa   foto
yomntwana  obefotwe  emile,  eze.  Ngoku  sele  iyifoto   ebonisa   umntwana
egocwagocwa, esenziwa ezinye izinto ngumntu omdala. Injalo le nto.

Uyabona ke, xa wena ungazalanga,  futhi  ungenalo  usizi  akubi  nankathalo.
Abanye abantu abangazalanga babanayo laa ntlungu.  Bayayiva  intlungu  ngezi
zinto le nto imbi  ngakumbi  kwaba  bantwana  babiwayo;  Abantwana  abakwezi
internet, abasetyenziswayo kwezi zinto, ngabantwana abazibone  bekwezi  meko
bengakhange bazi nabazali babo bengenalwazi.

Wena ke oza  kuthetha  ezo  lwimi  uzithethayo,  Mnu  Waters,  ongekabinguye
umzali ukubonakalisa ukungabi nankathalo. (Translation of  Xhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: People, I want  to  say  that  perhaps
child pornography is not very clear to some of us, because some  of  us  may
not have children. I would like to let parents know  that  this  problem  is
not only due to the use of computers, and I would specifically say  this  to
black  families,  as  these  things  are  new  to  us.  Our   children   are
photographed without our  knowing  that  and  sometimes  one  would  take  a
photograph of a child not knowing that it would later on  be  used  by  some
witch who would have very sinister and dirty ideas.

We are also witnessing growth in the number of people who come  as  tourists
and give our children money, take them to secluded areas and take photos  of
them naked. Some children are told to do things that they are  not  supposed
to do as children. These people would pose  half-naked  with  the  children.
Children take the money they are given because they are poor and would  want
to use the money to buy lunch at school perhaps. Those photographs would  be
later used for pornographic purposes. That is the reality of the  situation.
If you do not have children or are not  compassionate  about  this  problem,
you speak insensitively about the  issue.  Other  people  who  do  not  have
children do feel for those who do. It  is  particularly  children  who  have
been stolen from their families who are exposed to this dirty activity.  Our
children are being abused online, through the medium of  the  Internet.  The
parents of the children who  are  involved  in  child  pornography  and  the
children themselves do not know how they got involved in it.

Mr Waters, for you to speak the way you do now,  just  because  you  do  not
have children, is very insensitive.]

I don't really believe that you already have a child.  You  are  insensitive
and do not understand the urgency of  some  of  these  matters  because  you
don't know anything about parenthood. [Applause.] [Interjections.] ...

An HON MEMBER: It took you two years to ... [Inaudible.] ...

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Yes, it  took  me  two  years.  Yes,  I
delayed them for a reason, but the good thing is that there  was  ultimately
proper consultation and agreement with the Internet service  providers.  The
ones on whose behalf you purport to be speaking are,  in  fact,  the  people
who have agreed fully to these amendments and who are supporting  this  very
Bill. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. On Sunday I  spoke  at  a  meeting  in
Johannesburg that was attended by over 550 religious leaders,  human  rights
activists from  the  Hindu,  Muslim,  Christian,  spiritualist  and  atheist
communities. One of the issues raised was legislation and  its  enforcement,
and in terms of this Bill in particular. It had  overwhelming  support  from
the people who attended that meeting. The New  NP  listens  to  what  people
have to say and doesn't come here and yap like  a  little  pup.  We  support
this important and essential Bill.

As much has been  said  about  the  content,  I  shall  concentrate  on  its
implementation. There are several challenges that are still in  the  way  of
enforcing this piece of legislation. We therefore call  upon  the  Ministers
of Safety and Security, Justice and Constitutional Development,  and  Public
Service and Administration to take the required action to ensure  that  this
piece of legislation is enforced. We believe that they will do so,  moreover
after the allocations that were announced by the Minister of Finance.

If you make a commitment to enforce this legislation,  we  accept  that  you
will  do  so  because  you  are  the  Government  and  it  is  your   direct
responsibility.

At the meeting we also  discussed  the  commitment  advertised  by  the  DA,
namely that if one person votes for them,  they  will  put  150  000  police
personnel on the streets, supposedly to implement such legislation.  It  was
made clear that all empirical evidence shows that the DA  will  not  be  the
government of our country after the April elections -  and  they  are  fully
aware of that. Therefore they will not be able to give effect to the  claim.
As the DA will not be able to give effect to the claim, it  therefore  means
that it is a misleading advertisement. That advertisement was rejected  with
the contempt that it so rightly deserves.

The provisions of this Bill are important and they affect the lives  of  our
children and ourselves. We cannot stand by and be silent when a party  makes
a commitment that it knows it shall not be able to fulfil. The meeting  took
a decision that the matter will be  reported  to  the  relevant  authorities
with the request that the particular advertisement be withdrawn.

It is the Government that will allocate personnel  and  other  resources  to
implement this piece of legislation. Let us  be  absolutely  clear  on  that
point.  If  all  political  parties,  civic  organisations  and  responsible
leaders work together  to  implement  this  legislation,  those  wishing  to
violate this law will find it very difficult to do so. This has to  be  done
in a very responsible manner by everyone.

The plight of crime victims and the enforcement of  legislation  should  not
be used in the hope of gaining a few votes for those that have  tried.  They
will soon learn that the electorate will not be confused or misled  by  such
a wild and exaggerated advertisement.

In conclusion: The people at that meeting gave full  support  for  the  role
that the New NP is playing,  together  with  the  Government,  in  combating
crime, in particular child pornography.

Ms C DUDLEY: Deputy Chair, child pornography is  universally  condemned  for
good reason. It strikes at  the  dignity  of  children.  It  is  harmful  to
children who are used in these productions, and it  is  potentially  harmful
because of the attitude to child sex that it fosters and the use  of  it  in
grooming children to engage in  sexual  conduct.  These  are  the  words  of
Deputy Chief Judge Langa in 2003, when the Constitutional Court  ruled  that
the possession and production of child pornography should stay illegal.

The  Films  and  Publications  Amendment  Bill  makes  provision   for   the
prohibition of child pornography and  a  more  effective  investigation  and
prosecution  of  child   pornography   offenders.   These   objectives   are
commendable and its provisions are welcomed by the ACDP. However,  the  Bill
does not go far enough as adult pornography is still legal and  defended  in
the name of free speech.

Children are vulnerable and easily become victims of  those  who  have  been
aroused by adult pornography and not just child pornography. Of  course  the
ADCP  is  not  surprised  that  the  liberal  DA  opposes  any  efforts   to
effectively clamp down on pornography. [Applause.]

In 1996 the Films  and  Publications  Act  legalised  pornography  in  South
Africa for the first time. According to the South African  Police  Services'
Child Protection Unit this made it possible for child abusers,  rapists  and
pedophiles to obtain all the material they  needed.  Statistics,  they  say,
tells the story of South Africa  Police  records  showing  that  child  rape
increased by over 400%. The police  further  noted  that  in  research  with
child sexual offenders, it was revealed that all had used pornography.

Every 26 seconds a woman is raped in South Africa, often by a man  known  to
her and increasingly under excessively violent circumstances; and  every  24
minutes there is a rape or attempted rape of a child. Shockingly,  child-on-
child rape is on the increase in South Africa and  the  age  of  rapists  is
declining. This is not surprising, given  the  circulation  of  pornographic
magazines in our schools, not of child pornography, but adult pornography.

According to the police at the Mitchell's Plain Child  Protection  Unit  the
bizarre ideas employed by child-on-child rapists  are  likely  gleaned  from
pornographic material, which is also used by gangs  to  lure  children  from
school playgrounds. I have a lot more to say, but unfortunately I have  been
denied my other two minutes. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr W M  SKHOSANA:  Thank  you,  Chairperson,  Ministers,  and  hon  members.
Chairperson, the Bill before  the  House  today,  which  is  the  Films  and
Publications Bill, deals with the specific sections and  clauses  pertaining
to child pornography. It is another example  of  the  fact  that  the  South
African Constitution is a living document that impacts on and  improves  the
quality of life of all our people.

The Bill of Rights  as  contained  in  our  Constitution  guarantees,  among
others,  the  right  to  privacy,  the  right  to  dignity   and   prohibits
determination based on sex, gender and social orientation.

The Bill seeks to do that in totality. The principal  Act  did  not  include
the description of child pornography in its totality, or  the  inclusion  of
other parts of the body, which may be used for pornographic purposes.  As  a
result, the amendment is necessary as it can deal with specifics.

To show  that  the  Government  is  serious  about  child  pornography,  the
Government takes note of the development worldwide  of  the  technology  and
complexity that goes with it. Times are changing every day.

As a country and as a Government, we are determined  to  build  and  a  give
meaning to our Constitution. The amendment of the principal  Act  shows  the
determination of the ANC-led Government to become involved in  the  national
priority  task  of  laying  the  foundation  for  building  a  coherent  and
substainable society.

Taking the cue from the Minister of Finance yesterday in his  Budget  Review
and allocating more money to the Department  of  Education  because  of  the
need of computer  literacy  for  our  students,  this  Bill  seeks  to  take
everybody on board. Big businesses were consulted and all stakeholders  were
consulted. We should take note of the fact that our children  will  be  more
exposed to computers. It  is  necessary  for  school  governing  bodies  and
everybody else in society to do so. As a result,  possession,  according  to
the Bill, will go further  to  include  downloading  material  on  computers
which our children are using on daily basis.
Regarding Internet service providers, within its jurisdiction in so  far  as
child pornography is concerned, it is therefore  necessary  to  include  the
definition of "Internet address" and  "Internet  service  provider"  in  the
Act. We are living in a changing world.

There is a relationship  between  children  whose  images  appear  in  child
pornography and those who have gone missing through child trafficking.  This
Bill is part of the process to bring  about  a  legislative  framework  that
ensures the total protection of children against any form of  abuse,  be  it
sexual, violent, trafficking or otherwise, is in place.

As a result we are looking with interest at the development surrounding  the
finalisation of the legislation that deals with human trafficking.

Due to the nature of the problems involved,  which  include  the  fact  that
this is a cross-border crime, it has taken  a  long  time  to  finalise  the
policy in this regard. The ANC Government is making a call to  all  to  join
the ANC-led Government in the people's contract to  build  the  nation.  The
moral degeneration is one aspect that is to be used, and perhaps we need  to
revisit the notion of a collective upbringing of the child: Go back  to  the
basics of promoting the notion of your child is my child, my child  is  your
child.

Surely the hon member Walters might not understand what do we mean by  this.
Hon Walters, you have been all over  the  show,  accusing  particularly  the
chairperson of the portfolio committee of not  wanting  to  bring  the  Bill
before the committee. Now the Bill is before this House today  and  now  you
are the one who is opposing the Bill. You have  attended  all  those  public
hearings which included those other parastatals you have  made  mention  of.
We did not find any problems with those inputs, and they  ultimately  agreed
with us that there is a need to have this kind of amendment.

It is important to note that this world is changing.  We  are  part  of  the
global world which is constantly changing. Mr Walters tries to  compare  the
new South Africa with the South Africa of yesterday.  It  was  an  apartheid
state, it had its roles, it had its policies, and it had its aims.  We  want
to be part of the global world and then we want  to  ensure  that  each  and
every citizen, our children in particular,  are  safe  by  introducing  this
Bill. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: I was brought up differently from you.  I  can
never be  like  you.  Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon
members, I would like to make just one thing very clear. It is a  fact  that
this is indeed my Bill. I brought it to this House because  it  is  my  Bill
and my party supported this Bill. I am very grateful that  the  Minister  of
Safety and Security is here. When he was my Deputy Minister,  he  felt  very
passionately about this matter to the extent  -  I  think  the  Minister  of
Public Service would bear me out here - that he  would  have  wanted  us  to
have a presentation on the  kind  of  harm  that  is  done  to  children  by
pornography.

I could not have brought the Bill here  if  I  was  opposed  to  it  myself.
However, I have every right to  point  out,  as  you  saw,  that  there  are
certain people who made the  presentations  because  they  feel  differently
about it, but for the chairperson of the portfolio committee  to  come  here
and say that I was unhappy myself, I don't know what that means. How he  can
say that I am unhappy, especially  since  I  brought  the  Bill  before  the
House? There are many Bills that have been passed in this House,  and  which
have been taken to the Constitutional Court and were squashed.

If I just warned members that there was that possibility,  it  doesn't  mean
that I am opposed to the Bill. If I felt so  strongly,  I  could  even  have
discussed it with the Deputy Minister.

If  you  mother  brought  you  up  like  that,   it   is   just   too   bad.
[Interjections.] Yes, you have no manners and that is your  parents'  fault.
[Interjections.] I just want to make it very clear that you cannot  give  to
me what you do not have. If you don't have something between your ears,  you
can't give it to me. I would also like to say that there is also  wisdom  in
the old expression that we cannot  teach  an  old  woman  to  suck  an  egg.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (DA dissenting).

1.    The Speaker


     Eleventh Report of the Working Group on the African Union (AU):


     Following on its Tenth Report, adopted by  the  House  on  26  November
     2003, the Working Group would like to report as follows:


     (1)    Submission of names of PAP Members to AU Commission


         The Working Group in its Tenth Report recommended  that  5  Members
         be elected to represent Parliament in the  Pan  African  Parliament
         (PAP), in terms of Article 4(2)  of  the  Protocol  which  provides
         that each Member State shall be  represented  in  the  Pan  African
         Parliament by 5 Parliamentarians, at least one of whom shall  be  a
         woman.


         On 26 November 2003, the following Members were  elected:  Dr  F  N
         Ginwala, Ms M A A Njobe, Mr M J Mahlangu, Dr  B  L  Geldenhuys  and
         Prof H Ngubane  and  the  names  have  been  submitted  to  the  AU
         Commission.


         The AU Commission has indicated that it has now received the  names
         of the Members from 23 Parliaments. As some had  not  provided  all
         the required information (gender and  political  affiliation),  the
         Commission will  be  sending  a  further  communication  requesting
         standardised  formats  for  required  information,  including   the
         language preference of each Member and  whether  each  Member  will
         take an oath or make a solemn declaration.


     (2)    Arrangements for the Inaugural Session and the First Session


         (a)     Date and programme


              The date for the Inaugural Session has been set as  18  March
              2004 in Addis Ababa. The Inaugural Session will be preceded by
              regional meetings which are scheduled for 17  March  2004  and
              followed by the First Session of the PAP from 19 to  20  March
              2004. The Steering Committee at its meeting held on 13 and  14
              February 2004 adopted a  draft  programme  for  the  Inaugural
              Session for  consideration  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  AU,
              President J Chissano. It also agreed a programme for  adoption
              by the First Session of the PAP.


         (b)     Oath of Office


              The Steering Committee has  agreed  the  Oath  of  Office  or
              Affirmation for Members and for Presiding Officers, in each of
              the 4 official languages of the AU.


         (c)     Observers


             In addition to the 5 Members, each Member Parliament may send 3
              observers to attend the Inaugural Session.  The  Speaker  will
              submit names of observers to the Chief Whips.


         (d)     Secondment of Staff


              The Commission will be writing to  Members  of  the  Steering
              Committee and the African Foreign Missions in Addis  Ababa  to
              request them to second staff.


     (3)    Rules for the Inaugural Session


        Article 11 (8) of the Protocol empowers the PAP to adopt its  Rules
         of Procedure.


        The Steering Committee has adopted Draft Rules for the  PAP.  These
         Rules will be considered and adopted at the First Session.


     (4)    Nomination and election of the President of the PAP


        In terms of the Article 12 (2) of the Protocol, the PAP will at its
         first sitting, elect from among its Members and in accordance  with
         its  Rules  of  Procedure,  a  President  and  4  Vice   Presidents
         representing the regions of Africa. According to the Protocol,  the
         election of the President will  take  place  during  the  Inaugural
         Session and  be  presided  over  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  AU.
         National   Parliaments   may    nominate    candidates.    Regional
         consultations will be held to nominate a candidate from the  region
         from  amongst  the  nominations  from  National  Parliaments.   The
         election will be by secret ballot of all Members.


     (5)    Nomination and election of the Vice Presidents


        The Draft Rules provide that the region from  which  the  President
         comes is excluded from the ballot for Vice Presidents. Each of  the
         4 remaining regions will nominate two candidates  per  region,  one
         of whom must be a woman.


        Each ballot paper  will  have  two  sections:  Section  1  for  the
         nominated women  candidates  exclusively  and  Section  2  for  all
         candidates. In Section 1 of the ballot,  the  names  of  the  women
         candidates will be listed in alphabetical  order  indicating  their
         respective regions.


        Each delegate must vote for one woman on Section 1  of  the  ballot
         paper. Ballot papers which do not indicate a valid vote on  Section
         1 will be  disqualified.  Each  delegate  may  also  vote  for  one
         candidate from each of the regions  on  Section  2  of  the  ballot
         paper. Section 2 will be counted first. Should there  be  no  woman

     (6)    Rules of Debate


        A minimum set of Rules of Debate has also been agreed to.


     (7)    Establishment of committees


        Article 12(13) of the Protocol provides that the PAP may  establish
         such committees, as it deems fit, for the proper discharge  of  its
         functions and in accordance with its Rules of Procedure.


        According to the  Draft  Rules,  the  Bureau  will  constitute  the
         Business Committee of the PAP. At its first session, the  PAP  will
         establish the following ad hoc Committees:
         (a)     Rules Committee
         (b)     Budget Committee
         (c)     Credentials Committee


         These ad hoc Committees will be composed of 3  representatives  per
         region and will be appointed by the House.


     (8)    Reporting Mechanisms


        The  Working  Group  has  previously  highlighted  the   need   for
         Parliament to consider  how  the  five  Members  of  the  PAP  will
         report.


        The Working Group recommends:


        That  the  next  Parliament  prioritises  the  establishment  of  a
         committee to process  and  deal  with  issues  emanating  from  the
         African Union.


     Report to be considered.
