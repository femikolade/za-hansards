                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek sal by  die  volgende  sitting  van  die
Raad voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die skynheilige optrede van die DA,  en  veral  die  agb  DA
           leier, Tony Leon, teenoor die Afrikaanse gemeenskap;


       (b)  dat met die totstandkoming van die DA, mnr Leon 'n  raadsaal  in
           sy koukuskamer na die voormalige staatspresident van Suid-Afrika
           en Nobelpryswenner, mnr F W de Klerk, vernoem  het,  en  by  die
           geleentheid as sy ``imbongi'' opgetree het;


       (c)  dat noudat dié Afrikaner- en wêreld-ikoon sy steun aan die  Nuwe
           NP en sy samewerking met die ANC gee, Mnr Leon omswaai en mnr De
           Klerk probeer swartsmeer en verkleineer; en


       (d)  dat die DA verder gaan en mnr Leon as 'n plaasvervanger van  mnr
           De Klerk en as 'n ware Afrikaner-ikoon voorstel;


  (2) meen die oppervlakkigheid waarmee die DA met die  geestesgoedere  van
       Suid-Afrikaners en die Afrikaanse gemeenskap handel,  skreiend  is  -
       mnr Leon se  paar  woorde  in  Afrikaans  flous  nie  die  Afrikaanse
       gemeenskap nie;


  (3) kennis neem daarvan dat dit daarom is dat die foto van mnr  De  Klerk
       wat vir die DA geleen was, uit die DA-koukuskamer verwyder is  -  dit
       pryk nou in 'n museum in Pretoria waar ware  Suid-Afrikaners  en  die
       wêreld met waardering daarna kan kyk, en waar dit  vir  die  nageslag
       bewaar word; en


  (4) van mening is dat Suid-Afrika beter verdien as hierdie skynheiligheid
       en dit by die NNP kan kry.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I shall move at the next  sitting  of  the
Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the sanctimonious actions of the DA, and of the  DA  leader,  Mr
           Tony Leon, in particular, towards the Afrikaans community;


       (b)  that with the realisation of the DA, Mr  Leon  named  a  council
           chamber in his caucus room after the former State  President  of
           South Africa and Nobel Prize winner, Mr F W de Klerk, and  acted
           as his ``imbongi'' at this occasion;


       (c)  that now that this  Afrikaner  and  world  icon  is  giving  his
           support to the NNP and his co-operation  to  the  ANC,  Mr  Leon
           turned and is trying to denigrate and humiliate Mr De Klerk; and


       (d)  that the DA goes further by trying  to  portray  Mr  Leon  as  a
           substitute for Mr De Klerk and as a true Afrikaner icon;


  (2) is of the opinion that the superficial manner in which the  DA  deals
       with the  spiritual  assets  of  South  Africans  and  the  Afrikaans
       community is shameless - Mr Leon's few words in Afrikaans do not fool
       the Afrikaans community;


  (3) notes that it is for this reason that the photo of Mr De  Klerk  that
       was lent to the DA was removed from the DA's caucus  room  -  it  now
       graces a museum in Pretoria where true South Africans, and the world,
       can appreciate it, and where it is preserved for future  generations;
       and


  (4) is of the  opinion  that  South  Africa  deserves  better  than  this
       hypocrisy and can get it from the NNP.]

              RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that under the ANC South Africa's criminal justice  system  has
       undergone  a  radical  transformation   during   the   last   decade,
       effectively ending political violence, dealing with urban and  right-
       wing terror and taking important steps to stabilise crime;


  (2) also notes that progress in the integration of our justice system has
       resulted in faster finalisation  of  cases,  an  improvement  in  the
       quality of dockets and an increase in conviction rates;


  (3) notes further that community policing has been  made  more  effective
       through the establishment of community police forums, and  that  this
       has improved the  relationship  and  trust  between  the  police  and
       communities;


  (4) acknowledges that as a result of the number  of  measures  that  have
       been put in place to regulate the ownership of firearms, over 80  000
       firearms have been destroyed so far;


  (5) further acknowledges the measures that have  been  taken  to  relieve
       prison overcrowding, such as the construction  of  new  prisons,  the
       introduction  of  alternative  sentences   and   the   promotion   of
       correctional supervision;


  (6) notes  the  targeted  successes  of  specialist  units  such  as  the
       Scorpions and the  Asset  Forfeiture  Unit  against  organised  crime
       syndicates;


  (7) also notes that strategic partnerships ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, your time has expired. Your  motion
will now become a notice of motion and will be printed in full on  the  next
Order Paper.

                     OPENING OF PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Western Cape and Gauteng on the successful  opening
       of their provincial legislatures;


  (2) notes that the legislatures of Limpopo and Mpumalanga  are  scheduled
       to open today while the Eastern Cape, Free State and North West  will
       officially open  tomorrow,  followed  by  the  Northern  Cape  on  20
       February;


  (3) extends its best  wishes  to  all  provincial  legislatures  as  they
       continue in their efforts to improve the quality  of  life  of  their
       citizens, and wishes all premiers who are concluding their last terms
       all the best in the future.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection  to  that  motion?  Yes,
hon Windvoël?

Mr V V  Z  WINDVOЁL:  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson.  It  is  just  a  minor
amendment. The Mpumalanga legislature is officially opening tomorrow.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There  is  an  amendment.  Do  you  accept  the
amendment, Mr Lucas? All right. Is there any objection to  that  motion?  No
objection.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            LABELLING OF GM FOODS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the new labelling regulations that apply to GM  foods  in  South
           Africa;
       (b)  that these regulations do not require mandatory labelling of  GM
           foods;


       (c)  that the regulations require labelling only  where  there  is  a
           ``significant difference'' in certain prescribed  circumstances,
           but there are no GM foods currently in South  Africa  that  fall
           within this scope; and


       (d)  that South Africa has been growing GM white maize since 2001,  a
           staple food for the majority of South Africa's citizens;


  (2) is of the opinion that -


       (a)  the labelling regulations undermine the rights of  the  majority
           of the people in South Africa to know what  they  are  consuming
           and to exercise their rights of free choice whether  or  not  to
           buy GM foods on sale;


       (b)  all GM food and  feed  which  consist  of,  or  contain  or  are
           produced from genetically modified organisms should be  labelled
           in order to inform the consumers and  farmers  about  the  exact
           nature and characteristics of the food or feed, so that they can
           make informed choices; and


       (c)  the list of potential allergens  listed  in  the  annex  to  the
           regulations  is  restricted  and  does  not  take  into  account
           allergies that tourists to South Africa may have  -  this  could
           have a detrimental effect on the South African tourism industry;
           and


  (3) requests the Government to urgently review the regulations.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion?

An HON MEMBER: Chairperson, seeing that that is quite a substantial  motion,
I think I will object and let it be a notice of motion.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  There  is  an  objection.  The  motion  will,
therefore, become a notice of motion.

                        HORRIFIC MURDER IN NORTH WEST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its shock, horror and indignation -


       (a)  at the reported death of a son of the soil from North  West  who
           it is alleged was severely  beaten  up  by  a  farmer  with  the
           assistance of three alleged accomplices, and was thereafter tied
           up and driven 15 km, only to be thrown over the fence of a  lion
           enclosure at Hoedspruit, Limpopo; and


       (b)  that at the end of  this  decade,  during  which  we  have  been
           seeking to uphold  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law,  such
           behaviour is still possible by sadistic and cannibalistic people
           who delight in inflicting such a painful death;


  (2) wonders for how long such heartless, cruel persons will  enjoy  their
       human rights and the leniency of the process of justice that is often
       not afforded the victims of injustice;


  (3) expresses its horror at the thought  that  Nelson  Shisane,  only  38
       years old, had to die in such a cruel, painful and horrific way -  he
       saw a lion coming to him without escape and his body was torn to bits
       before he was dragged into the bush;


  (4) expresses its sorrow and  extends  its  condolences  to  his  family,
       friends and neighbours;


  (5) realises that there are still many of our people who are  maimed  and
       tortured out of sight and without publicity, and that there are still
       many such heartless people in many of the provinces; and


  (6) firmly believes that we need  to  expose  and  report  them  and  not
       support their ventures, clubs or farms.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion?  Hon  van
Niekerk?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I do not think we can take a decision ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there an objection?  Hon  members,  could  I
ask you not to motivate, but to indicate. Is there an objection?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Because it is sub judice, yes.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There is an objection.  Therefore,  the  motion
will become a notice of motion. And I will again repeat that where there  is
a court case pending, members of Parliament must be wise to the  sub  judice
rule.

                          PRECEDENCE TO FIFTH ORDER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That, after the First Order, precedence be given to the Fifth Order.


  I have consulted with all the Party Whips and they do not  have  problems
  with that. Thank you.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         PROVISIONS REGARDING LANGUAGE IN SECTION 6 OF CONSTITUTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the constitutional  provisions  in  section  6  of  the
       Constitution, with special reference to subsections (2) and (4):


       ``(2)      Recognising the historically diminished use and status  of
              the indigenous languages of our people, the state  must  take
              practical and positive measures to  elevate  the  status  and
              advance the use of these languages.''


       ``(4)      The national government  and  provincial  governments,  by
              legislative and other measures,  must  regulate  and  monitor
              their use of official languages. Without detracting from  the
              provisions of subsection  (2)  all  official  languages  must
              enjoy parity of esteem and must be treated equitably.'';


  (2) requests the nine provincial legislatures to inform  the  Council  on
       their progress in respect of adherence to the above.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       DA PROPAGANDA REGARDING FARMERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy misnoeë uitspreek oor die gevaarlike, vals en roekelose propaganda
       van die  DA  met  die  strekking  dat  die  ANC,  en  by  noodwendige
       implikasie daarom die ANC-beheerde Regering, nie omgee vir landbouers
       nie, en dat hulle daarom op hulself aangewys is vir hul veiligheid;


  (2) van mening is dat -


       (a)   hierdie  vals  propaganda,   indien   geglo   deur   potensiële
           plaasaanvallers, sal lei tot meer plaasaanvalle,  aangesien  dit
           potensiële plaasaanvallers onder die indruk sal bring  dat  daar
           nie effektief teen hulle opgetree sal word deur die staatsorgane
           verantwoordelik vir die voorkoming en bekamping van misdaad nie;


       (b)  indien dié propaganda geglo word, dit ook kan lei tot  die  neem
           van die reg in eie hande deur landbouers; en


       (c)  dié propoganda ook sal lei tot die polarisasie van gemeenskappe;
           en


  (3) daarom word die DA versoek om hulle te  weerhou  van  sodanige  vals,
       roekelose en gevaarlike propaganda.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution to follows).

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its displeasure at the dangerous,  deceitful  and  reckless
       propaganda of the DA to the effect that the ANC,  and  by  inevitable
       implication therefore the ANC-controlled Government,  does  not  care
       about agrarians and that they are therefore dependent  on  themselves
       for their security;


  (2) is of the opinion that -


       (a)   this  deceitful  propaganda,  if  believed  by  potential  farm
           attackers, will lead to more farm attacks because potential farm
           attackers will gain the impression that no effective action will
           be taken against them by the organs of state responsible for the
           prevention and combating of crime;


       (b)  if this propaganda gains credit, it can also lead  to  agrarians
           taking the law into their own hands; and


       (c)  this propaganda will also lead to the polarisation of  different
           communities; and


  (3) therefore requests the DA to refrain from  such  deceitful,  reckless
       and dangerous propaganda.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will, therefore, become a notice of motion.

                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mrs C NKUNA: Thank you, hon  Chairperson  and  hon  colleagues.  This  is  a
statement  about  the  Telecommunications  Amendment  Bill  as   agreed   at
committee level. The object of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill  before
the House is to amend the Telecommunications Act of  1996,  so  as  to  give
powers and duties to certain categories of operators  for  the  purposes  of
interconnection and facilities leasing, and to provide for  matters  related
to this.

In other words, the Bill seeks to amend sections 43 and 44 of the  principal
Act by defining certain operators as public operators for  the  purposes  of
interconnection and facilities leasing guidelines.  The  intended  operators
include   Sentech,   the   second   national   operator,   public   switched
telecommunication services licences, cellular mobile licences  and  national
long-distance licences.

The ANC wholeheartedly supports  the  definition  of  Sentech  as  a  public
operator. This will enable Sentech to lease  facilities  from  Telkom  on  a
wholesale basis, instead of on a retail basis,  for  purposes  of  both  its
carrier licence and its multimedia services licences. This will result in  a
significant change  for  end  users.  In  our  new  environment  of  managed
liberalisation  in  the  telecommunications  sector,  this  will  level  the
playing field and contribute  to  competitive  fairness  for  operators  who
provide telecommunication services to the public.  In  the  long  run,  this
will benefit consumers who can eventually look forward to  more  and  better
services and lower prices. The ANC supports this Bill.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON INTERVENTION IN THE QAUKENI
   LOCAL MUNICIPALITY IN TERMS OF SECTION 139(1)(B) OF THE CONSTITUTION -
                                ANNUAL REPORT

Mr G NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Thank you, Chairperson and hon members  of  the
House.  I  must  immediately  thank  the  House,   including   yourself   in
particular, for inviting us here, so that we could make a  few  comments  on
the steps taken in the municipality in question.  Secondly,  we  would  also
like to thank this House for responding very promptly to the letter sent  to
it, in which we notified them of the steps that had been taken.

On 23 December 2003 I wrote a letter to the speaker  of  the  Qaukeni  local
municipality, in which I notified him that in terms of the  mandate  that  I
have from the executive council of the province, I intended  intervening  in
the  affairs  of  the  municipality,  in  terms  of  section  139   of   the
Constitution.

In this letter, I then  requested  the  speaker  to  convene  a  meeting  of
members of the council of the Qaukeni local municipality, so  that  I  could
be able to then formally notify the council of this  decision.  The  council
indeed convened on 30 December 2003, at which meeting I  then  set  out  the
intentions that I had as a mandate from the executive council.

Chairperson, in the second last paragraph of the letter that I wrote, it  is
said that I hope the Speaker and the councillors  affected  will  co-operate
and accept this suspension as a sincere  and  positive  attempt  to  restore
proper administration, effective political management and the rule  of  law,
and restore an environment which will enable  their  council  to  once  more
fulfil its legislative and executive responsibilities, and for the level  of
service delivery that the people of Qaukeni both desire and  deserve  to  be
realised.

That really explains the thinking behind the letter and  the  struggle  that
we had before we intervened in the affairs of this municipality.  It  was  a
very sincere and positive attempt to restore the proper  administration  and
political management, as well as the rule of law, which had broken down.
The council accepted  that  decision.  I  then  wrote  to  the  council  and
notified the council that we had taken these steps in terms of  section  139
of the Constitution. I need not go back to it and read  them  here.  It  was
indeed not an easy decision. We worked very hard to ensure that  we  put  in
place an intervention strategy  that  would  ensure  that  we  restore  this
proper administration, political management and the rule of law, as  quickly
as possible, so that we can withdraw from  the  municipality.  We  are  also
mindful of the fact that  this  municipality  has  had  a  long  history  of
conflict. There have always been two conflicting parties  and  the  conflict
between the  two,  in  our  view,  has  come  to  a  point  where  they  are
irreconcilable.

My report to the executive council of the province, which  was  followed  by
assessment by members of the  council  led  by  the  premier,  came  to  one
conclusion: Indeed, there was a  need  for  an  intervention,  a  much  more
drastic  intervention.  At  the  beginning  of  2003,  around  January,  the
executive council took a decision that we should intervene and dissolve  the
municipality council. Our  view,  having  listened  to  advice  from  senior
counsel and the state law advisers, was that in the sequence of things  that
would be inappropriate. Therefore we needed to step back  and  intervene  in
terms of section 139 of the Constitution.

We heeded that advice from the  state  law  advisers  and  set  off  to  put
together a comprehensive strategy. We were mindful of the fact that,  having
been involved in the discussions and the interactions,  we  needed  to  have
political support to manage that  intervention,  so  that  we  did  not  act
subjectively, given the  history  of  disappointments  and  frustrations  in
interacting with the municipality.

We put in place a political support  team  that  consists  of  the  MEC  for
safety and liaison in the  province,  the  chairperson  of  Salga,  and  the
executive mayor  of  the  O  R  Tambo  district  municipality.  The  Qaukeni
municipality is in the  jurisdictional  area  of  the  O  R  Tambo  district
municipality. They are the members of the political team that is  supporting
me in my capacity as MEC for local government.

In so far as the administrator is concerned, we also thought  that  we  have
to learn from the structures Act. The structures Act, in our view,  provides
guidance in terms of how we should intervene.  We  may  be  wrong  here.  We
thought  that  we  should  learn  from  the  structures  Act,   which   then
establishes a mayor with committees around the  mayor,  so  that  the  mayor
could get the necessary strategic support.

Having learnt from the structures Act, we then decided to  put  in  place  a
strategic support team to the administrator so that he would not  be  taking
decisions, perhaps too subjectively, under  these  circumstances.  It  is  a
tough situation. We thought we needed  to  have  this  kind  of  environment
which would provide strategic support and assist the administrator to  think
carefully and properly about whatever steps needed to be taken.

In that regard, we thought that we should put in place  a  multidisciplinary
team of people to support the administrator. We have the  CEO  of  Salga  in
the Eastern Cape, Adv Graham Richards; we have the director of  the  special
investigative unit in the province, Adv Visagie; we had  commissioner  Lando
of the SA Police Service who later withdrew and who was replaced by a  chief
director from the  department  of  safety  and  liaison  in  the  provincial
government, Simon Meyer. We also have Messrs Wakhabe and Qhithi from  the  O
R  Tambo  district  municipality  and  senior  directors   of   the   senior
professional staff in the department of local government  in  the  province.
The appointment by us of Messrs Wakabhe and Qhithi was a strategic  move  on
our part, because Mr Qhithi is a municipal manager  and  Mr  Wakhabe  is  in
charge of the Indhinga Development  Agency  of  the  district  municipality,
responsible for development. Both of them are very  important,  particularly
in the post-intervention period which  we  need  to  have  the  municipality
mentored. We cannot do that. We do not have the  capacity  as  a  provincial
department to do so. We thought it wise to have these officials as  part  of
the strategic support team.

At the operational level we have a team of personnel  from  the  O  R  Tambo
district municipality as well as the department to  support  the  operations
of the municipality. It was necessary because at the beginning there was  no
co-operation whatsoever, particularly from senior management  of  the  staff
of the municipality. Up to now the director of finance of  the  municipality
has not been at work at all since the intervention. He has  reportedly  been
sick at the beginning and a couple of others behaved in the same way.

The municipal manager of the Qaukeni local  municipality  is  out  on  bail,
having been arrested following shootings which took place there. So  he  is,
in a sense, implicated because we do not know what the outcome of that  case
is going to be.

I wish to repeat in  this  august  House  here  that  it  was  not  easy  to
intervene in this municipality. I can  also  say  that  when  we  intervened
there was a major complaint from the community. We did a lot of  work  there
before the intervention. The main complaint  came  from  other  stakeholders
and it was that we took too long to intervene.  Really,  it  hurts  to  hear
them say that. It is true but the fact of the matter is  that,  essentially,
we do not want to intervene in the affairs of municipalities. We did not  do
it lightly. We are persuading this House to support  us.  Thank  you,  Madam
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, this ad hoc  committee  was  established  as
per Rule 161(a) in order to make an intervention under section 139(1)(b)  of
the Constitution. We wish to report to this House as  follows:  the  Qaukeni
municipality has been involved in a long, drawn-out political  dispute  that
the conflicting parties have, from  the  outset,  attempted  to  resolve  by
means of court action.

This has had significant financial implications and is  in  clear  violation
of sections 41(1)(h), 41(2) and 41(3) of the Constitution  of  the  Republic
of South Africa, Act  108  of  1996.  On  a  number  of  occasions  the  MEC
responsible  for  local  government  affairs  had  written  to  the  Qaukeni
council, met with the council and drawn its attention to the  concerns  that
the  various  stakeholders  had  raised  about  the  imminent  collapse   of
administration, political  management  and  the  rule  of  law  within  this
municipality.

A forensic audit was conducted by  the  Auditor-General  on  behalf  of  the
department.  The  report,  which  contains  specific  recommendations,   was
submitted to the municipal manager for action on  16  April  2003.  However,
for various reasons, the municipal manager refused to  take  action  on  the
recommendations. Consequently, the Qaukeni council has now reached  a  stage
where it is entirely unable to effectively fulfil  any  of  its  legislative
and executive obligations in terms of the Constitution and other  applicable
legislation, as referred to in the Municipal Structures Act.  As  a  result,
the MEC for local  government  affairs  launched  an  intervention  in  this
municipality on 30 December 2003.
The terms of the  intervention  were  that  on  30  December  2003  the  MEC
launched an intervention  in  this  municipality.  On  29  January  the  MEC
submitted a notice to the National  Council  of  Provinces  to  approve  the
intervention in compliance  with  section  139(2)(a)  of  the  Constitution.
Approval of this intervention is sought in order  to  implement  a  strategy
which focuses on the political strategy and operational areas,  as  the  MEC
has already indicated.

Action by the department to remedy the situation  was  that  the  department
undertook various actions at political, strategic and operational levels  in
an attempt to restore order in this municipality. At a political level,  the
department developed a support programme, in terms of  section  154  of  the
Constitution, to assist the municipality. At  a  strategic  level,  the  MEC
suspended the municipal council and appointed an administrator. A  strategic
support  team  was  established  to  assist  this   administrator.   At   an
operational level, the administrator suspended  the  municipal  manager  and
appointed an acting municipal manager.
Our visit, then, to Qaukeni on 8 to 10 February was  undertaken  because  we
wanted to establish whether there has been compliance  with  the  provisions
of section 139 of the Constitution; whether the prevailing circumstances  in
the municipality warrant  the  intervention;  and,  whether  there  are  any
measures other than an intervention that would  have  achieved  the  desired
effect.

During the period of our  visit,  we  met  with  various  stakeholders  that
included the MEC for local  government;  O  R  Tambo  District  Municipality
Executive Mayor - uMama uZoleka Capa; the SA  Local  Government  Association
led by the chairperson - Sakhumzi Somyo; the Eastern Cape strategic  support
team led by the administrator;  the  traditional  leaders  -  including  the
representatives of King Sigcau; religious leaders; the ANC Youth League  and
members of the community. We later visited the Qaukeni Great Place  and  met
uMaNdlunkulu [the queen].

Political instability in Qaukeni municipality started in June 2002 when  the
democratically elected mayor, Mr Ntsubane, and the speaker, Mr  Ngozi,  were
ousted by the council and replaced by the new mayor,  Mrs  Laleni,  and  the
new speaker, Mr Nabile. Mr Ntsubane and Mr Ngozi  moved  an  application  in
the High Court to declare the decision  of  the  council  to  oust  them  as
invalid.  The  High  Court  ordered  that  Mr  Ntsubane  and  Mr  Ngozi   be
reinstated. Mrs Laleni and  others  applied  for  leave  to  appeal  to  the
Supreme Court but failed to  prosecute  the  appeal  within  the  prescribed
period. Despite the judgment, Mrs Laleni and others failed  to  comply  with
the court order.

In December 2003 there were shootings at the municipality offices and  as  a
result municipal offices were closed. All  ordinary  services  were  stalled
during  this  period.  The  department  tried  to  resolve  the  matter   by
developing a management  support  programme.  This  programme  assisted  the
municipality,  amongst  others,  in  areas  of  budget  formulation,   asset
management, human resources and governance. The municipal  manager  did  not
comply with the support programme.

As far as service delivery is concerned, before the intervention  there  was
some  form  of  service  delivery  in   the   municipality.   However,   for
approximately 22 LED projects, only one person signed off cheques  and  paid
service providers. The Special Investigating Unit, which  was  appointed  as
part of the strategic team assisted by the administrator,  has  been  tasked
with conducting an investigation into irregularities in the LED projects  to
ascertain whether the R294 000 spent on  the  22  projects  is  commensurate
with the job done thus far.

The municipality did not have any procurement  policy  in  place  to  ensure
compliance  with  national  standards.  This  resulted  in  a  practice   of
corruption in the form of kickbacks.  The  Special  Investigating  Unit,  or
SIU,  is  investigating  such  allegations.  Despite   the   problems,   the
municipality  remained  unwilling  to  accept  guidance  from  the  district
municipality in the application of its equitable share.

There  was  a  lot  of  unauthorised  expenditure.  The   main   aspect   of
unauthorised expenditure relates to  the  access  of  the  political  office
bearers to municipal funds which were used to conduct their  court  actions.
After mayor Ntsubane was ousted, approximately R800 000  was  put  aside  in
the budget for legal costs. The money was wasted on court cases with  regard
to which the MEC had advised the Laleni group not to take  court  action  as
their action was not likely to succeed.

Regarding the lack of standing rules, it has been reported that many of  the
municipality's problems have been aggravated by a lack of standing rules  to
govern  the  council.  The  municipality  does  not  have  proper  tendering
procedures.

The municipality adopted the IDP  in  2002,  which  was  reviewed  in  2003.
Although the plan is  up  for  its  annual  review  in  2004,  the  inherent
limitations caused by the intervention process will mean that the task  team
will have to apply to the MEC to waive this review. Budgeting  for  IDPs  in
2004 will also likely be an internal process, as the municipality  will  not
be in a position to submit documents to the National Treasury.

Coming to  staff  issues,  there  have  been  allegations  of  nepotism  and
corruption in appointing staff.  Councillors  influence  management  on  the
appointment of staff and as a result the morale of staff is very low.  There
were two sets of staff members running parallel in the office - one for  the
ex-mayor and the other for the current mayor.

As far as public participation is concerned,  the  MEC  has  gone  to  great
lengths to ensure public participation in  the  intervention  process.  When
the administrator  was  appointed,  the  MEC  called  a  public  meeting  to
announce the appointment as well as the terms of reference for  delivery  by
the administrator. Furthermore, when  the  audit  investigative  report  was
eventually tabled and deliberated upon by the  strategic  task  team  on  26
January 2004, it was dealt with in a public meeting where  all  stakeholders
were present, including the King of Pondoland. The MEC  also  engaged  Salga
extensively on this matter.
A great deal of  progress  has  been  effected  by  the  administrator.  The
municipal manager has been suspended and  charges  have  been  laid  against
him. All municipal vehicles have been  returned,  except  the  one  that  is
still being held by mayor Laleni. All keys and locks of  all  doors  at  the
municipal buildings both in Flagstaff and in Lusikisiki have  been  changed.
There is a business plan that has been submitted to the  department  on  how
to deal with matters.

Regarding  the  response  to  this  intervention,   all   stakeholders   and
representatives  of  the  ad  hoc  committee  were  in  agreement  that  the
intervention was necessary. The community believes  that  intervention  will
bring normality  within  the  municipality  and  improve  service  delivery.
However, the community has  expressed  the  feeling  that  the  intervention
should  not  be  the  end  of  the  process  but  should  be   followed   by
investigations. Anyone who is found guilty of any irregularities  should  be
accountable.

On the resolutions of the committee, based on the  information  we  gathered
during the fact-finding mission, the ad hoc  committee  is  of  the  opinion
that the intervention at Qaukeni municipality was  not  only  necessary  but
also  long  overdue.  The  committee  is  satisfied  that   the   provincial
government had exhausted all other avenues prescribed  by  the  Constitution
and other legislation before launching the intervention. And, it is  of  the
opinion that intervention through suspension of the  council  was  the  only
reasonable step.

The committee thus recommends that the  intervention  by  the  Eastern  Cape
government in the Qaukeni municipality be approved  by  this  august  House;
that the office of the MEC submit a monthly report to the  National  Council
of Provinces in order  to  enable  the  NCOP  to  monitor  the  intervention
regularly - these monthly reports should focus on  terms  of  reference  for
the intervention, as well  as  areas  of  concern  raised  by  the  forensic
investigation report; and, that the community be kept  abreast  of  progress
made by the task  team  through  monthly  reports  and  regular  interaction
between the municipality and the community. A proper  communication  channel
should  be  established  to  facilitate  this  interaction.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I  wish  to  proceed
to put the question. But, before we proceed to vote on that,  we  will  ring
the bells in order to allow all  delegation  heads  to  be  present  in  the
Chamber.

We shall now proceed, hon members. I'm not certain why we  have  almost  50%
of the permanent delegates of the Council absent from the Chamber.  I  don't
quite understand because I don't think that we have assigned a large  number
to participate in provincial meetings. I know that there are  some  sittings
of provincial legislatures, but I'm not sure whether they  require  everyone
to be away.

We shall proceed therefore to put the question with respect to Order  No  5.
The question is that the report be adopted. This decision is dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution. I note that  all  delegation  heads
are present in the Chamber to cast their  provinces'  votes.  In  accordance
with Rule  71,  I  shall  allow  provinces  an  opportunity  to  make  their
declarations of vote if they wish to do so. Is there  any  province  wishing
to make a declaration of vote?  There  is  none.  We  proceed  therefore  to
voting on the  question.  This  will  be  done  in  alphabetical  order  per
province. Delegation heads should indicate  whether  they  vote  in  favour,
against or abstain from voting. The Eastern Cape?

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  All  provinces  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the report adopted. [Applause.] Might I  also,  on  behalf
of the House, thank the members who were part of that ad hoc  committee  for
working with such haste and yet producing a report that does  encompass  the
range of issues that they confronted. I thank  the  hon  members  for  their
hard work.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 ON PROTOCOL ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTIVE ACT OF THE AFRICAN UNION

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and hon members  of  the  House,  during  the
first session of the assembly of the African Union in Durban in  July  2002,
a number of amendments to the Constitutive Act of  the  African  Union  were
proposed. However, and in view of the required procedures described  in  the
Constitutive Act regarding amendments, the  proposed  amendments  were  only
discussed at three meetings which took place after the July  meeting.  These
meetings culminated in the first extraordinary session of  the  Assembly  of
the Heads of State and Government of the African Union, which took place  in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 2 February 2003.

The Assembly considered and endorsed recommendations made at  the  preceding
three  meetings.  In  order  to  give  effect  to  the  amendments,  the  AU
commission has drafted a protocol, presented  to  the  heads  of  state  and
government during the July 2003 Maputo summit, in which the  amendments  are
contained. The protocol must now be ratified by a simple majority of  member
states in order to give effect to the amended Constitutive Act.

At the inaugural summit in Durban it was therefore  decided  that  proposals
for amendments would be submitted to the interim commission  of  the  Union,
which would, in turn, distribute them to member states for consideration  in
accordance with the procedure outlined in article  32  of  the  Constitutive
Act.  In  addition,  the  assembly  decided  that  in  accordance  with  the
procedure set out in article 32, these amendments  would  be  considered  at
the extraordinary assembly within six months.

Member states proposing amendments included Libya, Senegal,  Nigeria,  South
Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Côte d'Ivoire. The proposals for  amendment
focused on two main themes, namely the strengthening and  technical  cleanup
of the Constitutive Act, which are proposals received  from  Nigeria,  South
Africa,  Mozambique,  Tanzania  and  Côte  d'Ivoire;   and   enhancing   the
continental integration process towards the early establishment of a  United
States of Africa or a  Federation  of  African  States  by  the  Libyan  and
Senegalese proposals.

The first extraordinary session of the executive  council  held  in  Tripoli
from  9  to  10  December  2002  was  convened  to  consider  the   proposed
amendments. Unresolved issues  were  referred  to  a  ministerial  committee
which met in Sun City from 20 to 21 January 2003 and  submitted  its  report
to the second extraordinary executive council meeting  held  on  1  February
2003, prior to the extraordinary session of the  assembly.  The  outcome  of
the ad hoc ministerial committee meeting  was  satisfactory  in  maintaining
momentum regarding technical changes to the Constitutive  Act,  rather  than
changing the nature of the union. Consensus was reached on all issues.

During the first session of the  extraordinary  assembly,  it  was  apparent
that  the  principles  established  by  the  first  extraordinary  executive
council had become  entrenched,  namely  that  amendments  should  focus  on
clarifying the Constitutive Act, that they should  ease  the  implementation
thereof and the integration of the union  is  at  an  early  stage  and  the
Constitutive Act should reflect this. The assembly upheld all the  proposals
emanating from the two executive council meetings, including a  satisfactory
solution to the issue of working and official languages. The  amendments  as
a whole reflect the South African approach of maintaining the  integrity  of
the Constitutive Act, while accommodating different perspectives.

The amendment as endorsed by the heads of state  and  government  have  been
contained in the protocol on the amendments to the Constitutive  Act,  which
will have to be ratified in order to give effect to the  amendment  as  part
of the revised Constitutive Act. In view of the fact  that  the  changes  to
the Constitutive Act were technical in  nature,  rather  than  changing  the
vision of the African  Union,  no  implications  are  foreseen  which  South
Africa has not already subscribed  to  by  joining  the  African  Union  and
ratifying its Constitutive Act.

The amendments have resulted  in  a  more  gender-sensitive  document  which
gives official recognition to the Peace and Security Council of the  African
Union, includes the importance of the African diaspora to the African  Union
and clarifies a number of procedural matters, including the use of  official
and technical languages. The protocol will be binding on the  Republic  upon
approval by both Houses of the South African Parliament.

On behalf of the  Select  Committee  on  Economic  and  Foreign  Affairs,  I
request the House to support the approval of  the  protocol.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We will deal with  the  decision  in  terms  of
section 65 of the  Constitution.  I  note  that  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes.

In accordance with rule 71, I shall first allow provinces an opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote if they wish to do so.

Is there any province wishing to make a declaration of vote? There is  none.

     CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND
                       ADMINISTRATION - ANNUAL REPORT

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you very much, hon Chairperson and  hon  colleagues.
It is with much humility and appreciation that  I  present  the  committee's
report to this august House.

The vision of the Select Committee on Local  Government  and  Administration
can be summarised as follows: to focus the committee's work in  the  context
of  the  challenges  of  economic  growth,  job  creation,  development  and
democracy; to link the committee's work to central  challenges  set  out  in
the policy statements by the Government, including the state of  the  nation
address, the Minister of Finance's Budget  Speech  and  state  of  provinces
addresses by the premiers.

Thus  our  mission  is  set  out  as  follows:  to  ensure   the   effective
implementation   of   the   system   of    co-operative    governance    and
intergovernmental relations, as enshrined in  the  Constitution;  to  ensure
the effective implementation of  the  new  model  of  local  government;  to
monitor the implementation of the urban  renewal  programme  and  integrated
sustainable rural development; to contribute towards defining  the  role  of
traditional leaders in a democratic South Africa; to ensure that the  system
of governance facilitates significant service delivery  and  development  in
the  country;  to  exercise  oversight  on  issues   related   to   disaster
management, cultural and linguistic rights and other matters dealt  with  by
the Department of Provincial and  Local  Government;  to  facilitate  public
participation  in  Parliament  and  in  the  legislatures  on   matters   of
governance and development; and, lastly, to  exercise  oversight  on  issues
dealt with by the Ministry  and,  in  fact,  by  the  Department  of  Public
Service and Administration.

Our objectives are also set out briefly as follows:  to  exercise  oversight
on service delivery; to monitor the quality  of  service  delivered  by  the
Public Service in relation to the Batho Pele principles, including  the  set
standards in the Public Service Act and Public Finance  Management  Act;  to
exercise oversight over the Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government
with more focus on the consolidation of the  new  local  government  system,
including  new  local  government  financial  systems  and  legislation;  to
facilitate   co-operative   governance   relationships   with    traditional
leadership; and, to process  legislation  and  amendments  whenever  we  are
called upon to do so. Also, members are welcome to suggest amendments  where
necessary in the legislation.

The list of entities that are overseen by this committee are the  following.
They are the Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration  with  the
following  institutions  and  parastatals:  the  SA  Management  Development
Institute, Samdi; the Public Service Commission, PSC; the State  Information
and Technology Agency, Sita; and the Public Service Sectoral  Education  and
Training Authority.

With regard to the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  the
following institutions are overseen by the committee.  They  are  the  Local
Government Water and Related Services  Seta;  the  Municipal  Infrastructure
Investment Unit; the National House of Traditional Leaders;  and,  organised
local government. Other stakeholders are: organised groups such as NGOs  and
CBOs, and the SA National Civics Organisation.

During the period of our report the following  pieces  of  legislation  were
dealt with. We dealt with the Local Government: Municipal Structures  Second
Amendment Bill. The Bill was finalised on  10  March  and  debated  in  this
House on 12 March. We also dealt, informally so, with the Local  Government:
Property  Rates  Bill  and  provinces  were  briefed  on   this   piece   of
legislation. Although it is a section 75 Bill, it is currently in the  hands
of the National Assembly and we expect it to be tabled in our  committee  by
26 February.

We also dealt with the Local Government: Municipal Systems  Amendment  Bill.
This Bill was dealt with, finalised and voted on on 20 November  last  year.
Perhaps  another  watershed  piece  of  legislation  was   the   Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill,  which  was  dealt  with  in  this
House and voted on on 26 November. This Bill is still a work in progress  as
provinces still have to promulgate relevant legislation which is  particular
to their provinces. We will be receiving a  briefing  about  development  in
this regard in the coming week.

Regarding other matters dealt with, owing to the outcry  about  capacity  in
local government,  the  committee  requested  a  briefing  by  the  relevant
sectoral education and training authority as to what it was doing  to  bring
capacity to local government. We learnt that there were  various  strategies
adopted by organised local government at this Seta, and work is in  progress
in that regard.

Another highlight of this year in the committee's work was  the  observation
of the rural bias enshrined in the budget of the  Department  of  Provincial
and Local Government. Briefly, in  this  regard  we  observed  an  increased
allocation  of  funding  and  resources  aimed  especially  at   the   rural
municipalities.

Another  matter  that  we  dealt  with  was  the  briefing  by  the  various
legislatures in the  form  of  a  section  106  investigation.  We  received
communication from the Department of Provincial and Local Government in  the
Northern Cape province and we went out as a committee  to  do  oversight  on
three municipalities in the Northern Cape.

This is still a work in progress. We are awaiting progress  as  to  what  is
happening in that regard. May I report to this House that  the  section  106
investigation is posing serious challenges for this House as,  in  terms  of
this legislation, the provincial government only notifies this  House  about
an investigation. The province is not compelled  or  expected  to  give  any
feedback or anything whatsoever to this House. We can only use other  pieces
of legislation in order to  support  those  provinces  who  report  problems
specific to those municipalities. There are still discussions  going  on  as
to how we can go about embellishing the confines as observed in  this  piece
of legislation.

We also received the following briefing concerning the National  Centre  for
Disaster Management. We also visited  this  centre  in  order  to  ascertain
whether it was ready and transformed in order to deal with the  matters  and
challenges  facing  it.  We  were  heartened  to  note  that  this  disaster
management centre does not only serve the needs of  the  Republic  but  also
those of all SADC countries that may call upon it for assistance.

Various matters were referred to this committee by way of the  ATC,  and  we
note and report to this House that several of these  matters  could  not  be
dealt with in terms of their finality owing to the  confines  of  time.  The
committee also noted, when dealing with this  report,  that  more  time  was
allocated to matters relating to local  government.  It  is  our  assessment
that the committee should have a relook at  this  matter  since  it  appears
that it allocates about 65% of its  time  and  commitment  to  dealing  with
matters of local government and only  about  35%  of  its  time  to  matters
dealing with the Public Service and administration.

Finally, may I also acknowledge the full-time  and  unwavering  support  and
commitment of committee members who serve in this  committee.  As  we  note,
some  of  the  activities  involving  this  committee  are   unplanned   and
unforeseen activities, such as disasters and  interventions.  Regardless  of
these confines and pressing time  constraints,  members  of  this  committee
have been very meticulous when dealing with  matters  when  called  upon.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  I  shall  now
put the question. The question  is  that  the  report  be  adopted.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to
cast their provinces' votes. Are they all present? [Interjections.] Yes.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if  there  are  any.  Is  there  anyone?
None.

We shall now proceed to the voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour of, against or abstain. Eastern Cape?

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
                           AFFAIRS - ANNUAL REPORT

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. It  is  with  pride  and  honour
that I report to  this  House  on  some  of  the  things  contained  in  the
committee's annual report. I am talking about  the  dynamic  and  calculated
Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs.
The list  of  clients  or  entities  overseen  by  this  committee  are  the
following: the Departments of Justice,  Safety  and  Security,  Correctional
Services, Defence  and  partly  the  Department  of  Intelligence.  We  also
oversee Armscor  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  Department  of  Safety  and
Security.

In dealing with these departments, we had  to  look  into  some  balance  of
forces and some motivating forces and  come  up  with  some  strategies  and
tactics. The committee had to grapple with a number of things - the  passing
of  legislation  and  other  international  agreements  and  protocols.  The
committee passed 14 Bills and 13 agreements  and  protocols  within  a  very
short space of time.

I am avoiding going into detail about these Bills  and  protocols,  assuming
that my colleagues have gone through  the  reports  and  if  there  are  any
queries, they will come to the committee to advise us  accordingly,  because
I know my hon colleagues in the House are good readers.

The committee got briefings from all our clients.  By  clients,  as  I  said
initially, I am referring to all those departments.  We  also  invited  some
officials who are dealing with some specific issues  to  appear  before  the
committee.

The aim of this interaction  by  this  committee  with  its  clients  is  to
oversee their operations and to monitor their expenditure patterns in  terms
of the Public Finance  Management  Act,  the  Public  Service  Act  and  the
implementation of legislation.

The committee managed to visit no fewer than six  provinces.  Our  visit  to
police stations was to look into various issues affecting  police  officers,
their working conditions, if there is transformation in  those  departments,
if they are getting the necessary support from the department, and to  check
if investigations of reported cases are properly carried out.

We are doing all this not because  we  are  trying  to  point  fingers,  but
because of complaints received from communities. When going out there, as  I
said, we are not only  trying  to  find  fault  but  to  also  motivate  and
encourage our police officers to work even harder.

The committee also visited magisterial offices  whose  aim  was  to  closely
scrutinise the implementation of the new courts process projects  to  assess
its effectiveness on a continuous basis, and to  undertake  periodic  visits
to courts and hold consultations  with  all  the  relevant  stakeholders  to
determine whether any problems exist with regard to  the  administration  of
justice.

The committee visited maintenance offices after  receiving  complaints  from
beneficiaries. We discovered horrible things in those  offices.  Because  of
our decisive interventions, many of those officials in  those  offices  were
arrested.

The committee visited our prisons which are overpopulated. The  overcrowding
in those prisons makes it impossible for the inmates to be  effectively  and
properly rehabilitated.

The  committee  was  supposed  to  have  visited  Canada   regarding   their
rehabilitation programme which seems to be very effective. The trip did  not
materialise because of some logistical and  technical  problems.  But,  with
the kind of leadership we have in the NCOP, I  do  not  have  the  slightest
doubt that those committee members who will  be  fortunate  enough  to  come
back after the elections will be allowed to go on that trip.

Because of  the  number  of  clients  that  have  to  be  serviced  by  this
committee, we have made a submission to the budget  sub-committee  that  our
budget be increased. With the hon Mr Ralane in that budget committee, we  do
not have any reason not to be optimistic and smile.

I urge members to go through the report. If they feel they  need  to  advise
us on anything, they are welcome to do so. We are  saying  that  because  we
have adopted an open-door policy.

Let me thank the committee  members  for  their  undivided  and  unqualified
support and loyalty. This committee has done  a  wonderful  job  because  of
you, colleagues. This committee is what it is because of you.

It is our culture that after I  have  spoken,  someone  must  stand  up  and
support what I have said.  That  person  is  none  other  than  the  hon  Mr
Matthee.

I now humbly commit the committee's annual report  to  this  Chamber.  Thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, hierdie komitee het  gehandel  met  nie  minder
nie as 11 artikel 75-wetsontwerpe. Wysigings of amendemente is  ten  opsigte
van vier  van  daardie  artikel  75-wetsontwerpe  voorgestel.  Dit  het  ook
gehandel met twee Grondwetwysigings.

Dit het gehandel met 12 internasionale ooreenkomste  en  protokolle.  As  ek
net vir 'n oomblik kan  stilstaan  by  die  internasionale  ooreenkomste  en
protokolle; ek dink dat die amptenare wat hiermee werk tot die  besef  gekom
het dat ons in hierdie komitee nie maar net 'n rubberstempel gaan  wees  ten
opsigte van hierdie ooreenkomste nie. Ons het werklik daarop aangedring  dat
daar behoorlik daarna gekyk word aangesien ons wou seker  wees  voordat  ons
dit goedkeur.

Die voordeel van hierdie komitee is dat al die departemente betrokke by  die
strafregpleging en die voorkoming en  bekamping  van  misdaad  deur  hierdie
komitee gehanteer word. Dit is daarom moontlik vir  hierdie  komitee  -  dit
was ook moontlik - om  'n  holistiese  beeld  te  kry  van  die  hele  Suid-
Afrikaanse  strafregstelsel.  Dit  is  'n  baie  groot   voordeel   bo   die
verskillende  portefeuljekomitees  in   die   Nasionale   Vergadering,   wat
uiteraard net 'n beperkte  insig  kan  ontwikkel  ten  opsigte  van  daardie
spesifieke departement waarmee hulle werk, sonder om die voordeel te hê  wat
hierdie  komitee  het  om  'n  geheelbeeld  van  die  hele   Suid-Afrikaanse
strafregpleging te kan ontwikkel en sodanige insig te kan hê.

Die feit dat daar 11 Artikel 75-wetsontwerpe behandel is, en  dat  wysigings
ten opsigte van vier daarvan voorgestel is, beklemtoon,  myns  insiens,  die
uiters belangrike funksie van die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies  ook  as  'n
tipiese hoërhuis van hersiening. Hoewel die klem dikwels  net  geplaas  word
op die rol van die  Nasionale  Raad  van  Provinsies  vis-à-vis  provinsies,
bewys die werk en die funksie van hierdie komitee  die  groot  belangrikheid
van hierdie Raad ook ten opsigte van nasionale aangeleenthede.

Ons insiens behoort hierdie rol  van  die  NRP  nooit  onderskat  of  gering
geskat te word nie. Dít is in baie tweede of hoërhuise  in  die  wêreld  die
enigste funksie wat sodanige Huise vervul.

Ten slotte wil ek graag die voorsitter, Kgoshi Mokoena, baie bedank  vir  sy
voortreflike leierskap en, op 'n ligter noot, wil ek sê  dat  hy  amper  kan
toetree tot die geledere van ereregsgeleerdes, want u sien  hy  het  net  op
een geleentheid die regsadvies van 'n staatsregsadviseur  bo  myne  aanvaar.
Maar ná die debat in die Huis dink ek hy het tot ander insigte gekom. Hy  is
werklik 'n baie bekwame  voorsitter  wat,  soos  ek  sê,  amper  alreeds  'n
regsgeleerde in eie reg kan wees.

Die werk van hierdie komitee is  ook  'n  goeie  bewys  dat  ons,  soos  wat
aangedui is in ander debatte - ook deur die Voorsitter van  hierdie  Raad  -
eintlik werklik meer permanente lede in hierdie  Raad  nodig  het.  Ons  het
vanmiddag geluister na beide die verslae van die voorsitter van die  komitee
wat handel met plaaslike regering en administrasie en ook  na  dié  van  die
voorsitter van hierdie komitee. En as 'n mens kyk  na  die  omvang  van  die
werk wat hierdie twee komitees doen, en ons  kyk  na  die  aantal  lede  wat
nodig is in die ander plekke in die Parlement  om  daardie  selfde  werk  te
doen, dan besef 'n mens dat - en in hierdie geval dien die  meeste  van  die
lede van hierdie twee komitees op altwee komitees -  dit  werklik  'n  groot
taak is. Daarom dink ek dit is nodig dat ons in  die  nuwe  termyn,  na  die
verkiesing, spesifiek daarna moet kyk om meer  permanente  lede  in  hierdie
Raad te kry.

Dit is vir my 'n groot voorreg om voor te stel dat die Raad hierdie  verslag
aanvaar. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, this committee has dealt with  no  fewer  than
11 section 75 Bills. Amendments were proposed in respect of  four  of  those
section 75 Bills. It also dealt with two constitutional amendments.

It dealt with 12 international agreements and protocols.  I  would  like  to
dwell for a moment on the international agreements and  protocols;  I  think
the officials who work with these have come  to  realise  that  we  in  this
committee are not going to be merely a rubber  stamp  in  respect  of  these
agreements. We insisted that they be looked at properly  because  we  wanted
to be certain before we approved them.

The advantage  of  this  committee  is  that  all  departments  involved  in
criminal justice and the prevention and combating of crime  are  dealt  with
by this committee. Therefore it is possible for  this  committee  -  it  was
also possible - to obtain a  holistic  image  of  the  whole  South  African
system of criminal law. It is a great advantage above the various  portfolio
committees in the National Assembly, who can develop only a limited  insight
in respect of that specific department with which they are working,  without
having the advantage of this committee to be able to form an  overall  image
of the whole  South  African  criminal  justice  system  and  to  have  such
insight.

The fact that 11 section 75 Bills were dealt with, and that amendments  were
proposed in respect of four of them, in my opinion  emphasises  the  crucial
function of the National Council of  Provinces  also  as  a  typical  higher
court of revision. Although the emphasis often falls only  on  the  role  of
the National Council of Provinces vis-á-vis  provinces,  the  work  and  the
function of this committee prove the great importance of this  Council  also
in respect of national matters.

In our opinion this role of the NCOP  should  never  be  underestimated.  In
many second or higher  Houses  in  the  world  this  is  the  only  function
fulfilled by such Houses.

In conclusion I would like to thank the chairman, Kgoshi  Mokoena,  for  his
excellent leadership and, in a lighter vein, I want  to  say  he  is  almost
ready to join the ranks of the honorary lawyers, because, you see,  on  only
one occasion did he accept the legal advice of a  state  law  adviser  above
mine. But after the debate in the House I think he came to  other  insights.
He is truly a very competent chairperson who, as I say, can  almost  already
be a lawyer in his own right.

The work of this committee is also good  proof  that  we,  as  indicated  in
other debates - also by the Chairperson of this Council  -  actually  really
need more permanent members in this Council. This afternoon we  listened  to
both the reports of the chairperson of  the  committee  dealing  with  local
government and administration  and  to  that  of  the  chairperson  of  this
committee. And if one looks  at  the  scope  of  the  work  that  these  two
committees must do, and we look at the number of members who  are  necessary
in other places in Parliament to do that same work, then one  realises  that
- and in this case most of the members of  these  two  committees  serve  on
both committees - it is really an enormous task. For that reason I think  it
is necessary that in the new term, after the election, we must  specifically
try to get more permanent members in this Council.

I find it a great  privilege  to  propose  that  the  Council  accepts  this
report. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
