                 RESULT OF BY-ELECTION HELD IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) Notes -


       (a)  the result of the recent by-election held on 11 February in ward
           12 in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal;


       (b)  that the ACDP has increased its share  of  the  votes  by  200%,
           namely from 4.1% in 2000 to 13.7% of votes cast;


       (c)  that the DA vote has decreased from 62.98% in  2000  to  44.29%;
           and


       (d)  that the increased share of the vote for the ACDP  indicates  an
           increased awareness among the electorate to return  to  policies
           promoting family values, social stability and  economic  growth;
           and


  (2) acknowledges the active participation of all those who  came  out  to
       vote for their respective  parties  and  all  officials  involved  in
       making this by-election a success.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  any
objection to the motion? [Interjections.]  There  is  an  objection  to  the
motion. Therefore, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion  without
notice will now become notice of a motion.

        THE ABOVE-AVERAGE FLEXIBILITY OF SOUTH AFRICA'S LABOUR MARKET

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

That the Council -


  (1) notes that, according to the World Bank, labour market flexibility in
       our country is well above average, while recent research  shows  that
       South African productivity compares well with the global average  and
       that the real cost of labour is falling;


  (2) is appalled, therefore, at the DA's call for Government to  make  our
       labour market more flexible;


  (3) believes that the DA's policy of a less regulated workplace will  not
       create jobs but will reverse the hard-fought gains of  workers,  lead
       to the scrapping of minimum wages and make the hiring and  firing  of
       workers easier;


  (4) further believes that this will perpetuate conditions of poverty even
       among employed workers; and


  (5) commends our ANC Government on the implementation  of  a  legislative
       framework that -


       (a)  increases the protection of workers;


       (b)  extends protection to marginalised sectors such  as  farmworkers
           and domestic workers; and
       (c)  promotes greater stability in the workplace.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  any
objection to that motion? There is an objection to the motion. In the  light
of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The  motion  without
notice will now become notice of a motion.

     AMENDMENT OF A RESOLUTION TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL ON 11 FEBRUARY 2004

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D M KGWARE: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:

That the Council resolves that the resolution adopted by the Council  on  11
February 2004, and reflected in the Minutes of Proceedings of that  day,  be
amended  by  the  substitution  in  paragraph  4  of  Item  5  of  the  word
"unqualified" by the word "underqualified".

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                     (The late Archbishop Denis Hurley)

Mrs C NKUNA: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:

That the Council -


     (1)    mourns with a deep sense of loss the passing away of  Archbishop
         Dennis Hurley;


     (2)    remembers him  as  a  dedicated  and  tireless  activist  and  a
         believer in reconciliation, communal harmony and social justice;


     (3)    expresses its sincere condolences to the members of his bereaved
         family; and


     (4)    wishes them strength to bear the pain of this untimely loss.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                      (The late Mr Sipho Sydney Makana)

Mr G A LUCAS: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes with sadness the untimely passing away of Mr Sipho  Sydney
        Makana;


   (2)      recalls his invaluable contribution to the establishment of  our
        democracy as a freedom fighter, as a member of the  Senate  of  the
        post-apartheid Parliament and later as South Africa's Ambassador to
        Vietnam;


   (3)      believes Mr Makana leaves behind a legacy  of  activism  in  the
        most difficult of circumstances and an active movement of people to
        continue the monumental tasks of consolidating democracy; and


   (4)      further believes that, in this sad moment, we cannot  do  better
        than to pledge  to  continue  the  struggle  fought  by  him  until
        complete justice is attained.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICES - ANNUAL
                                   REPORT

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Kwekhu,  yande  nale  nkqubo,  Sihlalo.  Enkosi  Sihlalo.
[Alas! This is such a long programme, Chair. Thank you, Chair.]

Deputy Chairperson, in terms of Rule 102, subsection 2(b), the committee  is
obliged and required to report to this Council on its  activities  at  least
once a year. Furthermore, section 6(a) of the Constitution bestows upon  the
NCOP or its committee discretionary powers to summon any  person  to  appear
before it in order to give evidence under oath or affirmation or to  produce
documents.

This has been adhered to by our committee, and the  following  organisations
or institutions were therefore summoned: the  SA  Taxi  Council's  executive
committee; the SA National Road Agency Limited, led by their CEO,  Mr  Nazir
Ali; the  Department  of  Public  Works;  the  Department  of  Housing;  the
Department of Transport, and the Commission on the Road Accident  Fund,  led
by Judge Kathleen Satchwell.

We have played an effective and robust oversight role  with  regard  to  the
above-mentioned departments when it comes to improvement in the  quality  of
the lives of all South Africans.

The following pieces of  legislation  were  processed:  the  National  Ports
Authority Bill, after taking a long, protracted journey from  the  portfolio
committee to the NCOP, was dealt with, but  later  withdrawn.  However,  the
aim of the Bill was to establish an independent authority to manage and  own
ports, as well as to remove the authority over ports from the management  of
Transnet.

The National Roads Traffic Amendment Bill was  finalised  by  the  committee
and adopted by this august House. This Bill was proposing to provide,  anew,
a period in which driving licences contained in the ID documents  and  those
that are not contained therein shall be deemed to  be  driving  licences  in
terms of this  Act,  and  to  empower  the  Minister  of  Transport  to  set
different dates.

It is with great pleasure that I give an overview of  the  Select  Committee
on Public Services. This is a committee with dedicated  permanent  delegates
from all provinces, except one, namely the Western Cape. Mrs  Versveld  used
to attend temporarily, but she has now decided to stay away altogether  from
the committee.

Nevertheless, the committee works in unison, as a team, with  the  desirable
political  vibrancy,  and  allows  space  for  any  form   of   constructive
criticism. There are positive contributions by  individual  members  towards
the mandated vision and mission statement of the committee, the  details  of
which I will not go into now as it is contained in your report, members.

Although clustered  around  three  departments,  often  our  work  does  not
balance with these arrangements owing to the fact that  our  priority  plans
get  frustrated  by  institutional  last-minute  changes  and  corresponding
times. As a result, the committee tends  to  focus  on  its  activities  and
participation only in two departments, namely Housing and  Transport,  owing
to the inclusive, accommodative and receptive  nature  of  our  relationship
with them.

Therefore, we note with great concern that we are  unable  to  play  a  more
proactive  oversight  role  regarding  the  Public   Works   department,   a
department that we view as a key institution in the  efforts  to  push  back
the frontiers of  poverty.  It  is  our  belief  that  with  regard  to  the
deteriorating  state  of  our  country's  rural  roads  infrastructure   and
property of Government, this department ought  to  make  a  more  meaningful
contribution.

One point that deserves particular mention here is  the  clustering  of  the
committees in the NCOP as a whole. While the number of  permanent  delegates
remains a fundamental issue, with constitutional  implications,  of  course,
the clustering of three to five departments into various  one-shop  entities
in the NCOP system does not assist the members to focus  on  and  specialise
in their work.

Members serve on more than one  select  committee  with  various  Government
portfolios or departments, and can never be expected to  pay  the  necessary
attention as well as play the active role that is expected  of  them.  As  a
result, members lose focus.

The mere fact that members are expected to serve  on  all  these  committees
places an unfair demand on them. The absence of a researcher to support  the
committee during the period of reporting also deserves  particular  mention.
The committee was incapacitated and derailed in terms of research  capacity,
owing to an apparent resignation of a committee researcher.  The  management
did  not  even  have  the  courtesy  to  inform  the  committee  about  this
resignation, let alone recruit, appoint or replace him/her with somebody  to
assist the committee on a full-time basis.

With regard to provincial oversight, it suffices to state  that  during  the
same period, no provincial visit or study tours, as  outlined  in  the  2003
programme,  were  undertaken  merely  because  of  a   tight   parliamentary
programme. Nevertheless, public participation  is  initiated  through  media
programmes dealing with our areas of focus, namely housing subsidy  schemes,
Arrive Alive, the Road Accident Fund, Taxi Recapitalisation, etc.

Suggestions that were made were forwarded to the relevant  departments.  The
committee identified the  need  for  a  snap  debate  on  the  Arrive  Alive
campaign, which struck a high note in this House shortly  before  the  start
of the festive season, in order to sensitise  the  members  and  the  entire
public about the importance and the seriousness of road safety.

The committee was, once again, handicapped for three months when it  had  to
operate without the  services  of  a  committee  secretary  or  a  committee
assistant secretary, who was forcefully taken away from us to the  portfolio
committee. We fought tooth and nail,  with  the  backing  of  the  Chair  of
Committees, uMam' uJoyce Kgoali, and Deputy  Chairperson,  uTat'  uMahlangu.
They put the last nail in the coffin of the committee  section.  Thank  you,
MaKgoali and Deputy Chairperson, we managed to get them back.

The committee would also like to thank  MaKgoali  for  her  leadership;  her
transparent, unwavering and honest leadership to  committees.  At  times  we
wake her up at five o'clock because we are  stranded  somewhere  and  cannot
get to other areas where we are supposed to play  our  oversight  role.  But
she has always been there for us. Thanks to  the  support  staff  for  their
commitment and their diligence in serving this committee.
Deputy Chairperson, I also wish to thank all  the  members  of  this  House,
specifically the members who participated in this select committee. I  think
I'm standing here for the last time on behalf of the committee,  before  the
election victory of the ANC. I thank you. [Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
                               - ANNUAL REPORT

Mr B J TOLO:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, it is our pleasure to present to this House the annual report  of
the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs. You will realise  that
this committee only started its activities at the end of March or  beginning
of April last year. This was due to the fact that  its  former  chairperson,
Comrade Mohseen Moosa, had resigned at the beginning  of  the  year.  A  new
chair was only appointed on 24 March the same year. The committee  therefore
was not functional for almost three months in the year under review.

The main brief of the committee,  as  you  will  be  aware,  is  to  process
legislation and do the oversight  work  of  three  departments,  namely  the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Minerals and Energy  and
the Department of Foreign Affairs.

As far as the processing of legislation is  concerned,  in  the  year  under
review we managed to deal with nine Bills which came before  the  committee.
Six of these Bills came from the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and
three from the Department of Minerals and Energy. Two of  these  Bills  were
section 76 Bills and were in fact principal Bills and not amending Bills.

As a committee we managed to improve some of the Bills that came before  us.
We would like to thank members of the committee  for  the  outstanding  work
they did in that respect.

On oversight, we managed to debrief both  Ministers  and  officials  of  the
different departments that we dealt with. These  committee  members  managed
to make constructive comments and suggestions to the  departments.  We  know
that the Department of Trade and Industry has established and  enlisted  the
services of a number  of  institutions  that  are  collectively  called  the
Council of Trade and Industry institutions, or Coti institutions. These  are
institutions  like  Khula,  Ntsika,  the  Competition  Commission  and  many
others.

We have met with some of them to establish whether they were  living  up  to
their mandates. We must indicate that there are  problems  here  and  there,
but overall we as a committee think that they are on the right track.

During the year under review, we also undertook a trip to Limpopo. There  we
met with departmental officials and other stakeholders in the  economy.  The
trip gave us invaluable experience, as we got first-hand  information  about
the successes and frustrations of the province,  both  at  government  level
and with regard to other stakeholders like Nafcoc. For instance, as  far  as
Nafcoc is concerned, black economic empowerment  has  not  filtered  to  the
rural provinces. Its impact is felt only in Gauteng, they claim.

One objective problem that we are faced with in the committee is  the  known
fact of there being only a few members in every committee. As a  result,  we
struggle  to  form  quorums  at  committee  meetings.  The   clustering   of
committees, as indicated by hon Majodina, may have advantages in  the  NCOP,
given the same problem of numbers. But there are  obvious  disadvantages.  A
member who serves in my committee, which deals with three departments,  also
serves in hon Nkuna's committee and there  he  or  she  also  deals  with  a
further  three  departments.  All  in  all,  this  person  deals  with   six
departments. This will inevitably result in a lack of efficiency in  all  of
us. The  member  goes  to  every  meeting  half  prepared.  This  is  not  a
lamentation but a reality that we face in the committee.

In conclusion, I want to reiterate the comment we made in  our  report  that
economics  is  a  specialised  field,  and  that  we  should  look  at   the
possibility of treating it like  finance,  that  we  should  have  dedicated
members where possible. We would like to commend this report  to  the  House
for adoption. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question and the question is that the report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provincial votes. Are you all  present?
In terms of Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces an  opportunity  to  make
their declarations of vote if they so wish. Is there any province? None.  We
shall now proceed to voting on the question. We shall do so  alphabetically.
Delegation heads must indicate to the Chair whether  they  vote  in  favour,
against or abstain. Eastern Cape?

Constitution.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - ANNUAL REPORT

Mr G A LUCAS: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson. As you can  see  the  trend
is that chairpersons are presenting their reports.  Nonetheless,  there  has
not  been  any  coup  d'état  in  the  finance  committee.  Therefore,  this
statement is on behalf of the chairperson of the finance committee.

The year 2003 was the most difficult and challenging year  in  the  life  of
the committee since its inception in August 1999. This was  so,  because  we
began to understand our work environment. The committee  has  had  quite  an
engaging agenda at the beginning of the year which was followed  through  to
its challenging conclusion.

Despite  these  challenges,  we  were  in  a   position   to   execute   our
constitutional responsibilities:  that  of  passing  important  legislation;
conducting public hearings; and going on oversight visits  to  some  of  the
institutions we are overseeing. The work we have done in the course  of  the
year has been immense, and we would like to commend  Government  for  making
strides in areas where infrastructure never existed.

Government has been able, through the DPSA, to help  municipalities  who  do
not  have  any  form  of  revenue  base  from  which  to  borrow  money  for
infrastructure development for the benefit of the poorest  of  the  poor  in
rural areas.

We were also able to approve the Municipal Finance Management Bill  for  all
municipalities in the country.  This  legislation  is  meant  to  provide  a
framework for treasury norms and standards in the public sector. We  are  of
the opinion that in due course all municipalities  will  be  able  to  align
their systems in  accordance  with  the  above-mentioned  legislation.  This
legislation will result in improved service delivery, efficiency,  a  proper
budgeting framework that is aligned to IDPs, and in bringing  municipalities
in line with the National Budget Framework, the MTEF.

Public hearings were  also  held  on  the  Preferential  Procurement  Policy
Framework Act. These  hearings  were  quite  successful,  and  a  number  of
stakeholders participated  immensely.  What  is  quite  clear  is  that  our
structures at the various spheres of Government need to align  their  policy
and policy framework to ensure that they are able to achieve the  guidelines
as set out in the preferential procurement policy framework.  What  is  also
quite clear  from  those  hearings  is  that  the  majority  of  black-owned
companies felt that the framework itself was not benefiting  black  economic
empowerment. And that is a matter that the new  Parliament  ought  to  focus
on, ensuring that black economic empowerment does find meaning in  terms  of
our procurement system at the level of government.
The committee takes particular pride in the strides that it made  pertaining
to its involvement with regard to the budget  process,  and  to  ensure  the
involvement of provinces and municipalities in this very important  process.
Standing committees, Salga and other relevant stakeholders  participated  in
the process of the  division  of  revenue,  but  also  participated  in  the
overall budget hearings, and this has given meaningful participation to  our
structures as a whole.

On behalf of the chairperson, let me take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the
committee members who executed their duties  with  commitment  and  purpose,
and congratulate them on their hard work and the  quality  results  that  we
have accomplished. Without their contribution the  provincial  participation
and quality of Bills pushed through the corridors of  Parliament  would  not
have been possible to achieve. I am certain that this display of  commitment
on their side will surely be documented in due course. I salute all  members
from  all  political  parties  for  their  sincere  participation  and   the
chairperson thanks you all for your participation. Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question, and the question is  that  the  report
be adopted. As the decision is dealt with in terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether all the delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. Are you all  present?
Now, in  accordance  with  rule  71,  I  shall  first  allow  provinces  the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they so wish.  Any?  None.
We shall now proceed to the voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour, against or abstain. Eastern Cape?

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.
      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
                         ENTERPRISES - ANNUAL REPORT

Mrs C NKUNA:  Hon  colleagues,  I  thank  you.  This  is  the  Chairperson's
overview. Over the period of 12 months, the Select Committee on  Labour  and
Public  Enterprises  held  17  meetings  towards  the  realisation  of   its
objectives as stipulated in the report. The activities of the committee  are
characterised by a number of achievements as  well  as  further  constraints
which helped provide a broader perspective. The  first  achievement  regards
the oversight function. The committee undertook an international study  tour
to Germany from 19 April to 25 April in the year 2003.

The report was published in the ATCs and debated in the NCOP  Chamber  on  9
September 2003. The committee's recommendations are reflected in  section  8
of this report. Furthermore, on 21 August 2003, the committee  conducted  an
oversight visit to Limpopo  province  to  assess  challenges  faced  by  the
telecommunications and postal services sectors in the province.  The  report
was published in the ATCs and was to be debated by the NCOP  in  the  coming
year.   Based  on  the  visit,  recommendations  were  made  and  these  are
reflected in section 8 of this report.

Then, the other achievement is in respect of legislation.  Three  pieces  of
legislation were referred for the committee  to  scrutinise  and  report  on
within the stipulated time period.  These  pieces  of  legislation  are  the
Skills Development  Amendment  Bill,  Bill  46  of  2003;  the  Unemployment
Insurance Amendment Bill, Bill 35 of 2003 and the Postal Services  Amendment
Bill, Bill 40 of 2003. It is worth mentioning that the committee dealt  well
with all the Bills, except for  the  Postal  Services  Amendment  Bill,  the
reason here being that the Bill was referred  back  to  the  committee.  The
Bill was recommitted  because  the  affected  shareholder  referred  to  and
criticised the process in the media.  Serious consultations in  this  regard
were made. We gave the committee an opportunity,  and  the  legislation  was
passed without amendments.

When it comes to interaction  with  the  departments,  in  its  planning  of
committee meetings, emphasis was  laid  on  ensuring  that  interaction  and
communication are maintained with all relevant government departments.

There are some challenges. Given that the committee has oversight  functions
over three departments as well as the relevant stakeholder, it has not  been
able to do so effectively due to a number of constraints.

The following are the recommendations of the committee  to  the  House.  The
first one is  that  further  discussions  are  needed  with  regard  to  the
restructuring processes by the Department of Public Enterprises. The  second
is that more oversight is needed with regard to the  Department  of  Labour.
The third is that more work still needs to be done with  the  Department  of
Communications to ensure that there is more accessibility of information.

In conclusion, hon Chairperson, we would like to thank the  Chief  Whip  for
the intervention and advice he gave to the  committee,  especially  when  we
were dealing with the Postal Services Amendment  Bill.  Secondly,  we  would
also like to thank the members of the  committee  for  the  commitment  they
have shown throughout the year. Keep it up, hon members.  I,  on  behalf  of
the committee, hon  Chairperson,  present  this  report  to  the  House  and
request that it be adopted. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I shall  now  put  the
question. The question is that the report be adopted.  As  the  decision  is
dealt with in terms of  section  65  of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first
ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast  a
vote for their provinces. Are you all here? In accordance with  Rule  71,  I
shall first allow provinces the opportunity to make a  declaration  of  vote
if they so wish. Is there any province that wishes to do so? None.

We  shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I   shall   do   so
alphabetically. Heads of delegations  should  then  indicate  to  the  Chair
whether they vote in favour, against or abstain. Eastern Cape?

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES - ANNUAL
                                   REPORT

Ms L JACOBUS: Thank you,  Deputy  Chair.  Deputy  Chair  and  members,  this
committee has the competence to deal with the following  portfolios,  namely
Health, Home Affairs and Social Development.

On presenting the annual report of our committee, I want  to  focus  on  the
following areas specifically:  firstly,  legislation;  secondly,  oversight;
thirdly, the budget - that is the budget of the committee -  and,  fourthly,
members' participation. I assume that members have read  the  report  and  I
will therefore not dwell on the details contained therein. However,  I  feel
there is a need for us to just briefly reflect on the areas mentioned  above
and make some recommendations on some of them.

Firstly, in terms of legislation,  the  select  committee  has  had  a  year
marked by the passage of ground-breaking legislation and amongst  these  are
the National Health Bill, the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, the  Alteration
of Sex Description and Sex Status Bill and the National  Development  Agency
Bill. I do  not  want  to  single  out  any  one  of  these  as  being  more
significant than the other, save to say that they have  all  contributed  to
the betterment of the lives of our people.

In general, the committee is satisfied with the  support  we  have  received
from the respective Ministers and  the  departments  in  the  processing  of
these pieces of legislation. The concern we have, however, is  one  that  we
have raised on numerous occasions, and I am sure that other committees  have
the  same  concern,  and  that  is  the  timing  of  the   introduction   of
legislation, especially section 76 legislation - always towards the  end  of
a year, when most of the legislatures are  just  about  winding  down  their
work for the year. I am personally not convinced that  the  executive  fully
understands how this  animal  that  is  called  the  NCOP  works  and  I  am
suggesting that those of us who will be coming back and those  who  will  be
presiding officers run a workshop for  the  executive  on  how  this  animal
actually works and operates. [Interjections.]

It is our belief that this practice  substantially  reduces  the  input  and
participation that  provinces  and  local  government  could  have  made  in
strengthening legislation and it subsequently waters  down  the  quality  of
the product that we churn out at the end of the day.

I recommend that we look at section 73(3) of the Constitution,  which  reads
as follows:


  A Bill referred to  in  section  76(3),  except  a  money  Bill,  may  be
  introduced in the National Council of Provinces.

Some of us have actually managed to persuade our respective Ministers to  do
so - to introduce it here first before it goes to the National Assembly.

Secondly, another recommendation is the  introduction  of  a  more  flexible
NCOP cycle to allow provinces enough time to  interrogate  legislation,  not
necessarily limiting provinces to  the  four  or  five-week  cycle  that  we
currently have.

As regards oversight, as our report reflects,  we  only  did  one  oversight
visit, and that was to the Eastern Cape. This was the follow-up  visit  that
the National Council of Provinces undertook to this province earlier in  the
year. That visit focused on the access to  social  security,  including  the
issuing of identity  documents.  Without  going  into  the  details  of  our
findings, and the report has been tabled, it is sad to  say,  however,  that
most of the issues raised during our first visit  as  the  whole  NCOP  were
raised again in our follow-up visit. I have also submitted  a  copy  of  our
report to the new Director-General of  Home  Affairs,  Mr  Gilder,  for  his
intervention on these matters.

Because legislative obligations take priority, this was  the  only  province
we could visit although we had planned in our programme also  to  visit  the
North West following the NCOP visit to that province. I am hoping  that  the
new committee to be constituted in the new Parliament  after  the  elections
will be able to prioritise a visit to the North West  to  look  at  progress
made since we were last there.
On the issue of our committee budget, like we advocate  an  equitable  share
for provinces in the division  of  revenue,  I  also  want  to  advocate  an
equitable  share  of  Parliament's  budget   for   committees.   The   newly
established Joint Budget Committee, I assume, is attempting to do so.  I  am
not just saying it should be an equitable share amongst  select  committees,
but also amongst committees of the two Houses. If one looks  at  the  volume
of work between the committees of the respective  Houses,  and  some  of  my
colleagues have alluded to  that,  there  is  just  no  comparison.  Whereas
portfolio committees deal with only one portfolio, we as  select  committees
deal with no less than three portfolios each. Yet,  they  receive  a  bigger
share of the budget.

Section 72(1) of the Constitution goes:


  The National Council of Provinces must - and I underline ``must'' -


  (a) facilitate public involvement in the legislative and other  processes
       of the Council and its committees ...

My interpretation of this section is that  we  are  given  a  constitutional
mandate to ensure that the public is involved in the work of  the  NCOP  and
that of its committees.

The Chairperson of the NCOP, Ms Pandor and yourself included, Deputy  Chair,
has many a time alluded to  the  uniqueness  of  this  institution  and  the
dynamic role it can play  if  it  is  utilised  to  its  full  capacity  and
potential. Unfortunately, this role is not fully recognised by all and  this
is reflected in the budgetary allocations to committees of Parliament. I  am
sure that most, if not all, of our  committees  would  have  liked  to  have
visited at least three provinces in  a  year  to  oversee  and  monitor  the
respective  competencies  that  they  are  charged  with,  but  because   of
budgetary constraints they are not in a position to do so. [Interjections.]

Regarding members' participation,  with  the  workload  and  constraints  of
various  natures,  I  think  all  members  of  the  committees  and  special
delegates who are invited from time to time perform to  the  best  of  their
ability. This was evident in the feedback we got on legislation as  well  as
other areas of our  work,  particularly  our  oversight  function.  At  this
point, let me take the opportunity to congratulate and single out  the  Free
State  province  for  always  meticulously  scrutinising   legislation   and
proposing amendments that have always strengthened the legislation we  dealt
with over the past year and indeed over the past four years.

One worrying factor is the high turnover of committee members. Maybe  it  is
a feather in the cap of the NCOP  that  a  lot  of  its  members  have  been
constantly redeployed to  take  up  senior  positions  in  their  respective
provinces, but on the other hand it drains the human  resource  capacity  of
the institution and committees in particular and it weakens committees.
I must also take this opportunity to congratulate members of  the  committee
on their participation when we, for the first time,  conducted  hearings  on
the intergovernmental fiscal review.  MECs  from  the  nine  provinces  were
invited to interrogate  with  ourselves  their  budgetary  allocations,  the
identification of provincial priorities and whether their spending  patterns
related to their priorities as they identified it. They also shared with  us
their achievements and challenges and how they intended to deal with  these.
This was a very significant, insightful exercise and it assisted us a  great
deal in our subsequent policy debates that followed.

In conclusion, despite our challenges and constraints - and  I  support  the
comments made by some of my other colleagues in terms of our  constraints  -
this has been a very exciting year for our committee.  We  have  engaged  in
sometimes very robust debate on matters before us, but  the  needs  and  the
expectations of our provinces always took centre stage. Even though  we  are
often from different political parties, our priority  concern  was  that  of
our province and I  want  to  thank  members  once  more  for  their  mature
engagement with me as the chairperson, and with one another on the  work  of
the committee. It  is  also  appropriate  for  me  to  thank  the  presiding
officers and the Chief Whip  for  their  continued  assistance  and  support
throughout the year.

With these few words, I submit to the House, on  behalf  of  the  committee,
the annual report of the select committee for  the  year  2003,  January  to
December. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  report  be

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON PRIVATE MEMBERS' LEGISLATIVE
                          PROPOSALS - ANNUAL REPORT

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the mission of this  committee  is  to  promote
and facilitate the making of legislative proposals by individual members  of
the National Council of Provinces, and its vision  to  get  members  of  the
NCOP to make effective use of their rights to initiate legislation in  order
to enhance our democracy.

The  committee  studied  and  discussed  the  draft  document  entitled:   A
Practical Guide for Members' Legislative Proposals at all its meetings.  The
draft was also handed to the Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, the Chief  Whip
and chairpersons for comments, and all comments  received  have  been  taken
into account. The final draft will be ready for printing before the  end  of
March so that the new members coming in after the election  will  have  this
manual ready for their use and to empower them.

The  effective  functioning  of  this  committee  is  dependent   upon   the
submission of legislative  proposals  by  members.  Unfortunately  only  two
members submitted legislative proposals. The first one was the Promotion  of
Multilingualism Bill by Mr Van Niekerk and  then  there  was  the  Pan-South
African Language Board Amendment Bill, also by Mr Van Niekerk.

These two legislative proposals were referred  to  the  nine  provinces  and
were considered by them in terms of the Rules  of  the  NCOP.  Five  of  the
provinces recommended that the proposer should be allowed to  introduce  the
legislative proposals as Bills.

When the report served in the Council,  the  Chief  Whip  recommended  in  a
motion that the said legislative proposals be referred back to the  relevant
select committee to determine its financial implications  and  to  ascertain
whether it would influence the desirabilty of the Bills before  the  Council
takes a formal decision thereon.

Then there was the Sectional Titles Amendment Bill by Dr Conroy.  After  the
proposer had introduced this legislative proposal in the committee  and  had
briefed the committee thereon, at which briefing  the  Deputy  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs was also present, the proposer and  the  Deputy
Minister discussed  the  said  legislative  proposal.  Thereafter  the  said
Ministry introduced the Sectional  Titles  Amendment  Bill,  which  contains
certain of the proposals proposed in this legislative proposal.

The amending Bill, introduced by the Minister,  has  in  the  meantime  been
enacted as the Sectional Titles Amendment Act, Act No 29 of 2003. Dr  Conroy
has indicated that in the light of the  aforementioned  he  would,  at  this
stage, withdraw his proposal.

Then the committee also dealt with the  Commission  for  the  Promotion  and
Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and  Linguistic  Communities
Amendment Bill, also by  Mr  Van  Niekerk.  This  legislative  proposal  was
referred to the committee on 17 July 2003. This proposal seeks to  vest  the
said  commission  with  the  powers  to  deal  with  noncompliance  of   its
recommendations.

Following a briefing  by  Mr  Van  Niekerk,  the  legislative  proposal  was
referred to the relevant select committee - it is the  Select  Committee  on
Local Government and Administration. A joint meeting of this  committee  and
the Select Committee on Local Government and Administration was held  on  27
November in order to comply with Rule 179(2) of the NCOP. It was  agreed  in
the said joint meeting that  a  further  meeting  to  consider  this  matter
should be held, which meeting will soon be held.

Now, as mentioned under legislation, there has been some success in  respect
of the Promotion of Multilingualism Bill and the Pan-South African  Language
Board Amendment Bill, both submitted by Mr  Van  Niekerk,  as  well  as  The
Sectional Titles Amendment Bill, submitted by Dr Conroy.

It is trusted that the draft document  referred  to,  once  finalised,  will
encourage and empower members of the NCOP  to  utilise  this  very  powerful
instrument  of  initiating  legislation  by  way  of  members'   legislative
proposals, and in so doing to enhance our democracy.

It has been proven all over the world, and specifically  in  countries  like
Australia, that although not many Bills submitted  by  private  members  are
eventually enacted, there are some very important Bills  that  members  have
succeeded in getting enacted.

For instance, in the Australian Senate  the  compulsory  voting  at  federal
elections  was  introduced  as  a  result  of  Senator   Payne's   Electoral
Compulsory Voting Act, way back in 1924  already.  The  banning  of  tobacco
advertising in the printed media was achieved through  a  senator's  Smoking
and Tobacco Products Advertisements Act in 1989.

And the most  significant  piece  of  legislation  sponsored  by  a  private
senator or  member  in  that  country  was,  of  course,  the  Parliamentary
Privileges Act of 1987, which was introduced by the President of the  Senate
there, and which codified the parliament's legal immunities and  its  powers
to protect the integrity of its processes.
Members' legislative proposals certainly  are  the  most  powerful  tool  or
instrument in the hands of any individual member. Even  though  the  chances
are not always good that those proposals might  actually  become  law,  they
remain the best instrument to shine a very bright light on any issue.

And when the Government decides to take over  the  ideas  of  a  legislative
proposal, as we have seen happen in this report with  The  Sectional  Titles
Amendment Bill, the member can rightly claim some credit for it.

I trust that in the new Parliament - the new NCOP after the election  -  the
guide which we envisage will really empower members of  the  NCOP  and  also
provincial legislatures to fully utilise this powerful  instrument  to  help
them succeed in fulfilling their role as representatives of our people,  and
to improve the quality of life of all of those whom we  represent.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  Report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall now first ascertain whether all delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provincial votes. Are you  all  in?  In
accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces  the  opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote if they so wish. Is there any province?  The
hon Van Niekerk?

Declaration of vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie. Na aanleiding van die  verslag
wat die agb Matthee gelewer het, wil ek net die Raad  daarop  wys  dat  twee
van die privaatlid-wetgewende voorstelle terugverwys is na  die  komitee  op
grond van ondersoek wat ingestel moet word  na  die  finansiële  implikasies
van die voorstelle, en hulle is beide so pas  deur  die  Adjunkminister  van
Kuns, Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie in hierdie Raad gehanteer.

Ek wil ook net die Raad daarop wys dat die proses  waarna  die  agb  Matthee
verwys het baie lank is en dat ons klarigheid moet kry of  sulke  voorstelle
ná hierdie Parlement na  die  nuwe  Parlement  oorgedra  word,  soos  gewone
wetgewing, en of dit verval en die proses weer van vooraf moet  begin.  Daar
is nie klarigheid in die Reëls daaroor nie en ek wil dit net  aan  die  Huis
stel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. With  regard  to  the
report that the hon Matthee has delivered, I would just like  to  point  out
to the Council that two of the private members' legislative  proposals  were
referred  back  to  the  committee  on  the  grounds  that   the   financial
implications of these proposals should be investigated, and both  have  just
been dealt with by  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology.
I also want to point out to the Council that the process to  which  the  hon
Matthee referred is very long, and that we must obtain clarity whether  such
proposals must be carried over to the new Parliament after this  Parliament,
and whether it expires and the process must start all over again.  There  is
no clarity in the Rules where this is concerned and I  would  just  like  to
put this to the House.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Thank you  very  much,
Mr Van Niekerk. Any other further declarations of vote? None. We  shall  now
proceed to voting on the question. I shall do  this  in  alphabetical  order
per province. Delegation heads must please indicate  to  the  Chair  whether
they vote in favour or against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Eastern Cape supports.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Free State?

Mr T S SETONA: Free State supports.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Re a dumela. [We support.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): KwaZulu-Natal?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Mpumalanga?

Mr F ADAMS: Wes-Kaap steun. [Western Cape supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  All  nine  provinces
voted in favour. I therefore declare the report adopted in  accordance  with
section 65 of the Constitution.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:48.
