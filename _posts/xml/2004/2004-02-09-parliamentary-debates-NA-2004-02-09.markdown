                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

                                 NEW MEMBER

                               (Announcement)

The Speaker announced that the vacancy that had arisen as a  result  of  the
resignation of Dr S M Mogoba had been filled, in accordance with  item  6(3)
of Schedule 6 to the Constitution, 1996, by the  nomination  of  Mr  T  Godi
with effect from 1 February 2004.

The member had made and subscribed the oath in the  Speaker's  office  on  3
February 2004.

                         COPY OF PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

                               (Announcement)

The Speaker announced that she had received a copy of the President  of  the
Republic's address delivered at a Joint Sitting on Friday, 6 February  2004,
and that the speech had been printed in the Minutes of the Joint Sitting.

The SPEAKER: As I announced last Friday,  the  President  has  requested  an
opportunity to make an announcement, and I  will  now  grant  the  President
that opportunity. [Applause.]

                           DATE OF 2004 ELECTIONS

                               (Announcement)
The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

As all of us know, this  year  we  will  be  holding  our  third  democratic
general elections. In this  regard,  as  the  Speaker  has  just  said,  the
Speaker announced before we adjourned on Friday that we would  announce  the
election date today.

Again, as hon members are aware, we have to consider the matter of the  date
together with the Electoral Commission and the premiers  of  our  provinces.
Among other things, the Electoral Commission  has  been  concerned  that  it
should have enough time  to  register  as  many  voters  as  possible  while
allowing enough time for it to do everything necessary to organise  and  run
the elections as required by the law.

Originally, we had agreed with  the  Electoral  Commission  that  we  should
announce the election date on 11 February. Later, the  Electoral  Commission
requested  that  we  should  make  this  announcement  a   little   earlier.
Accordingly,  after  consultation  with   the   Electoral   Commission   and
discussion  with  the  premiers,  I  would  like  to  inform  the   national
legislature and  the  country  that  the  2004  general  elections  for  the
national  and  provincial  legislatures  will  take  place  on   14   April.
[Applause.]

It is visualised that  this  date  will  be  gazetted  later  this  week  on
Wednesday, 11 February, after the national and provincial legislatures  have
approved the necessary dissolution  resolutions.  Accordingly,  the  voter's
roll will be closed at midnight, 24h00, on Wednesday this  week.  Thank  you
very much, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr President.

                     SUSPENSION OF RULE 298 AND RULE 316

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) noting the proposal by the  President  in  his  announcement  in  the
       National Assembly today to call an election  on  14  April  2004,  in
       accordance  with  section  50(1)  of  the  Constitution  resolves  to
       dissolve;


  (2) notes that in terms of section 49(4) of the Constitution  it  remains
       competent to function until the day before the first day  of  polling
       for the next Assembly; and


  (3) resolves to suspend Rule 298 and Rule 316 to prevent bills and  other
       business from lapsing when the House is dissolved.

Question put: That the motion be adopted.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I want to draw your attention that though we  have
dissolved, we are still competent to carry on business, so we are  still  at
work. However, to make that official, we will be asking you to  record  your
votes as we need a majority, and we need to record the majority.

Hon members, I know we've got these nice new systems. Would you  all  please
record your votes.

                              HOURS OF SITTING

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House suspends Rule 23(2) in  regard  to  Tuesday,  10  February
  2004, and that the hours of sitting on that day shall be as follows:


  10:00, or such later time as the Speaker determines, to adjournment.

Agreed to.

                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The SPEAKER: The hon Mr Lekota! [Applause.] Order! The  hon  Mr  Gibson!  Mr
Lekota, will you please take your seat for a moment.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, on a point of  order:  This
must be the only parliamentary democracy in the world where an  ANC  speaker
responds  to  the  President  instead  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.
[Interjections.] I am  sure  that  there  must  be  some  mistake  with  the
speaking order, and I ask you to give attention to that. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, this is the only Parliament that I know  of
where all parties have forgotten decisions they took, even though it was  in
1996. Mr Gibson is  correct;  that  is  a  right  that  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition has - to make the first response, if he wishes. I would  suggest,
in future, that we abide by that decision or change it. [Interjections.]

In the meantime, I call on Minister Lekota.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy  President  and
colleagues, members of the House, I would like to start by saying  that  the
state of the nation address was a review of the work  our  nation  has  done
over the past 10 years, and  not  a  campaign  speech  about  what  the  ANC
intended to do if it were to return to power  after  the  coming  elections.
[Interjections.]
May I proceed and say that on the northern banks of the Vaal River stands  a
town where in 1902 British and Afrikaner leaders concluded peace and  signed
a treaty. They then named the place Vereeniging, a place  of  unity.  Eighty
years later they, ignoring the demands of  the  majority  black  population,
consolidated their unity by forging  the  Union  of  South  Africa.  In  the
intervening period those excluded persisted and prepared themselves for  the
day when this mistake  of  history  would  be  corrected.  It  required  the
organised strength of the majority who were excluded  in  1910  to  wage  an
unrelenting struggle to build a democracy  that  would  at  last  unite  the
people of South Africa into one nation.

It is a source of joy that we can say today that 80 years later our  people,
black and white, at Codesa united and took a decision to forge  one  nation.
The negotiated settlement at Codesa placed a historical  obligation  on  all
sides to work and  eradicate  the  disparities  the  intervening  years  had
produced. The challenge for us over the past 10 years  has  been,  and  into
the future will be, to continue to work together, and for every  section  to
be  upfront  in  tackling  the  huge  disparities   created   during   those
intervening years,  disparities  which  at  the  present  time  continue  to
undermine the image of our nation.

When President Mandela called for reconciliation at  the  beginning  of  our
first decade of democracy, he invited all of us to make the journey in  this
direction together. As South Africans we continue on this  journey,  but  we
do so side by side and whilst debating the ways and means by which this  has
to be done.

Of course, central to this debate must be  how  South  Africans  would  push
back the frontiers of poverty. Everyone of us has an equal  right  and  duty
to participate in this national discourse, for it is only through  open  and
free dialogue that we can arrive at sound solutions.

Whilst no one sector of our population can claim the monopoly  of  how  this
must be done, the voices of those who were previously  disadvantaged  should
indeed be listened to with close attention, because it is  there  where  the
pain and the sore of what happened in the past resides. Those  who  suffered
the humiliation and the pain of the past should in some  measure  enjoy  the
patience and the willingness of their fellow South Africans to be heard  and
to be assisted, not as a matter of favour, but as  a  matter  of  historical
duty.

This places an obligation on those who were advantaged to be equally  active
in the search for solutions, and not  to  adopt  the  posture  of  onlooking
critics who have no obligations to build our common future.

The  general  upliftment  of  those  who  were  historically  disadvantaged,
through real and palpable and visible steps, must  be  unstintingly  pursued
and this must be done in the interests of South Africa as a whole.

In the drive towards democracy we prepared our people, under the  banner  of
the ANC, not only to know what was wrong with apartheid, but also  what  the
ideal model to replace apartheid would be. We  need  increasing  numbers  of
South Africans to support the drive towards the attainment of that  goal  of
a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it, black and white.

It is with a measure of satisfaction that today we  may  look  back  on  the
past 10 years of democracy and appreciate those who  went  through  the  TRC
process, from both sides of the divide,  who  declared  their  mistakes  and
asked for amnesty. It was a courageous gesture on the part of all  of  them.
The TRC was an achievement, not a setback.

We  also  acknowledge  those  who  have  made  contributions  through  their
participation in the Jobs Summit, those who have been  part  of  the  growth
and development programme activities, and those who have sought  to  advance
national reconciliation, individually and collectively.  I  think  that  the
most pregnant example, alongside the one the President quoted of Rian  Malan
...

... is die voorbeeld van E T Terre'blanche, wat nie lank terug nie voor  die
hof gekom het en vir die hele land gesê het dat hy aanvaar dat  hy  'n  fout
begaan het deur andere vroeërjare op te stook. [... is the example  of  E  T
Terreblanche, who appeared in court not very long ago  and  told  the  whole
country he accepted he had made a mistake inciting others previously.]

He then made an appeal to his followers and supporters and  those  who  care
to listen, by saying that the new South Africa was here,  and  required  his
supporters and followers to go back  to  their  homes,  to  put  down  their
weapons and to join the national project to construct a  South  Africa  that
we have already been pursuing.

It takes a lot of courage for a man or woman to be able  to  confront  their
mistakes and acknowledge them before his or her people. I  think  that  this
country is the better for what E T Terre'blanche did.

Nevertheless, there are challenges that remain. Recently a black  colleague,
who is in this House, had supper at the Mount Nelson Hotel. He  shared  with
me his experience there. He asked the manager why there were no black  staff
in the restaurant. The manager, to his amazement, replied  that  staff  were
recruited on merit, and  since  many  blacks  did  not  speak  English  well
enough, they could not be employed, because they would not be able  to  deal
with the clientele.

The incident raises a number of issues I would  like  to  highlight  in  the
debate today. Firstly,  the  need  to  transform  attitudes  remains  a  big
challenge. As long as generalisations of this nature persist in the  outlook
of South Africans of one colour or race towards  others,  our  judgments  of
the opportunities that history has placed before us will not be used  by  us
effectively.

Secondly, this incident denies the fact  that  there  are  plenty  of  young
black South Africans who speak perfect  English  and,  certainly,  who  have
sufficient intelligence to serve the  clientele  of  any  hotel,  the  Mount
Nelson included.

Thirdly, this incident shows that the opportunities denied to blacks in  the
past must  be  reversed  and  that  people  from  disadvantaged  educational
backgrounds must be given the training and skills needed for  them  to  take
their rightful place in society.

As long as these kinds of attitudes persist, we will deny our  fellow  South
Africans the  opportunities  they  deserve,  opportunities  which  over  the
period of 80 years I referred to  were  given  to  our  white  brothers  and
sisters who came from the countryside and from backgrounds that involved  no
training whatsoever. The time has come for black and  white  South  Africans
to recognise their obligations towards those who have paid the price of  the
mistakes of history, and to do so because a better future can only arise  if
we act correctly.

This incident illustrates the distance we  still  have  to  travel  in  this
country. Few can argue that the position of the Mount Nelson  is  not  based
on plain and simple bigotry and irrational prejudice. Had the  manager  been
further challenged, he would have emphatically denied the  offensiveness  of
his explanation. Denial is, after all, a way of not facing up to  irrational
prejudice, but the incident also illustrates the  damage  South  Africa  has
suffered. Whilst the incident is a small example and an isolated one, if  we
were multiply  such  an  incident  across  our  country  -  there  are  many
incidents of that nature - then we would be able to understand the  enormity
of the task we face.

To talk of people the way the manager spoke about black people  is  to  deny
their humanity. It highlights  the  disadvantages  black  people  are  still
burdened with 10 years into our  democracy.  However,  most  seriously,  the
sort of racial prejudice that occurs here, physically robs South  Africa  of
the talents of its peoples by denying them the room to contribute. It is  as
illogical and as irrational as watching three men try to push  a  wagon  out
of a ditch, while six other men look on and observe. Were all  nine  persons
to push the wagon, it would soon be on its way.

As we complete the first decade of our freedom we continue to  call  on  all
South Africans to join hands and to push the wagon out of the mud, to  build
and strengthen our democracy  and  to  fight  the  scourge  of  poverty  and
unemployment.

In  another  vein,  the  nine  persons  pushing  the  wagon  represent   our
diversity, symbolised by our new coat of arms. The coat  of  arms,  composed
of elephant tusks, the ears of wheat, the shield,  the  human  figures,  the
spear, the knobkerrie, the protea, the secretary bird and  the  rising  sun,
is flanked by the motto: ``!ke  e:  /xarra  //ke'',  which  means  ``Diverse
people unite'' or ``Unity in diversity''.

We are one nation  made  up  of  diverse  peoples.  We  are  a  multiracial,
multilingual, multireligious nation, and  this  is  our  greatest  strength.
Other countries, like  Brazil,  have  used  their  diversity  to  make  them
strong. Whilst in the past our diversity was a source of  tension,  we  have
turned this on its head and  correctly  made  our  diversity  our  strength,
building on our wealth of diverse cultures and  experiences  to  enrich  our
nation. Because of the past, South  Africa  will  never  be  at  peace  with
itself until its people have reconciled themselves through that process.

Social stability necessitates reconciliation and requires commitment to  our
diversity. It means breaking out of our racial, tribal, ethnic  cocoons  and
recognising that there is a place for  everyone  in  this  diverse  national
environment. However, our diversity has  to  be  lived  and  experienced  as
equality.

Our partnership with the people means that the Government  is  working  with
the people to further intensify  the  transformation  process  necessary  to
rebuild our society. At each turn  we  should  be  able  to  ask  what  role
different institutions can play in that partnership - the role  of  parties,
of the churches, of sports bodies, of the media, of business  and  so  on  -
what role indeed our manager of the Mount Nelson Hotel should be playing.

Democracy is not just about going to the polls every five  years.  It  is  a
comprehensive political and social culture  based  on  certain  values.  The
preamble to the opening chapter of our Constitution lists these values,  but
they were not dreamt up in 1994. They are to be found  in  the  history  and
the experience of our people, in the founding documents of the ANC in  1912,
the African Claims of 1943, the Freedom  Charter  of  1955  and  the  Harare
Declaration of 1989.

The signing of the Constitution  in  1996  was  a  crowning  moment  in  our
history, consolidating our experience, our sacrifices  and  our  hard  work.
These values permeate the democratic movement and the ideals  for  which  it
stands. Central to these is their adoption, ownership  and  defence  by  the
people of South Africa as  a  whole.  The  nation-building  process  entails
encouraging all South Africans to buy into that comprehensive  value  system
known as democracy.

We are not going to be able to build a democracy and stability in  a  nation
that contains disparities, a nation wherein some persons have so  much  food
that all they can think about is dieting, while others  do  not  know  where
their next meal is coming from. [Interjections.]

The definition  of  national  interest  and  self-interest  consistent  with
democracy is based on ``Motho ke motho ka  batho  ba  bang''.  This  is  the
people-centred society the President referred to in his address. It  is  the
orientation of our forebears articulated when they said:  ``Motho  ke  motho
ka batho ba bang''. The humanity of  one  flows  from  the  recognition  and
respect of the humanity of others. You are only so human to the extent  that
you treat others as human. If you treat others as less than human, then  you
yourself are less than human.

In the history of the ANC  and  its  operations,  the  movement  has  always
sought to cultivate men and women towards a democratic orientation.  Indeed,
as it struggled for democracy, the ANC was already preparing her  membership
and followers for the  advent  of  democracy.  It  taught  its  members,  it
prepared them, it subjected them to practice. It proceeded to  educate  them
on what an acceptable alternative was, and when the day and  date  came  the
ANC was party to the drafting, drawing and signing of the Constitution  that
embraced those goals. [Applause.]

At  the  Codesa  negotiations  we  accepted  the  participation   of   every
representative and leader of  the  people  of  South  Africa,  whether  they
agreed with us  or  not.  We  participated  with  them  and  took  decisions
together democratically. In order to come to Government, we  fought  a  free
and fair election alongside other parties in the true spirit  of  multiparty
democracy. We have sustained that culture and practice and will go into  the
next election in the same spirit.

When we joined the SADC community of nations, we moved that SADC must  never
entertain in her forum any leader who was not voted to power  democratically
in their country. Later, at the 35th summit of the OAU, under the  aegis  of
SADC, we moved a similar position. Today our continent  has  inherited  this
position with regard to democracy. We have consistently inside the  ANC,  in
the country and abroad advocated  and  supported  democratic  practice.  We,
past victims of an undemocratic order, will not veer  away  from  democratic
ways and  practices  for  which  so  many  of  our  members  and  supporters
struggled, suffered and sacrificed their lives. [Applause.]

I wish to place on record that as the National  Chairperson  of  the  ANC  I
have missed no meetings of its senior councils, officials, national  working
committee, national executive committee and national  conferences  since  we
came  to  power  in  this  country  and  since  we   adopted   the   present
Constitution. I am privy to reports of branches of  the  ANC,  its  regions,
provinces and structures of its allied partners in the tripartite  alliance.
I wish to assure this House and our  nation  that  there  is  no  individual
member or structure of the ANC that has even raised the  issue  of  amending
the Constitution in order to enable any ANC member to occupy  the  country's
presidency  or  any  position  for  longer  than  is   stipulated   in   the
Constitution of our country. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Two weeks ago I was passing through Johannesburg International  Airport  and
saw black and white  young  airline  ground  staff  in  uniform.  They  were
sitting on one of those benches  in  the  airport,  earnestly  chatting  and
sometimes whispering to each other, presumably about matters  close  to  the
hearts of the youth. They were totally engrossed as if there was no  outside
world. For a moment I slowed my step. It occurred to me that  in  the  South
Africa of my youth such  a  scene  would  have  been  unthinkable  and  even
obscene to some.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I thank you. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE  OPPOSITION:  Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  colleagues,
today President Mbeki announced that our third democratic election  will  be
held on 14 April. In response the DA has just three words: Bring it on,  for
we are going to give the people of South Africa a real choice and  hope  for
real change. We are going to give our  democracy  the  best  tenth  birthday
present it could possibly hope for: The  creation  of  a  genuine  two-party
system, and a real  alternative  for  this  country,  because  South  Africa
deserves better. [Interjections.]

Ten years ago, at the very moment that our nation won its  freedom,  we  had
to face a new task. Our first democratically elected President, Mr  Mandela,
told us at his inauguration:


  We  have,  at  last,  achieved  our  political  emancipation.  We  pledge
  ourselves to liberate all our  people  from  the  continuing  bondage  of
  poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.

And so, therefore, for South Africans, as defined by  the  first  President,
freedom does not begin and end with the right to vote.  Freedom  also  means
the opportunity to work  and  earn  a  living,  freedom  means  safety  from
violence - on the streets and in the  home  -  freedom  means  good  health,
decent schools and a clean environment. Freedom  means  real  hope  for  the
future.
With that mission in mind, and the best opposition - and a better one  after
this election when this side is much larger than it has ever been  before  -
South Africa began a new journey. [Interjections.] We  have  indeed  come  a
long way, as the Minister of Defence reminded  us  this  afternoon.  We  did
create a constitution with a bill of rights that  protects  communities  and
individuals. We have bound the wounds of our  nation  together  through  the
TRC. We built a stable economy and we supported it with  responsible  fiscal
policies that have  reduced  debt  and  cut  inflation.  We  extended  basic
services such as housing, electricity, water and sanitation to  millions  of
people. [Interjections.]

We should all be proud of these achievements. They are to the credit of  the
government and the people of South Africa.  However,  the  people  of  South
Africa are not yet  truly  free.  Millions  have  been  left  behind.  Eight
million South Africans are out of work, 22,5 million South Africans live  in
poverty, a quarter of a million South Africans have  been  murdered  in  the
last decade, 5 million South Africans have been infected with  the  HI-virus
and as many as 1 million have died already. [Interjections.]  They  are  not
just numbers; they represent  real  people,  real  human  beings  with  real
stories.

Over the past five years my colleagues and I have travelled  throughout  the
length and breadth of our land. We have strolled down the dusty  streets  of
squatter camps, we have visited distant farms and towns on  the  platteland,
and we have walked through the concrete canyons of the inner cities. I  have
seen the suffering  of  millions  of  our  fellow  South  Africans.  I  have
listened to the stories of ordinary people - men, women,  young  and  old  -
struggling to succeed and struggling to survive.

On the streets of Jeppestown, Johannesburg, I spoke to hawkers who  told  me
that they could not find the capital they needed to expand their  businesses
and  to  create  jobs.  Among  them  was  a  man  called  Linda   Cebekhulu.
[Interjections.] He had wandered around the streets of  the  city  with  his
three children, looking for work. ``My family is dying of hunger,'' he  told
me. That is why South Africa needs real change.

If the Government simply extended, for example, the two-tier labour  system,
which it is introducing for itself in the expanded public  works  programme,
and applied it to the private sector, we would create jobs for  millions  of
people like Linda. [Interjections.]

We have made several visits to Khayelitsha,  a  few  kilometers  from  here,
where the poorest families survive on less than R40 per  person  per  month.
In parts of Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal where we were, entire families  have  no
source of cash, except for the pension of granny or  grandpa.  That  is  why
South Africa needs real change.

If Government simply reversed its position on the  basic  income  grant,  it
could make a tremendous difference to  those  people's  lives.  In  Pretoria
West I visited with Clifford Rawstone, a man who lost his  infant  daughter,
his fiancée and his mother in a brutal and senseless hijacking  and  tripple
murder. In the informal settlement of Witlokasie in the Southern  Cape  near
Knysna, I was with the family of Claudine Arnold, a  ten-year-old,  who  was
found raped, murdered and her neck broken.

Here in Cape Town  I  met  with  Liesl  de  Villiers  whose  fiancé,  Martin
Whitaker, was murdered by a man whom the  President  pardoned  and  released
from jail. That is why South Africa needs real  change.  If  the  Government
made a serious commitment to  fighting  crime,  and  improving  the  justice
system, it could prevent all of this needless suffering.

In Boksburg North, when we went to visit Aids children, we played  with  the
children of St Francis Care Centre, many of whom  have  been  infected  with
HIV. In Pietermaritzburg I saw how the KwaZulu-Natal government was  helping
Aids orphans by assisting the Pietermaritzburg  Children's  Home,  but  even
there there are far too few beds for all the children who  need  care.  That
is why South Africa needs real change. [Interjections.] The lives  of  those
children would have been completely different if the  Government  -  at  the
right moment and in the right way - had provided their  mothers  with  drugs
to prevent the transmission of the HI-virus.

The children in the Kaalfontein  Primary  School  had  a  different  set  of
problems. They had, last year, no desks, no chairs and no  roof  over  their
heads. I found them, nearly 1200 of them, sitting on top of  concrete  slabs
and empty paint cans in the heat of the day. That is why South Africa  needs
real change. Those children could have a real chance for a  brighter  future
if the Government put the basics first, ahead of  a  whole  range  of  other
issues and priorities.

Ek was nou die dag by die Hoërskool Hendrik  Verwoerd  in  Villeria  wat  op
versoek van die Regering en  die  Gautengse  departement  van  onderwys  van
Afrikaans  na  dubbelmedium  oorgeskakel  het.  Die   skool   is   bykomende
hulpbronne en nog onderwysers belowe om dit  moontlik  te  maak.  Sewe  jaar
later het hulle net een ekstra onderwyser, en sukkel hulle  om  vir  al  hul
leerders voorsiening te maak. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit  is  waarom  Suid-Afrika
ware verandering nodig het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Recently, I was at the Hendrik Verwoerd High School  in  Villeria  who,  at
the request of the Government and the Gauteng Department of  Education,  has
switched from Afrikaans to dual medium. The school was  promised  additional
resources and more teachers to make this possible. Seven  years  later  they
only have one additional teacher, and they are struggling to make  provision
for all their learners. [Interjections.] That  is  why  South  Africa  needs
real change.]

That school, and others  like  it,  would  be  thriving  if  the  Government
honoured, by practice and by deed, its commitments to language and  cultural
diversity.

We travelled to Zimbabwe to meet  with  workers,  farmers,  journalists  and
activists, the very people that the ANC backbenchers  are  utterly  deriding
today. [Interjections.] We learnt  first-hand,  not  through  a  book  or  a
magazine, about the suffering that the people have had at the hands  of  the
Zanu-PF regime. The people of Zimbabwe would still have  had  their  freedom
and prosperity if our Government, at crucial moments, had stood up for  that
which is right. [Interjections.]

To the many, many women, men and children whom we have met and  whose  lives
we have shared, the President said on Friday:


  We do not foresee that there will be any need for new  and  major  policy
  initiatives.

This is an extraordinary statement, one that will go down in  history  as  a
symbol of the fundamental problem at  the  core  of  the  failures  of  this
Government.

It was also quite extraordinary, if not shocking, that the  President  would
continue to deny the gravity of the HIV/Aids crisis in this country,  as  he
did only last night on television.

In August last year, the Government announced that  it  would  introduce  an
antiretroviral programme. Today, six months later,  we  are  still  waiting.
Instead of saving lives, the  Government  is  counting  death  notices.  The
people  of  South  Africa  are  crying  out  for  help  on   these   crucial
battleground  issues,  but  the  President  and  the  Government  have   not
listened.

For all the money and all the events and all the results of the  imbizos,  I
believe the President has failed to learn that South Africans  want  certain
changes, real fundamental changes, because  the  President  said  on  Friday
that all South Africa has to do is implement the policies we  already  have.
With great respect, many of these policies are  failing,  precisely  because
the Government does not listen to the people until it is too late. When  the
people raise their  voices,  the  Government  reacts  in  ways  that  raises
serious questions about  its  own  commitment  to  openness  and  democracy,
despite the fine words uttered today by the Minister of Defence.

A few days ago, when the  nation's  doctors  marched  to  protest  the  poor
condition in the public health service, the Minister of Health,  instead  of
meeting them, threatened to fire them. [Interjections.] In similar  fashion,
the President on Friday ... maybe they should fire  Manto,  yes  ...  lashed
out against what he called ``the traditional  doomsayers''.  Let's  consider
this concept. Let's consider the following quotes:


  If all indicators in  South  Africa  were  to  continue  along  the  same
  trajectory, especially in respect of economic inclusion and exclusion, we
  could soon reach a point where  the  negatives  start  to  overwhelm  the
  positives. This could precipitate a  vicious  cycle  of  decline  in  all
  spheres.

Who made that statement? The opposition? The usual suspects  in  the  media?
No, it was made by the Government itself in its document,  ``Towards  a  10-
year Review''. There  are  many  proud  and  patriotic  South  Africans  who
express similar concerns.  Jeremy  Cronin,  I  dare  say,  is  a  proud  and
patriotic  South  African.  He  himself  brought  up  the  question  of  the
``Zanufication''  of  the  ruling  party.  Others  like  journalist   Barney
Mthombothi have warned us only last week  about  the  possibility  of  ``our
country becoming a one-party state by default''.

Former ANC MP Andrew Feinstein, who resigned  over  the  way  in  which  his
party was covering up the arms deal, said after 1999:


  Parliament has become more of a rubberstamp for the executive  on  really
  crucial oversight issues such as HIV/Aids, Zimbabwe, aspects of  economic
  policy and the arms deal.

Trevor Ncube, the Zimbabwean owner of the Mail and Guardian, said:


  I am concerned about the similarities I am reading between  South  Africa
  and Zimbabwe, and Good Lord, I hope I'm wrong, because if I'm  not,  then
  South Africa is headed in the direction of Zimbabwe.

These are not doomsayers by any stretch of the imagination. They are  people
who care deeply about South Africa  and  that  is  precisely  why  they  are
speaking out. If democracy is not about the freedom to  speak  out  and  the
freedom to choose, then democracy is about  nothing  at  all.  That  is  the
essence of a democracy and of our new democratic South Africa. [Applause.]

Again, the Minister of Defence today, speaker number seven of the ANC by  my
account on the  third  term,  spoke  about  this  issue  in  terms  of  past
resolutions, but all the President has to do is to speak about  it  himself.
And the issue was not raised by  the  Opposition.  I  wish  to  correct  the
Minister of Defence. It was raised by former President Mandela  himself.  It
is not a matter of electioneering. [Interjections.] It is about the  quality
of our democracy. I might add that public institutions such as  the  SABC-TV
are also about the quality of democracy. If it  is  a  good  democracy  that
gives an hour and a half free TV time to the ANC for  its  launch,  and  one
and a half minutes to the opposition for  their  launch,  then  I  say  that
certain things need fixing. [Interjections.]

If we are concerned, as we should be, about the quality of our  democracy  -
and not just its quantity -  then  I  believe  it  is  a  problem  when  our
President and our Government  aligns  itself  with  oppressors  like  Saddam
Hussein  and  his  government  and  Robert  Mugabe,  against  the  oppressed
majorities in their countries. I think when incipient tyrants such as  Jean-
Bertrand Aristide of Haiti  receive  millions  of  rands  of  South  African
taxpayers' money, that is a problem.

President Mbeki has today announced the election date.  There  are  only  65
days left before South Africans go to the  polls  in  our  third  democratic
election. I want  to  make  a  prediction  here,  Madam  Speaker,  that  the
Government is in for a surprise. [Interjections.] The DA and  the  Coalition
for Change are going to  make  historic  gains  in  every  single  province.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

I say this with confidence because we have listened to the people,  and  the
people want real change. You might not want to hear it, but let  the  people
speak through their ballots.

The SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members! Mr Leon.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: The people want an economy that grows  rapidly
- at 6% per annum or faster - so that millions of jobs can be  created.  The
people want a basic income grant of R110 per month so that millions of  poor
people can enter the cash economy.  The  people  want  150  000  new  police
officers on the street in the next three years so that we can start  winning
the war against crime. The people want a  massive  and  urgent  roll-out  of
Aids drugs so that millions of lives can be saved. The people  want  a  road
map to democracy in Zimbabwe and a foreign policy that stands up  for  human
rights.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Let the people speak!

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: And they will speak against  you,  Mr  Manuel.
These are the policies that will cement our true democracy. After ten  years
of democracy, our nation has reached a  critical  junction  in  its  history
where the path divides, and we must choose between those two roads.

If we stay on the road we are on - for all the good it has brought us  -  we
will condemn ourselves to slow economic growth, to a situation  where  crime
is high, HIV is spreading, empowerment benefits  only  a  few  and  not  the
many. However, if we choose a new road, the path of rapid  economic  growth,
fighting crime, treating HIV/Aids as the national emergency it actually  is,
empowering the many and not  the  few,  and  restoring  the  vision  of  the
Rainbow Nation, then South Africa  will  prosper  in  unity  and  in  peace.
[Applause.]

Frankly, Madam Speaker, the  choice  belongs  to  us.  As  the  Minister  of
Finance is keen to shout out and interject: Let the people choose!  We  have
absolute confidence in the judgment of the people. [Interjections.]  Because
we are on the side of the people. I want to tell you  today  that  the  real
essence of this election was summed up by the President of the  Republic  of
South Africa on Friday when he said: More of the same, business as usual.

We say: Real change on these key  issues,now  South  Africans  want  change,
because South Africa deserves  better.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  Thank
you very much, and let's go and win!

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, would you kindly remember that members  are
also supposed to be audible. If you drown the voices,  it  does  not  matter
which side, there is no point in having a debate.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President  and
Cabinet colleagues, hon members, dear friends, I am certain that most  South
Africans expected the debate on the state of the nation address to  be  more
than ordinary and for obvious reasons. It is already living up  to  some  of
those expectations. This year,  the  debate  on  the  state  of  the  nation
address by the President also gives this House an  opportunity  to  look  at
our own work over the past 10 years and to  deal  introspectively  with  the
issue of how far this institution has contributed to the realisation of  the
ideal to build a better country for all our people.

Allow me, at the outset, Madam Speaker,  to  send  our  condolences  to  the
family of baby Karabo Gwala who was recently killed in a freak  accident  in
Soweto. May God give them comfort during their time of pain.

A lot could be said here about the extent to which  the  Government  of  the
ANC has succeeded in bringing to fruition the ideal  of  building  a  better
future for our country.  As  has  been  repeated  several  times  from  this
podium, the most important yardstick for this success will  be  how  it  has
impacted on the lives of the most ordinary and the most  vulnerable  members
of our society. I would like my input in  part  to  focus  on  some  of  the
people who fall within this category - the rural women of  our  country  who
represent the majority of the people most affected by the problems  we  have
been trying to resolve over  the  past  10  years  since  the  dawn  of  our
democracy.

I thought it fitting to dedicate this speech to a woman who  symbolises  the
resilience and strength of these ordinary mothers of  our  nation,  a  woman
who has given so much to us and still remains an unsung heroine - in a  true
sense a mother to all of us - someone who has offered and  provided  without
asking for much in return. Because amongst the  rural  women  that  we  talk
about here today stands someone to whom we  should  duly  give  recognition,
Mama  Epainette  Mbeki,  the  mother  of  our  President  Thabo  Mbeki   ...
[Applause.] ... not only because she has given birth to such an  outstanding
leader who has meant a lot to his people, but because,  like  the  many  who
are legends of this ordinary sector of our people, she  has  truly  remained
committed to the community of Engcingwana, a small dusty village in  Idutywa
with whom she has remained until this day.

Despite the easy access to the high life she could  have  chosen  to  enjoy,
her story is the story of many others  who  have  remained  pillars  of  our
society. She has harboured no bitterness towards a  system  that  took  away
all the people she loved - a husband  to  Robben  Island,  and  children  to
foreign countries, and left her with a responsibility not  only  to  be  the
head of a family, but to lead and serve a community that to this  day  looks
up to her as their mother and grandmother, as well.  [Applause.]  We  should
salute mothers like her and duly allow them their rightful  recognition  and
place when the South African story is being told.

I would like to illustrate the story and character of these  women  so  that
when we assess the amount of work the  ANC  Government  has  done  in  their
development, we truly appreciate where they have come from and what  genuine
expectation they have for the future  of  a  country  whose  destiny  is  so
intertwined with theirs and that of their children.

Amongst the multitudes that descended on an empty piece of  land  that  cold
afternoon of 26 June 1955 in Kliptown were also many ordinary women who  had
come to add their voices in determining the kind of society they desired  to
live in. From this Congress of the People  the  Freedom  Charter  was  born,
which most importantly declared: The people shall govern.  Marching  towards
making this assertion a reality, the ANC carried it in all  its  activities,
in its planning and in the process of preparing to govern.

Just as it happened  on  that  day  in  Kliptown,  the  leadership  of  this
Government arrived in many dusty areas  through  the  Imbizo  programmes  to
listen to the people in a manner that demonstrates the ANC's  commitment  to
this brand of participatory democracy. The imbizo by leaders  of  Government
at all levels has provided a platform for us to  seek  further  mandates  to
consult and to give feedback to the people, true to the  declaration.  In  a
real sense, the people shall govern and the people are governing.

To this date the most ordinary of our  people,  the  majority  of  whom  are
these real rural women, are afforded an opportunity to interact  and  engage
their Government on issues affecting their lives and their  communities.  So
from the start we can be true to our mothers who gathered on  that  day  and
assert that the people are indeed governing.

During the run-up to the 1994 elections women gathered as part of  the  ANC-
convened people's forum and said to us that they would never truly feel  the
taste of freedom if they would still be condemned to being  hewers  of  wood
and drawers of water, live with their children in abject poverty and die  of
curable and preventable diseases. Some said their land had been  taken  away
from them, preventing them from producing their own food and  affecting  the
accommodation and housing of their families. Out of  these  and  many  other
fora, the Reconstruction and  Development  Programme  of  the  ANC  emerged.
Consultation and  report  -  backs  on  progress  regarding  these  problems
continued during the past 10 years.

During the past 10 years, what  then  has  been  the  response  of  the  ANC
Government to these and many other problems directly  inherited  from  these
decades of injustice and oppression? Hon members will  remember  that  since
Kliptown we have vowed that in the  South  Africa  that  we  envisaged,  all
should be equal before the  law.  Indeed,  during  its  first  decade,  this
democratic Parliament has passed laws that have made it possible  for  women
to be included as human beings and citizens with equal rights  and  standing
before  the  law.  Amongst  these  pieces  of  legislation  has   been   the
revolutionary Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, which has given  great
relief to rural women who used to be left by husbands who came  to  work  in
the big cities, married new wives through the Civil  Marriages  Act,  forced
the rural wives to lose all their rights to the matrimonial estate and  left
them destitute with dozens of children to feed.

This  new  policy  regime  has  created  institutions   that   monitor   the
implementation  of  women  empowerment  programmes  by  Government,  thereby
placing them strategically  in  a  position  to  be  watchdogs  for  women's
emancipation. The policy dispensation has  also  led  to  the  enactment  of
ground-breaking pieces of legislation in the areas of  human  rights,  black
economic  empowerment,  preferential  procurement  and,   of   course,   the
Termination of Pregnancy Act.

However, these pieces of legislation that  have  been  celebrated  by  women
throughout our country and the world over have been  demonised  by  some  of
our members in this House because some of them can never really imagine  how
it feels to be a woman under the yoke of institutionalised oppression.  Some
of these laws have directly contributed to the sense of security  that  many
women enjoy today. Whereas in the past they have been vulnerable  to  public
and domestic violence, today it is possible  for  them  to  seek  protection
from the ANC Government for themselves and their children.

Based on the foundation of this legislative and  policy  framework,  it  was
possible for the  ANC  Government  to  address  some  of  the  socioeconomic
problems facing our communities. The  ANC  Government  understood  that  the
provision of electricity and water in  the  rural  areas  was  not  just  an
exercise to make life easier in those communities, but that  for  women,  in
particular, it was a social revolution that reversed their roles  as  hewers
of wood and ensured that they would  sleep  better  in  the  knowledge  that
their children would no longer suffer from diseases such  as  cholera  as  a
result of drinking unclean water.

Of course, to someone who has had access to this  water  all  along  in  the
past, the provision of this water to the rural people might not seem such  a
big stride. Someone who has had eight taps in the same household might  even
move around and tell these communities that theirs  was  only  one  communal
tap provided by Government  to  serve  30  households.  However,  for  these
people, that one tap makes a huge difference because  it  brings  clean  and
healthy water that saves lives. [Applause.]

Again, the imbizo programmes have given us an opportunity to see  first-hand
the impact of the work of this Government on communities.  Many  communities
are now engaged  in  programmes  of  sustainable  development  supported  by
Government, and these are bringing a lot of relief to these areas where  the
battle for survival is a stark reality of daily life.  These  projects  have
included the support for new and emerging farmers in rural  areas,  and  the
land restitution programmes whose proper management  has  made  it  possible
for many ordinary people to return to their land with as little dispute  and
conflict as is possible. From this programme, ordinary communities in  rural
areas were afforded the possibility for  subsistence  farming.  Others  even
utilised  their  land  for  implementation  of  income-generating  projects.
Everyday communities are seeing meaningful changes in  their  lives  through
the support that this ANC Government has given to grass-roots projects  such
as these.

What has been most encouraging about most of these  projects  is  that  they
involve  work  that  has  been  initiated  by  communities  themselves,  and
Government has come through to support and sustain this. In  their  response
to your call, Mr President, for Letsema and  Vuk'uzenzele,  our  people  are
joining hands with the ANC  Government  to  drive  development  and  not  to
remain passive recipients of Government generosity.  Through  this  we  have
been successful in many areas to create work and fight  back  the  frontiers
of poverty - push back the frontiers of poverty.

Uhleka ntoni Meshoe ngoba mna nawe sibamnyama? [What are  you  laughing  at,
Meshoe, because you and I are black?] [Laughter.]

I have found it saddening that there have been certain people who have  been
at pains to use every opportunity they get to tell our people that the much-
needed services that the ANC Government provides  to  them  are  unbefitting
and  that  our  people  should  demand  much  more  better,   whatever   the
circumstances. If you provide a million houses for those who never  had  any
form of accommodation at all, there is always talk about  the  houses  being
too small. If you build a clinic, then the community will  be  told  not  to
appreciate it because it is not big enough or  that  it  does  not  open  24
hours. One of the things that we know, however, is  that  our  people,  even
those who have not yet received these services, are confident that there  is
a real commitment by this Government to change their lives for  the  better.
[Applause.]

Even if there are many more who still have not received  decent  housing  or
electricity, they too are given hope because millions who used  to  be  like
them now have  such  amenities.  In  the  past  few  years  these  shameless
prophets of doom have even tried to convince us that something is  seriously
wrong if black matriculants can write the same examination  as  their  white
counterparts and pass in large numbers. This was after they  had  complained
in the earlier years that the matric pass rate was too low because  the  ANC
Government could not improve the system.

The repeated calls that ``South Africa deserves better'' have  not  produced
a real alternative aimed at providing better solutions. For those  who  have
suffered for too long, if  anything,  the  slogan  ``South  Africa  deserves
better'' should be understood to mean that nonracial democracy  has  failed,
and that what South Africa  deserves  is  to  go  back  to  white  minority.
[Applause.]
Hon members,  I  also  thought  it  necessary  that  we  should  dispel  the
disturbing notions by some amongst us here in  this  House  who  think  that
just because they belong to an opposition political party, that  gives  them
the right to move around our country and  stand  on  the  podium  to  spread
horror stories of lies and innuendo. There are others  who  have  insinuated
that if it wins the next election, the ANC intends to  drastically  overhaul
the Constitution of the country by effecting  far-reaching  changes  on  the
basis of our constitutional democracy.

To reiterate, the ANC is proud of the Constitution of our country  and  what
it stands for, not only because we  have  been  the  biggest  driving  force
behind its development, but also because we genuinely  believe  that  it  is
good for our country and for its people. That commitment  is  not  about  to
change, for we  are  a  responsible  leadership  that  takes  seriously  the
responsibility that the majority of South Africans have entrusted  us  with.
[Applause.]

Unlike some of the members in the House, the ANC does not  have  the  luxury
to be casual and self-serving about matters  involving  governance  in  this
country. however, typical of some racist  white  parties  that  are  led  by
white leaders ... [Interjections] ... yes, by some white leaders -  some  of
them. The fact that a party is  predominantly  black  and  led  by  a  black
President cannot be good enough in South Africa, hence the DA's slogan  that
South Africa will be better off if  it  goes  back  to  colonialisation.  We
cannot be colonialised again. [Interjections.]

Therefore ... [Interjections] ... yes, as it were, black cannot  be  better;
yes, white is better. If a native in Zimbabwe grabs land, it is equal  to  a
native in South Africa. It  will  grab  land.  [Interjections.]  If  Namibia
amends its constitution to extend the president's term of office to a  third
term, it is equal to South Africa, and it means  that  native  is  going  to
amend the constitution so that he can get a  third  term.  [Applause.]  Yes,
yes, he will do it for himself because he is a native. Yes, all natives,  in
the convoluted mind of a racist, are the same. All of  them  are  the  same.
All natives are  the  same.  [Interjections.]  Your  fear  of  democracy  is
palpable. Your fear of democracy is palpable. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member! Hon member, would you  please  just  take  a
seat. Yes, Mr Gibson?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION:  Madam  Speaker,  on  a  point  of  order:
Before the hon member bursts, would you please call on her to  withdraw  her
racist remarks. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: I will look at Hansard  and  rule  on  that.  I  did  not  hear
exactly what was said. Please proceed, hon member.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you, Madam  Speaker.  During  his
address, President Mbeki  referred  to  the  fact  that  together  as  South
Africans we have been successful in forging a united and reconciled  nation,
that we are indeed in the main a nation of humble and forgiving  people.  He
said, and I quote:
  Over many decades, we had seen that these masses would always  refuse  to
  turn racist simply because they were subjected to cruel racist rule. They
  thought and acted as they did because they knew better than those who had
  been certified as learned, that it was only a just peace that  would  end
  their despair and bring into their lives the sense  of  hope  that  would
  make it possible for them to bear the pain of hunger until the  day  came
  when they would no longer be hungry.

Fourteen years before our President made this statement, the then  president
of the ANC, O R Tambo, had this to say, and I quote:


  We are accordingly inviting all those  who  love  peace,  prosperity  and
  freedom for all to join in the struggle that is bound to  result  in  the
  liberty of every single South African. In particular, we urge  our  white
  compatriots to join hands with us. Let us act now to salvage our  country
  from sinking into a bottomless pit. The time has come for us  to  make  a
  clean break with the past and begin with the difficult  task  of  healing
  the wounds that we afflicted upon ourselves for so long.

Again, there are some in our country who take very  lightly  the  commitment
our people have made to forgive.  Some,  in  fact,  take  for  granted  this
enormous achievement when they play down the benefits that our  country  has
enjoyed in the area of reconciliation and nation-building  as  a  result  of
the inception of this democracy. So  forgiving  are  we  that  at  times  we
deliberately shy away and avoid telling the horror stories  of  our  history
to our children for fear that they might harbour bitterness and  indulge  in
recrimination which we do not need in this country at this time and point.

The challenge is reconstruction of our country and  nation-building.  It  is
for us to instill a sense of patriotism in our children, thereby building  a
future generation that will defend, advance and deepen  our  democracy,  and
ensure that South Africa never again reverts to the  amount  of  hatred  and
inhuman injustice that some of us experienced.

There will never again be a swart gevaar. There will never again be a  white
gevaar in this country, and people should  accept  the  reality  that  South
Africa will not sink back to that  period  of  the  past  where  people  ...
[Interjections.] ... yes, where people used  racist  language.  This  fight-
back campaign and lack of acceptance of the fact  that,  yes,  unfortunately
you now have a black majority which is ruling the country,  is  a  shame  to
the country. [Time expired.] It is a shame. [Applause.]

THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, his Excellency  the  President,
his Excellency the Deputy President, hon members, in considering  the  state
of our nation ten years after its liberation, we must  call  on  our  sombre
sense of realism and pragmatism. In fact, in looking back at  the  past  ten
years we can rightly take pride  in  a  long  string  of  achievements.  The
President has  mentioned  some  of  them,  ranging  from  services  such  as
housing, water, electricity and  sanitation  having  been  delivered  to  an
enormous number  of  people  who  were  previously  denied  these,  to  many
beneficial development projects being under way. There  is  in  fact  a  lot
more which one may add to  what  the  President  stated  to  point  out  the
extraordinary nature of the season we have lived  in  during  the  past  ten
years.

In fact, we as a Government have completed an unprecedented  reform  of  all
our  laws,  ranging  from  the  Constitution  to  most  of  the  regulations
implementing the hundreds of laws this Parliament has passed to bring  about
beneficial change not only in each and every line  function  of  Government,
but in almost all fields of social, economic and cultural activities  within
our society.

One may only say that the only blemish in our  law-making  process  was  the
crossing of the floor amendment. I don't think that the scepticism  that  we
see about what may happen in the Constitution comes out of any  mistrust  on
the part of all of us. I think the old issue of the  President,  whether  he
will have a third term is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned. At the  same
time, however, I think that we cannot sweep under the carpet the fact  that,
whereas we've been told that the Constitution was  sacrosanct  and  that  it
could not be amended at the drop of a  hat,  it  was  in  fact  amended  for
purely expedient reasons.

One may also add what civil society itself has done in the past  ten  years,
which indeed completes the reassuring picture of social growth and  success.
In fact, Madam Speaker, if we look around all our major cities and  in  many
rural  areas  alike,  we  can  see  how  an  enormous  amount  of   physical
development has taken place, ranging  from  previously  unprecedented  large
shopping centres to massive business parks and infrastructure.

We can also take pride in  the  fact  that  our  society  has  accepted  and
absorbed such positive change in  a  remarkably  constructive  and  peaceful
manner. Not only has our society  held  together,  in  spite  of  the  great
acceleration given to its  internal  processes  and  dynamics,  but  it  has
coagulated even more in new forms of social and economic  harmony,  which  I
think are strengthening its internal unity and promise well for the  future.
One would need to be blind, I think, not  to  see  the  enormous  amount  of
positive, productive and constructive transformation which has  taken  place
in our country over the past ten years.

However, by the same token one must be  completely  blind  not  to  see  the
enormous problems and challenges our society is now facing.  In  considering
the state of our nation, we can rightly look at the  glass  being  half-full
and take pride in it. However, that is neither our job  nor  responsibility,
for we are tasked by the people we represent to fill  the  glass  completely
and must therefore focus and place emphasis on  the  empty  portion  of  the
glass and the many problems which cause our people to  suffer.  We  must  be
sensitive to the tears of our people even though the sun shines  beautifully
over our land.

Our people are suffering because of five major crises within our  land,  the
nature,  magnitude  and  implication  of  which  have  not  yet  been  fully
acknowledged in all that has been said. It is  regrettable,  Madam  Speaker,
that once again, in his state of the nation address, the President seems  to
have failed to acknowledge the existence and dramatic nature of  these  five
crises. One appreciates that the President has indicated that it is not  his
responsibility to identify programmes which may solve South  Africa's  grave
problems at this juncture, because that will be the  responsibility  of  the
new President elected at the next elections, who will  preside  over  a  new
Government with a new programme of action. However, as we look backward  and
at the  present,  it  is  our  collegial  responsibility  to  recognise  the
problems we  now  have,  and  express  the  critical  admission  that  these
problems have reached the present status of crisis  because,  for  the  past
ten years, their existence  has  been  neglected  and  underplayed,  if  not
outrightly denied.

I have mentioned these problems in my addresses, standing  at  this  podium,
to this House for the past five years, and the  fact  that  I  now  have  to
repeat myself indicates how necessary it is that the President of  the  next
Government really adopts a different attitude in recognising the  nature  of
these problems and  matching  them  with  adequate  solutions,  because  our
people are gravely suffering under their yoke. The next President  must  act
differently, even if it is the same President. [Laughing.]

I should not even  need  to  mention  these  five  problems  to  any  of  my
colleagues, or to most South African families, because every  South  African
is directly or indirectly affected by them. HIV/Aids,  unemployment,  crime,
poverty and corruption are the five crises which in one  way  or  the  other
affect the lives of each of our families.  No  South  African  is  insulated
from these crises. I know thousands of people who are infected with HIV  and
have gone to hundreds of funerals of people who have died of  Aids.  I  have
shared the sufferings of thousands more  who  are  affected  by  this  great
scourge on our land. Yet, those who are  suffering  are  still  waiting  for
available treatment which should have been rolled out  to  them  many  years
ago. Those who are affected by it  are  still  waiting  for  consistent  and
effective  Government  programmes,  dealing  with  Aids  orphans,  disrupted
families  and  the  generalised  need  for  both  social  and  health   care
specifically tailored to the widespread range of  effects  and  implications
of HIV/Aids on our communities.

Similarly, we are all affected by crime, and I know few South  Africans  who
in the past ten years have not been victims of crimes, or who  do  not  live
under the daily fear of becoming its  victims.  However,  the  magnitude  of
this problem has been denied and there  has  been  insufficient  recognition
that the infrastructure dealing with  it  is  fundamentally  inadequate  and
requires major overhauling, both in respect of  the  police  force  and  the
judiciary. Every South African has a story to tell in this respect  and  has
experienced the collapse in the crime-fighting machine. Yet the  nature  and
magnitude of this problem does not even feature in  how  the  state  of  our
nation is described.

For instance, not only on the occasion when my own cattle were  stolen,  but
even when the cattle of the King of the Zulu  nation  are  taken,  there  is
little or ineffective police investigation and nobody is apprehended.  Those
of us who may smile at stock theft as being a lesser crime, fail to  realise
its importance in the life of poverty-stricken  rural  communities,  and  do
not understand that in a country in which a king's cattle are not safe,  no-
one's Mercedes is safe either. The truth  is  that,  in  most  cases,  stock
theft has become a petty crime in our country. That was not the case  before
1994. [Interjections.]

It will be remembered that in a  previous  response  to  the  state  of  the
nation address by our President, I mentioned the extent  of  my  concern  at
what was virtually a breakdown of our  criminal  justice  system.  I  quoted
specific cases which were either mishandled, or just never came  before  our
courts. I mentioned the extent to which dockets were  lost,  and  that  even
murder cases  never  went  to  court  as  a  result  of  lost  dockets.  The
seriousness of this is that the  problem  of  crime  is  compounded  by  the
extent of this kind of corruption, which is quite widespread.

My colleague in Lesotho, the Minister of Home  Affairs  of  the  Kingdom  of
Lesotho, is very troubled about the extent of stock  theft  on  our  borders
with Lesotho. As I have already stated, this kind of crime has  impoverished
our people on both sides of the border. That is one reason  why  poverty  in
rural areas is today worse than before 1994, when we took over  the  running
of this country. [Interjections.]

Similarly, there is almost a growing perception that unemployment is one  of
South Africa's features which is meant  to  stay  with  us  as  a  necessary
curse. I have spent all my life right  here  in  South  Africa  amongst  the
poorest of the poor, but I shall  never  grow  used  to  the  image  of  our
squatter camps and the abject social and economic conditions  in  which  our
people live there. Each of us drive past squatter camps every time  we  move
from the airport to this Parliament, but I wonder  how  many  of  us  really
feel their hearts sinking, and their guts twisting, when  they  see  such  a
display of horror and despair. Perhaps some of  us  have  grown  comfortable
and feel that things in South Africa are now fine  because  they  are  fine,
when in fact, for the majority of our people, freedom has  not  yet  brought
about liberation from the slavery of abject poverty,  unhygienic  conditions
under which a large majority of  our  people  are  forced  to  survive,  and
ignorance for lack of education, knowledge and exposure.

Only through employment will our people achieve equal  dignity  and  freedom
from the enslavement of poverty. Sustainable massive  employment  generation
cannot be achieved with what has been done in the past five years,  or  with
what the ruling party  intends  to  do  in  the  future,  even  through  our
Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.  We  need  sustainable  and  accelerated
economic growth along the lines of the many  proposals  you  have  heard  me
making in this House  for  the  past  ten  years,  ranging  from  the  green
revolution which ought to transform our agriculture from land-intensive  and
low-added-value crops to labour-intensive and high-added-value produce,  all
the way creating an adequate industrial basis which  identifies  today  what
will be produced for the global markets, not now, but  twenty  years  later.
There are no shortcuts in terms of employment  generation,  of  course,  and
there are no excuses or justifications for not walking the hard  and  uphill
road ahead.

For years we have known that the minimum growth rate  we  need  to  achieve,
not to solve all our social problems, but merely to keep  them  at  bay,  is
that of 6% per year. This rate was  not  identified  in  our  macro-economic
strategy, Gear, as a maximum goal, but as a minimum  condition  of  success,
which really means that we are failing even on our own premises. And  if  we
are honest, we know the reasons why we are failing on our own  premises.  We
know for a fact that  the  Government  has  intended  actually  implementing
Gear, and we know that in fact that partners of the  ruling  party,  the  SA
Communist Party and Cosatu, actually prevented it from  doing  so.  We  must
have the strength to acknowledge it and the will to change it.

My concern is that by denying  problems,  we  are  offering  South  Africans
nothing more than much more of the  same,  while  the  pressure  of  present
circumstances requires us to create the hope for something  much  better  in
terms of which HIV/Aids, crime and unemployment may finally  be  solved.  We
must admit to the  problems  so  that  the  next  elections  may  become  an
opportunity for renewal and the catalyst of a new beginning.

The situation of poverty in rural  areas  has  been  affected  by  the  same
syndrome of denial - as those people were shouting at me just  now  -  which
has thus far paralysed Government action, in spite of the growing  suffering
of our rural people who, in their preponderance, are much  worse  off  today
than they were ten years ago.

You go to the Eastern Cape, you go to KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and  Mpumalanga
in the rural areas, and you will find that there is not a  single  patch  of
mealies, which was actually there before so that people could  actually  get
something to eat, especially in summer.

This might not be a psychologically rewarding statement that  I  am  making,
but it is a true one which we  must  admit  in  order  to  enable  the  next
President of the next Government to change  things  around,  beginning  from
the perception of the problem and ending with the  development  of  adequate
rural strategies.

By the same token, unless we have the courage at the next election  to  turn
over a new leaf, giving rise to the hope of a profound  renewal,  I  do  not
see how the cancer of corruption will ever be solved. Corruption  is  now  a
very serious problem in our country, which  many  of  us  do  not  have  the
courage to look straight in the eye, because it is  too  close  for  comfort
and affects many of us. We must have the courage of doing what  is  painful,
my colleagues, because corruption is a problem  that  knows  no  limits  and
could grow into becoming worse, beyond our wildest fears.

In the state of the nation address, his Excellency the President often  made
reference to his predecessor,  former  President  Mandela.  Undoubtedly,  we
must  regain  the  legacy  of  optimism,  self-confidence  and  hope   which
characterises that precidency and that administration. However, we  must  go
beyond that, so as to regain our real roots as they are  in  the  liberation
movement which originally gave us purpose.

I grew up at the knees of Inkosi Albert Luthuli who was my  mentor.  At  one
time, as a young man of eighteen years doing matric at Adams College, I  did
errands for my uncle, Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme, the founder  of  the  ANC.  I
used to help him with his correspondence. He dictated to me as  I  wrote  in
longhand, after one of his eyes had been removed by doctors, when  it  could
no longer see.

Some of the stalwarts of the  ANC  joined  Inkatha  in  the  70s  after  the
apartheid regime banned our liberation movements.  Mr  A  W  G  Champion,  a
former leader of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, and Mr H Selby Msimang,  who  was
the provincial secretary of the ANC in our province, were  both  members  of
the central committee of Inkatha at the time of their deaths.

I was a student of Prof Z K Matthews, the former leader of the  ANC  in  the
Cape. The Rev James Calata, a stalwart of the ANC, visited me in  1968,  and
was with me when  I  buried  my  late  cousin,  King  Cyprian  Bhekuzulu  ka
Solomon.

Madam Speaker, hon speaker and hon members, what I am saying is that I  have
also learnt - as much as the President  referred  to  our  leader  President
Mandela - from the lips of the ANC's founding fathers. I grew up in the  ANC
and I was the ANC as much as the ANC was me. This was before something  went
wrong in the ANC and the ANC became somewhat  different  from  what  is  was
created to be by its founding fathers, who led it originally.

The option of violence, intimidation and the armed  struggle  advocated  and
embraced by some, changed things around and produced a  movement  which  was
more tailored to the conquering of power, rather than caring for the  people
we represent, and to formulating a vision which can  accommodate  all  South
Africans.

The original ANC had a vision which  was  tailored  to  creating  a  country
which can make and fulfil promises to  all  its  children,  irrespective  of
race, colour, creed or social status. We  need  to  go  back  now  to  those
roots, to turn a page at the next  elections  and  develop  a  vision  which
critically admits the severe problems we now have  and  formulates  a  long-
term  strategy  which  addresses  both  the  needs  of  the  poor  and   the
expectations of the rich and describes to all  South  Africans  how,  in  20
years, we plan to make our country succeed, so that  we  may  all  buy  into
that plan and endure the sacrifices required for its realisation.

I would like to say that  the  President,  during  the  launch  of  the  ANC
manifesto in Pietermaritzburg, made an appeal that when the  election  takes
place, it must take place in a situation where there is no  intimidation  or
violence. In his speech, the hon President referred to  the  doomsayers  and
said that, instead of their pained emotional speeches threatening  impending
violence  during  the  forthcoming  elections,  there   could   be   radical
constitutional amendments  after  the  elections  by  the  very  people  who
drafted this Constitution.

I would like to say to His Excellency,  the  President,  that  I  am  rather
nervous. When we  launched  our  manifesto,  I  reiterated  the  President's
appeal that we should have an  election  without  intimidation  and  without
violence. I said so, notwithstanding the  fact  that  on  the  8th,  when  I
travelled to Durban to see whether people were registering, as  Minister  of
Home Affairs and not as president of the IFP, when  I  got  to  Lamontville,
the deputy leader of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Cele, was there.

Shortly after I left, a kombi-load of people who were wearing  ANC  T-shirts
said: ``Where is he? What does he want  here?  What  does  he  want  here?''
[Interjections].  And  the  next  thing  ...  Madam  Speaker,   I   am   not
intimidatable. You are wasting your time. You cannot intimidate me.

The next thing that happened, is that the few members of the  IFP  who  were
wearing IFP T-shirts - there were people wearing  ANC  T-shirts  and  people
wearing IFP T-shirts - had their T-shirts torn off their  bodies,  including
a woman of 89 years, in the presence of the deputy leader of  the  province.
[Interjections.]

What is more, when the ANC launched its manifesto in KwaZulu-Natal,  we  did
not do anything either to undermine it or do anything about it. And yet,  on
the 17th, on the eve of our launch, an ANC councillor in  Clermont  shot  at
the car,  damaging  the  windscreen,  of  a  member  of  this  Assembly,  Mr
Tshabalala. He is out on bail of R5 000.

What is more, yesterday my party had a rally in Escort  and  people  wearing
ANC T-shirts - I will not say they were ANC, but they were  wearing  ANC  T-
shirts - shot at our people and four  people  were  injured  and  rushed  to
hospital.

I mention this, so that it can get the attention it  deserves,  because  the
President wishes that we should have an intimidation-free and  violence-free
election, and I as leader of my party wish that too, but  these  wishes  may
be undermined by certain elements. [Interjections.] It is  no  use  shouting
at me for mentioning these facts.
I say we should endure the sacrifices required for the  realisation  of  our
dreams, for unless we do so, the present crises of  HIV/Aids,  unemployment,
crime, poverty and corruption are going to increase and  become  of  such  a
nature that they will obfuscate all the gains  of  our  liberation  and  the
extraordinary achievements which we have undoubtedly  secured  in  the  past
ten years.

I appeal that in the spirit of the legacy of President Mandela, we must  now
transform our betrayed revolution of goodwill to move from the  old  to  the
really new.

I just want to draw the attention of members of this House to  the  headline
of an article by Mr Dumisani Makhaya which appears in this  morning's  paper
in KwaZulu-Natal:


  A marriage made in hell - The DA/IFP alliance  is  based  on  expediency.
  This makes it impracticable for the ANC to invite the IFP into its future
  government.

Now, to be quite honest, I think that if we are all honest here, it is  well
known  that  for  survival  I  had  to  seek  the  assistance  of  the   DA.
[Interjections.] I had to. Yes, I had to. There is nothing wrong with  that,
because when you interfered with the Constitution and amended  it  to  steal
members for your party, I had to do something about  that.  [Interjections.]
It is  a  fact  that  governments  change  and  parties  are  ousted  during
elections. I accept that. I do not mind if it is done through  an  electoral
process, but not through the system of crossing  the  floor,  of  chequebook
politics - not on that basis.

I would like to say that in actual fact I  pity  Madam  Speaker,  you  know,
because I thought that after ten years we would be more  civilised  than  we
were  ten  years  ago.  Robust  debate  is  accepted,  and  also  quips  and
interruptions are accepted, but the intimidatory nature of  how  people  are
shouted at here in fact belies the fact that we are a democracy.

I would like to say that the really new South Africa must be built with  the
commitment and sacrifices of all, to make it become a decent and  prosperous
place for all.

All of you know that in 1999, when President Mbeki approached me and  called
me to his office and said that we must continue to serve in his  Government,
we did so, because more than 20  000  black  people  died  in  the  conflict
between our members. Twenty thousand people - more people than had  died  in
the Anglo Boer War died. So, it was for a very good reason and  not  for  an
expedient reason. The fact that we tried to have the committee  of  three  a
side, in fact was in order to consolidate that reconciliation which we  were
trying to achieve.

When I talk about these matters and members try just to trivialise  them,  I
fear for the future of this country. I fear for our  future,  because  these
are very serious matters. When I  am  talking  about  matters  of  life  and
death, I shudder when I see the extent  to  which  people  are  trivialising
that.

I would like to say that I have been very grateful to the President  of  the
Republic of South Africa for giving me the opportunity to try  with  him  to
consolidate the relationship between our two parties, not for  the  sake  of
President Mbeki, not for my sake, not for the sake of the ANC, not  for  the
sake of the IFP, but for the sake of South Africa.

I appreciated that. The fact that we have failed does not mean it  was  easy
to accomplish. No one will say that we did not try. So, with these words,  I
would like to say that I dream of a peaceful election,  now  that  you  have
announced the date of the election. I pray that God,  being  the  great  God
that he is, will hear our prayers and let the election be peaceful. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam  Speaker,  Your  Excellency
Mr President, hon members, the one message that I would like to  leave  with
you in this debate, is that the economy has never been better managed.

The evidence is there for all to see. Books have been written and  rewritten
about the successes of this  economy  since  this  ANC-led  Government  took
over. Commentators and analysts are fully occupied trying to demystify  this
miracle that is South Africa because of the policies of  the  ANC  which  we
adopted and implemented since 1994.

We talked to big businesses, we talked to black  businesses,  we  talked  to
the trade unions, we talked to the farmers, the youth,  the  businesswomen's
associations, and all of them testified to an economy that is well  managed.
They give evidence that inflation has  gone  down,  they  give  evidence  of
increased income levels, and they give evidence of increased profits  and  a
GDP that has improved.

However, we also spoke to the masses of our people through the  door-to-door
campaigns and through imbizos, and although they  do  not  talk  about  GDP,
about inflation and about all these economic terms, they do speak of  having
a decent roof over their heads. They speak of having clean water  to  drink,
wash and cook. They speak of electricity in the house, of  a  telephone  not
far from the house. They speak of new roads, new schools,  new  clinics  and
houses. They talk of how their lives have improved and how  they  have  hope
for the future.

These people, whose aspirations were zero in 1994,  now  aspire  to  greater
and better things. When you go to their villages and to the  townships  they
say, ``You know, we are happy with the school the Government has  built.  We
are happy with this house. We are happy with the clinics, but  our  children
have no place to play. There are no sport amenities. There are no  community
halls.'' They will even go out and show you. ``Can you see  that  field?  It
was reserved for a community hall. Can't the Government do  something  about
it? ''That is a sign of a better life. As we all know, aspirations  grow  as
one's standard of living improves. All  this,  I  say,  is  evidence  of  an
economy that is well managed and that has freed resources for  us  to  start
addressing our social needs.

Of course there are those who only see  economic  growth  in  terms  of  the
number of jobs created, but I dare say  that,  besides  these  masses,  even
respected and independent opinionmakers are testifying that this economy  is
well managed. Here I want to quote from  The  Daily  Despatch  of  6  Friday
2004, even before the President had made his state of  the  nation  address.
Note that this is not the City Press; it's The Daily Despatch. You know  who
is the editor. This is the editorial opinion and I quote:


  Political honchos expect an upbeat and optimistic speech  from  President
  Thabo Mbeki at the opening of Parliament in Cape Town this  morning.  Not
  only is this an election year, but the ANC Government has  much  to  talk
  about with pride, if not satisfaction. The exchange value of the rand  is
  way up. Inflation is way down. Our  international  business  ratings  are
  excellent and economic forecasts are optimistic. If this  Government  has
  achieved nothing else in 10 years, it will still deserve credit  for  its
  control of its spending and the country's finances.  It  has  steadfastly
  resisted the temptation of paying  political  favours  with  jobs  or  of
  erecting grandiose works  in  its  own  honour.  Our  civil  service  has
  contracted and our monuments have been modest  and  generally  practical.
  Anybody who has driven between our major cities  must  have  noticed  the
  quality of the roads, the scattering of new schools, the  mushrooming  of
  RDP housing schemes outside every town, taps, where there  was  no  water
  and, at night, the twinkling of lights in villages which  once  lived  by
  candles.

It's not me, it's the editor who says that. [Applause.] He goes on to say:


  Those who see only debts need brooms. Less visible, more  subtle  but  no
  less pervasive have been changes  within  the  very  bloodstream  of  the
  country - in welfare, in business, health, justice, education, sport  and
  every other form of socioeconomic life. None of it is perfect, but  there
  is also no going back.

He goes on to raise concerns, and I must say that he has  very  constructive
criticism.

To appreciate how well we have done with this economy, it  is  important  to
understand what we have inherited. By 1994 South Africa's economy was in  an
advanced  stage  of  decline  due  to  political  isolation,  inward-looking
economic policies and the legacy of racial exclusion. Our GDP was  stagnant,
resulting in a  decline  in  the  per  capita  GDP,  declining  savings  and
investment rates, and falling employment rates. This ANC-led Government  had
to respond decisively and boldly to this state of affairs.

It was not an easy task to take over  and  correct  in  10  years  what  was
destroyed in more than 300 years of colonial and  apartheid  oppression.   I
can say that the South African economy in 2004  is  stronger,  more  dynamic
and more robust than it was in 1994. This strength comes after 10  years  of
successful interventions by the ANC-led Government and it provides  a  solid
basis for the continued growth and expansion of the economy  over  the  next
10 years.
Interventions made during the first 10 years of  democracy  start  with  the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, and  later  the  Gear  policy  and
then the Microeconomic Reform Strategy.  Despite  what  other  people  might
believe, Gear is part of our policies that we  implement  today.  There  has
been a build-up from the RDP to Gear,  to  macroeconomic  and  microeconomic
reforms.

Our  overarching  approach  has  been  firstly  to   provide   an   enabling
environment for business through macroeconomic stability, as such  stability
provides a predictable environment  in  which  businesses  can  operate  and
flourish, and secondly, to make decisive interventions in  an  economy  that
required  structural  transformation  in  order  to  move  away   from   the
protectionist, uncompetitive and primary sector bias that was  in  existence
prior to 1994.

Over the past few years, we have seen the positive impact  of  macroeconomic
stability and structural transformation of the economy and  the  role  these
measures have played in facilitating our successful entry  into  the  global
economy. These measures provide the  framework  for  us  to  continue  on  a
positive and sustained growth path over the next 10 years -  a  growth  path
that will contribute to our  stated  objectives  of  job  creation,  poverty
eradication, a more egalitarian society and black economic  empowerment.  By
addressing these objectives and including more people, in  particular  black
people, into the economic mainstream, we  will  in  turn  further  stimulate
economic growth and tackle the challenges posed by the second economy.

Some of the interventions that have arisen from our policy of  macroeconomic
stability and structural transformation measures include  the  following:  a
reduction of the budget deficit; repayment  of  foreign  debts;  setting  an
inflation target and putting in place a Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework;
and overhauling the bureacracy in key economic organisations,  such  as  the
Department of Trade and Industry, the National Treasury, the  South  African
Revenue Service, Public Works, and Mineral and Energy, amongst others.  This
has led to better policies, incentives, improved spending on  infrastructure
projects and a more efficient tax collection system.

Other interventions include developing an industrial strategy that  promotes
the diversification of our economy; growth of the manufacturing  sector  and
competitiveness in a global economy; opening up the South  African  economy;
promoting trade and growing the export market through  reduction  of  import
tariffs; concluding trade agreements; participation in  international  trade
bodies;  implementation  of  World  Trade  Organisation   compliant   export
incentives; and developing closer links with other countries in Africa.

These links are not only at the political level. We have seen economic  ties
being improved and economic agreements being concluded with our neighbours.

We have introduced numerous policies and pieces of legislation that seek  to
positively transform our economy and empower our  people.  Such  legislation
includes the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, the National  Small
Business Act, the National Procurement Act, the  Minerals  Rights  Act,  and
the Land Restitution Act. It is  important  to  mention  here  that  in  the
development of the policies and in the  introduction  or  amendment  of  the
legislation,  the  ANC-led  Government  has  consistently   been   open   to
negotiation and prepared to listen to the economic citizens of our  country.
Where necessary, we have adjusted our policies and amended our  legislation.
This openness has had an important stabilising effect  on  our  economy.  We
have been successful in attracting investors  into  our  country.  Investors
have  started  to  recognise  South  Africa  as  an   important   investment
destination. This recognition has come through our macroeconomic  stability,
sound economic policies and marketing of South Africa, as  well  as  through
hosting and participating  in  international  fora,  leading  and  receiving
numerous trade missions and having foreign economic representation. We  have
also attracted investment by focusing on  the  development,  clustering  and
support of key sectors such as automotive,  ICT,  tourism,  agro-processing,
clothing and textiles, and minerals and beneficiation.

I have mentioned only a few of the key economic interventions that  we  have
embarked on since the start of our democracy. These interventions have  been
implemented alongside a  broad  range  of  social  support  measures  which,
firstly, ensure that the most impoverished in  our  country  have  a  social
safety net, secondly, measures that deal with the  skills  shortage  of  our
people; thirdly, measures which  ensure  that  the  problems  of  crime  are
tackled; and fourthly, that the prevalence of HIV/Aids is reduced  and  that
those who live with the disease are given the necessary support.

I dare say that ten years is a very short period  to  address  our  colonial
and apartheid past, yet we have made remarkable progress, progress that,  in
1994, many would not have believed  possible  from  an  ANC-led  Government.
Some of the achievements of the past decade include an average  growth  rate
of approximately 2,8% over the past 10 years. I wish to reiterate  what  our
President said on this issue in his state  of  the  nation  address,  and  I
quote:


  The country is currently experiencing the longest period  of  consistent,
  positive GDP growth.

This growth compares favourably to the negative  growth  that  this  country
experienced from 1990 to the end of 1993, which was  on  average  -0,5%.  It
also compares favourably with other developing countries, with South  Africa
having the least volatile GDP  growth  of  all  developing  economies  since
1994. It should also be noted that our growth took place  during  the  Asian
currency crisis in 1998 and also during the global downturn - from  2001  to
2003. The performance of our economy as measured  by  the  growth  rate  has
been good since democracy. With the global economy starting to pick  up,  we
should see a positive impact on South Africa's  economic  growth  from  this
year.

Secondly, South Africa has become a  competitive  economy  that  has  jumped
several places in the world competitiveness index to rank  at  42  in  2003.
The countries that ranked ahead of us on this list are mainly the  developed
and industrialised countries of Europe and North America.  Evidence  of  our
growing competitiveness is that our volume of trade, which includes  imports
and exports, has  more  than  tripled  since  1994.  This  growth  has  been
stimulated by the growth in  volume  of  South  African  exports,  which  on
average  grew  by  8,8%  per  annum  since  1994.  This  is  an   impressive
performance which has not abated as a result of  the  strengthening  of  the
rand. We have also seen a steady inflow  of  capital  into  the  country,  a
significant proportion of which is for productive investments. For  example,
last year alone, R5 billion was invested in South Africa.

Thirdly, we have a manufacturing sector that  far  outperforms  the  primary
sector when it  comes  to  productive  capacity  and  exports.  Manufactured
exports are our biggest export sector at the  moment  and  constitute  about
32% of total exports, which is a complete reversal of the situation that  we
found here, where the country and the main  exports  were  just  of  primary
products of gold and diamonds.
Fourthly, there is a more efficient bureaucracy, which makes  it  easier  to
do business in South Africa. South Africa was recently recognised  as  being
in the top five of developing countries when it comes to  ease  of  starting
and operating a business. It ranks in the top 30 countries in  the  business
competitive index. An example of one of these  improvements  in  the  public
sector  is  the  Company  Registrations  Office,  which  has   reduced   the
registration time for a new business from six weeks in 1994  to  three  days
in 2004.

Fifthly, our inflation rate is under control,  at  between  3%  and  6%  per
annum. We have almost cleared our short-term foreign currency debt,  putting
us in a very strong position to build our currency reserves, both  of  which
have a stabilising effect on the economy and on the value of the rand.

Sixthly, there has been a significant change in our relationship with  other
countries in Africa. Investment and trade with  other  countries  in  Africa
has grown substantially, with South  Africa  becoming  one  of  the  largest
foreign direct investors in Africa and, since 1994,  increasing  the  volume
of trade with African countries by an average of 17% per annum.

Finally, we have had the release of the BEE strategy which has  resulted  in
several sectors concluding their own BEE charters. Too often we hear  people
arguing that the ANC-led Government is not  doing  enough  in  the  area  of
economic growth. They say that it is not creating jobs and that it  has  not
achieved broad-based black economic empowerment. I think they are  misguided
if they believe that South Africa would have achieved  any  measure  of  the
economic long-term stability and success that I have spoken about  today  if
we had pursued any other economic strategy. That's the reason the  President
said that our policies are correct and we are still going  to  pursue  them.
We are not going to change them. [Applause.]

There may have been projects or areas  which  could  have  had  been  better
implemented over the past ten years, and yet, when we  consider  the  bigger
picture and the progress that we have  made,  we  should  give  ourselves  a
round of applause because we have achieved remarkable success. We have  also
received international accolades for our well-managed  economy.  [Applause.]
These are positive indications that  we  have  pursued  the  correct  policy
framework. As the President said in his address, we will  continue  on  this
path - only with better implementation.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that during this period, we  have  set  the
stage for future growth, for the creation of many  more  new  jobs  and  for
sustainable broad-based black economic  empowerment  ventures,  so  that  in
future, more people will have access  to  and  be  part  of  our  successful
economy. Yes, there are challenges and we are aware of them, and we as  this
ANC-led Government do indeed have a plan to confront these challenges  in  a
spirit of partnership with all South Africans.

Ngithi kuMntwana  waKwaphindangene:  Kungidabukisile  kakhulu  lokhu  okusho
lapha, baba, ngoba okunye angivumelani ngempela nakho ukuthi kanti  izinkomo
zabantu emaphandleni ziqale ukwebiwa ngo-1994  ngoba  phela  izimpi  zalapha
eMzansi  Afrika  eziningi  zaqaliswa  ukwebiwa  kwezinkomo.  Nokuthi  abantu
basemaphandleni  bayalamba  namhlanje   ngenxa   yezinkomo   zabo   ezebiwe,
angivumelani nakho. Abantu basemaphandleni  namaphandle  ngokwawo  ayingxaki
esuka ekuphathweni kwaleli zwe esikhathini esidlule.  Nakhona  lokho  ukuthi
impela ungaze ugxumele emkhumbini ocwilayo kababa uTony  Leon  impela  nakho
kungidabukisile.  [Kwaphela  isikhathi.]  (Translation  of  Zulu   paragraph
follows.)

[I want to say this to the Prince of Kwaphindangene:  What  you  said  here,
hon member, saddened me very much, because I don't agree  with  some  of  it
completely. Stock theft in rural areas started in 1994  because  most  South
African conflicts were started by stock theft.  I  also  want  to  say  that
people in rural areas are hungry because their cows  were  stolen.  I  don't
agree with that. People in rural areas and rural settlements as such  are  a
problem, which stems from the way in which this country was governed in  the
past. Also, the fact that you jumped into  Tony  Leon's  sinking  boat  also
saddened me. [Time Expired.]]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Hon Deputy Speaker, the cat is finally out  of  the  bag.
According to the hon leader of the IFP, the  DA-IFP  alliance  is  based  on
expediency and not on conviction. No wonder it won't last. [Interjections.]

Deputy Speaker, according to the Chinese calender, 2004 is the Year  of  the
Monkey,  the  same  year  as  South  Africa's  third  democratic  elections.
According to mythology, each year portrays the same characteristics  as  its
patron animal. Monkey business will  therefore  be  the  order  of  the  day
during this year. [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  The  dictionary  defines  monkey
business as  ``deceitful  behaviour''.  The  election  campaign  has  hardly
started, but some political parties in this House already  excel  in  monkey
business, in other words, in deceitful behaviour.

At the top of the list is the DA with its claim - you heard  it  again  this
afternoon - that it is an alternative government and that the hon  Leon  has
a chance of  becoming  the  next  President  of  South  Africa.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]
This is not going to happen on 14 April. It is not going to happen in  2009.
As a matter of fact,  it  is  not  going  to  happen  during  this  century.
[Applause.]  Given  the  fact  that  the  ANC  adopted  a  market-orientated
economy, no party to the right of the ANC will ever be able  to  unseat  the
ANC as Government of the day. [Applause.] Only a party to the  left  of  the
ANC has that potential, with devastating  consequences  for  the  future  of
this country.

The New NP therefore firmly believes that it is in  the  best  interests  of
South Africa to strengthen the centre of the political spectrum. The New  NP
furthermore believes that the best way of promoting  the  interests  of  its
support base is to co-operate with the Government instead of  screaming  and
kicking on the sidelines for ever. [Applause.]

However, the cherry on the cake of deceitful behaviour comes  from  the  hon
Chief Whip of the DA, who portrays the hon leader of the DA as an  Afrikaner
icon. Now, the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  may  be  many  things,  but  an
Afrikaner icon, aikona. [Laughter.] Perhaps an icon for those who revert  to
the past, but an Afrikaner icon, no! Let me give some  good  advice  to  the
hon Chief Whip. Leave it to  the  Afrikaners  to  choose  their  own  icons.
[Applause.]

Accusing former President F W de Klerk of  treason  for  endorsing  the  co-
operation between  the  ANC  and  the  New  NP  places  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition squarely in the camp of the far right, who also accused  F  W  de
Klerk of treason when he unbanned the ANC and the SACP. [Applause.]

Another  party  guilty  of  deceitful   behaviour   is,   of   course,   the
Vryheidsfront Plus.

Die front poseer graag as 'n respektabele party wat slegs daarop uit  is  om
Afrikanerbelange binne die konteks van internasionale verdrae  te  bevorder.
Onder die leiding van die agb dr Pieter Mulder was dit inderdaad so.  Vandat
die party homself  egter  nou  met  die  KP  ``geplus''  het,  het  hy  alle
geloofwaardigheid in dié  opsig  verloor,  want  onder  die  helfte  van  sy
ondersteunersbasis tel nou mense wat nog altyd  aan  blanke  baasskap  binne
die grense van die ou Suid-Afrika geglo het, en  wat  dit  nog  steeds  glo.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The front likes posing as a respectable party whose only aim is to  promote
Afrikaner interests within the context  of  international  agreements.  This
was indeed the case under the  leadership  of  the  hon  Dr  Pieter  Mulder.
However, since the party has now ``plussed'' itself  with  the  CP  it  also
lost all credibility in this respect, because amongst half of its  supporter
basis there are now people who  have  always  believed  in  white  supremacy
within the borders of the old South Africa,  and  who  still  believe  this.
[Interjections.]]

Another party that is a master of deceitful behaviour  is,  of  course,  the
Independent Democrats. The hon De Lille wants people  to  believe  that  her
party is going to get 5% of the votes, but unsubstantiated allegations  that
Cabinet Ministers were former spies of the  apartheid  government  and  that
the President himself is involved in the so-called arms scandal  won't  even
bring her 1% of the votes. After the election it won't  be  the  Independent
Democrats, it will only be an Independent Democrat.

Believe it or not, another party guilty of deceitful behaviour is the  ACDP.
They want to lead people to believe that they are the only party capable  of
promoting biblical values in this country, which, of course,  is  not  true.
There are members in every caucus who believe that one should be  guided  by
biblical  principles  when  making  political  decisions.   These   members,
however, unlike the ACDP, do not use the Bible  as  a  political  manifesto.
[Interjections.] What I find problematic is the fact that  the  party  bases
itself exclusively on a specific religion. Now that may turn  out  to  be  a
dangerous exercise in a country characterised by its diversity. Politics  is
about the struggle for power, and if that struggle  is  then  launched  from
different religious trenches, we may end up as a second Northern Ireland.

The New NP wishes to co-operate with the Government in alleviating  poverty,
which is the biggest problem facing South Africa.  The  key  to  alleviating
poverty is economic growth. The UN Millennium Summit resolved  to  have  the
number of the world's poor halved by  2015.  Africa  south  of  the  Sahara,
including of course South Africa, needs  growth  of  about  7%  annually  to
achieve this objective.

In other words, if South Africa wants to address  poverty  effectively,  the
economy will have to generate growth of 7% instead of the  current  2%.  The
key  to  economic  growth  is  investment,  investment  by  South   Africans
themselves, but also foreign direct investment. The lack of property  rights
on the continent of Africa hampers economic growth, because due  to  a  lack
of title deeds, assets cannot be used as  collateral  for  further  economic
expansion.

A Peruvian economist estimated that the total value of  Africa's  informally
owned houses and farmlands in 1997 amounted to $1 trillion. Better  property
rights foster confidence and therefore investment. Mozambique is a  case  in
point. Since families' occupancy rights were codified in  law  in  2000  and
investors can buy long leases, economic growth has been in double-digits  in
four of the past six years. South Africa should follow  suit  and  leave  no
stone unturned in securing property  rights  and  establishing  security  of
tenure.

Unfortunately, since independence, some African governments have  tended  to
weaken property rights rather than strengthen  them.  A  case  in  point  is
Zimbabwe. The latest on the list for confiscation  is  the  property  rights
belonging to Anglo American. A bilateral  agreement  on  the  protection  of
property rights between South Africa and Zimbabwe is long overdue.

During question time in this House, the  hon  President  indicated  that  he
would ask for the most up-to-date details regarding this  matter.  Hopefully
the hon President will be in a position to announce some  progress  on  this
very important issue during his reply.

Secure property rights should also attract foreign direct investment. It  is
a  fallacy  to  regard  Africa  as  a  high-risk  area  for  foreign  direct
investment. The UN  Economic  Commission  for  Africa  calculates  that  for
Africa as a whole, the average return on foreign direct investment  is  four
times that in  G8  countries  and  twice  that  in  Asia.  South  Africa  is
undoubtedly, therefore, a safe haven for foreign capital.

The New NP also wants to co-operate with the ANC in creating  jobs  for  the
unemployed. The envisaged Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  is  a  welcome
short-term solution. A  government,  however,  can  never  be  a  sufficient
creator of jobs. In most developed countries, small and  medium  enterprises
are the biggest job creators. We fell well short in this regard, because  in
our country small and medium enterprises  contribute  about  half  of  total
employment. Spectacular incentives are therefore needed  to  stimulate  this
sector. Rigid labour laws also need to be reviewed. At the end of the day  a
low-paid job is perhaps better than no job at all.

Die Nuwe NP wil saam met die ANC werk  om  misdaad  te  bekamp.  Hoewel  die
getal moorde afgeneem het, is dit nog steeds onaanvaarbaar  hoog.  'n  Suid-
Afrikaner se kanse om vermoor te word, is  vyf  keer  hoër  as  dié  van  'n
Amerikaner. Afgesien van meer effektiewe polisiëring,  is  swaarder  strawwe
beslis 'n deel van die antwoord. Die doodstraf behoort oorweeg  te  word  in
gevalle waar moord met brutale geweld gepleeg word. Tot tyd en  wyl  behoort
die  Regering  dit  te  oorweeg  om  lewenslange  gevangenisstraf  inderdaad
lewenslank te maak.

Die Nuwe NP neem met trots deel  aan  die  feesvieringe  om  tien  jaar  van
demokrasie te herdenk. As dit nie was vir die versiendheid  van  die  leiers
van die ANC en die destydse NP nie,  sou  hierdie  demokrasie  nie  die  lig
gesien het nie. Soos wat die ANC en die NP toe die  regte  ding  gedoen  het
deur te onderhandel eerder as om te baklei, doen die ANC en die Nuwe NP  nou
ook die regte ding om saam te werk  in  belang  van  Suid-Afrika  en  al  sy
mense. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The New NP wants to work with the ANC to combat crime. Although the  number
of murders has decreased, it is still unacceptably high. A  South  African's
chances of being murdered is five times higher than  that  of  an  American.
Apart from effective policing, heavier penalties are definitely part of  the
answer. Capital punishment should be considered in  cases  where  murder  is
committed with brutal  violence.  In  the  meantime  the  Government  should
consider making life-long imprisonment life-long indeed.

The New NP take pride in participating in  the  festivities  to  commemorate
ten years of democracy. If it were not for the vision of the leaders of  the
ANC and the former NP, this democracy would not have seen the light. As  the
ANC and the NP did the right thing by negotiating rather than fighting,  the
ANC and the New NP are now also doing the right  thing  by  co-operating  in
the interests of South Africa and all its people. [Applause.]]

Business suspended at 16:10 and resumed at 16:24.

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, Comrade  President,  Comrade  Deputy
President, comrades and hon members, a few weeks from now we will  celebrate
our first decade of democracy and freedom.  For  decades  South  Africa  had
been developed into four separate communities, the one  hardly  knowing  the
other; the one the master and the others the servants.

On 27 April 1994 millions of our people experienced freedom  for  the  first
time. They took their rightful place as the true sons and daughters  of  our
land. The shackles of apartheid were finally broken and their human  dignity
was restored. On that memorable day the reconstruction  and  development  of
our country, which  had  experienced  over  300  years  of  destruction  and
underdevelopment, began.

There are people in our country, including some here in  this  Chamber,  who
constantly state that nothing has changed,  and  that  the  destruction  and
underdevelopment of 300 years should have been undone within a short  period
of time. Those who make such statements do so because they have  always  had
everything. They do not know what life is  like  without  having  access  to
water, sanitation, electricity,  tarred  roads,  streetlights,  security  of
tenure and ownership of their own homes.

The message they send out is that they have  neither  care  nor  compassion,
and would rather not see those affected by apartheid being given  the  best,
something which they themselves enjoyed for so long. They would rather  have
an approach  using  poorly  planned  and  implemented  policies,  delivering
inferior services. They broadcast  this  message  as  though  they  are  the
masters and the poor are the servants who  will  simply  listen  and  accept
what they say, despite the fact that what they  say  contains  no  truth  at
all.

In the coming 2004 elections, as in  previous  elections,  the  majority  of
people will continue to reject  their  devious  and  malicious  attempts  to
reassert their past role  of  master  over  servant  with  the  contempt  it
deserves.

During the past 10 years the living conditions  of  over  6  million  people
have been improved through the housing  delivery  programme.  We  have  also
seen people gaining access to housing  through  rental  and  social  housing
programmes. Specifically designed housing units  and  housing  subsidies  to
meet the requirements of people with disabilities have been introduced.  The
hostel  redevelopment  programme  focuses  on  the   upgrading   of   hostel
facilities and infrastructure, and the conversion of  dormitory  rooms  into
family units.

The housing delivery programme has helped  to  facilitate  the  delivery  of
basic services such  as  water  and  sanitation,  as  well  as  electricity,
together  with  infrastructure  such  as  schools,  clinics  and  roads,  to
communities which did not previously have  access  to  these.  Through  this
programme we have witnessed the joy of  millions  of  people  who,  for  the
first time in their lives, now own property.

We have also witnessed the joy of both young and old moving from homes  made
of plastic, iron  and  cardboard  into  homes  made  of  brick  and  mortar,
providing warmth from the cold, shelter from the  rain,  and  coolness  from
the heat. A resident in Sikhane had the following to say:


  I have a sense of pride here.  Living  in  this  house  has  made  a  big
  difference in my life.

Another resident in Galeshewe said this:


  This is the first time I have ever owned a house. Nobody can take it away
  from me.

Not only is it a house, but it is also an asset which can  be  improved  and
used as a guarantee to secure financial loans.  Many  of  these  homes  have
provided beneficiaries with the facilities to start home-based businesses.

The 99-year-lease programme which effectively ensured for so long  that  our
people were deprived of ownership and  title  deeds,  was  sent  to  eternal
banishment.

Women who have been  the  most  marginalised  of  society,  have  played  an
important role in the housing delivery programme.  Not  only  are  they  the
main  beneficiaries  of  housing   subsidies,   but   they   have   actively
participated  in  the  construction  of  houses,  particularly  through  the
people's housing process.

Women have also taken the lead  in  mobilising  savings  groups,  generating
much-needed finance for housing. These are women who come from urban  areas,
rural areas and informal settlements, and are often from the poorest of  the
poor. They have displayed unwavering commitment and  dedication  to  playing
their part in working with Government to rebuild this country.

The housing delivery programme has restored human  dignity  to  millions  of
people. No longer do families have to sleep in one room. Many  beneficiaries
choose to have internal walls built,  so  that  parents  and  children  have
separate rooms.

Programmes aimed at upgrading informal settlements,  providing  piped  water
and waterborne sanitation, together with the provision  of  electricity,  is
taking place throughout the country. The Urban  Renewal  Programme  and  the
Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme  form  part  of   the
strategy  of  the  ANC-led  Government  in  rebuilding  our  country.  These
programmes are aimed at reconstructing and  developing  specific  urban  and
rural nodes, improving living conditions, and providing infrastructure  that
had not previously been provided to these affected communities.

The development of the rural nodes will play a significant role in  enabling
community members to continue living where they live, whilst providing  them
with sustainable employment opportunities. This will impact  on  the  number
of people migrating to urban areas in search of employment, and  could  also
see people moving back to rural areas as more employment  opportunities  are
created.

The face of formerly white suburbs  has  changed  significantly,  with  many
providing a picture of racial  integration,  providing  an  opportunity  for
barriers to be broken down and for new friendships to  be  made.  There  has
been no decline in property prices or the deterioration of suburbs, as  some
prophets of doom predicted in 1994.

I am able to speak with confidence of  the  significant  progress  that  has
taken place in meeting the housing needs of the peoples of this country,  as
I, too, have personally witnessed this in all nine provinces, in both  urban
and rural areas. The words of the Freedom Charter that say ``all the  people
shall have the right to live where  they  choose,  be  decently  housed  and
bring up their families in comfort and security'' are no longer words.  They
have become a reality for millions of our people.

Whilst significant progress has been made in this  past  decade,  more  work
must take place to ensure that the peoples of this country  have  access  to
adequate shelter, as enshrined in our  Constitution.  There  are  challenges
that lie ahead; they are not insurmountable.
Government has taken measures to ensure  that  the  housing  products  being
provided are of sound quality.  These  include  the  role  of  the  National
Homebuilders Registration Council which  conducts  on-site  inspections.  Of
concern, however, are the actions of some developers who seem to think  that
the housing programme is a way of making money at the expense of  those  who
are most in need. They maximise their profits by  building  inferior-quality
homes, leaving Government with the task of having to  repair,  and  in  some
cases rebuild, poorly  built  homes.  A  commitment  is  required  from  the
construction industry to build homes that they themselves would be proud  to
live in.

There are many potential home owners  who  fall  just  outside  the  subsidy
band, and who are unable to access finance because they are presumed  to  be
a financial risk. The practice of redlining has led to many who  can  afford
to repay home  loans  being  denied  access.  We  call  on  these  financial
institutions to work with Government in rebuilding the country. Through  the
provision of affordable finance many people will  be  able  to  purchase  or
build a home of their choice.

The location of housing developments needs to be  closer  to  city  centres.
The notion that  property  prices  fall  if  there  is  a  low-cost  housing
development in areas close to  existing  suburbs  often  results  in  houses
having to be built far away from places of employment.

High land costs also contribute to this practice. We  need  to  ensure  that
the integration of society continues to take  place,  and  we  cannot  allow
communities such  as  those  in  Zevenfontein,  next  to  Dainfern,  and  in
Lanseria in Gauteng continuously to be  denied  access  to  housing,  simply
because landowners object. If we  are  building  a  country  for  all  South
Africans, surely we cannot  continue  along  the  lines  of  demanding  that
Government provide houses to those regarded as poor, but at  the  same  time
insist that they be built far away from leafy suburbs.

As we continue along the path of reconstruction and  development,  a  united
effort is required from all South  Africans.  In  particular,  we  need  the
building industry and financial institutions to join hands  with  Government
and play an active role in helping to reduce the levels of poverty in  which
many of our people still live. Through a  united  effort,  housing  delivery
can be speeded up and much-needed employment opportunities  can  be  created
on the construction sites.

The time for being spectators on the grandstand is  over.  We  all  need  to
become players. We need to work together and win  together.  An  article  in
yesterday's City Press, titled ``When home turns out to be  the  best  place
after all'' said the following, and I quote:


  With little fanfare but lots  of  enthusiasm  white  South  Africans  are
  returning to a country that works and a homeland they miss.

The article goes on to talk  about  the  work  of  Angel  Jones  and  Marina
Smithers, and their role in  the  creation  of  the  homecoming  revolution,
which is calling on South Africans to come  home  and  play  their  part  in
creating employment, reducing  poverty  and  helping  to  create  a  winning
nation. Angel Jones and Marina Smithers are true patriots; they  believe  in
South Africa and are proud to live here. They are examples we  all  need  to
follow, including some members on this side of the House.

In a few weeks from now, on 14 April, the electorate will  have  to  make  a
choice - a choice that says ``I want to be a team player'' or a choice  that
says ``I want to be a spectator''; a choice that says ``I am  tired  of  the
negative campaign waged by certain political  leaders''  or  a  choice  that
says ``I do not want to  be  part  of  the  process  of  reconstruction  and
development''; a choice to work with the  ANC  and  Government  in  creating
work and fighting poverty, or a choice to ensure that South Africa does  not
succeed.

I made my choice a long time ago. It was a choice  to  become  part  of  the
majority, to become a team player, to work and win together ...  [Applause.]
... to contribute in my small way to help improve the  lives  of  those  who
were denied the same opportunity that I had when I was born, to be proud  of
and defend my country, and to be proud of my President. The ANC is the  only
party that has delivered on its promises over the past decade.  When  others
in this House have  had  the  opportunity  at  different  times,  they  have
failed.

A vote for the ANC will ensure that tomorrow South Africa becomes  a  better
country than the  one  that  we  have  today,  and  the  reconstruction  and
development of a country for you, your family and generations to come  which
we will be proud of. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President and  Deputy  President,
hon members and our hon Deputy Minister  of  Home  Affairs,  Madam  Nosiviwe
`fight back' Nqakula: I recognise you.

The Government's ten-year review identified socioeconomic  challenges  that,
if not addressed, could result in  liberation  gains  being  overturned.  We
celebrate ten years of freedom this  year.  We  understand  freedom  as  the
ability  of  individuals  and  groups  to  make  choices  and  pursue  their
aspirations freely. This includes choices such as where to live,  what  work
to choose and where to engage in it, where and  what  to  learn,  where  and
what business to pursue and many others.

In the same vein, we should congratulate  the  ANC-led  Government  for  the
progress made  in  various  fields  thus  far.  However,  political  freedom
without economic and social freedom is not  real  freedom,  and  whilst  the
President dwelt much on the successes of  the  past  ten  years  during  his
state of the nation address, I submit  that  he  neglected  to  address  the
major social and economic challenges that face us as a nation.

Yes, our political freedom was indeed a miracle. however, in ten  years,  we
cannot honestly say  that  this  political  freedom  has  materialised  into
social and economic freedom. The truth is that ten  years  of  unemployment,
crime, hunger and poverty undermine the people's freedom.
Madam Deputy Speaker, when more than 20 000 people are murdered every  year,
that is not real freedom; when more than a million  jobs  are  destroyed  in
ten years and nearly half of the adult population are  unemployed,  that  is
not  real  freedom;  when  hundreds  of  thousands  of  school-leavers   and
graduates join the job  market  every  year  with  little  hope  of  finding
employment, that is not  real  freedom;  when  millions  are  infected  with
HIV/Aids and Government drags it feet  with  treatment,  that  is  not  real
freedom; and when the institutions of education which are supposed  to  help
disadvantaged communities are closed down, and no replacements are  offered,
that is not real freedom.

On Friday President Mbeki said:


  We do not foresee that there will be any need for new  and  major  policy
  initiatives. [Interjections.]

If that is what you want to call it, he gave his  assurance  that  the  next
term of ANC Government would be characterised by no changes in policies.  In
essense, he has promised the South African public more of the same. We  must
ask: more of the same unemployment, more of the  same  crime,  more  of  the
same corruption at the highest levels, more of the same failure  to  address
HIV/Aids and more of the same procurement  of  weapons  of  war  instead  of
investing in social security? And now ...

... sithetha ngabantu abanyotyiweyo, kanti bekuthiwe le  mali  iza  kuthenga
izixhobo zokulwa. [... we are talking about people  who  have  been  bribed,
whereas it was said this money would be used for buying arms.]

Fundamentally, South Africa stands at a crossroads.  We  need  to  recognise
the immensity of these challenges. We need to admit  that  these  challenges
require new policies, concerted  action  and,  above  all  else,  much  more
Government intervention. Anything less is wishful  thinking.  `More  of  the
same' will not provide solutions. `More of the same' is a direct  threat  to
our freedom and development. We need to move away  from  this  confusion  of
tripartite governance ever since the introduction of  Gear.  Remember,  this
is the tripartite alliance which, on the streets preaches  more  employment,
but  legislates  greater  unemployment  in  the  boardrooms  and   committee
chambers.

Madam Deputy Speaker, the President also said the following:


  We have already identified the challenges posed by  the  second  economy,
  which  economy  constitutes  the  structural  manifestation  of  poverty,
  underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country.

Yes, the harsh reality is that eight million people are jobless.  When  Gear
was introduced, the ANC was warned about the  inevitable  outcome.  Instead,
we were promised hundreds of thousands of jobs in  the  first  economy.  The
Gear policy was responsible for removing trade protection and the  promotion
of South African industries  as  a  way  of  playing  to  the  international
gallery. For instance, in the textile and agricultural  industry,  jobs  and
enterprises were destroyed at a frightening rate. These  masses  which  lost
their jobs and were relegated to the  so-called  second  economy  are  there
exactly because of the ANC's economic policy.

On the other  hand,  the  architects  of  globalisation  are  still  pumping
trillions of rands into their economies as a  way  to  protect  and  promote
their  domestic  jobs  and  businesses.  Madam   Deputy   Speaker,   it   is
disingenuous to speak  of  the  second  economy  as  something  that  simply
exists, when the truth is that the ANC has actively  pursued  policies  that
continuously expand this sector of our society. For the President  to  speak
of   poverty,   underdevelopment   and   marginalisation    as    structural
manifestations, is supremely ironic. Is it not the ANC which has  pursued  a
self-imposed structural adjustment programme? Is it not this  headlong  rush
to satisfy the structures of neo-liberal economics that has  brought  us  to
this impasse?

Finally, the President naturally needs to  make  policy  proposals  that  we
concure with, but at the very least, we would have expected  some  proposals
instead of more of the  same  approach.  The  challenges  we  face  in  this
country  are  challenges  that  undermine  our  freedom.  To  address  these
challenges, we require more political will.

closed the  education  institutions.  That's  a  reality.  They  are  there.
Colleges of education have been closed throughout the country. What  do  you
mean in saying `they are not closed'? Do you know what it is  that  you  are
talking about? [Applause.]]

Ms V  MERUTI:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President  and  Deputy  President,  hon
members, comrades, ladies and gentlemen ...

... ek wil graag ons agb President se woorde van  verlede  week  beklemtoon.
Ons is besig om die toestande van  die  verlede  te  verander,  en  ons  sal
aanhou om saam met die mense van ons land te sorg dat Suid-Afrika  'n  goeie
en veilige land vir al haar kinders is.

Daar is baie dinge wat 'n mens  kan  sê  oor  die  afgelope  10  jaar,  maar
niemand kan sê dat mense nie beter daaraan toe is as ooit  tevore  nie.  Dit
is ook baie belangrik dat ons kinders die geskiedenis van ons land  ken,  en
ek hoop die Minister van Onderwys luister.

In die dae toe pensioen volgens ras ingedeel was, moes 'n mens omtrent  drie
maande gewag het vir jou pensioen as jy 'n dompas gehad het; terwyl  blankes
dit onmiddellik en maandeliks ontvang het.  Die  naturelle  of  nie-blankes,
soos ons toe genoem is, het ook baie minder geld as  blankes  gekry.  Vandag
kry  ons  almal  dieselfde  bedrag,  en  ons  kry  almal  dieselfde   diens.
[Applous.] Meer van ons mense het huise,  hulle  het  makliker  toegang  tot
opvoeding, beter mediese sorg en ons welsynstelsel is van die beste  in  die
wêreld. [Applous.]

Ek sal binnekort uitbrei oor hoe goed ons welsynstelsel is, maar ek wil  net
gou iets aanspreek. Ons mense weet dat hierdie Regering vir hulle omgee,  en
dat hulle veel eerder in vandag se omstandighede wil lewe  as  om  terug  te
gaan na 'n tyd toe die meeste van  ons  mense  in  onmenslike  omstandighede
gebly het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to emphasise our hon President's words of last  week.  We  are
busy changing the conditions of the past and will continue, with the  people
of our country, to make sure that South Africa is a safe  and  good  country
for all its children.

There are many things one could say about the past 10 years, but no one  can
say that people are not  better  off  now  than  ever  before.  It  is  also
important that our children know the history of our country and I hope  that
the Minister of Education is listening.

In the days when pension was allotted according to race,  you  had  to  wait
for about three months for your pension if you  had  a  dompas;  whilst  the
whites received  it  immediately  and  monthly.  The  ``Bantu'',  or  ``non-
whites'', as we were called then, also received a lot less than the  whites.
Today, we all are getting the same amount, and we are all getting  the  same
service. [Applause.] More of  our  people  have  houses,  they  have  easier
access to education, improved medical care and our welfare system is of  the
best in the world. [Applause.]

I shall shortly elaborate on how good our welfare  system  is,  but  I  just
want to address something quickly. Our  people  know  that  this  Government
cares  about  them  and  that  they  would  much  rather  live  in   today's
circumstances than go back to a time  when  most  of  our  people  lived  in
inhumane conditions.]

[Grandfathers once went to war accompanying the  whites.  After  some  years
the heroes went back home. The women were cheering them when  they  arrived.
Some fainted when they received a report about the men  who  had  died.  The
women consoled themselves with the thought that the compensation they  would
get would take them out of the many years of hunger. My goodness! They  were
very disappointed when the  men  were  given  bicycles  and  jackets  called
solalaphi. [Applause.]

The  whites  received  houses,  significant  amounts  of  money,  a  monthly
pension,  and  their  children  were  sent  to  school.  We  thank  the  ANC
Government for taking us out of slavery. Today we have  a  Constitution.  We
know our rights and responsibilities. All of us are equal.]

Our ten-year democracy has been marked by undeniable achievements in  fields
such as social delivery. I want to repeat and reinforce what has  been  said
by our hon President. This is a good time to  be  living  in  South  Africa.
[Applause.]

Yes, we have problems. However, we  also  have  major  achievements.  It  is
about time that we proclaim our achievements for  all  to  see.  Our  social
welfare system has  been  hailed  as  one  of  the  most  effective  amongst
developing countries anywhere in the world.

With regards to social grants, they  are  diverse  and  structured  to  meet
people's  needs.  There  are  at  least  seven  types  of  grants  currently
administered by the Department of Social Development and these are  targeted
at pensioners, poor families with children, war veterans ...

... bona ba ba amogetseng dijase le dibaesekele  ...  [those  that  received
jackets and bicycles ...]

... foster care and grants-in-aid for families taking care of  children  and
people in need. The expenditure on social grants has increased by 3,5  times
between 1994 and 2003. The number of beneficiaries has almost  tripled  over
the past ten years and this figure is likely to increase.

One of the most  important  improvements  in  grant  payments  has  been  in
replacing the  racially  scaled  child  maintenance  grant  with  the  child
support grant.  The  number  of  children  in  receipt  of  this  grant  has
increased by 62,25% in the period April 2002 to April 2003. There  has  been
an extension of this grant to include children up to 14 years.

All the extensions  are  aimed  at  providing  the  grant  to  an  estimated
additional  3,2  million  children.  This  is  vastly  different  from   the
situation which  prevailed  under  the  previous  regime,  and  our  ANC-led
Government is committed to seeing that the very good policies  we  have  put
in place in this regard will be executed without too many problems.

One of the most important  challenges  in  this  area  is  actually  service
delivery. It is an unfortunate fact that we are  not  reaching  all  of  the
poor  and  vulnerable.  There  have  been  problems  with  private   service
providers and we have dealt with them decisively.

There are problems in the  relationship  between  the  Departments  of  Home
Affairs and Social Development, and an extensive effort needs to be made  to
sort this out. People cannot access their grants if they  do  not  have  the
necessary identification  papers.  Some  tribal  authorities  expect  social
grant applicants to pay a levy,  "jojo"  [bribe],  in  order  to  facilitate
processing of their applications. This is corruption, and I  appeal  to  all
those who have paid such levies  to  lay  a  charge  against  these  corrupt
authorities.

We are of the opinion that the  proposed  national  social  security  agency
will provide the eventual solution to many of the existing problems  in  our
grants payment system, but until this agency is fully  functional,  we  will
continue to address human resource and other problems  which  prevent  grant
beneficiaries from accessing their grants.

As part of the objective to provide employment and to move people away  from
dependence on mere social grants, the Public Works Programme has employed  a
total of 124 808 people since 1998. However, most of the jobs  created  were
temporary. Whilst Public Works Programmes increase the provision  of  assets
to the community, they are not as efficient as income grants in  alleviating
poverty. However, these Public Works  Programmes  also  serve  to  create  a
skills base which participants may be able to  rely  on  to  create  further
income.

Several social changes still remain in our country, as  the  President  said
in his state of the nation address, and our Government has  identified  that
several things have to be done in order to further improve the lives of  our
people. The aim is to create  a  massive  Public  Works  Programme,  and  to
improve access to social security measures with better vehicles  to  improve
social delivery, while reducing the number of citizens dependent on grants.

We must also continue to promote national identity and pride, ensuring  that
households develop civic responsibility, including a culture of  paying  for
service beyond the free  basic  provision,  and  taking  responsibility  for
protecting the infrastructure in their communities.

As stated by the President on several occasions, voting in the elections  is
a fundamental and hard-won right, and  citizens  have  a  responsibility  to
exercise it and keep our democracy strong.

The Department of Home Affairs has  waived  the  cost  for  photographs  and
reissues  until  the  closure  of  voter  registration  to  facilitate  easy
accessibility of IDs. The IEC reports that  the  current  voters'  roll  has
increased to more than 20 million and  that  young  people  -  I  say  young
people - between the ages of 18 and 25  accounted  for  almost  60%  of  the
newly registered. [Applause.]

I would like to say that this figure, despite the opposition's  rhetoric  to
the contrary, indicates that our people are not apathetic about  the  coming
elections, nor are they despondent about conditions in our country.  On  the
contrary,  we  are  hopeful  and  committed  to  achieving   the   task   of
reconstruction and  development.  It  is  only  by  working  together  in  a
people's contract that we can really fulfil the  amazing  potential  of  our
beautiful country.

In conclusion, the journey we started  in  1994  was  always  aimed  at  the
realisation of this goal. We have a caring Government led by the ANC,  which
is fully conscious of the fact that we have entered  into  a  contract  with
the people, to work in partnership with all South Africans, and to  build  a
winning and successful nation. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P H  K  DITSHETELO:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President,  Deputy  President,
Ministers present, as  we  are  about  to  celebrate  the  first  decade  of
democracy in our country, we are challenged to remember where we  come  from
as a nation and the reasons why we  were  first  elected  to  serve  in  the
democratic Parliament.

It is within this context that we reply to the President's  address  on  his
Government's achievements  for  the  past  decade.  Yes,  he  has  correctly
captured the many challenges that our country  faces  and  our  Government's
achievements thus far. However, we think that it is not enough.  We  believe
that the Government can do better than listing its short-term  achievements.
Our people are still suffering.

The challenges he identified are capable of being addressed,  especially  if
the Government can give itself time to listen to the people on  the  ground,
and not only when it is election time. Our people need constant  interaction
with the Government. This has  to  happen  in  addition  to  that  they  are
remembered when their votes  matter  most.  Imbizos  are  events;  what  the
people need is a programme.

Mr President, we have to advise that our rigid economic  policies,  obsessed
with fiscal discipline regardless  of  its  social  impact,  will  cost  the
country dearly. We are asking: Why stick to economic policies  that  do  not
deliver to our people?

In his statement, the President said:


  We must ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities  to
  our  people  as  a  critical  player  in  the  process  of  the   growth,
  reconstruction and development of our country.

He further  said  that  we  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  traditional
government  plays  the  role  ascribed  to  it  by  our   Constitution   and
legislation.

We all know for a fact that the President's statement in  this  regard  does
not capture the reality in terms of how his Government regards the  role  of
traditional leaders within  our  democratic  institutions.  [Interjections.]
The traditional leadership has been relegated to mere spectators  in  making
a meaningful contribution to our democratic society. Their powers have  been
diminished in favour of local authorities.

It is indeed sad that the President mentioned the importance of the  African
Renaissance, but said little about the traditional institutions that  define
precisely what it means to be an African. He  has  also  not  mentioned  any
serious plan of action concerning HIV/Aids. What our people need  is  action
and more action by providing them with access to  medicine.  The  Government
should implement, and not plan anymore, as our people are dying  like  flies
when we know that there are medicines that can help improve their health.

We are saying to the President that he must walk his talk before it  is  too
late. Mr President, we were indeed elected by our people to serve  them  and
not to determine what is good for them without their voices being heard.
Tautona, ke eletsa go feleletsa ka go re,  rona  ra  re  kgetsi  ya  tsie  e

President, I wish to conclude by saying, we say that a  job  becomes  easier
when many people give their assistance. Co-operation can help us in  solving
our problems in South Africa.  By  co-operating  with  traditional  leaders,
they can help you, Mr President. [Time expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, Mr President, it is unfortunate that in  this
Parliament we have a short speaking time and we cannot always  pay  all  the
courtesies, including to the Deputy President.

I want to begin my response to the President's state of the  nation  address
by thanking him for his honesty in telling the nation that, if elected,  his
Government would continue the  flawed  market-led  policies,  such  as  that
Gear, that have led to South Africa being listed as the second most  unequal
society in the world, a  country  ranked  amongst  those  with  the  highest
unemployment rates, a country where the people of this nation have  to  wait
another ten years for 30% of their right to land to be given back to them.

Ten years  after  the  first  election,  the  African  people  retain  their
relatively powerless position, not only because  they  are  dispossessed  of
monetary and human resources, but also because they have a Government  which
ignores the fundamental objectives of our liberation struggle.

The PAC, as the champion of the politics of  this  country,  recognizes  ...
[Interjections] ... that this nation requires free education. Education  has
one honourable purpose: the purpose of proper education is  to  prepare  the
student to be a responsible handler of power.  It  must  ultimately  improve
one's understanding of what power is and how one has to have power in  order
to be a total human being.

Free education must be the cornerstone  of  this  nation,  from  primary  to
tertiary, for the next 30  years,  if  we  are  to  build  the  capacity  of
Africans to participate effectively  in  industrialising  this  country  and
transforming our rural  areas  from  graveyards  into  flourishing  centres.
Education is a right. It is not a commodity that  can  be  bought  or  sold.
Free education must be implemented to create a knowledge  society.  We  need
an education for a new reality in our country.

Land claims from 1913 have legalised land  dispossession  of  the  majority.
Across this country the  land  and  resource  rights  of  the  Africans  are
threatened by  inappropriate  policies  and  institutions,  unequal  social,
political and  economic  relations,  and  the  actions  of  powerful  vested
interests. Millions of our people live in  filthy  squatter  camps  and  are
built matchbox houses regardless of the size  of  families.  People  in  the
squatter camps not only lose their properties  but  also  their  lives  when
these ``mkhukhus'' [shacks] burn. There must be  equitable  distribution  of
land.

To take away land from a people is to take away a source of life from  them.
Section 25 of the Constitution must be repealed,  especially  subsection  7.
To legislate that the land dispossessed African  majority  of  this  country
claim land from  after  1913  is  to  legalise  and  legitimise  their  land
dispossession, landlessness  and  daily  evictions.  A  moratorium  on  land
evictions is fundamental.

Government  policies  on  reparations  are  sensitive.   The   PAC   demands
qualitative reparations for the victims of apartheid. An amount of  R30  000
offered to the victims of apartheid by the TRC and endorsed by the  policies
of the present Government is insensitive and humiliating in the extreme.

This amount is less than 2  500  British  pounds  and  less  than  US$5 000.
Compare this with reparations of $2,7 billion, about R10 billion, which  was
demanded of Libya for only 267 passengers who died  when  the  Pan  American
plane was bombed. Compare this also with DM132 billion paid  as  reparations
to the Jews. Africans must be treated equally with all the  nations  of  the
world. African are not sub-humans. [Interjections.]

The PAC thanks President Mbeki for his reference to the construction of  the
Freedom Park. However, the past ten years have shown  that  this  Government
has lost its historical memory. Freedom Park must be a symbol that  reclaims
our entire heritage in a truthful and accurate  manner  in  order  to  be  a
total and united heritage.

Freedom Park must reflect that the PAC was responsible for  the  Sharpeville
uprising which internationalised apartheid and forced the UN  to  be  seized
with this heinous crime against humanity for over 30 years. It was  the  PAC
which got apartheid South Africa expelled  from  the  UN  General  Assembly,
paving the way for the PAC and the ANC to take the  South  African  seat  as
liberation movements.

Freedom Park must recognise and reflect that the first  political  prisoners
to be imprisoned on Robben  Island  were  from  the  PAC.  Some,  like  G  T
Komsane, E P Mpondwana and Mahlubi Tolbart arrived on Robben  Island  on  12
October 1962. Robben Island was crowned with the imprisonment of  the  first
president of the PAC, Robert Mangaliso  Sobukwe,  without  trial  under  the
special law called the Sobukwe Clause. He left Robben Island poisoned.

The PAC warns those  who  are  intoxicated  with  the  exuberance  of  their
verbose sectarianism in the politics of this country  that  the  history  of
the PAC is written with blood. It will never be erased with lies written  in
ink. [Laughter.]

Let me pay tribute to all who have fallen for our freedom  by  invoking  the
spirit of ...

with. This is our land!]

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Madam  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President,  Deputy
President, hon members and Deputy Ministers present, members of  Parliament,
democratic South Africa was born  of  a  leadership  with  a  vision  for  a
people's struggle to lift themselves  out  of  the  guagmire  of  apartheid,
people pitted against one another  brought  into  the  unifying  streams  of
democracy and nation-building. These  unifying  streams  of  democracy  were
brought into being by the ANC-led Government and  its  tripartite  alliance.
This is where the leadership was born.

Here was born a South African idea of moulding people from diverse  origins,
cultural practices and languages into one, within a framework democratic  in
character  that  could  absorb,  accommodate  and  mediate   conflicts   and
adverserial interests without oppression and injustice.  Throughout  its  92
years of existence, the ANC has put the  interests  of  all  the  people  of
South Africa at the top of its agenda.

Having united the overwhelming majority of South Africans in  struggle,  the
possibility was created in 1994 for  us  to  work  together  practically  to
construct a society that cares.

In the area of education, progress has been made by the  ANC-led  Government
through its Department of Education, especially  in  the  implementation  of
our Tirisano mmogo  programme.  Through  our  collective  efforts  involving
teachers, students, parents,  the  business  community,  civil  society  and
nongovernmental organisations, we as the ANC-led Government managed to  push
back the frontiers of poverty and degradation in our schools.

Our people, even in most rural areas  of  our  country,  have  come  out  in
support  of  our  Tirisano  call.  Schools  in  these  areas  are  gradually
recording improvements in their performance. We had a huge improvement  last
year, 2003, in the matric results, both nationally and provincially.

A brief examination of progress in our nine Tirisano priorities will  reveal
the hearty success we are recording. Curriculum 2005  was  first  introduced
to schools in 1998, with a phased introduction, intended to  result  in  the
first matric class by 2005. However, in 1999 it was  apparent  that  various
problems existed which were limiting the  effective  implementation  of  the
curriculum. Minister Asmal therefore  appointed  a  review  committee  which
made  three  findings,  that  is,  that  the  principle  of   outcomes-based
education was valid, that the design feature of  the  curriculum,  including
much of the terminology, was overcomplex and hard to  understand,  and  that
the preparation  of  teachers  and  materials  for  the  approach  had  been
inadequate.

A Minister-appointed committee then redrafted the curriculum statements  for
foundation classes, that is, Grade Reception to Grade  9,  in  a  way  which
simplified much of the language  and  provided  more  guidance  to  teachers
regarding the expectations. The revised curriculum takes as its  foundation,
and provides extensive support for, the core  values  of  the  Constitution,
including equity, social justice, a healthy environment and the  dignity  of
every individual.

The revised curriculum received overwhelming support  from  the  public  and
the  education  community.  The  curriculum  statements  were   subsequently
translated into all official languages, as well as into  Braille  for  blind
teachers, and a full set, together with a teacher's guide, was delivered  to
every single teacher in the country at a cost of R60 million. The  teacher's
guide spells out how the outcomes can be achieved in the  different  schools
and classroom contexts. It is too early to assess the benefits of  outcomes-
based education comprehensively.

The revised outcomes-based curriculum for Grades 10 to 12 has only  recently
been improved and will be implemented in 2006,  with  the  first  cohort  to
finish school under the new system completing in 2008.

The  new  approach  has  been  widely  welcomed  by  the  teachers'  unions,
academics and parents, and we are  confident  that  the  children  who  have
completed their education under  outcomes-based  education  will  be  better
equipped and be more productive citizens,  able  to  work  collectively  and
equipped with thinking skills rather than the ability to memorise facts.

Our Government is seriously engaged in the anti-poverty drive, and  this  is
an ongoing process. In December 2002 the Department of  Education  published
the results of a comprehensive study  into  the  financing,  resourcing  and
cost of education. A number of factors were identified which impact  on  the
cost of education, the main drivers being school fees, the cost of  uniforms
and transport costs. Each of these areas have  been  developed  to  minimise
the cost of education for the poor.

With regard to school fees, it is  hoped  that  we  will  soon  be  able  to
announce the scrapping of fees in at least the poorest 40% of schools,  were
the amounts are very small, that is, often less than R100 per year  in  some
60% of schools. However, the impact is enormous in terms  of  exclusion  and
loss of dignity. It is the wish of the Government  to  commit  itself  to  a
minimum resource package, so that these schools have no  need  to  levy  any
fees at all.

The challenge of long distances travelled by our  learners  to  schools,  in
particular those who live in rural areas, was noted in the 2003 report  that
looked at the financing, resource and cost of education in  public  schools.
Research work will be conducted in the first part of the new financial  year
to look at the provision of education in rural communities, and chief  among
these areas is transport and hostel provisioning for learners in  rural  and
farm areas.

Two years ago the President made a  statement  that  no  learner  should  be
learning under trees. In 2002-03 the Department of Education, together  with
provincial departments of education, embarked on a drive  to  eradicate  all
instances of learners  learning  under  trees.  Each  provincial  department
developed a strategy for addressing the problem  of  learners  under  trees.
Information  received  indicates  that  we  have  broken  the  back  of  the
phenomenon of learners under trees.

(Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[Countrymen, not long ago I heard the hon Tony Leon saying  that  there  are
children who still sit on stones under some trees. I want to  dispute  that.
Maybe he is thinking of what used to happen during the apartheid era,  under
his apartheid government.]

Ons kan dit nie daar laat nie, meneer. Ons kan nie. Kyk, ons het die  mense.
Daar vóór loop ons en daar vóór brand die lig. Ons lei  die  lig;  ons  loop
voor die mense. Ons kan dit nie daar laat nie. [We cannot  leave  it  there,
sir. We cannot. Look, we have the people. Up ahead we  are  walking  and  up
ahead the light is shining. We are leading the  light;  we  are  walking  in
front of the people. We cannot leave it there.]

I do not know. Maybe there is a certain hidden farm  school  on  your  farm,
hon Tony, of which we are not aware. Such practices are not tolerated.  Such
practices are taboos in  the  present  Government.  We  won't  tolerate  it,
Comrade Seremane.

Government has accepted that the  restructuring  and  consolidation  of  the
higher education system is essential if the system is to be transformed.  To
achieve   the   strategic   objectives   of   equalising   the   educational
opportunities and of producing the knowledge output required  for  national,
social and economic development, this restructuring and  consolidation  will
help to remove from the higher education  system  the  apartheid  legacy  of
fragmentation, inequity and inefficiency which have hampered its ability  to
participate fully in the national development strategies.

Four major mergers have taken place in January 2004  at  the  University  of
KwaZulu-Natal,  North  West  University,  University  of  South  Africa  and
Tshwane University of Technology. All the constituency  campuses,  that  is,
eight of them, have been incorporated into  each  receiving  institution  in
January 2004. The Rhodes-East London campus has been incorporated  into  the
University of Fort Hare and the Dean  Street  Faculty  of  Stellenbosch  has
been incorporated into the University of the Western Cape.

In the case of teaching  itself,  progress  towards  teaching  equality  has
received much attention and upgrading of teachers  has  continued,  with  an
annual increase of just over 2% in the proportion of qualified  teachers  in
South Africa since 1994.

It  must  also  be  noted  that  teacher  discipline  continues  to  receive
attention within the education community, particularly  within  the  teacher
unions and  associations.  Cases  against  teachers  are  monitored  by  the
Department of Education ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, hon President  and  Deputy  President,  I
would like to refer to something that the hon Boy Geldenhuys said  in  terms
of monkey business. If there's an example of real monkey business, it's  New
NP members during cross-over sessions and getting new positions. It's  quite
remarkable! [Interjections.] Could I also just remind Boy Geldenhuys of ...

... 'n plakkaat wat julle nie so lank gelede nie opgehad het van  ``Hou  die
ANC uit!'' en nou is daar 'n nuwe plakkaat op: ``Gee jou stem vir ons  sodat
ons die ANC in die Wes-Kaap in beheer kan hou!'' (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[... a poster that you had up not  so  long  ago,  stating  ``Keep  the  ANC
out!'' and now there is a new poster: ``Give us your vote  so  that  we  can
keep the ANC in the Western Cape under control!'']

And   you   speak   of   monkey   business!   That's   quite    interesting.
[Interjections.]

In his State of the Nation Address, the hon President said that  all  policy
matters in the Government of South Africa are in place. I would like to  get
some clarity on this matter and the role  that  participatory,  co-operative
government plays in this regard.

Die Nuwe NP gee hoog op dat samewerking met die ANC aan  hulle  inspraak  in
die hoofstroom van die politiek gee. kan die  agb  President  dalk  vir  ons
klarigheid gee oor wat dit in die praktyk beteken? Beteken dit dat die  Nuwe
NP inspraak oor ANC-beleid het en dat hulle dit kan  verander  en  in  enige
rigting stuur, of beteken dit dat die ANC die beleid formuleer en  die  Nuwe
NP dan die ANC-regering help om die beleid te implementeer, die  skurwer  en
skerper kante reg te poets, die dotjies mooi  op  die  i's  te  sit  en  die
strepies  deur  die  t's  te  trek.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[The New NP maintains that co-operation with the ANC gives  them  a  say  in
the main stream of politics. Could the hon President perhaps  give  us  some
clarity regarding what this means in practice? Does it mean that the New  NP
has a say in ANC policy and can change it and send it in any  direction,  or
does it mean that the ANC formulates the policy and that  the  New  NP  then
helps the ANC Government to implement the policy, to polish  the  rough  and
sharp edges, to dot the ``i''s and cross the ``t''s?]

I have a further question for the hon President.  Where does this  so-called
``inspraak'' take place? The site where the policy of the ANC  is  finalised
are the President's Office, the  Cabinet,  the  ANC  Congress  and  the  ANC
caucus. In the Cabinet the New Np has no  representative,  only  two  Deputy
Ministers who are present in Cabinet committees, and up to  date  they  have
had no impact on policy; they  could  not  even  prevent  the  doctors  from
marching!

In die ANC-kongres is die Nuwe NP waarnemers. [In the ANC congress  the  New
NP are observers.]

They're  not  delegates.  Therefore   the   President's   Office   and   the
parliamentary caucus are  the  only  two  sites  left  where  the  so-called
``inspraak'' could have an effect.

The question  therefore  remains:  Can  the  New  NP  really  influence  the
direction of ANC policy and put it on a new course, or  is  the  opportunity
for ``inspraak'' only available to enhance the practical application of  ANC
policy? Hon President, is there perhaps an example  where  the  New  NP  has
changed the ANC policy drastically and steered it  in  a  new  direction  or
even influenced the ANC principle? [Interjections.]

Ek sien swarigheid vir die Nuwe NP. My ondervinding  van  hoofstroompolitiek
as lid van die Regering van Nasionale Eenheid van 1994 tot  1996  soos  deur
die ANC uit 'n magsposisie bedryf, is nie baie gunstig nie.  In  die  eerste
RNE het die destydse NP in eie reg gesit volgens die oorgangsgrondwet.  Daar
was een Minister vir elke 5% stemme en en Adjnkpresident vir die  20%  steun
wat die NP gehad het. Daar het ek dit ervaar dat die NP in  'n  gemoedelike,
soms selfs akkommoderende atmosfeer, kon saampraat en insette lewer oor ANC-
beleid, maar aan die rigting en  die  aard  kon  hy  weinig,  indien  enige,
verskil maak. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[I foresee difficulties for  the  New  NP.  My  experience  of  main  stream
politics as a member of the Government of National Unity from 1994  to  1996
as run by the ANC from a position of power is not very  favourable.  In  the
first GNU, the former NP sat in their  own  right  in  accordance  with  the
transitional constitution. There was one Minister for every 5% of votes  and
one Deputy Minister for the 20% support enjoyed by the  NP.  There  I  found
that the NP could talk about and make  inputs  into  the  ANC  policy  in  a
congenial, and sometimes even accommodating atmosphere, but  that  it  could
make very little, if any, difference to its direction and nature.]

You will remember that. We were part of that Government.

Miskien het ons dit 'n  rukkie  vertraag,  maar  aan  die  beleid  het  niks
verander nie. Kritiek was daar wel en standpunte is sterk gestel,  maar  dit
het nie gehelp om die beleid te verander nie. Dit het per geleentheid  selfs
tot skerp botsings in die Kabinet gelei.  Sonder  om  kabinetsvertroulikheid
te verbreek, wil ek een voorbeeld aanhaal  wat  in  die  pers  verskyn  het.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Perhaps we delayed it for a while,  but  nothing  has  changed  as  far  as
policy is concerned. There was  criticism,  and  standpoints  were  strongly
put, but that did not help to change policy. On  occasion  it  even  led  to
sharp   conflict   in   the   Cabinet.    Without    compromising    Cabinet
confidentiality, I want to quote one example which appeared in the press.]

You will remember that, Mr President.

By 'n geleentheid het president Mandela so kwaad geword vir  adjunkpresident
De Klerk oor  kritiek  en  beleid  dat  president  Mandela  in  'n  gespanne
atmosfeer gesê het: ``Get out of my Cabinet! I don't  want  you  here'',  en
bygevoeg het, ``If you leave, it won't even cause a ripple!''  Die  antwoord
... [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[On occasion President Mandela was so cross with Deputy President  De  Klerk
regarding criticism and  policy  that  Presient  Mandela  said  in  a  tense
atmosphere: ``Get out of my Cabinet! I don't want  you  here'',  and  added,
``If you leave, it won't cause a ripple!'' The reply ... [Interjections.]]

It's not! You can read the papers on that! [Interjections.]

Die antwoord van adjunkpresident  De  Klerk  in  die  gespanne  Kabinet  van
president Mandela was die  volgende  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [The  reply  of
Deputy President De Klerk in the tense Cabinet of President Mandela was  the
following ... [Interjections.]]

The answer of De Klerk was remarkable. He said:


  The transitional Constitution gives my party the right to four  Ministers
  in the Government of National Unity, and with 20% support I am in my  own
  right Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and a part of this
  Government. The decision to walk or stay is mine, not yours.

Nou is die vraag aan die Nuwe NP oor sy inspraak in die hoofstroom  van  die
ANC-regering: As die Nuwe NP-standpunt nie vir die ANC  aanvaarbaar  is  nie
en dit tot 'n  botsing  lei,  soos  wat  sal  gebeur  as  die  Nuwe  NP  nie
onderdanig is en net na die ANC se pype dans nie, en  die  ANC  sê  vir  die
Nuwe NP hy moet loop, wat gaan die Nuwe NP doen? [Tussenwerpsels.] Op  grond
waarvan gaan die Nuwe NP bly sit in  die  kring  van  die  magsbehepte  ANC?
[Tussenwerpsels.]

In die ou dae was daar 'n grammofoonmaatskappy met 'n hondjie as 'n  embleem
en die  slagspreuk,  ``His  Master's  Voice''.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Iets  van
hierdie  gebeure  laat  my  dink  aan  die  Nuwe  NP  in  hierdie   verband.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Kom ek illustreer  dit  verder.  Volgens  'n  koerantberig  in  Rapport  van
Sondag, 8 Februarie 2004, het die agb leier van die  Nuwe  NP,  premier  Van
Schalkwyk, gesê dat boere ophou moet skree  oor  grondhervorming  en  eerder
met die Regering moet saamwerk. In feitlik dieselfde asem verdedig die  Nuwe
NP egter ook die wetlike stap wat die ANC gedoen het om die wet te  verander
sodat die toekenning van grond uit die hande van die  regstelsel  geneem  en
met verdere onteineningstukragte in die hand van  die  ANC-minister  geplaas
word; iets soos wat in Zimbabwe gebeur. Hoe regverdig die Nuwe NP  dit?  Die
hele episode laat my aan 'n verdere spreekwoord dink,  naamlik  ``Hansie  my
kneg, jy moet doen wat ek seg, anders is jy weg''.

In die Wes-Kaap-regering word al hoe meer uitsprake gehoor oor, en sien  ons
al meer munisipaliteite wat bankrot raak onder ANC-bestuur. Het die Nuwe  NP
iets  reggekry  om  dit  te  verander?  Nee.  Hulle  moes  onderdanig  wees.
Verbasend genoeg sien ek dat oudpresident De Klerk die Nuwe Np aanmoedig  om
terug te keer, maar in sy eie woorde in gister se Rapport sê  hy:  ``Ek  was
maar 'n swak leier van  die  opposisie.  Dit  was  die  swakste  tyd  in  my
politieke loopbaan.'' [Tussenwerpsels.] En hy sê toe daar  as  hy  weer  die
besluit moet neem om te loop, sal hy loop. Nou wens hy die Nuwe NP terug  om
weer te loop! Dít is ``monkey business'' in die  ware  sin  van  die  woord.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Oral in die wêreld is sterk, onafhanklike opposisie  'n  noodsaaklikheid  om
die demokrasie  en  ekonomiese  orde  in  stand  te  hou.  Waar  geen  sterk
onafhanklike opposisie teenwoordig  is  nie,  vergaan  sulke  lande  gou  en
verval hulle uiteindelik in situasies soos  dié  van  Zimbabwe.  Suid-Afrika
verdien beter as dit. Daarom sal die DA voortgaan  om  die  vaandel  van  'n
duidelike, sinvolle alternatief teenoor die  magsbehepte  ANC  in  die  nuwe
Suid-Afrika te dra en voor die kiesers op die tafel te  plaas.  Ek  dank  u.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Now the question to the New NP regarding its say in the main stream of  the
ANC Government is: If the New NP's standpoint is not acceptable to  the  ANC
and it leads to conflict, such as will be the case if  the  New  NP  is  not
submissive and does not dance to the ANC's tune, and the  ANC  says  to  the
New NP that it must go, what is the New NP going to do? [Interjections.]  On
what basis is the New NP going to remain sitting in the circle  of  the  ANC
who is obsessed by power? [Interjectons.]

In the old days there was a grammophone company with  a  little  dog  as  an
emblem and the motto, ``His  Master's  Voice''.  [Interjections.]  Something
about what is happening here reminds me  of  the  New  NP  in  this  regard.
[Interjections.]

Let me illustrate it further. According to a newspaper  article  in  Rapport
of Sunday,  8  February  2004,  the  leader  of  the  New  NP,  Premier  Van
Schalkwyk, said that farmers must stop shouting about land reform  and  that
they must rather co-operate with the Government.  In  practically  the  same
breath, however, the New NP also defends the legal step taken by the ANC  to
change the Act so that the allocation of land is taken out of the  hands  of
the judiciary and is placed in the hands of the ANC  Minister  with  further
expropriation drives; similar to what is happening  in  Zimbabwe.  How  does
the New NP justify this? The whole episode reminds me of  a  further  adage,
namely ``Hansie my kneg, jy moet doen  wat  ek  seg,  anders  is  jy  weg''.
[Hansie my servant, you must do as I say, otherwise you will be fired.]

In the Western Cape government an increasing number of  findings  are  being
heard and we see an increasing number of municipalities who become  bankrupt
under ANC management. Has the New NP succeeded in changing  this?  No.  They
must be submissive. Surprisingly enough  I  see  that  former  President  De
Klerk is encouraging the  New  NP  to  return,  but  in  his  own  words  in
yesterday's Rapport he said: ``Ek was maar 'n swak leier van die  opposisie.
Dit was die swakste tyd in my  politieke  loopbaan''.  [Interjections.]  And
then he said there that if he were again to make  the  decision  to  go,  he
would go. Now he wants the New NP back just to go again!  That  is  ``monkey
business'' in the real sense of the word. [Interjections.]

Everywhere in the world strong,  independent  opposition  is  essential  for
maintaining democracy  and  economic  order.  Where  no  strong  independent
opposition is present, such countries soon pass  away  and  they  eventually
deteriorate into situations such as that of Zimbabwe. South Africa  deserves
something better. Therefore the DA will continue to carry the  banner  of  a
clear, significant alternative to the power-obsessed ANC in  the  New  South
Africa and to place it  on  the  table  before  the  voters.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before I call on the next speaker, I  would
like to give a ruling.

Earlier today I've undertaken to look at Hansard and rule on  the  point  of
order raised by the hon Mr Gibson regarding the comments made by the  Deputy
Minister of Home Affairs. The comments  refer,  and  I've  seen  a  copy  of
Hansard, to political parties and their leaders, and not to  any  particular
member. Now, in the past we have ruled that allegations of racism or  racist
behaviour  against  parties  are  not  unparliamentary,  but  would  not  be
acceptable if directed at a particular member.  Accordingly,  the  point  of
order was not well taken and is denied. [Applause.]

Mr D S MAIMANE: Madam Speaker, hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
members of Parliament,  allow  me  to  pay  tribute  to  comrades  who  were
murdered by the Bophuthatswana police in 1986.

These young people were expressing their discontent about  the  illegitimate
bantustan and the squalid conditions under which they lived in  Winterveldt.
Water supply, sanitation and electricity were something unheard of  in  that
community. Today, as I speak,  the  community  of  Winterveldt  is  a  proud
beneficiary of the Government's electrification, RDP housing,  water  supply
and sanitation programmes. [Applause.]

This is a monument that our Government has built for you. It is  a  monument
unequalled by any in the world. Surely your blood was not spilled  in  vain.
Sejo sennye ga se fete molomo. [Half a loaf is better than no bread.]

In 1994 South Africans, conscious of their  past  and  determined  to  bring
about change, chose a path. This path is  best  described  by  Robert  Frost
when he says, and I quote:


  I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and  ages  hence:  Two
  roads diverged in a wood and I took the one less travelled by,  and  that
  has made all the difference.

Surely there is a difference: a difference that I saw in  a  remote  village
known  as  Klipvoorstad  in  the  North  West  province.   The   people   of
Klipvoorstad depended on a river running through their village as  a  source
of water. In the midst of all the health risks, they  used  the  water  from
that river to cook, wash and drink. No government before 1994  ever  thought
of coming to their rescue.

It is the result of 1994 that brought relief to this community. A  completed
water project has been handed over to this community by  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry. To other people,  particularly  those  who  have
never experienced drawing water from a river or using a hand  pump,  such  a
development is meaningless, but to Mrs Maakwe and  her  family  this  is  an
indelible imprint.

As we  undo  the  impact  of  apartheid  rule,  there  will  be  challenges;
challenges which are best expressed in the words of our  President  when  he
addressed Parliament on 6 February 2004. He said, and I quote:


  There are still many of our people who live in shacks and others who have
  no access to clean water, proper sanitation and electricity.

As I speak on this podium, I am aware of development plans  that  are  being
drawn by municipalities throughout our nation to  determine  the  pace  with
which such  challenges  can  be  dealt  with.  Innovative  mechanisms  of  a
material nature are being looked into to provide capacity to  municipalities
so as to enable them to realise their developmental plans.

The introduction of free  basic  services  is  a  case  in  point.  The  six
kilolitres of water  provided  by  the  municipalities  free  of  charge  is
indicative of commitment to reverse the conditions under  which  our  people
had to live during  the  apartheid  days.  We  will  continue  to  introduce
changes in partnership with our people, so as to attain a  better  life  for
all.

It is against this background that our people will refuse to listen  to  our
oppressors who in their illusion do not see any development  or  change.  It
is us  who  bear  the  scars  of  poverty,  unemployment,  exploitation  and
oppression who can proudly speak about the fruits of liberty in the past  10
years.

The people who reside in a village called Mothlabe, east  of  Rustenburg  in
the North West province, who had no water supply  or  electricity  prior  to
1994, can bear testimony to the changes we brought about. Today as I  speak,
there is a completed water scheme managed by local people,  and  each  house
has been electrified. When community meetings are held,  discussions  centre
around mechanisms for ensuring sustainability of the water project.

It is only people from such communities who can proudly  say  that  the  ANC
Government has delivered since 1994. It is the people who are employed in  a
Working  for  Water  Project  and  have  acquired  skills  and   contractual
opportunities, who can testify that there are  changes.  Through  programmes
such as the Working for Water Project, Government  has  been  able  to  take
jobseekers out of the streets and into the workplace.

The management of Working for Water is looking into  partnerships  with  the
private sector to increase the project's capacity to meet the challenges  of
providing jobs. The community-based  Public  Works  programme  has  afforded
emerging contractors work opportunities through poverty-relief projects.  As
a result, short-term jobs have been created.

There are people who do not want us to recognise this reality. They want  us
to ignore the truth and talk about things that are not  there.  They  forget
that ours is a revolution informed by truth, commitment and honesty.  It  is
better explained in the words of a revolutionary of our epoch,  Comrade  Che
Guavara, when he says: ``Tell no lies and claim no easy victory.''

In the 10 years of our freedom we have also  dealt  a  blow  to  the  bucket
system which so much dehumanised our people. Plans have  been  developed  by
both the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, DWAF, and the  Department
of Provincial Affairs and Local Government to phase out  the  bucket  system
where it still exists.

It is important to mention that the sanitation programme, both  water  borne
and VIP, contributes in no small measure to job creation  opportunities.  In
the Free State DWAF has been able to  roll  out  sanitation  projects  in  a
manner that creates opportunities for SMME's and the  unemployed  people  of
our country, particularly in that area.

Anybody who attempts to distort the  reality  of  delivery  by  the  ANC-led
Government is not worthy of being called a  South  African.  It  is  against
this  background  that  I  say  the  performance  of   our   Government   is
meritorious. I would, therefore, like to make a call to all  South  Africans
to join us as we continue  with  the  contract  to  create  jobs  and  fight
poverty.

[I am saying that  no  government  has  ever  supported  us  like  this.  No
government has ever thought of us  like  the  present  Government.  We  were
regarded as herdsmen and looked down upon.  Those  who  were  despising  us,
mocking us, are now trying to lure us with their lies and hypocrisy. We  are
not going to agree with them.

We will keep on calling them upstarts, nobodies.

Hon MEMBERS: Yes!

Mr D S MAIMANE: Merciless and cruel people.  We  know  what  hunger  is  all
about. We know what the pain of oppression and joblessness is all about.  We
understand that the Government is working very hard to speed up changes.

The Motswana of yesteryear said that we only own  what  is  already  in  our
possession, as opposed to what we wish to have. As South  Africans  we  have
to learn much from the Motswana, by  not  wasting  and  destroying  what  we
have.

Forward with the ANC-led Government, forward!

Hon MEMBERS: Forward! [Applause.]]

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President  and  members.
We are on the eve  of  celebrating  our  first  ten  years  of  freedom  and
democracy, and we are told that there is much to celebrate.

On the one hand, it is widely contended that we have, in many  senses,  been
liberated; on the other hand, we are increasingly enslaved and held  hostage
to legitimate fears and misgivings. I would suggest that  for  the  minority
one-third of the population of the Republic who did not vote  for  the  ANC,
in essence many millions of South Africans, this equates to  enslavement  of
a large minority to a two-third majority of ANC supporters.

In all seriousness, a two-thirds majority  is  represented  in  this  House,
which leaves a one-third minority under  the  proverbial  jack-boot  of  the
majority without taking  into  account  the  untold  numbers  who  have  not
exercised their right to vote - those unregistered or without ID  books  and
so on.

Yes, we have come a  long  way  from  the  madness  of  apartheid,  and  our
esteemed President has ably outlined the key  achievements  of  the  ANC-led
Government, such as they are. However, the ANC has more than enough  praise-
singers in its ranks. Therefore, the IAM, without  apologising,  prefers  to
highlight  some  of  the  many  shortcomings   indicated   in   policy   and
implementation.

As my time is limited, these are just some comments on key  policies.  Where
credit is due for the  positive  developments  the  ANC-led  Government  has
spearheaded, I readily acknowledge such. However, it is  unfortunately  true
that the health Ministry has condemned millions of South Africans to a  slow
and painful death through HIV and Aids, and  even  though  a  policy  is  in
place, its effectiveness can be  likened  to  the  legendary  King  Canute's
futile  attempt  to  hold  back  the   overwhelming   tide   of   attendant,
opportunistic diseases such as TB and malaria, adding to the enslavement  of
millions to unnecessary ill-health and death.

To escape the dictates of such enslaving and unconstitutional policies  such
as the certificate of need in the Health Act, our highly  qualified  doctors
are fleeing the country in spite of  supposedly  successful  ANC-led  health
policy. Yet, our hon President stated  categorically  in  his  TV  interview
yesterday that the policy for all  Ministeries  is  in  place,  implying  no
possibility of amendment to said policies.

In response to the challenge made by the President in the same  interview  -
to name any country that could equal  or  better  this  Government's  policy
regarding the promised roll-out of antiretrovirals for HIV-Aids  -  I  would
counter that challenge by noting that  there  are  few,  if  any,  countries
facing the enormity of the Aids pandemic that we face.  Therefore,  we  damn
well should have not only the  best  programme,  but  it  should  have  been
implemented years ago.

The policy on welfare  is  hopelessly  inadequate  to  address  the  legions
shackled by the oppression of unemployment and its twin, poverty.  Likewise,
the housing policy is blighted by weekly, if not  daily  reports  of  scores
and hundreds of temporary shacks being burnt down, blooded out or torn  down
by officials, thereby compounding the  enslavement  of  homelessness  of  so
many people, in spite of ANC policy on housing being in place.

Again, crime prevention policy, or the abysmal lack thereof, has  seen  some
of us come through ten years of rampant crime, enslaved to the untold  added
expense of high fortress-like walls and razor wire and electric  fences  and
the like to imprison ourselves to the enslavement of the  criminal  minority
who largely  roam  freely  to  continue  their  terror  and  mayhem  over  a
terrified majority who, incidentally, include all of us, from  the  humblest
shack-dweller to the mightiest in our land, namely  our  esteemed  President
and his Ministers who  have  in  the  past  fallen  prey  to  the  rampaging
criminals.

It has come to my attention in the past few days, through personal  accounts
by foreign diplomatic envoys based in South  Africa,  that  they  themselves
are daily falling victim to the tidal wave of crime,  suffering  burglaries,
hijackings and even violent assault,  and  of  course,  the  ordinary  South
African citizen enjoys no freedom from crime, even at times  being  held  up
in one's bank, for  example,  resulting  in  such  enslavements  as  steeply
rising bank charges and penalties for having the audacity to bank one's  own
hard-earned cash.

With regard to education policy,  our  children  are  subject  to  an  ever-
increasing policy of mediocrity and dumbing-down which logically leads to  a
higher pass rate, with the proviso being the easier the syllabus,  the  less
credibility our pass rate will have at all levels of  education.  Thus,  our
children are robbed of aspiring to excellence, and are instead  enslaved  to
a system of egalitarianism, condemning us all to being the  same  under  the
yoke of ANC policy on education stifling any individualism  and  freedom  of
choice.

On sport policy, recent  events  are  self-evident,  and  proving  that  our
sportsmen and  women,  in  the  main,  are  enslaved  by  a  ridiculous  and
incompetent administration, demanding more and more powers and,  to  put  it
impolitely, screwing up on a regular basis.  [Interjections.]  I  sympathise
with all those thus affected, and specifically our  Bafana-Bafana  team,  as
it is clear to all that they have no freedom and, to escape the clutches  of
enslavement to which they are victim, they are  forced  to  leave  for  more
sports-friendly shores.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon member.

Ms T E MILLIN: In conclusion, I pray that the next ten years  of  multiparty
democracy will continue ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon member! Order!

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, the hon member has completed her speech.  I  don't
know whether you wanted to ask her a question?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I didn't want to ask  a
question. Rather, I have a point of order regarding two phrases in  the  hon
member's speech. The one was about ``screwing up'', and the  other  one  was
``damn well'', whatever the English expression is. I am just asking  whether
you could check as to whether that is appropriate  language  in  so  far  as
this particular House is concerned.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will look at that, hon member.

Moh S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Modulasetulo, beibele e re, morena Jesu  e  be

Mešomo ya ANC ga e hlaswe, mang le mang o a e bona. Yoo a sa e bonego  a  ka

[Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Chairperson, the  Bible  says  that  when  the
Pharisees asked Jesus silly questions, he  would  respond  by  saying  ``the
blind see, the disabled walk'', and that is the way things are today.  There
is no need to tell people about the works of the ANC, because everybody  can
see what is happening. Whoever does not see it, never will do. [Applause.]]

Madam Deputy Speaker, before we celebrate  this  tenth  anniversary  of  our
freedom, I think it is important for us to reflect and  see  where  we  come
from as a nation. I will focus mostly on the events on the  continent  since
the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
In the fifties, when the African leaders, including the  ANC  leadership  in
South Africa, were advocating freedom so that Africans could also enjoy  the
benefits of this declaration, and were fighting  for  the  establishment  of
national governance, they were called names.

In the sixties some of the countries started  seeing  their  freedom,  while
some were still struggling. We, the ANC, had to change our tactics and  take
another route. Even the leadership at that time was called names.

In the seventies other parts of the continent continued to  fight  and  some
countries around South Africa were  singing  ``uhuru''.  Countries  in  West
Africa, Central Africa and other parts started experiencing instability  and
coups d'état.

In the eighties, the image of  this  continent  changed  again.  There  were
countries which chose the socialist-oriented economy, but what is  important
is that  the  Nonaligned  Movement  was  also  growing.  The  continent  was
unfortunately struck by famine, hunger and diseases.

In the nineties, in the  southern  part  of  this  continent,  we  sang  our
``uhuru'' song. When the drums were beating in South Africa,  we  all  stood
up to dance because we liked the rhythm. However, going to the  dance  floor
does not mean you are a good dancer.

Mašaedi le ona a kitimela go letša seeta. [Those who cannot  dance  also  go
to the dance floor.]

Today we in this House are lucky, because in the dance it  is  the  minority
who cannot move with the beat of the drums. If they were  in  the  majority,
we would be in big trouble. The whole continent rejoiced  and  joined  South
Africa in this ``uhuru'' song. South Africa did not  hesitate  to  take  its
rightful position in the continent and, under the leadership of the ANC,  is
leading the continent.

In 1993, the Heads  of  State  and  Government  established  mechanisms  for
conflict prevention, management and resolution on  the  continent.  By  that
time, an agreement had already been reached  that,  in  the  coming  African
Union, leadership that comes to power through  coups  d'état  would  not  be
accepted. This was in line with the  objectives  of  the  African  Union  of
promoting peace, security and stability  on  the  continent,  and  promoting
democratic principles and institutions with popular participation  and  good
governance.

I am proud to say that the ANC leadership is acknowledged by  the  continent
in respect of all these achievements. Last year some of  us  were  fortunate
to witness the elections in some parts  of  the  continent.  In  the  DRC  a
transitional  government  was  established.  In   Burundi   a   transitional
government was also put in place, owing  to  the  tireless  efforts  of  our
Deputy President of the ANC who facilitated the peace process there.

We have seen Rwanda going through peaceful  presidential  and  parliamentary
elections. Those of us who were there were humbled to see  the  transparency
and the commitment of the ruling party. When we expressed this  feeling,  we
were told that it was because of the education that the ANC gave  them.  The
ANC has been an example to them.

paragraphs follows.)

[It is true that the ANC has played a role.  When  you  look  at  the  whole
continent, the works of the ANC are understood by everybody who  knows  that
the ANC exists. When the executive committee of the ANC  had  a  meeting  in
1997, they asked the general assembly of  the  ANC  to  deliberate  on  what
could be done to bring about peace  on  the  continent,  and  today,  as  we
speak, this continent has  managed  to  develop  after  our  President  held
discussions with other members and leaders to establish the African Union.
As we speak, the continent has five regions, and  these  regions  will  make
sure that we have laws in  order  to  have  development  on  the  continent.
Countries which are lagging behind with regard to development are to  follow
suit. When the African  Union  was  established,  the  Nepad  programme  was
adopted to be used so that our  countries'  politics  could  be  better,  in
order for the economy to grow and for  the  people  to  work  together  with
their leaders.

If we look at this carefully, we should realise that this  relates  to  what
is happening at the United Nations. There is what we call peer review.  Most
have been trying to hide our leaders'  mistakes,  but  as  black  people  we
understand that when a person makes a mistake, there is no need for them  to
be severely punished; you show them the way and talk to  them  properly  and
they will be able to carry out their responsibilities properly.

Now, we make an appeal to our people to be careful when they look  at  these
organisations, and to understand what happens around them. They  should  not
be happy to be given food which is not sufficient and  think  that  is  what
should be happening. As we speak, diseases are becoming  diminished  on  the
continent,  because  countries  are  coming  together  and  sharing  medical
expertise and resources to avoid the lagging behind of poor countries.

What is talked about here is just to destroy this good programme so that  in
the end our people could be poor forever. As I speak,  the  countries  which
had problems are now developing. I think of Burundi. As we speak, the  peace
that Burundi has achieved, has ensured  that  they  get  financial  help  to
build and develop their country.

With regard to Rwanda, it is leading the way worldwide  with  women  leaders
because of the peace that they now have.

As I conclude my speech, I will go back to the Bible  and  talk  about  John
the Baptist who, when his faith was fading,  sent  those  who  were  working
with him to go and ask Jesus if he was the Lord. Today I want our people  to
be careful of the political organisations who ask if  the  ANC  is  doing  a
good job or not. What kind of organisations are they, because everybody  can
see what we have done?

Let me come back to those who use the word of  God  to  electioneer.  If  we
truly love our people and want to lead them to  God,  let  us  stop  playing
games in the church, because games will  never  be  played  in  the  church.
[Laughter.]

I would also like to make an appeal to the leader of the  opposition  party,
since other  leaders  are  respected  in  their  countries.  There  will  be
disagreements, but the way you  work  with  the  ruling  party  should  show
respect, as we are all human.
I therefore want to respond to you with regard to Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe  is  a
foreign country; it is a neighbouring country, and we are  not  the  leaders
of Zimbabwe. It is sad that, even though you do read, you  ignore  the  true
facts. Even during the time of Idi Amin the true facts  were  ignored;  they
were generalising even if it was just three countries in Africa.
In conclusion, I would like to give a word of advice to the  leader  of  the
opposition, Mr Leon. The way you do things, Mr Leon, you  indeed  remind  me
of an uncircumcised Ndebele. [Laughter.]]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairman, although the President is not here,  I  believe  he
must be monitoring the  debate  somewhere  on  a  monitor,  and  so  I  will
continue to address him.

Though much is taken, much abides,  as  Tennyson's  Ulysses  observed.  Like
Ulysses, you too, Mr President, have seen and known much cities of  men  and
manners, climates, councils, governments, yourself, not least, but  honoured
of them all. Through your travel  and  your  efforts,  peace,  international
relations and co-operation, trade, tourism, transfer of technology and  many
other benefits have flowed from connecting South Africa to Africa and  South
Africa to the world.

Oh, the hon President is here. Thank you, hon Minister of  Foreign  Affairs.
You are reaching out, sir, to the world and the  world  is  responding,  and
the strength of the rand bears testimony to that.

Mr President, I now wish to focus on Parliament  as  an  institution,  as  I
have some experience of it. I accept that no precedent exists in  the  world
for, what I would like to call, the politics of  mutuality.  That  does  not
mean that it does not exist or that it should not be  fully  developed  here
in our Parliament. Our Constitution envisages a politics  of  mutuality  and
the all-important Public Finance Management Act necessitates it.

Having a figurative axe  to  grind  does  not  mean  that  we,  as  opposing
political parties, should battle it out with axes until blood flows,  as  in
Lord of the Rings. For us, as new age MPs  operating  at  the  frontiers  of
parliamentary practice, the PFMA has to become  the  hub  around  which  the
huge parliamentary wheel turns round and round.  Our  parliamentary  battles
have to be undertaken  using  the  estimates  of  national  expenditure  and
computer wizardry. Our Parliament has, moreover, just invested  R22  million
in placing a computer before each one of us. We cannot, therefore, carry  on
as we did in 1994 or earlier.

Our Constitution and the PFMA both make clear what our central functions  in
Parliament are. Our functions are  to  make  laws  and  to  hold  Government
accountable. Happily, Government is a willing partner  in  the  exercise  of
oversight, providing this Parliament  with  copious  information  about  its
programmes in the  estimates  of  national  expenditure.  Everything  is  in
place, except that everything that should have been done by us here to  make
the work possible, didn't happen, and everyone of us is to blame for that.

Hon President,  you  signed  this  powerful  tool  into  law  and  you,  hon
President, must demand that the PFMA be given the  kind  of  attention  that
the English give to their crown jewels, regardless  of  where  those  jewels
came from.

Voters, too, can exert tremendous influence if they wish  corruption  to  be
halted, slackness on the part of officials  to  be  halted  and  joblessness
reversed. The power of the voter and the power of the MP lies in making  the
PFMA work. Voters would do well to let the posters speak to the  poles  they
hang on. They and all of us should focus sharply on the PFMA and ask  for  a
total commitment on the implementation of the PFMA.

If this election becomes an election around the PFMA  as  a  central  issue,
South Africa is poised to become one of the greatest  democracies  that  the
world has ever seen. It is the magic key, it is Arthur's sword,  it  is  the
traditional healer's most potent muti. If we seize on it as a  nation,  like
Jacques Kallis has been doing recently with a cricket  ball,  we  will  have
made our fortune and our future. The first, middle and last issues  in  this
coming election ought to be about getting the PFMA to work from day  one  of
the new Parliament. The PFMA is the future.

To accelerate job creation, we would need to look at the arts, the  sciences
and technology.  The  arts  have  the  greatest  potential  to  deliver  the
greatest number of jobs, provided that it  is  driven  with  commitment  and
purpose.

We also need your direct intervention in nudging us here  in  Parliament  to
develop policies on when and how members may travel; whether committees  can
appoint expert researchers; how committee reports should  be  processed  and
responded to by the executive; who has responsibility for what; and how  all
reports coming to Parliament should be dealt with and proper formal  closure
be effected.

Another issue that we should  look  at  is  the  implementation  of  section
57(2)(c). There is also the issue of creating constituencies. Over the  past
two  days,  we  have  witnessed  finger-pointing,  but  that  is  completely
unimportant. Parliament has to function effectively. It must  become  an  e-
Parliament, because we are wired to become an e-Parliament.

In the past few years, we witnessed several  conflicts  around  governmental
policy issues. As a country that defines itself by making  consensus-seeking
a  virtue  and  a  necessity,  the  intervention  of  Parliament  should  be
obligatory when the people express their unhappiness  as  strongly  as  they
sometimes do in respect of Government policies. All disputes can and  should
be mediated through Parliament, to find the middle ground. The  imbizos  you
began, sir, should continue here, as this is the seat of  the  grand  imbizo
itself.

Finally, our Parliament, as an institution,  needs  to  be  scrutinised.  We
took a quantum leap in proposing to create a  dynamic  people's  Parliament.
We need to make good on that promise. For that very  reason,  the  glare  of
the nation must be as much on Parliament now as it will be on  the  MPs  and
the political parties.

Much has indeed been taken, but much abides. For me, what will  define  this
Parliament in the years to come will be the manner in which  the  PFMA  will
be made to operate.

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Chairperson, hon President, hon Deputy President and  hon
members, on 27 April this year, the peoples of Africa  and  the  peoples  of
the world will be joining us, the people of  South  Africa,  in  celebrating
our decade of freedom.  The  question  is:  Why  would  people  hundreds  of
kilometers away from our borders, thousands  of  kilometers  away  from  our
shores, celebrate this important part of our history with us?

They will be celebrating with us because, from 27 April 1994, South  Africa,
under the leadership of the ANC, has moved away from  being  a  violator  of
human rights, inside and outside of her borders, to being  a  global  player
in the restoration of human dignity and the creation of a caring society.

Instead of being part of civil wars in Mozambique and Angola, South  Africa,
under the leadership of the ANC, assisted  the  people  of  Mozambique  when
there were floods. The Defence Force that could have killed them  before  27
April 1994 saved a woman and her baby from drowning. South Africa was  known
in Lesotho for cross-border raids and abductions, but after 27 April 1994  a
SADC force restored democracy in that country.
We have not only established a culture of human rights here at home, but  we
are the exporters of this culture. That is why in August 1994 His  Lordship,
Justice Richard Goldstone was appointed by the United  Nations  organisation
as a chief prosecutor in the  international  criminal  tribunal  for  former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda. We have done  all  this  and  much  more  because  we
believe that  our  own  development,  the  development  of  Africa  and  the
development of the rest of the world cannot be separated.

We also believe that development outside  a  culture  of  human  rights  can
never be sustainable. Our efforts in Africa and the rest of the  world  have
not gone  unappreciated.  That  is  why  the  rest  of  the  world  will  be
celebrating, this important day with us. As South Africans,  what  shall  we
be celebrating? We shall be celebrating our successes and challenges in  the
first ten years of democracy.

There is no doubt that South  Africa  is  gradually  moving  away  from  its
painful past, a past full of tears and sorrow, and brick  by  brick  we  are
building a society where a rich man's heaven is not a poor  man's  hell.  We
are from a society where the white man's privileges  were  the  black  man's
hell. Despite the fact that the system of apartheid used to refer  to  white
South  Africans  as  Europeans,  on  8  May  1996,  when  we   adopted   our
Constitution, the architects and leaders of that system  joined  the  leader
of the ANC in  this  House,  the  hon  President,  and  declared  themselves
Africans. This was an important victory for  the  oppressed  masses  because
our struggle was not only about our own liberation  as  the  oppressed,  but
also about the liberation of the oppressor.

For  national  reconciliation  to  succeed,  both  the  oppressed  and   the
oppressor must be truly liberated. We are not yet there, but  that  is  what
we are building towards. Despite  many  challenges,  we  are  succeeding  in
building this society where people will  not  be  judged  according  to  the
colour of their skin, but according to the content of their own character.

This reminds me of the incident that happened in the sixties.  A  young  man
of 15 years was arrested for participating in a political activity.  He  was
sentenced to ten years imprisonment. He had his youth taken away  from  him.
Whilst in prison, he studied law. When he was supposed to be admitted as  an
attorney, he was told that he was a Tswana and therefore he  should  go  and
practise  in  Bophuthatswana.  Today  that  person  is  a   judge   of   the
Constitutional Court of the Republic of South Africa.  I  am  talking  about
His Lordship, Justice Earnest Dikgang Moseneke. He is one amongst  many  who
are a clear illustration of how far we have travelled to  be  where  we  are
today.

Before 1994, judges were less independent than they are now because  of  the
supremacy of Parliament, which meant that  even  laws  that  violated  basic
human rights, such as the Suppression of Communism Act, had to  be  enforced
by our courts as long as they were properly passed by Parliament.

Under the ANC we have a constitutional  democracy,  which  means  that  laws
passed by Parliament can be struck down by the courts and be  declared  null
and void if that law violates our Constitution. Under the  ANC,  judges  are
appointed in a transparent manner through the Judicial Services  Commission.
They  are  interviewed  publicly  and  recommendations  are  made   to   the
President, who then appoints.

Before 1994, the president appointed judges in an untransparent way. It  was
just an executive decision without any inputs from people  involved  in  the
administration of justice. We are in the process  of  making  the  judiciary
more accountable to the people  than  it  is  now.  A  Bill  is  before  the
Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development on  complaints
mechanisms against judges and magistrates.

The Department of Justice, with the input from the judiciary,  is  about  to
complete a programme on the continuous changing of the  judiciary,  so  that
our judiciary is in line  with  the  development  of  our  society.  Despite
infrastructural  challenges,  such  as  some  building  not  being  in  good
condition and case backlogs, court  hours  are  continuously  improving  and
conviction rates are improving.

The shift by the  Legal  Aid  Board  away  from  the  judicature  system  to
salaried lawyers has ensured that more poor people get legal  representation
than before, and many offices are being opened which ensure more  access  to
legal representation for the poor.

One of the challenges we are facing is overcrowding  in  prisons,  which  is
partly caused by magistrates imposing high bail amounts to people for  minor
cases. Because most of these people cannot afford bail, they are  forced  to
stay in jail for offences for which,  even  if  convicted,  they  might  not
serve prison sentences. It  is  important  that  magistrates  should  become
sensitive when dealing with this issue.

We have established special courts to deal with sexual  offences  and  child
abuse because it has been very difficult to  deal  with  these  cases  in  a
normal court, because court officials were not trained to  deal  with  them.
One of the most important structures we have created is the  office  of  the
Public Protector, which is empowered by section 182 of the  Constitution  to
investigate  any  conduct  in  any  state  department,  or  in  the   public
administration in any sphere of government that is alleged or  suspected  to
be engaged in improper conduct.

Our objective in creating this structure was to ensure that there  would  be
good  governance,  which  would  improve  service  delivery.  However,   the
challenge faced by this office is the abuse by  some  political  parties  in
this House. When they have lost battles here, they choose the Office of  the
Public Protector to  continue  with  their  battles,  and  that  is  totally
unacceptable.

History has taught us that the problem with good  constitutions  with  bills
of rights throughout the world, is that poor people are not in the  position
to exercise those rights because they don't have money to  pay  lawyers.  To
deal with that, we have established a SA Human Rights Commission whose  duty
is to promote respect for  human  rights,  to  promote  the  protection  and
development of human rights, and to monitor and  assess  the  observance  of
human rights. The SA Human Rights Commission can, on  behalf  of  the  poor,
take a matter to court so that people concerned can exercise their rights.

The transformation of the judiciary is an ongoing  process  and  although  a
lot  has  been  achieved  since   1994,   the   realisation   of   equitable
representation of both black people and women  within  the  judiciary  forms
part of the longer-term objectives.

Over the next five years, the ANC aims to strengthen the prosecution  system
and the Scorpions, and improve  co-ordination  amongst  all  levels  of  law
enforcement.

As some people yearn for the glory of the old South Africa that is gone,  we
shall continue to labour for the success of the new South Africa,  free  and
great among the nations of the world. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, hon President, hon Deputy  President  and  hon
members on both sides of this House, we thank God  and  the  ancestors  that
the  President  recuperated  from  his  recent  health  setback.  Blessings,
visionary guidance and good health to you, Mdengeentonga.

The state of the nation address cried out loud and clear for balance,  which
is so critical in human affairs, especially in a land where there  has  been
so much fragmentation, hate, hurt and oppression  of  so  many  by  so  few,
poverty in the midst of plenty, and many other contrasts and imbalances.

I do not hesitate to say that we recognise  the  achievements  over  the  10
years that will  soon  be  going  past,  but  also,  we  shall  consistently
highlight the shortcomings, for it is right and proper to  do  so,  lest  we
rest on our laurels.

Aptly, President  Thabo  Mbeki  extensively  quoted  from  former  President
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, the undisputed icon and  father  of  our  rainbow
nation. Mandela the reconciler, I call him. Mr President, you  may  walk  in
Mandela's footsteps, but do not be caught up in his ecliptic high tower  and
shadow.

With regard to balance, it was good to welcome the  families  of  those  who
were killed 30 years ago in  various  African  states.  That  was  good,  ke
botho, hobuntu. However,  the  balance  would  have  been  correct  if  also
present were some families such as the Maki Skhosana  family,  Mrs  Moshoue,
mother to Paki and  Grenade,  Tsakane  and  Mamongane,  parents  to  Kenneth
Mahamba, and many others on both sides of the sad civil  strife  and  divide
of our sad history.

Remembering will also reinforce our firm belief in the sanctity of life  and
equality of citizens before the law, not least forgetting our  firm  resolve
to heal the hurts of past injustices.

Reconciliation, as Mandela espoused it, has as  its  cardinal  prerequisites
forgiveness, which  is  a  very  difficult  thing,  tolerance  and  justice.
Reconciliation seeks to unite that  which  was  put  asunder  by  injustice,
ethnic or racial pride and  prejudice,  economic  exploitation  and  overall
social degradation of one group of society by another. The quest  for  unity
cannot  be  completed  without  the   attainment   of   reconciliation   and
reparations where needs be.

Mandela,  despite  our  painful  past,  has  proved  himself   to   be   the
reconciliator par excellence, the unifier. President Thabo Mbeki,  wittingly
or unwittingly, on the basis of our sad history, assumes the  morbid  mantle
of divisiveness. South Africa and all her people  deserve  far  better  than
the retrogressive racial jibes, including ethnic or tribal tendencies.  More
and more people on the ground feel marginalised. Such  negative  perceptions
need the Government's  urgent  attention,  for  they  are  negative  indeed!
[Interjections.]

Our brown compatriots feel that they are again given a raw deal. I quote:


  Not black enough  now  after  not  being  white  enough  under  erstwhile
  apartheid.

[Interjections.]

Some whites have a sense of perpetual guilt and blame, possibly due  to  the
perceived behaviour of the ANC and Government and  some  of  these  howlers.
[Interjections.] Africans  on  the  ground  coined  terms  such  as  ``Xhosa
nostra'' and the ``REX factor'', which acronym means ``Robben Island,  exile
and Xhosa.''

These are perceived as attributes  for  accessing  opportunities,  business,
tenders, jobs, etc. ``You are doomed if you do not have these  attributes,''
the perceptions go. Only the Government  can  dispel  these  perceptions  by
being true to reconciliation and unity in diversity. Afropessimism, you  may
say, but the truth and the reality are staring South Africans in  the  face.
This is indeed a challenge, more than the material, tangible things.  It  is
the soul of a nation. This nation has a soul.

Mr President, you are our President too. As President of  South  Africa  you
are charged to live above the racial, tribal and  sectarian  prejudice  that
we hear. Yours is to govern even-handedly and lead  our  country  to  better
and greater heights, and you are very capable of doing that.

Seize the moment that history has given  you.  Be  the  nation-builder,  the
unifier, the mature statesman with  unfaltering  political  acumen  who  can
dialogue constructively with the country's legitimate opposition parties  or
any other social or economic formations which do  not  necessarily  have  to
agree with the point of view of Government.

It is essential to establish  reconciliation  that  will  facilitate  peace,
stability and prosperity in our land. Our leader, former President  Mandela,
set these high standards and challenges and we have to walk that path.

We have to revisit his wonderful track record from time  to  time,  but  the
greatest  thing  of  all  is  that  we  must  practise  what  he  taught  so
consistently. Reconciliation and unity in diversity, as undergirded  by  the
country's Constitution, are our reality and challenge.
The Mandela  rainbow  reconciliation  nation  has  a  bearing  on  the  very
Government's programme of moral regeneration.  These  things  are  not  only
political or secular, but also have a deep spiritual bearing, especially  in
a country such as ours in which a very large  proportion  of  the  citizenry
subscribes to one faith or the other.

Let us then walk this Madibapath to a reconciled nation and not  be  tempted
to do the easiest thing of playing the race card,  being  unmindful  of  the
dangers of incipient tribalism and unhealthy ethnic prejudice.

Rekindle the beautiful vision of a united and diverse nation with  a  strong
bias for justice, democracy, and  a  nonracial  and  nonsexist  society.  Re
batho ka go fela ga rona! [We are all people.] [Applause.]

Ms Annalizé VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, hon President, hon  Deputy  President,
members of the executive and members of the  House,  in  Disney's  The  Lion
King, the following dialogue between Simba and Rafiki takes place:


  Rafiki: ``The question is: Who are you?''
  Simba: ``I thought I knew, now I'm not sure.''
  Rafiki: ``A change is good.''
  Simba: ``Yeah, but it's not so easy. I know what I have to do, but  going
  back means I'll have to face my past. I've been running from  it  for  so
  long.''

Then suddenly Rafiki hits Simba.


  Simba: ``What was that for?''
  Rafiki: ``It doesn't matter; it's in the past.''
  Simba: ``Yeah, but it still hurts!''
  Rafiki: ``Oh yes, the past can hurt, but the way I  see  it  is  you  can
  either run from it or learn from it. So what are you going to do?''

Who are you and what are you going to do? As illustrated  in  this  dialogue
between two fictitious characters, dealing with the  past  is  not  an  easy
thing to do. As further illustrated,  you  cannot  determine  who  you  are,
unless you deal with the past. In the political  context,  there  are  those
for whom referring to the past is very unpopular. They would  rather  ignore
it and would prefer to act as if South Africa has no past. Ironically,  they
are the very same people, when it suits them, like to create the  impression
that life and  living  conditions  have  not  improved  under  a  democratic
government. As President Mandela said: ``Had the new  South  Africa  emerged
out of nothing, it would not exist.''

South Africa belongs to all who live in it. This is a fundamental  principle
of the Freedom Charter. It's  a  principle  for  which  thousands  of  South
Africans laid down their lives and to which many millions more  dedicated  a
lifetime in order to achieve. It is a principle that drives the ANC and  its
programme of action in its commitment to creating a better life for all.

Who are you and what are you going to do? Did you take up your ownership  of
South Africa and what are you doing with it? A lack of understanding of  our
democracy and a limited understanding of our country paralyses too  many  to
expand  their  own  human  fulfilment  and  accordingly  extend  their   own
frontiers of freedom.

South Africa belongs to all who live in it. Unless we  understand  that  and
take up our rightful place in this democracy, we are limiting the role  that
we can play in building South Africa and in being co-authors of our  future.
It is for this reason that we need to look back from where  we  come  before
we can assess where we are and what role we choose to play.

In die terugkyk na die verlede is die doel geensins  om  skuldgevoelens  aan
te wakker of selfs skuld toe te  dig  nie.  Skuldgevolens  is  'n  negatiewe
energie, en onaangespreek dien dit geen doel om iets  positiefs  by  te  dra
tot die toekoms nie. Hoe elkeen van  ons  met  die  verlede  handel,  is  'n
persoonlike keuse. Die tempo waarteen elkeen kies om dit te doen, is ook  'n
persoonlike keuse.

Die belangrike is egter dat ons dit doen, en wanneer  ons  dit  gedoen  het,
ons weet wie ons is en watter rol ons in die toekoms speel. (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The purpose of looking back at the past is by no means to  arouse  feelings
of guilt or even to apportion blame. Guilt feelings are a  negative  energy,
and unaddressed they serve no purpose in contributing anything  positive  to
the future. The way each of us deals with the past  is  a  personal  choice.
The rate at which everyone chooses to do so is also a personal choice.

What is important, however, is that we do it, and when we have done  it,  we
know who we are and which role we will be playing in future.]

Until 1994 we did not know a democracy. We did not experience  a  democracy.
Oh  yes,  we  as  minorities  participated  in  elections  at  national  and
municipal level. We were told that that was democracy.  We  were  taught  at
school that it was a democracy. At that time many  of  us  believed  it.  We
need to understand that democracy under the ANC Government is in fact a  way
of everyday living. Democracy is more than just free  elections  every  five
years. It's a culture, a  way  of  behaving  in  everyday  life,  a  set  of
principles. And it is once we  realise  this  and  turn  from  spectator  to
player that we can take up  ownership  and  that  South  Africa  will  truly
belong to all who live in it. It is for this reason we need to look  at  our
past. [Applause.]

Ek wil u vra om u gemoed vir 'n oomblik oop te  maak.  Plaas  uself  in  die
skoene van 'n mede-landsburger onder die wette van  apartheid.  [I  want  to
ask you to open your mind for moment. Put yourself in the shoes of a  fellow
citizen during the apartheid laws.]

In 1959 Lesley Rubin wrote  a  pamphlet  entitled,  ``This  is  Apartheid''.
Lesley Rubin, and I quote, ``represented the Africans of the Cape  province,
excluding the Transkei, in the Senate''. In this publication Rubin gives  no
personal view, nor does he make any comments; he simply states some  of  the
race laws of the time. I quote:
  An African who was born in a town and who lived  there  continuously  for
  fifty years, but then left to reside elsewhere for any period,  even  two
  weeks, is not entitled, as of right, to return to the town where  he  was
  born and to remain there for more than seventy-two hours. If he does,  he
  is guilty of a criminal offence punishable by a fine  not  exceeding  ten
  pounds or, in default,  imprisonment  for  a  period  not  exceeding  two
  months, unless he has obtained a permit to do so.

Imagine that you were born, raised and worked in a town for  50  years.  One
day you need to go and visit a relative in  another  town,  maybe  attend  a
funeral, or visit a family member. Because you were African and you did  not
have a permit, and you left the town where you had stayed for more  than  50
years, you would not be allowed to return. It did not  matter  whether  your
wife, children or your life was in that town  -  you  were  not  allowed  to
return. How inhumane,  degrading  and  destructive  to  the  institution  of
families on which we must base so much of a healthy, caring,  people-centred
society! [Applause.]
Die blote feit dat ek in besit is en aangehaal het uit Rubin se  publikasie,
sou onder apartheid beteken het dat ek self in die tronk sou beland het.

Plaas jouself in die skoene van die volgende persoon.  Hierdie  persoon,  'n
dame van 60 jaar, moet daagliks kilometers ver stap om  hout  te  gaan  soek
sodat sy vir haar familie hulle daaglikse etes kan voorberei. Stel jou  voor
hoe sy, nadat sy met moeite en 'n  swaar  kruiwa  vol  hout  terug  by  haar
plakkershut gekom het, dan in die teenoorgestelde rigting  met  'n  25-liter
emmer op haar kop 6 kilometer moet aflê om te gaan water  haal,  dag  in  en
dag uit, jaar na jaar.

Vandag bly dieselfde persoon in  'n  huis  wat  die  ANC-regering  aan  haar
verskaf  het.  Daar  is  lopende  water  en  haar  huis  het  elektrisiteit.
[Applous.] Sy ontvang 'n pensioen van die staat. Haar  mening  tel  en  haar
insette word gevra wanneer  besluite  wat  haar  en  haar  gemeenskap  raak,
gemaak moet word.  Haar  menswaardigheid  is  herstel.  Suid-Afrika  behoort
inderdaad aan almal wat in hierdie land woon.

Sou hierdie persoon u eie ma, vrou of suster wees, sou u steeds kon  sê  dat
die lewe vir miljoene Suid-Afrikaners nie verbeter het nie? (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The mere fact that I am in possession  of  and  have  quoted  from  Rubin's
publication would have meant, under apartheid,  that  I  myself  would  have
landed in prison.

Put yourself in the shoes of the following person. This person,  a  lady  of
60 years, has to walk kilometres every day to look  for  wood  in  order  to
prepare  her  family's  daily  meals.  Imagine  how,  having  returned  with
difficulty to her squatter's hut with a heavy wheelbarrel full of wood,  she
then has to travel for 6 kilometres in the  opposite  direction  with  a  5-
litre bucket on her head to fetch water, day after day, year after year.

Today the same person lives in a house that the ANC Government provided  for
her.  There  is  running  water  and  she  has  electricity  in  her  house.
[Applause.] She receives a pension from the state. Her  opinion  counts  and
her inputs are requested when decisions  affecting  her  and  her  community
have to be made. Her human dignity has been restored. South Africa  belongs,
indeed, to everyone living in this country.

Should this person be your own mother, wife or sister, would  you  still  be
able to say that life has not improved for millions of South Africans?]

With what credibility can anyone who, like me, was on  the  advantaged  side
of apartheid, ever say that the lives of millions of South Africans did  not
improve? The next time before you  make  such  a  comment,  remind  yourself
where we come from.

We come from a past where women were paid less than men doing the same  job;
where one race group was considered superior to all others; where a  certain
religion was the preferred one by the  state;  where  old  was  better  than
young and where  some  had  all  the  civil  rights  and  others  had  none.
Inequality  was  deeply  embedded  in  our  everyday  life;  inequality  was
legalised and institutionalised.

In 1994 the ANC inherited a  government  with  no  credibility  amongst  the
majority of the people. It was a government  that  had  become  increasingly
isolated, authoritarian and corrupt. It was an administrative  structure  at
variance with reality as experienced by  the  majority  of  South  Africans.
Days before 1994, the desperation of  the  very  poor  hardly  registered  a
blimp on the  radar  screen  of  priorities  of  the  apartheid  government.
HIV/Aids and the  potential  consequences  received  very  little,  if  any,
attention. State welfare  grants  were  unevenly  distributed  along  racial
lines to disfavour those who needed them most. Prior to 1994  the  apartheid
government budgeted for less than five million people. Today we  budget  for
almost 10 times as many people. [Applause.] The institutions  of  government
were used to enforce political philosophy, not the delivery of  services  to
the people. It was a state that excluded the majority of citizens  and  used
its machinery to ensure that the divide  between  race  groups,  both  on  a
social and economic level, was entrenched. The structures and  systems  were
designed in such a way that the relations between races and between men  and
women were perpetuated.

It is thus  abundantly  clear  that  in  order  to  ensure  a  people-driven
government, where the needs of the people were  driving  the  priorities  of
government, a complete transformation of government was needed.

During the first years of democracy the priority was to put in place  a  new
constitutional  and  legislative  framework.  The  adoption   of   the   new
Constitution in 1996 was one of the most important achievements during  this
time. Then followed numerous new Acts and amendments  to  Acts  required  to
reconfigure the South African society and establish the  framework  for  the
necessary implementation of policies that would lead to the  improvement  of
the lives of all South Africans. An important part of the transformation  of
the state was also the successful establishment of Chapter 9 institutions.

These  institutions,  such  as  the  Public  Protector,  the  Human   Rights
Commission and the Commission for Gender Equality, protect  the  rights  and
privileges of all South Africans and of our democratic state.

It is clear that the ANC made remarkable progress in transforming the  state
machinery from an oppressive monster to one responsive to the needs  of  the
citizens  and  accountable  to  the   electorate   through   their   elected
representatives.  The  rationalisation  and  integration  of  Government  is
almost complete into a central government public service.

We have almost achieved our target of representivity in the Public  Service.
There is, however, room for improvement in increasing the  number  of  women
in senior positions and a  general  increase  of  disabled  persons  at  all
levels. The democratic state is able to exercise authority  across  society,
and in the eyes of the overwhelming majority it enjoys legitimacy.

We do, however, need to enhance our service delivery so that  we  can  reach
more people at an accelerated pace.

This ANC Government has  dealt  decisively  with  corruption  and  no  other
government in the history of South Africa  has  done  as  much  to  rid  the
Public Service of corruption. [Applause.] The implementation of  the  Public
Finance  Management  Act  enhanced  and   improved   accountability   within
Government and to Parliament.

Batho Pele had mixed success.  Weaknesses  include  the  monitoring  of  the
implementation of the principles by senior management. The  public  is  also
not as involved in enforcing these principles as they ought to be.

I would like to take a minute to react to some of  the  speeches  that  were
made today. I would like to start off with the DA. For once  in  my  life  I
actually agree with the Leader of the Opposition. The country  needs  change
and  the  country  wants  change.  We  need  a  change  from  a  destructive
opposition to one that will play a positive role in making  sure  that  they
can contribute in facing and addressing  the  challenges  of  this  country.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Furthermore, I also think that it's a shame that he didn't have the  courage
- maybe we should start calling  him  the  ``red  herring''  Leader  of  the
Opposition - to apologise for the red herrings that were  sent  out  by  his
party, such as the third term and a couple of others as well,  such  as  the
two-thirds majority and the threat that it  will  happen.  Let  us  remember
that they, at least twice  or  thrice  already  this  year,  have  suggested
certain questions in  this  House  that  would  have  led  to  changing  the
Constitution of this country. [Interjections.]

To the DA I want to say that visiting areas on the campaign trail and  being
there on a daily basis are different situations. The  people  know  who  are
there every  day.  They  know  who  were  there  during  the  fight  against
apartheid.  [Applause.]  They  know  who  brought  them  freedom,   housing,
education and dignity. I have dealt with my past; it's your turn to  do  so.
[Applause.] They know who cares.  Our  people  are  far  more  informed  and
politically mature, as they tolerate Mr Leon during his  election  campaign.
They know that all changes cannot be delivered  overnight.  They  know  that
their freedom is not the DA's business. Was I the only one,  or  were  there
others who picked up that Mr Leon's list of crime victims  were  all  white?
Are they the only people affected by crime? [Applause.]

Who are you and what are you going to do? Are you going to isolate  yourself
and around dinner tables complain  about  everything  going  wrong?  Do  you
choose to become part of those who want to build South Africa, who give  not
only  money  and  expertise,  but  also  most  importantly  involvement  and
loyalty? Are you going to continue to complain amongst  your  friends  about
the police in your area or are you going to join the community police  forum
in your neighbourhood? [Applause.]  Do  you  know  how  your  councillor  is
spending your money? Let your councillor consult with you.  Do  you  have  a
ward committee? We know which party's councillors refuse to  establish  ward
committees. Do you serve on the school board at your child's school? Do  you
ever attend an imbizo in your area to confront a Government Minister or  MEC
with your concerns? Who are you and what do you choose  to  do?  Are  you  a
spectator or armchair critic, or are  you  contributing  towards  finding  a
solution for our nation and our country's many challenges?

South Africa belongs to all who live in it. Who are  you?  Are  you  signing
the contract with the ANC and are  you  becoming  the  author  of  your  own
future? Allow yourself to take up ownership of  South  Africa.  Become  your
own voice in Government. Join the ANC and together  let  us  build  an  even
better South Africa for all who live in it ... [Applause.] ... never  to  go
back to yesterday, our eyes  and  efforts  firmly  on  today,  building  for
tomorrow to ensure a better life for all.

I know what my choice is. I would like to end my speech with  the  words  of
the renowned author Pamela Jooste. She wrote about being an African.


  It is a matter of the blood. If you have felt the blood pull  of  Africa,
  there is no need for explanation. If you have not,  no  explanation  will
  suffice. Perhaps it is in the air, which, high up on the  plains,  is  so
  easy to breathe it floats in and out of the lungs with no effort at  all,
  or perhaps the light, which in high summer shines like running water over
  everything it touches.


  In Africa there is no middle way. Ours is a continent that knows want and
  famine and poverty and is plagued by a great pandemic. It is a  continent
  too well versed in mourning its dead. Yet, when the world turns,  as  the
  world always does, and the rains come and with them a promise, if not  of
  plenty then at least of sufficiency, Africa is a continent that knows how
  to dance. After its great lamentations Africa knows what  it  is  to  bow
  before that precious gift that is life and give thanks. For an African to
  go is always to return. What other place is there  that  offers  us  such
  freedom? What other place is there that can satisfy us and return  to  us
  that essential part of ourselves that is ourselves? We are here where  we
  ought to be. It is not by chance and it is enough.

I thank you. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 18:45.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.     Report  of  the   Portfolio   Committee   on   Public   Service   and
     Administration on Visit to Alexandra Urban  Renewal  Project  and  Free
     State, dated 26 February 2003:


     The Portfolio Commmittee on Public Service and  Administration,  having
     visited the Alexandra Urban Renewal  Project  and  the  Free  State  in
     January 2003, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         As part of our Annual Programme for  2003,  the  Committee  visited
         the Alexandra Urban Renewal Project, the Free State Office  of  the
         Director-General  and  three   Free   State   Departments,   namely
         Agriculture, Home Affairs and Social Development, on 21, 22 and  23
         January 2003, respectively.


         Whereas our visit can largely be explained as part of  our  routine
         oversight programme, the idea to visit the Alexandra Urban  Renewal
         Project was due to what was alleged during our visit  to  the  same
         project  in  2002,  namely  that  there   were   serious   problems
         associated with the implementation of  the  project.  It  was  said
         then  that  the  community  was  generally  dissatisfied  with  the
         project, to the extent that they did not  see  themselves  deriving
         any benefit from it. It was  due  to  this  understanding  and  the
         desire to make a contribution towards finding a  solution  for  the
         project that we decided to organise a panel and to allow  community
         representatives to share their opinions regarding the project.  The
         day  was  meant  to   belong   to   the   people,   through   their
         representatives, whereas the panel would listen to those people  as
         they air their views and would later develop  a  strategy  to  take
         those issues forward.


         The Office of the Director-General in the Free State was  requested
         to brief the Committee about the  Province's  strategic  plans  and
         organisational  structure,  so  as  to  enable  the  Committee   to
         understand their state of  readiness  in  dealing  with  issues  of
         service delivery to the community. It was anticipated that  dealing
         with the organisational structure at the level of  Director-General
         would  facilitate  interaction,  so  that,  when   we   deal   with
         provincial departments, we would have enough time  to  engage  them
         on  key  areas  of  service  delivery,   rather   than   sing   the
         organogramme rhetoric as we visit one department after another.


         The Committee's interest with the  Department  of  Agriculture  was
         the role of the Department in creating a conducive environment  for
         emerging farmers, with specific focus  on  assisting  farmers  from
         previously disadvantaged communities. Noting that land  acquisition
         and ownership have a direct impact on the success or  otherwise  of
         accelerating new entrants into the farming fraternity, and  further
         noting  that  there  are  other  departments  that  have  a  direct
         responsibility  to  deal  with  questions  related  to   this,   we
         requested that the Department of Agriculture be accompanied by  the
         Departments of Land and of Local Government when  they  make  their
         presentation.


         The Department of Home Affairs was requested to brief us  on  their
         service delivery highlights and low point,  and  they  had  to  put
         more emphasis on the  issuing  of  identity  documents,  birth  and
         death  certificates,  residence  and  other  permits,  issuing   of
         passports, and issues of  migration  and  immigration.  In  dealing
         with these  issues,  the  Department  had  to  demonstrate  to  the
         Committee how accessible these services were to the community,  and
         whether the Department conformed to  the  standards  for  rendering
         such a service.


         We asked the Department of Social Development to brief  us  on  the
         situation in the Free State - how they deal with issues  of  social
         security services, i.e. old-age  pension  payments,  child  support
         grants, orphanage grants and other related services.


     B.     Delegation


         The delegation to the Alexandra Urban Renewal Project was:


         Mr M R Baloyi (ANC) (leader)
         Mr J Mohlala (ANC)
         Mr B Mthembu (ANC)
         Ms L Maloney (ANC)
         Mr B G Bell (DA)


         In the Free State, Dr  U  Roopnarain  (IFP)  and  Ms  Seeco  (UCDP)
         joined the delegation.


     C.     Developments at Alexandra


         1. Panel


              We set up a panel that was supposed  to  listen  to  what  the
              people had to say about their experience as far as  the  Urban
              Renewal Project was  concerned,  and  that  comprised  of  the
              following:


                  The  National  Assembly  Portfolio  Committee  on   Public
                  Service and Administration;
                  Gauteng  Provincial  Legislature  Standing  Committee   on
                  Housing;
                  Gauteng  Provincial  Legislature  Standing  Committee   on
                  Local Government and Development;
                  The project's Steering Committee;
                  The Public Service Commission.


         2. Community representation and participation


              The community was represented by NGOs, ward  committees,  ward
              councillors, political organisations and other organs of civil
              society.
              Facilitated by  the  chairperson  of  the  Gauteng  Provincial
              Legislature's Standing Committee on Housing,  Mr  Mabaso,  the
              panel listened to the  people  speaking  of  their  experience
              about the project - they stood up one after the other, talking
              only about how well the  project  is  turning  their  township
              around.


              They are proud of the project. They  believe  that  it  is  on
              course to achieve the objectives set during inception and that
              they stand to benefit at the end of the development.


              They cited shortcomings in  the  area  of  monitoring  -  they
              indicated that contractors are not closely monitored on  site,
              so they they take advantage  of  that  to  compromise  quality
              during  construction   and   exploit   contract   workers   by
              underpaying them.


              Whereas they believe  it  is  the  community  representatives'
              responsibility to join the monitoring process and to do  other
              community  work,  like  participating  in   crime   prevention
              initiatives, they recognised a resource burden. They  have  to
              do it in such a manner that they  find  themselves  having  to
              spend money in order to meet their obligations. They  appealed
              that  we  should  consider  influencing  a   situation   where
              community representatives are entitled to an allowance.


              The other problem identified, was that of  the  occupation  of
              flats by foreigners who are not even legally  supposed  to  be
              staying in those areas, and are actually contributing  to  the
              prevalence of crime in the area.


              Before the community participated in the fashion as  indicated
              above,  the  Department  of  Housing  gave  an  input  on  the
              performance of the project, where they mentioned that, despite
              the fact that funding was  not  as  forthcoming  as  they  had
              anticipated, particularly from Head  Office  level,  they  are
              doing well with the implementation of  the  project.  In  this
              regard, our impression came from the following observations:


              *   The replacement of shacks with decent housing


              *   The restoration of access to the township through widening
                  the street


              *   The restoration of access to the school by the removal  of
                  shacks around that school. The  upgrading  of  13  primary
                  schools  and  five  high  schools  is  approximately   30%
                  complete.  Additional  land  is  acquired  for  three  new
                  schools, and design is under way for five new schools


              *   Improving sanitation in the township, as they  distributed
                  58 000 bins to members of the community. A study has  been
                  completed for the establishment of a recycling station


              *   The restoration of the Jukskei River through  the  removal
                  of  refuse  debris  and  the  clearing  of  all   unwanted
                  materials from the river bank


              *   The establishment of a multipurpose complex in the CBD  of
                  Alexandra. During the visit,  the  contractors  were  busy
                  demolishing the old railway  buildings  and  removing  all
                  dumped properties that were polluting the area  so  as  to
                  make way for the complex that will be established as  part
                  of the Urban Renewal Project


              *   The establishment of  a  transit  village  to  accommodate
                  households whose houses  are  under  construction  at  any
                  given  time.  The  Marlboro  Transit  village   has   been
                  upgraded and additional land has  been  acquired,  whereas
                  the Alexandra transit village, with 500  units,  has  been
                  handed over


              *   The establishment of parks at the township


              *   The establishment of a police station in the area comes as
                  an important part of the project.  The  communication  and
                  interaction  that  arose  from   the   project,   and   in
                  particular when it came to a point  of  the  establishment
                  of this station, created a environment conducive  for  the
                  community  to  be  involved  in  matters  of  safety   and
                  security. As a result of this, the project has yielded  an
                  actual drop of crime  by  30%  in  the  outskirts  of  the
                  township


              *   Cemetery upgrading is approximately 40% complete


              *   About 2 500  trees  have  been  planted  as  part  of  the
                  greening project


              *   Contractors have been appointed for all  water  works  for
                  Frankenwald, Westlake, Marlboro and Linbro


              *   About 907 restitution claims have been settled


              *   Approximately 1 200 households have been relocated  and  a
                  voluntary relocation package introduced


              *    2  281  RDP  housing  units  have  been  constructed   at
                  Braamfisherville and 200 units at Alexandra  Extension  8,
                  while the concept and design work are  completed  for  the
                  conversion of hostel units into family units.


     D.     Briefing with Director-General of Free State


         During the briefing session with the Director-General of  the  Free
         Sate, the following came to light:


         *  The  Province  has  a  strategic  plan  called  the  Free  State
              Development Plan, which has been in operation for  almost  two
              years


         *  The Province is experiencing a declining economic growth due  to
              the mining operations that are on the  decline.  According  to
              their strategic plan, they are aiming to turn the tide  around
              and to get the economy growing by at least 4,5% by the end  of
              the financial year


         *  The first community bank was established for the  Province,  but
              it has run into serious problems
         *  The child support grant uptake takes place at an increased pace


         *  The province has managed to train 761 emerging farmers in  terms
              of their farmer support programme


         *  The Development Plan encourages the practice  of  intersectional
              and intergovernmental co-ordination, in that the plans of each
              section  are  related  to  the  main  plan.  Accordingly,  the
              Province established a co-ordination structure called PROVLOC,
              which is used as a vehicle to get the provincial government co-
              ordinating their activities with local government. The PROVLOC
              technical team and the head of department has to consult  with
              municipal managers in the Province, whereas PROVLOC  political
              is a forum through which Premier consult Mayors. In  order  to
              deal with the challenges of some  schools  performing  to  the
              level of expectation while others are  dismally  failing,  the
              Province deployed principals from the  successful  schools  to
              monitor the activities of principals from those  schools  that
              are failing to produce good matric results


         *  The challenge with the development plan is that of  capacity  to
              implement it, but they are working on it


         *  The realisation of service-delivery objectives in  the  Province
              is attributed to the utilisation of the cluster approach,  and
              the fact that all Departments have appointed  Chief  Financial
              Officers.


     E.     Briefing with Department of Agriculture, Free State


         During the briefing  session  with  our  delegation,  the  MEC  for
         Agriculture alluded to the following:


         *  The Department's strategic plan  is  based  on  the  Free  State
              Development Plan


         *  The programme of land reform for agricultural development is  in
              progress - currently there are 1 600 recipients


         *  In dealing with the broader land redistribution  programme,  the
              Province experiences a situation where there are more  willing
              sellers, which gives an  opportunity  for  entrance  into  the
              farming  environment  by  emerging  farmers  from   previously
              disadvantaged  communities.  The  Department  introduced   two
              campaigns to the established commercial farmers, called  "Know
              your neighbour" and "Pick your  neighbour",  with  the  former
              encouraging them  to  know  and  understand  either  the  farm
              workers or the people from villages around the farm,  and  the
              latter encouraging them to work with those  people  either  in
              the form of acquiring shares  in  the  farms  or  establishing
              partnerships


         *  The problem for those emerging farmers that  would  like  to  go
              the route of the  Land  Bank  loan  option  is  that  of  land
              ownership, because many of them own land on the tenure  system
              that is not always reliable, such as the Permission To  Occupy
              Route (PTO). This option applies to areas under the control of
              traditional leaders, and it does not transfer ownership to the
              land user
         *  The Department could have done more than they  had  been  doing,
              had they not experienced budget cuts, and also if they did not
              have the  anomaly  that  74%  of  their  budget  went  towards
              personnel


         *  The  Department  did  not  utilise  the  money  donated  by  the
              European Union for the support of small-scale farmers  in  the
              form of establishing community gardens, and they cited reasons
              of stringent rules as the main cause, but when we engaged them
              on  this,  it  became  clear  that  it  was  a   question   of
              misunderstanding and lack of commitment on their part that the
              money was not spent. They, however, mentioned  that  they  are
              now ready and have a programme for spending the money.


     F.     Briefing with Department of Home Affairs, Free State


         The  Department  of  Home  Affairs  submitted   their   report   of
         performance in all their key performance areas, in  a  manner  that
         gave  an  aggregate  picture  of  their  performance,  and  without
         breaking the figures down to be able to give us a picture of  their
         performance against set standards. Although they could  not  relate
         to a particular figure, they argued that  there  is  a  backlog  in
         terms of identity documents that have been  applied  for  but  have
         not yet been issued, and they blamed it on the complex  operational
         process with their Head Office.


         The regional office is handling cases  of  migration  through  four
         border posts.


         Their service delivery points are coping with the workload.


         With effect from April 2003, they will  embark  on  a  campaign  to
         accelerate the issuing of identity documents, as a preparation  for
         the 2004 elections.


         Their success in dealing with their  workload  is,  allegedly,  not
         influenced by the convenience of their  work  environment,  but  by
         the fact that they are committed  to  work,  even  under  difficult
         circumstances, as reflected in  the  challenges  in  the  areas  of
         budget constraints, logistics and low  morale,  Two  main  problems
         were mentioned in dealing with  logistics,  one  being  a  lack  of
         facilities at border posts. According to the  report,  there  is  a
         need for the  use  of  facilities  such  as  photocopiers  and  fax
         machines. The impact  is  that  they  have  to  travel  for  longer
         distances to be able to access such services, and more  often  than
         not, they find themselves in a situation where they have to  accept
         that they just cannot stretch themselves beyond the limit.


         The second problem is that of  their  Bloemfontein  service  point,
         which is not compatible for use by members of  the  community  when
         they come for such  services  as  identity  socuments,  birth/death
         certificates, marriage certificates, etc. The  office  is  situated
         on the first floor of the building and ordinary people have to  use
         escalators to get to the service desks. There are two lifts in  the
         building, but they are overcrowded most of the time. They took  the
         matter up with the Department of Public Work,s but up to now  there
         has been no change. It is difficult for  ordinary  members  of  the
         community to use,  but  it  is  worse  with  disabled  persons.  We
         visited the building in question and  interviewed  the  people  who
         were  there  for  assistance,  as  well  as  staff  members.  Those
         interviewed members of the community confirmed  that  the  location
         of the building is an issue warranting attention. One staff  member
         commented generally about the situation, as follows:


         *  The building is not conducive for work
         *  There are no ventilators in the building


         *  Many people collapse in the building because of heat


         *  Some people go  back  unattended  because  they  are  afraid  of
              escalators


         *  The building is not identifiable as a Home Affairs outlet


         *  The public toilets  are  not  blocked  off  from  the  frontline
              desks, with the result that  the  bad  smell  always  disturbs
              workers


         *  The doors of the staff toilets  are  facing  the  staff  kitchen
              directly


         *  Black employees of the Department are not  allowed  to  work  in
              some  sections,  such  as  Data  Processing,  Civic   Affairs,
              Personnel, Stores, etc.
         *  The Regional Director never visits the office


         *  There is a bad relationship between management and  one  of  the
              two recognised trade unions.


         Another problem which has been shared with the Committee, was  that
         of corruption at border posts, with specific reference  to  Lindela
         transit  facility,  in  respect  of  which  they   have   taken   a
         departmental decision that they are no longer  going  to  use  that
         border post.


     G.     Briefing with Department of Social Development, Free State


         In briefing the Committee,  the  MEC  for  the  Social  Development
         indicated that 98% of the budget is spent on social security.


         A cumulative total of back-payment to old-age  pensioners  amounted
         to R73 061 302, and that covered 109 615 beneficiaries.


         The Department has a strategy to increase the uptake of  the  child
         support grant in the Province.


         The Department has embarked  on  a  process  of  improving  pension
         payout points by facilitating the provision  of  shelter,  toilets,
         water and security.


         They identified a problem of underpayment for social  workers,  and
         that state of affairs makes them vulnerable to outside  recruitment
         and deprives the Department  of  these  indispensable  units.  They
         have tried their best to address the  question  of  incentives  for
         these scarce skills, but they are always disappointed. A report  by
         the Social Workers' Council was written, in  which  they  addressed
         the situation  concerning  the  conditions  of  service  of  social
         workers and in which they also made  specific  recommendations  for
         the improvement of social  workers'  salaries.  The  Department  of
         Social Development referred such a report to the  Minister  of  the
         Public Service and Administration for her  attention,  but  at  the
         time of the visit, the Minister had not yet replied to the report.


         Inspired by the successful operation of the "Stepping Stones"  One-
         Stop Centre in Port Elizabeth, and committed to  provide  a  child-
         friendly and rights-based  service  that  adheres  to  the  minimum
         standards for the Child and Youth Care System,  the  Department  of
         Social Development entered into a partnership with  the  SAPS,  the
         Department  of  Justice  and  the  National  Institute  for   Crime
         Prevention and Reintegration of Offenders, to establish a  one-stop
         Child Justice Centre in Mangaung. The Centre started  operating  in
         May 2002, and it deals with children  in  conflict  with  the  law,
         aged between 14 and  17,  and  children  who  have  committed  less
         serious offences. The approach  at  this  Centre  is  more  one  of
         rehabilitation and reintegration,  and  proceedings  are  conducted
         with the best interest of the juvenile at heart, in  an  atmosphere
         of understanding, allowing juveniles  to  participate  and  express
         themselves freely, unlike rigid  and  intimidatory  proceedings  in
         court.


         Since it started operating, the Centre has already been home for  a
         few offenders, some of whom have already been reconciled  with  the
         law.


         In  dealing  with  the  HIV/AIDS  campaign,  the   Department   has
         appointed  an  HIV-positive  person,  who  is  doing  well  in  the
         campaign.


     H.     Recommendations


         The Committee recommends:
         1. That Parliament note the good progress in the  roll-out  of  the
              Alexandra Urban Renewal Project.


         2. That the Department of Provincial and Local Government  and  the
              Alexandra  Steering  Committee  ensure  that  the  project  is

              section in Alexandra.


         4. That the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  look
              into the question of advising municipalities to consider  ways

         5. That the Free State Director-General's  office  investigate  the
              nature of problems that confronted the  first  community  bank
              that was established in the province.


         6. That the Director-General's office determine  a  time-frame  for
              building capacity to deal with their strategic plan  and  that
              they give feedback on this issue by August 2003.


         7.  That  there  be  a  strategic  intervention   to   ensure   the
              sustainability of SMMEs.
         8. That  the  Department  of  Agriculture  (Free  State)  submit  a
              detailed plan, with time-frames, in terms of which they intend
              spending European  Union  funds,  within  two  months  of  the
              adoption of this Report by the National Assembly.


         9. That the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  provide  the  necessary
              amenities,  like  fax  machines,  computers,  telephones   and
              photocopiers to the border post offices.


         10.      That  the  Bloemfontein  Home  Affairs  service  point  be
              relocated to an area where it will be accessible to members of
              the community.


         11.     That the  allegations  of  corruption  at  Lindela  Transit
              Facility be referred to the anti-corruption unit  for  further
              investigation.


         12.     That the Department of Home Affairs fill its  vacancies  as
              soon as it is convenient to do so.


         13.     That the Department of Social Development, in  consultation
              with the Department of Public Service and Administration, look

     I.     Inflation targeting


     A.     Comments by Deutsche Bank: C Barr, Chief UK Economist, M Biggs &
         George Buck (2 Oct)


         1. History


              Up until the introduction of inflation targeting, there was  a
              haphazard monetary policy in the UK. The  impetus  towards  an
              inflation targeting regime was induced as a  response  to  the
              crisis which had occurred  after  sterling  left  the  ERM  in
              September 1992. Until 1997, the  government  still  controlled
              interest rate decisions, but in  May  of  that  year  the  new
              Labour Government formalised the monetary  policy  regime.  It
              granted "operational independence" to the Bank of  England  to
              determine interest rates and introduced inflation targeting as
              formal policy.


         2. Key features of inflation targeting in UK


              (a) The primary aim of  inflation  targeting  is  to  maintain
                  price stability, with the government defining  the  target
                  and the bank having operational  independence  to  achieve
                  that target.


              (b) Currently, and since the  beginning,  the  RPIX  inflation
                  target (which is exactly the same as the  CPIX)  is  fixed
                  at 2,5% at all times, with a 1% deviation band  on  either
                  side. In South Africa the target is based on a  range  and
                  is specified for a period of time.


              (c) If inflation deviates by more  than  1%  from  the  target
                  (i.e. 1,4 or below or 3,6 or higher)  for  reasons  beyond
                  the control of the Central Bank, the Bank  is  obliged  to
                  account for its failure to attain  the  inflation  target.
                  This is done through the mechanism of an "open letter"  by
                  means of which the Governor informs the  Treasury  on  the
                  following matters:


                  *    Why inflation has moved away from the target by  more
                       than 1%


                  *    What policy is used to deal with it


                  *    The period within which it is expected to  return  to
                       the target


                  *    How this approach  meets  the  government's  monetary
                       policy objectives.


              (d) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)


                  The  MPC,  which  is  housed  in  the  Bank  of   England,
                  deliberates and makes decisions on all matters  pertaining
                  to inflation targeting.


                  It consists of 11 members, of whom  five  are  members  of
                  staff of the Bank and four external members, not  employed
                  by the  Bank  and  appointed  by  the  Chancellor  of  the
                  Exchequer. The Governor appoints Bank members.
                  There is a Treasury  representative  present  at  all  MPC
                  meetings  who  represents  the  views  of  the   Treasury.
                  However, this representative  does  not  have  any  voting
                  power. The Treasury representative provides input  on  the
                  fiscal  policy  of  the  government  and  reports  to  the
                  Treasury.


                  The MPC meets once a month, and its minutes are  published
                  within  two  weeks  of  a  meeting.  The  minutes  do  not
                  attribute  comments  to  specific  individuals,  but   the
                  voting of  specific  members  is  noted.  Explicit  voting
                  allows different views and can aid the credibility of  the
                  process.


                  One of  the  factors  which  the  MPC  has  to  take  into
                  account, is whether inflation is being driven  by  demand-
                  side or supply-side factors.


                  The Chancellor can override  a  decision  by  the  MPC  in
                  "exceptional circumstances". However, this cannot be  done
                  without first going  through  Parliament.  The  Chancellor
                  has never used this power.


         3. Environment in which inflation targeting was introduced


              Inflation targeting was introduced into a benign  inflationary
              environment. Inflationary pressures were falling.  From  1992,
              the informal inflation target was between 1%  and  4%  and  in
              1994 and 1995 it was 2,5% or less. At the time, the market did
              not believe that the authorities would meet these targets.


              There was excess capacity in the market. Output volatility was
              decreasing together with inflation. There  was  a  history  of
              boom bust economic growth, which  had  stabilised  during  the
              1990s.


              Major structural reforms  of  the  British  economy  occurred,
              which facilitated the introduction of an  inflation  targeting
              regime. Some of these included the  decentralisation  of  wage
              negotiations and large-scale privatisation in the 1980s.
         4. UK Experience - current status


              The  MPC  has  been  relatively   successful   in   containing
              inflation. In fact, it has consistently undershot its  target.
              A consequence has been that the inflation target  has  "locked
              in" low inflation, with an overall diminution in volatility of
              inflation and output. The market (and the public) expects  low
              inflation to be maintained.


         5. Unforeseen consequences


              (a)  The  continuing  strength  of  the  Pound  has   directly
                  contributed to the inflation undershoot in  that  the  MPC
                  made its decisions based on the notion that  the  sterling
                  would  decline.  However,  it   did   not   decline.   The
                  consequence   was   that   the   inflation   target    was
                  continuously undershot. This  is  the  opposite  of  South
                  Africa, where it is continuously  overshot.  The  MPC  now
                  follows a more pragmatic approach and is less inclined  to
                  follow a pre-emptive strategy on the same scale.


              (b) Low inflation has led to low interest rates, which in have
                  led to a surge in consumer spending and  have  discouraged
                  saving. This has had  serious  consequences,  including  a
                  dramatic  rise  in  consumer  debt.  It  has  also,   very
                  importantly, led to a massive increase  in  house  prices,
                  which could potentially have serious consequences for  the
                  economy.


                  The impact of MPC policy has been to encourage  the  surge
                  in consumer spending, which  has  helped  to  off-set  the
                  deteriorating economic climate internationally.


         6. General comments by Deutsche Bank


              The  Bank  of  England  tends  to  ignore   food   prices   in
              inflationary trends, even though food prices are  included  in
              the index. They are  not  a  major  factor  in  deliberations,
              although they are not completely  excluded.  Food  is  a  much
              smaller proportion of the overall basket only 11%  as  opposed
              to 26% in SA.


              The Bank has to acknowledge the limits of inflation  targeting
              in emerging markets, where exchange rates  are  likely  to  be
              more volatile. Therefore, emerging markets often  have  a  far
              more difficult task because they are subject  to  far  greater
              pressures, and therefore they should not be hesitant to invoke
              the escape clause. This should not be interpreted as  reneging
              on the policy. The Bank  must  at  all  times  account  for  a
              deviation from the target, but the market needs to  know  that
              in adverse conditions the bank will stick to its target.


              Inflation targeting has its limitations, and the best  way  to
              deal with these is to  be  transparent.  When  the  target  is
              missed, it should  be  explained  that  the  target  has  been
              missed, why it was missed and how the situation will be  dealt
              with. It is important to recognise and  to  explain  that  the
              factors that may have caused the target to be missed, may  not
              occur again; it might be a singular occurrence.


     B.     Comments by Bank of England: Sir E  George,  Governor,  C  Bean,
         Executive  Director  and  Chief   Economist,   A   Haldene,   Head:
         International  Finance  Division,  A  Clark,  Executive   Director:
         Financial Stability (2 Oct)


         1. Inflation  targeting  has  been  the  most  successful  monetary
              policy so far, more successful than targeting the money supply
              or exchange rate.


         2. The Bank does not see any trade-off in  the  long  term  between
              growth and inflation because price stability  is  a  necessary
              condition for sustainable growth.


         3. It  is  most  important  to  differentiate  between  supply-side
              shocks (where their effect on inflation often depends  on  why
              they have changed) and demand-side shocks. The Bank of England
              follows  the  policy  of  demand  management  because  it   is
              operating on the demand-side and cannot  control  the  supply-
              side.


         4. The "open letter" can and probably should be used when there  is
              a supply-side shock (e.g. an oil price increase), but then the
              Bank should prevent the shock  from  leading  to  a  secondary
              round of inflation.


         5. There has been remarkable  stability  in  the  economy.  It  has
              involved a continual quest to right the imbalance between  the
              domestic economy and externally exposed factors.
         6. On the topic of the MPC, the Bank commented as follows:


              (a) It is very useful having non-Bank of  England  members  on
                  the Committee. It is a way of keeping the  Bank  in  touch
                  with other perspectives. They are all  expert  economists,
                  and are not representatives of industry or  trade  unions.
                  Each one of them brings fresh thoughts and each one  is  a
                  specialist in a particular area.


              (b) In order to have good non-Bank members, the country  needs
                  a sufficient pool of experts which is not  always  readily
                  available.


              (c) There is a good argument for having  these  members  serve
                  for a term longer than three years (as in the UK).


         7. On the question of whether a Central Bank should stick to  their
              target, no matter what, the Bank commented that  policy-makers
              do themselves a disservice by saying they will stick to a  set
              of policies that are not credible. It is  better  to  admit  a
              mistake as quickly as possible and make the necessary changes.
              This should be done with a lot of explanation. If there  is  a
              logical argument for it, it will be more credible.


         8. The Bank commented  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  for  the
              Chancellor to criticise the Governor  in  public.  This  would
              damage the credibility of the whole system.


     C.     Comments by Treasury - R Fellgett,  Director:  Financial  Sector
         (joined by R Woods, Head: Fiscal & Macroeconomic Policy &  A  Wren,
         Financial Stability Markets (4 Oct)
         1.  There  is  a  Treasury  representative   on   the   MPC.   This
              representative has no voting  power,  but  provides  input  on
              fiscal policy issues and provides feedback to the Treasury.


         2. If the Minister or the Chancellor disagreed with a  decision  of
              the Governor, there is no law to  prevent  the  Chancellor  or
              Minister from making it public, but it is hard to imagine that
              this would ever happen. It would affect the credibility of the
              whole system.


     D.     Bank of England's relationship  with  Parliament  -  comment  by
         Treasury Select Committee - House of Commons (7 Oct)


         1. The primary relationship of the Bank of England with  Parliament
              is with the Treasury Select Committee.


         2. The Bank of England produces  quarterly  inflation  reports  and
              appears before the above committee three times a year on these
              reports.


         3. Prior  to  these  meetings,  the  committee  consults  with  its
              specialist advisers on the contents of  the  latest  inflation
              report, so that they are fully prepared when the  MPC  appears
              before them.


         4. The Committee has seven specialist advisers. They are,  however,
              not full-time employees of the committee.


         5. Various members of the MPC appear  before  the  committee  on  a
              rotational basis. The reason they do  not  appear  before  the
              committee four times a year, is  that  in  the  third  quarter
              (August) it is recess and everyone is on leave.


         6. The select committee holds hearings on the  appointment  of  new
              members, even though they do not have any statutory  authority
              to do this.


     E.     Comments by Economic Affairs Committee  (House  of  Lords)  &  M
         Wickens, Specialist Adviser (7 Oct)


         1. The Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  with  his  chief  advisers,
              appears before the committee twice a year.


         2. The Governor of the Bank of  England  also  appears  before  the
              committee twice a year.


         3. There is no relationship between the two committees of  the  two
              Houses of Parliament.


         4. Their comment was that the debate between the committee and  the
              Governor is very robust. The committee is not at all  hesitant
              to  raise  any  issue,  but  will  not  get   into   technical
              discussions with the Governor. Technical questions  are  dealt
              with when the Deputy Governor appears before them.


         5. The Chancellor is under  no  obligation  to  appear  before  the
              committee, and may  refuse  to  do  so.  However,  this  would
              reflect badly on the Chancellor and diminish the status of the
              committee.


     F.     Recommendations
         1.  Membership  of  non-Reserve  Bank  representatives,   excluding
              Treasury officials, of the MPC should be considered.


         2. The invocation of the escape clause should not  be  seen  as  an
              abdication by the Reserve Bank of its commitment  to  maintain
              its target, but should be viewed  as  an  instrument  for  the
              Reserve Bank to  communicate,  in  a  transparent  way,  valid
              reasons why it has not met its target and how  it  intends  to
              get back to the target.


     II.    Single financial regulator


     A.     Introduction to changing trends in financial regulation


         A number of forces have driven change  in  the  regulation  of  the
         financial services industry  globally,  especially  changes  within
         the structure of the industry  itself,  as  well  as  instances  of
         serious  corporate  failures.  These  are  all  relevant  to  South
         Africa.


         Changes in the industry include the following:


         1. In the past, institutions within  a  particular  sector  of  the
              industry  used  to  provide  services   restricted   to   that
              particular sector. For example, banking services were provided
              by the banking sector and insurance services were provided  by
              the insurance sector. However, services and products  are  now
              being offered across sectors. Banks  are  providing  insurance
              schemes  and  insurance  companies   are   providing   banking
              services.


         2. There have also been a number of mergers, which means  that  big
              conglomerates now offer products and services across different
              sectors.
         3. Moreover, new products are developed that  often  have  features
              of a number  of  sectors  in  the  industry.  Regulators  were
              usually assigned to a sector or a number of sectors jointly.


         4. Other changes necessitating an overhaul in financial  regulation
              include  providers   crossing   geographic   boundaries,   the
              emergence  of  new  distribution  channels   (internet),   and
              consumers' demand for more "wholesale-like" products.


         Therefore, functional differences of the different  regulators  are
         becoming less distinct. With the breakdown of  sectoral  boundaries
         in the financial services industry, regulators now find that  their
         boundaries are no longer clearly defined, hence  the  move  towards
         transforming the regulatory structure  in  the  financial  services
         industry.


         Instances of corporate failure include the collapse  of  individual
         banks and investor protection failures, which have led to the  need
         to restore confidence in the integrity of the banking system  as  a
         whole. Others are investor protection failures (e.g. pensions  mis-
         selling in the U.K), periodic market instability and its impact  on
         industry players, and  a  political/public  desire  to  reform  the
         existing system.


         As a  result  of  these  trends  and  events,  there  has  been  an
         international trend to consolidate  regulatory  bodies.  Typically,
         financial  regulation   consists   of   two   aspects:   Prudential
         regulation,  which  seeks  to  ensure  the  health   of   financial
         institutions,  and  market  conduct  regulation,  which  seeks   to
         protect the consumer from unscrupulous practices. Different  models
         for reforming financial regulation have been adopted  in  different
         countries.


         For example:


         (a)     Scandinavia


              The Scandinavians were the first to  reform  their  regulatory
              system. They have a banking division,  an  insurance  division
              and an  investment/securities  division.  They  simply  put  a
              single roof over all three of  these.  This  was  not  a  true
              integration of regulatory functions.


         (b)     Australia


              Under  this  model,  the  prudential  and  conduct-of-business
              regulations are dealt with by two bodies instead of one.  They
              implemented the Twin Peaks model, which meant that  prudential
              and  conduct-of-business  (market-conduct)   regulation   were
              consolidated into two bodies, namely the Australian Prudential
              Regulatory Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities  and
              Investments Commission (ASIC).


              Australia conducted a full review of the regulatory  structure
              (the Wallis Enquiry) before making  any  legislative  changes.
              Its Central Bank maintains responsibility for monetary  policy
              and overall financial system stability.


         (c)     UK: Discussed in more  detail  below  -  "C.  Structure  of
              FSA").


         In the UK and Germany, all  regulators  were  consolidated  into  a
         single   body   organised   along    functional    lines,    namely
         authorisation/licensing, setting standards for  firms,  supervision
         and enforcement. There  is  a  completely  separate  ombudsman  for
         receiving complaints.


         The regulator  is  responsible  for  both  prudential  and  market-
         conduct  regulation,  as  well  as  for  policy   development   and
         execution.


         A  report  on  reform  of  the  financial  regulatory  system   was
         commissioned by the Chancellor before these changes were made.


         There was a 9-way  (later  10-way)  merger  of  existing  financial
         regulators to create a new single integrated  financial  regulator,
         the FSA.


     B.     History of establishment of FSA


         The scandal that occurred in the UK associated  with  the  collapse
         of Barings Bank gave impetus to the programme  of  overhauling  the
         regulatory regime  there.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the
         problem in Barings Bank  occurred  within  the  securities  trading
         section, that part of the business that was not supervised  by  the
         Bank of England. This highlighted a  serious  regulatory  gap,  and
         there was recognition of the need to improve financial oversight.


         When the Labour Government came to power  in  1997,  it  instituted
         steps  for  transformation  of  the  regulatory   framework.   This
         transformation was based on a report received by the Chancellor.


         Prudential supervision of the banking system was removed  from  the
         Bank  of  England  and  transferred  to  the  FSA.  Likewise,   the
         functions of other regulators in the  financial  services  industry
         were also transferred to the  FSA,  which  became  responsible  for
         both  market  conduct  and  prudential  supervision.  The  Bank  of
         England was granted independence  to  set  interest  rates  in  May
         1997.


         A memorandum of understanding between the  Treasury,  the  Bank  of
         England and the FSA was drawn up in October 1997. It  set  out  the
         role of each institution and explained how they would work  towards
         a  common  objective  of  financial  stability.  The  division   of
         responsibility  is  based  on  four   guiding   principles:   Clear
         accountability, transparency, no duplication and  regular  exchange
         of information.


         The Bank  retains  responsibility  for  overall  stability  of  the
         financial system as a whole. To this end, it  publishes  a  regular
         Financial Stability Report. The report strives to make  the  Bank's
         activities as  transparent  as  possible.  Both  the  FSA  and  the
         Treasury provide input into the report.


         The  FSA  is  responsible   for   prudential   and   market-conduct
         regulation of financial institutions. The Treasury  is  responsible
         for the overall  institutional  structure  of  regulation  and  the
         legislation that governs it. It has no  operational  responsibility
         for the activities of the FSA and the Bank, but  will  need  to  be
         alerted, should serious problems arise.
         A standing committee of representatives of the  three  institutions
         meets  on  a  monthly  basis  to  discuss   individual   cases   of
         significance  and  other   developments   relative   to   financial
         stability.  This  committee  brings  together  all  the   different
         perspectives. The FSA brings expertise as supervisor, the  Bank  of
         England brings expertise  of  oversight  of  the  markets  and  the
         Treasury brings expertise of the economy as a whole.


         There are also bilateral agreements (arising  from  the  tripartite
         agreement), between the Bank of England and the FSA to provide  for
         the sharing of information and the cross-secondment of people.  The
         FSA has more information on specific firms than the Bank,  but  the
         Bank has broader market information.


         Legislation  providing  for  the  establishment  of  the  FSA   was
         processed through lengthy discussion in Parliament.
         On 1 December 2001 the FSA assumed its powers and  responsibilities
         under the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2000. The FSA is  now
         the single statutory regulator responsible for  the  regulation  of
         deposit-taking, insurance and investment business.


     C.     Structure and functioning of FSA


         The FSA  is  a  public  body,  set  up  by  legislation  (Financial
         Services and Markets Act). It is  a  private  company,  limited  by
         guarantee.


         It has very wide-ranging regulatory powers. It  is  governed  by  a
         board of directors (appointed by the  Treasury)  consisting  of  15
         members, four of whom are executive directors and 11  of  whom  are
         non-executive members.


         It is  entirely  funded  by  levies  from  the  financial  services
         industry  and  receives  no  money  from  the  government.  It   is
         operationally  independent  of   the   government   and   currently
         regulates approximately 11 000 firms.


         1. The FSA's statutory objectives are:


              *   Maintaining confidence in the financial system  (Note:  It
                  is not the maintenance of financial stability)


              *   Promoting public understanding of the financial system


              *    Securing  the  appropriate  degree  of   protection   for
                  consumers


              *   Reducing the risks of financial crime.


         2. The legislation also sets out  guidelines  with  regard  to  the
              principles of good regulation:
              *   Using its resources in the most economic and efficient way
                  (the non-executive committee of the board has  to  oversee
                  this and report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer)


              *   Recognising the responsibilities of regulated  firms'  own
                  management (there was initially a fear that the FSA  would
                  interfere in the running of firms)


              *   Being proportionate in imposing burdens or restrictions on
                  the industry (regulation  must  be  proportionate  to  the
                  risk)


              *   Facilitating innovation


              *    Taking  into  account  the  international  character   of
                  financial services and the UK's competitive position
              *   Facilitating, and  not  having  an  unnecessarily  adverse
                  effect on competition.


         3. Accountability of FSA:


              The Financial Services and Markets Act clearly  sets  out  all
              the objectives, as well as the general duties of the  FSA.  It
              states that the FSA must produce an  annual  report  and  must
              specifically report on achievement of  their  objectives.  The
              annual report must also include a report by the  non-executive
              directors  of  the  board  with  regard  to  the  economy  and
              efficiency of the FSA.


              The Treasury select committee  exercises  oversight  over  the
              FSA, and they have the power to summons  witnesses,  call  for
              evidence and write reports. The FSA currently  appears  before
              the committee at least twice a year. One meeting is to look at
              the annual report (looking back) and  one  to  look  at  their
              future plans  (looking  forward).  The  Chairman  of  the  FSA
              attends  these  meetings  and  the  committee  publishes   the
              evidence in a report.


              The FSA makes it their business to be in touch  with  MPs  and
              holds regular briefings with  them.  It  also  goes  to  party
              conferences. They receive about 40 MP letters a week,  dealing
              with constituency business. In their view, their  relationship
              with Parliament is constructive and good.


              The Treasury has the power to commission an independent review
              if there is a failure of the system of regulation. It can also
              commission an audit on the FSA.


              An open meeting is held once a year in order  to  discuss  the
              annual report, and this meeting is  open  to  the  public.  An
              independent complaints  commissioner  investigates  complaints
              against the FSA, and can publish a report and require the  FSA
              to  respond.  It  can  also  recommend  that   the   FSA   pay
              compensation.


              Legislation requires the  FSA  to  consult  in  public  before
              making any rules. It must consult two  statutory  panels,  the
              practitioner panel and the consumer panel.


              Legislation also provides that a  cost-benefit  analysis  must
              always be done before any rule is adopted and that a statement
              of purpose must accompany a new rule.


              All the  FSA's  rules  and  regulations  are  subject  to  the
              oversight of the Competition Board. If rules  are  restricting
              competition  unnecessarily,  they  can  be  deferred  to   the
              Competition Board, which can overrule.


              Individual cases can be challenged in a  specialist  tribunal,
              which is part of the court system. However, this is  a  public
              forum and has therefore not been used in  practice.  It  does,
              however, help to encourage  discussion  between  the  FSA  and
              those they regulate.


     D.     Specific comments on FSA


         1. Comments by Bank of England


              It is possibly too early to  assess  the  Bank's  relationship
              with the FSA, as it had only started operating  in  1997,  and
              officially only in December 2001. The Bank is of  the  opinion
              that  the  relationship  has  worked  well.  This  is  largely
              attributable  to  the  fact  that  there  are  many   personal
              linkages, because people moved  from  the  Bank  to  the  FSA.
              However, the Bank is aware that these personal  linkages  will
              eventually erode. There have been attempts to institutionalise
              the relationship by cross-secondments.


              The  Bank  recognises  the  importance  of  maintaining   good
              relationships between both institutions. Crucial  to  this  is
              the continuing exchange of relevant  information.  This  takes
              place on several levels.  The  Bank's  Deputy  Governor  is  a
              member of the FSA Board and the FSA chairman sits on the Court
              of Directors of the Bank of England. At all  levels  there  is
              close and regular  contact  between  the  Bank  and  the  FSA.
              Information is shared, which is or  may  be  relevant  to  the
              discharge of their respective responsibilities.


              One of the issues raised  by  the  Bank,  is  that  the  FSA's
              reporting responsibilities are defined in detail in  the  Bank
              of England Act, 1998, but the Bank's responsibilities are  not
              as clearly defined. Therefore, it is  not  always  clear  what
              information should be passed on, and this becomes a matter  of
              interpretation. Difficulties have been experienced  in  giving
              legislative definition to the financial stability role of  the
              Bank. Its monetary policy role is more easily defined.  It  is
              therefore  difficult  to  determine  whether  something  falls
              within the Bank's responsibilities. However, the Bank has  not
              experienced problems in obtaining information as and when they
              require it.


              The removal of bank supervision from the Bank of  England  has
              required considerable  adaptation  by  the  Bank,  given  that
              amongst other functions it is responsible for maintaining  the
              infrastructure for bank payment  systems,  both  at  home  and
              abroad, in its capacity as the banker's Bank.


              The Bank was of the view that an  important  consideration  in
              determining whether to adopt the FSA model, is  whether  there
              are sufficient resources and people with the necessary  skills
              to staff both institutions.  Employment  in  either  of  these
              institutions should  offer  the  same  career  advantages  and
              prestige as the other.


         2. Comments by Ernst  &  Young  UK  Financial  Services  Regulatory
              Practice


              Ernst & Young pointed out that there are a number of different
              models of financial  regulation.  In  their  opinion,  a  good
              alternative to the UK model of a single regulator is the  Twin
              Peaks model (Australian and Dutch model).  Under  this  model,
              the prudential and conduct-of-business regulations  are  dealt
              with by two bodies instead of one.


              However, they noted that a central bank may not be comfortable
              with relinquishing  the  role  of  prudential  supervision  in
              instances  where  it  retains   responsibility   for   overall
              stability of the financial system as a whole, because  it  may
              not  get  the  necessary  information  from   the   prudential
              regulator in order for it to perform its  financial  stability
              role. The regulator has the best source of micro  information,
              but  the  central  bank  has  the  best   source   of   market
              information.


              Ernst &  Young  were  of  the  view  that  it  is  easier  for
              Parliament to address the accountability of the  regulator  if
              it is split into two. The  two  bodies  have  more  manageable
              objectives and it is therefore easier to  exercise  oversight.
              In deciding what model to  adopt,  it  is  thus  important  to
              decide what degree of oversight one wants  to  have  over  the
              regulator. If the two functions are together, as they  are  in
              the FSA, it is more powerful than if they were separated.


              On the other hand, the existence of two regulatory bodies with
              limited   accountability,   instead   of   one    with    full
              accountability, could also present a weakness. There  will  be
              an  area  dealing  with  systems  and  controls   and   senior
              management responsibilities, where it  will  be  difficult  to
              determine who is responsible and  accountable  for  regulating
              that area.


              They  noted  that   when   the   FSA   was   first   proposed,
              accountability was a very important concern, and it took  four
              years to draft the necessary statute.


              In the UK, oversight of both the MPC and the FSA is  exercised
              by the Treasury select committee, which  hires  economists  to
              advise it.


              With regard to how well the relationship between the FSA,  the
              Bank of England and the Treasury is  maintained  and  managed,
              Ernst & Young referred to the tripartite  standing  committee,
              where monthly meetings are held between them.


              They stated that policy in a macro-economic crisis would be co-
              coordinated between these three bodies, and the way in which a
              systemic  crisis  would  be  dealt  with,  would  largely   be
              determined by how well these individuals work together.


              They stressed that it is very helpful that most of the  people
              now working for the FSA had originally worked for the Bank  of
              England. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the FSA, is the former
              Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.


         3. Treasury comments


              The Treasury felt  that  a  single  regulator  was  necessary,
              because there has been  a  great  degree  of  convergence  and
              overlapping of services offered  by  insurance  companies  and
              banks,  which   led   to   artificial   distinctions   between
              regulators.


              They went on to say that there is a good reason for separating
              banking supervision from monetary policy. There is a potential
              conflict of interest between the conduct  of  monetary  policy
              and banking supervision. They felt that, on occasion, monetary
              policy is conducted with too great an emphasis on the  banking
              sector, when it should be conducted with the  overall  economy
              in mind.


              With regard to their relationship with the  Bank  of  England,
              they said that the development of the  standing  committee  on
              financial  stability  has  made   the   relationship   between
              themselves and the Bank closer and less formal in  respect  of
              financial stability.


              They felt it was very helpful that the standing  committee  on
              financial stability may also set up subcommittees  on  special
              issues that need to be dealt with.


              In  the  Treasury's  opinion,  the  existence  of  a  standing
              committee has  worked  well  in  policy  terms.  However,  the
              administrative arrangements to  separate  banking  supervision
              from monetary policy are not yet satisfactory.  They  stressed
              that cross-membership on the boards of the FSA  and  the  Bank
              are crucial. In terms of  accountability,  the  memorandum  of
              understanding is a key element, but it has not yet been tested
              in a crisis.


         4. McKinsey comments


              (a) Objective


                  In McKinsey's view, determining the objective of having  a
                  single  regulatory  authority  is  very   important.   One
                  possible  objective  is  to  enhance  the  soundness   and
                  stability of the financial  system;  another  may  be  the
                  integration  of  a   number   of   regulators   into   one
                  institution reflecting  the  trend  towards  consolidation
                  within the financial services sector.


                  The objective one  chooses,  will  determine  the  process
                  that will  be  followed.  An  emphasis  on  the  financial
                  stability objective presupposes a more thorough review  of
                  the regulatory system and its  structure  and  how  a  new
                  regulator would need to operate and be organised in  order
                  to achieve financial stability. An emphasis  on  the  mere
                  consolidation of regulators would simply  be  an  exercise
                  in institutional integration. This debate has  yet  to  be
                  resolved in South Africa.


              (b) Level of stability


                  In their view, it is important to  determine  what  degree
                  of stability one  is  aiming  for  in  creating  a  single
                  regulator.


                  A zero level of failure of financial institutions  is  not
                  practical, possible  or  desirable.  It  would  be  highly
                  inefficient  to  obtain  such  a  level,   as   too   many
                  regulators would be  required.  Also,  the  consumer  must
                  assume a certain amount of  responsibility  for  investing
                  prudently. It cannot be expected of, nor is  it  practical
                  for a regulator to fully protect  a  consumer  from  risk.
                  Instead,  it  is  desirable   to   encourage   people   to
                  thoroughly check  out  institutions  for  themselves,  and
                  thus cause bad institutions to fail.


                  Since regulation does not protect against  every  failure,
                  the  regulator  must  adopt  a  risk-based   approach   to
                  supervision of firms. There are  a  number  of  regulatory
                  approaches  to  choose  from,  ranging  from  a  resource-
                  intensive  approach,  where  supervisory  activities   are
                  determined through detailed risk assessments of firms,  to
                  "remote monitoring", which involves desk-based  review  of
                  financial  information  and  other  regulatory   data   to
                  identify key risks in groups of similar firms.


              (c) Managing transition process


                  Aside from  the  need  to  set  clear  objectives  on  the
                  formation of a single regulator, the question of  how  the
                  various regulators are  merged,  is  also  something  that
                  needs  to  be  debated  extensively.  There  needs  to  be
                  management  of  continuity  as  well  as   management   of
                  (foreseeable) external events  which  will  coincide  with
                  the transition.


                  The transition to a single regulator is  usually  a  four-
                  year to five-year process. In the  UK,  the  process  took
                  from  mid-1997  until  late   2001   to   complete.   They
                  consolidated all  the  role-players  in  one  institution.
                  Only after that was the legal framework put into place.


                  In Australia  they  did  it  the  other  way  around.  The
                  establishment of the institution was preceded  by  a  full
                  strategic review,  called  the  Wallis  Enquiry.  However,
                  this did not assist in shortening the time involved.  They
                  had the Wallis Enquiry, which was a full strategy  review;
                  however, this did not really  help  to  shorten  the  time
                  involved in setting up the single regulator. It also  took
                  more than four years to implement.


         5. Recommendation


              A  decision  to  reform  the  system  of  a  single  financial
              regulator should be preceded by a  thorough  strategic  review
              involving all role-players across all  government  departments
              and relevant institutions.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 1 December 2003, from the Minister of  Public  Enterprises
     to the Speaker of the National Assembly, in terms of  section  65(2)(a)
     of the Public  Finance  Management  Act,  1999  (Act  No  1  of  1999),
     explaining the delay in the tabling of the Annual Report of DENEL (Pty)
     Ltd for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam Speaker,
         TABLING OF ANNUAL REPORT OF DENEL (PTY) LTD 2002/2003  by  MR  J  T
         RADEBE, MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES


         In terms of section 65(1) of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
         1999 I, as the Executive Authority for  the  public  entity,  Denel
         (Pty) Ltd. should have tabled Denel's annual report  and  financial
         statements in the National Assembly within  six  months  after  the
         end of the financial year, which ended  31  March  2003.  The  last
         date for tabling  in  the  National  Assembly  was,  therefore,  30
         September 2003.


         In line with Government's objective to  improve  and  increase  its
         oversight role in respect of State Owned  Enterprises,  the  annual
         financial statements of Denel and  other  public  entities  require
         intensive analysis and interaction between all the  relevant  role-
         players  before  being  released  publicly  at  an  Annual  General
         Meeting for the entity.  Taking  into  account  the  notice  period
         requirements and the availability of  the  necessary  role-players,
         the analysis of these financial statements and the publication  and
         release of Denel's annual report  at  a  properly  convened  Annual
         General Meeting could not be finalised timeously to  enable  me  to
         table the relevant documents within the required six  month  period
         in the National Assembly.


         This written explanation is submitted in terms of Section 65(2)  of
         the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, setting  out  the  reasons
         for the delay.


         Please accept my sincere apology for the delay.


         Yours sincerely,




         Signed
         J T RADEBE, MP
         MINISTER OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

1.    The Speaker:


     (a)    The President of the Republic  submitted  the  following  letter

         informing Members of the National Assembly  of  the  employment  of
         the South African National Defence Force:


         EMPLOYMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE IN HAITI  IN
         FULFILLMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THE UNITED NATIONS


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that on the 4th day  of
         December Two Thousand and Three, I  authorised  the  employment  of
         the South African  National  Defence  Force  (SANDF)  personnel  to
         assist the Government of Haiti in celebrating two hundred years  of
         its independence and victory in the  struggle  against  slavery  in
         the Americas.


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions

         1996)], read with Section 201(2)(c) of  the  said  Constitution  of
         1996, in assisting the Government of Haiti in  fulfillment  of  the
         international obligations of the Republic of South  Africa  towards
         the United Nations, in terms of Section 227(1)(b) and  (c)  of  the
         Constitution of 1993, (which section is  also  still  in  force  by
         virtue of the  aforementioned  Item  24)  and  Section  18(1)  read
         together with Sections 11, 52 and 53 of the Defence Act, 2002  (Act
         No 42 of 2002).


         A total of 139 personnel will be employed comprised as follows:
         120 Navy Members;
         9 SAAF Members;
         7 SAMHS Members; and
         3 CJ Ops

         1 Combat Support Ship (SAS Drakensberg);
         1 Harbour Patrol Boat; and
         1 Oryx Helicopter.

         Dear Madam Speaker

         In terms of Section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management  Act,
         1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), I  wish  to  inform  the  House  that  the
         following Annual Reports were tabled late due to printing,  editing
         and logistical reasons:


         1. The South African Quality Institute
         2. Competition Tribunal
         3. Nstika Enterprises Promotion Agency
         4. Support Programme for Industrial Innovation (SPII)
         5. Board of Tariffs and Trade
         6. Khula Enterprises Finance Ltd
         7. Companies and Intellectual Property Registration Office (CIPRO)
         8. Technology for Women in Business
         9. Proudly South African Annual Report
         10.     The Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa
         11.     National Empowerment Fund
         12.     Trade and Investment South Africa

         the House and reports numbered 11  to  15  will  be  tabled  by  12
         December 2003. The Estate Agents Board Annual Report  will  not  be
         tabled this year as I have requested the DTI  to  review  the  said
         report. I will table the said report early  next  year.  The  DTI'S
         intention was to do a consolidated  exercise  to  ensure  that  all
         reports are  tabled  by  the  end  of  this  session,  I  therefore
         apologise for the late submission of this letter.

     (c)    Letter from the Minister of Finance to the National Assembly, in
         terms of section 65(2)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
         1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the delay  in  the  tabling  of
         the Annual Report of the Public Investment Commissioners for  2002-
         2003:


         In terms of Section 65(1)(a) of the Public Finance  Management  Act
         the executive authority responsible  for  a  department  or  public
         entity  must  table  in  the  National  Assembly  or  a  Provincial
         Legislature,  as  may  be  appropriate,  the  Annual   Report   and
         Financial Statements referred to in section  40(1)(d)  or  55(1)(d)
         and the Audit Report on those statements, within  one  month  after
         the  accounting  officer  for  the  Department  or  the  Accounting
         Authority for the Public entity received the Audit report.


         We advise that  the  Public  Investment  Commissioners  (PIC)  were
         unable to submit the Annual Report  and  Financial  Statements  and
         Audit Report referred to in section 55(1)(b) on or  before  the  31
         August 2003 due to the reasons set out hereunder.


         The  Annual  Financial  statements   of   the   Public   Investment
         Commissioners were completed  and  approved  by  the  Board  on  28
         August 2003.


         An amended Audit Report by the Auditor-General was  signed  on  the
         26 September 2003 and submitted to  the  PIC.  Thereafter  the  PIC
         submitted the complete draft Annual  Report,  Financial  Statements
         and  Audit  Report  to  the  Auditor-General  and   each   of   the
         Commissioners for their comments.


         The  Auditor-General  has  requested  minor  adjustments  and   the
         comments from the Commissioners have been included  in  the  Annual
         Report. The Annual Report was tabled in Parliament on  27  November
         2003.


     (d)    Letter dated 9 December 2003, from the Minister  of  Finance  to
         the Speaker of the National Assembly:


     Scan in Document


     (e)    Letter dated 2 November 2003, from the Minister for  the  Public
         Service  and  Administration  to  the  Speaker  of   the   National
         Assembly, in terms  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of  1999),  explaining  the  further
         delay in the  tabling  of  the  Annual  Report  for  South  African
         Management Development Institute (SAMDI) for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         SAMDI's Annual Report


         My previous letter dated and signed 29 September 2003 refers.


         1. In terms of section 65(1) of the Public Finance  Management  Act
              of 1999, I must table in  the  National  Assembly  the  annual
              report and financial statements and the audit report on  those
              statements, within one month after the accounting officer  for
              the department received the audit reports.


         2. In terms of section 40(1)(c) of the PFMA the accounting  officer
              for a  department  must  submit  annual  financial  statements
              within two months after the end of the financial year  to  the
              Auditor-General for auditing (i.e. 31 May of each year).


              SAMDI was only able to submit the  mentioned  statements  for
              2002/03  on  12  August  2003  due  to  capacity  and   system
              challenges. These statements however needed to be  changed  as
              required by the Office of the  Auditor-General  and  was  only
              ready for resubmission on 17 September 2003.


         3. With regard to paragraph 3 of my previous letter  (dd  29/09/03)
              apparently SAMDI  was  misinformed,  and  only  after  further
              deliberations it became obvious that the  Auditor-General  did
              in fact not cause the delay in the audit as indicated.
         4. The process of finalising the audit furthermore took longer  tha
              anticipated and the accounting officer of SAMDI only  received
              the audit reports on 17 November 2003. SAMDI is therefore  not
              currently in a position to submit their Annual  Report  on  30
              November 2003 as was requested in the aforementioned letter.


         5. The draft annual report will be ready for  layout  and  printing
              early in December 2003. Due to  the  fact  that  the  printers
              close for the festive season early in December 2003  and  only
              re-open on 14  January  2004,  I  hereby  ask  for  a  further
              extension to table the printed Annual Report of  SAMDI  on  31
              January 2004.

     (f)    Letter dated  5  December  2003,  from  the  Minister  of  Arts,
         Culture, Science and Technology to  the  Speaker  of  the  National
         Assembly, in terms  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the  delay  in
         the tabling of the Annual Report of the Arts, Culture and  Heritage
         Institutions:


         Dear Dr Ginwala


         EXPLANATION FOR THE LATE TABLING  OF  ARTS,  CULTURE  AND  HERITAGE
         INSTITUTIONS' ANNUAL REPORTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH  SECTIONS  65(2)(a)
         OF THE PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT ACT, NO 1 OF 1999


         In terms of section 65(1)(a) of the above-mentioned Act the  annual
         reports and financial statements, and the audit  reports  on  those
         statements, of the Arts, Culture and Heritage  institutions  listed
         below were tabled late or have not been tabled.


         The following are reasons  for  late  tabling  of  reports  or  for
         reports which have not yet been submitted:


         1. The Reports of the War Museum of the Boer  Republics  were  only
              tabled on 9 October 2003 due to logistical problems.


         2. The Reports  of  the  National  Museum  Bloemfontein  were  only
              tabled on 22 October 2003 due to logistical problems.


         3. The Reports of the National English Literary  Museum  were  only
              tabled on 17 October 2003 due to logistical problems.


         4. The  South  African  Heritage  Resources  Agency  submitted  its
              Annual Report, Audit Report and Financial  Statements  to  the
              Department on 2 October 2003 due to logistical  problems.  Due
              to an administrative error these were not tabled. Tabling will
              take place in the next Parliamentary session.


         5. The Nelson Mandela Museum has to date not submitted  its  Annual
              Report,  Audit  Report  and  Financial   Statements   to   the
              Department for tabling. This is  due  to  the  fact  that  the
              Financial Statements, Annual Report and Audit report  has  not
              been finalised. Once finalised, tabling will take place in the
              next Parliamentary session.


         6. The Northern Flagship Institution has to date not submitted  its
              Annual Report, Audit Report and Financial  Statements  to  the
              Department for tabling. This is  due  to  the  fact  that  the
              Financial Statements, Annual Report and Audit report  has  not
              been finalised. Once finalised, tabling will take place in the
              next Parliamentary session.


         7. The Windybrow Centre for the Arts has to date not submitted  its
              Annual Report and Financial Statements to the  Department  for
              tabling.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that   the   Financial
              Statements, Annual  Report  and  Audit  report  has  not  been
              finalised. Once finalised, tabling will take place in the next
              Parliamentary session.


         8. The Market Theatre has to date not submitted its Annual  Report,
              Audit Report and Financial statements to  the  Department  for
              tabling.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that   the   Financial
              Statements, Annual  Report  and  Audit  report  has  not  been
              finalised. Once finalised, tabling will take place in the next
              Parliamentary session.

         This serves to inform the National Assembly that on the 11h day  of

         illegal fishing vessel in international waters.


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of Section 82(4)(b)(ii) of the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of
         South Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of 1993), [which  Sections  continue

         terms of Section 227(1)(b) and (c) of  the  Constitution  of  1993,

         aforementioned Item  24)  and  Section  18(1)  read  together  with
         Sections 11, 52 and 53 of the Defence  Act,  2002  (Act  No  42  of
         2002).

         The equipment provided by the SANDF is as follows:
         1 Combat Support Ship (SAS Drakensberg); and
         1 Oryx Helicopter.


         The cost for the deployment of personnel on the operation  is  R350
         000 at the expense of the Australian Government.


         The duration of  the  operation  is  five  days,  however,  it  was
         appreciated that the duration would include  the  time  from  which
         the planning of the operation commenced in August 2003 to the  time
         of completion of the operation.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National

National Assembly

1.    The Speaker


     On 25 November 2003, the National Assembly adopted the  Report  of  the
     Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests concerning a complaint
     against Mr M A Maziya regarding non-disclosure  of  income.  The  House
     thereby requested the Speaker to issue a written reprimand to Mr Maziya
     in this regard. The decision of the House has been implemented  by  way
     of the following written communication to Mr Maziya:


         19 January 2004


         Dear Mr Maziya


         BREACH OF PARLIAMENT'S CODE OF CONDUCT


         The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members'  Interests  reported  to
         the National Assembly on 19 November  on  its  investigation  of  a
         complaint  concerning  alleged  non-disclosure  of   interests   by
         yourself in the Register of Members' Interests.


         The  National  Assembly  adopted   the   Committee's   report   and
         recommendations on 25 November.


         The Committee found  firstly  that  you  only  partially  disclosed
         details of your shareholdings and, secondly,  that  you  failed  to
         disclose certain payments you received by way of income  from  such
         interests.  The  Committee  accordingly  recommended  that  you  be
         cautioned in respect of the first finding  and  be  issued  with  a
         written reprimand in respect of the second.


         As public representatives, members have  through  the  Register  of
         Members'   Interests   committed   themselves   to   constitutional
         principles  of  good   governance   and   accountability   to   the
         electorate. You will therefore realise, I am sure,  the  importance
         of  full  disclosure  of  all  your  financial  interests  in   the
         Register. A partial disclosure fails to give meaningful  effect  to
         our commitment as members. I trust that your  full  compliance  can
         be relied on in future.


         Your complete failure to disclose  payments  you  received  from  a
         company by way of income indicates  a  wilful  non-compliance  with
         the Code which is unacceptable as it  undermines  public  trust  in
         Parliament as a democratic  institution  and  calls  into  question
         members'  commitment  to  being  held  accountable.  This   blatant
         disregard of the Code is inexcusable and,  by  instruction  of  the
         Assembly,  I  hereby  reprimand  you  for  your  non-disclosure  of
         income.


         This letter will  in  due  course  be  published  in  the  document
         "Announcements,  Tablings  and  Committee  Reports"   for   general
         information.


         Yours sincerely


         FRENE GINWALA, MP

2.    The Speaker


     The following Bill has, in terms of Rule 274(1)(a), been placed on  the

     The President of the Republic submitted the following letter  dated  21

     of the National  Assembly  of  the  employment  of  the  South  African
     National Defence Force:


         EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE   FORCE   IN
         COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA IN ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE  REPUBLIC  OF  IRAN
         IN A SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that I  authorised  the

         earthquake in the province of Bam.


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of  section  82(4)(b)(ii)  read  with  section  227(1)(d)  of   the
         Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No  200  of

         The total estimated cost for two return flights is R2 724 241.  The
         final cost may fluctuate due to  weather  conditions  and  possible
         diversions. The Department of Foreign Affairs  if  responsible  for
         the costs of this Deployment.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National
         Council of Provinces, and  wish  to  request  that  you  bring  the
         contents of this report to the notice of the National Assembly.
