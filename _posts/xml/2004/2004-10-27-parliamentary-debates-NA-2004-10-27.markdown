                              NOTICES OF MOTION


Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chair, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move:

  That the House-


     1) discusses the United Nations proclamation of 2002 that declared
        2004 as the International Year to Commemorate the Struggle Against
        Slavery and its Abolition.


[Applause.]
Mr G R MORGAN: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:


  That the House-


     1) notes that the people of Pondoland urgently require developments
        that will reduce poverty and that the significant developments
        currently being considered in Pondoland in regard to the N2 toll
        road and dune mining have major environmental implications;


     2) recognises that consultation with the people of Pondoland regarding
        these developments has been insufficient; and

     3) therefore resolves to debate the various issues surrounding these
        developments in Pondoland.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of this
House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:

  That the House-


     1) debates whether or not the right message is going out in terms of
        the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy;
     2) reminds itself that in view of warnings from doctors that condoms
        regularly fail and do not provide full protection against pregnancy
        or disease;


3) recognises that family medicine experts in the latest edition of South
   African Family Practice, the official journal of the South African
   Academy of Family Practice and Primary Care, pointed out that even if
   male condoms are correctly used, the contraceptive failure rate is
   relatively high; and

     4) notes that referring to research on contraceptive failure published
        in the South African Medical Journal last year, authors said that
        the survey showed that 17% of contraceptive failures were among
        people whose partners used the male condom.


              ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN


                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the House -

     1) notes that –


        (a) each day articles about violence against women and children
             appear in our newspapers and although Parliament and the
             public have worked hard at stopping such violence we need to
             do more;


        (b) it brings tears to one's eyes when reading of the little four-
             year-old Pretoria girl who was raped and indecently assaulted
             by her mother, granddad, uncle, domestic worker, a prostitute
             and another man and one asks: How sick is this world?;


        (c) Nono Meriet Nhlapo was stabbed and beaten for more than five
              hours by her jealous boyfriend in the East Rand and poor
              Selija Julia Thabethe, may she rest in peace, who was stabbed
              eighteen times and disembowelled by her lover; and


          d) there are sick horrors that continue to destroy the fabric of
             society, violate our Constitution and destroy our people; and


    2)      calls on all South Africa to put an end to this violence against
        women and children and show that barbarism is unacceptable and will
        not be tolerated.
Agreed to.


                        WATER SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Thank you very much,
Chairperson. Colleagues and hon members, the primary function of the Water
Services Act of 1997 is to provide water services to other water services
institutions, mainly municipalities, in their service areas. “Service area”
in this case is understood to mean a service area within the borders of our
country.

The water boards, being creations of the Water Services Act of 1997, can
only do what the Act permits them to do; hence it is necessary for
Parliament to amend this Act. The amendment will create an enabling
environment for the water boards to operate outside the borders of our
country.

The reality we face today, in a world where globalisation has touched every
continent and country, is the need to use our own competitive advantage
wherever we can. However, most importantly, the Nepad programme becomes
instructive for all of us on the continent to work towards a better Africa
and a better world. We are, therefore, challenged to share with the rest of
the continent the knowledge and skills available in our country.

Our legislative framework and the way we have been able to deliver water to
all citizens efficiently in a short space of 10 years are recognised the
world over. The water boards have been significant in contributing to this
very positive image. Some of our water boards are recognised leaders in
their fields; and at times they are approached by other bodies and
institutions to assist with water-supply activities in other countries.
This type of international recognition is a feather in the cap for these
boards. Indeed, this recognition should make us hold our heads up proudly.

In bringing the Water Services Amendment Bill before you, we are asking
this House to recognise that South Africa has world-class public
institutions in our water boards that have been approached by international
organisations, such as the African Development Bank and others, to assist
in devising and advising on programmes for basic water services.

Today we are asking the House to pass the amendment to the Water Services
Act to allow our water boards to provide these services, as indicated,
outside South Africa. However, I want to emphasise that we are allowing the
water boards to operate across the borders for various reasons. The first
reason is that some of the water boards have accumulated expertise and
experience over time - some of them are as old as 100 years and some as old
as 50 years – which they have certainly accumulated through the taxpayer’s
money, as they are public entities.

Since the formalisation of the sphere of local government and the creation
of wall-to-wall municipalities, the functions of the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry have changed from that of service delivery to that of
policy and regulation formulation, making us the leader in the water
sector. I hope that my colleagues are listening very attentively, so that
they realise that we don’t have the budget to deliver, as the budget is
with the municipalities.

The legal framework goes on to give powers to municipalities, as service
authorities, to appoint their preferred service providers. As a Minister
with powers given by the Water Services Act to establish water boards with
the purpose of providing water services to other institutions, mainly the
municipalities, this new situation clearly challenges me and the department
to find a strategic function for the water boards. Hence, it has become
necessary to open up these opportunities so that they can expand to other
areas in terms of their operations.

We want to make the point that in creating this enabling environment for
our water boards, we are conscious that all this needs to happen within a
specific regulatory framework and that we have to ensure that the
initiative does not only benefit the water boards. In other words, this
initiative isn’t only for water boards to make profits, as water boards
will have to plough back through the process of building sustainable
communities for future generations. Hence, the Bill provides for two phases
in the process of legalising this initiative.

During the first phase, four Ministers, namely the Minister of Water
Affairs and Forestry, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Public
Enterprises and the Minister of Trade and Industry, determine the limits
within which a water board’s intended operation abroad may be authorised.
These limits include, firstly, that the activities should be permissible;
secondly, that the activities are undertaken with permissible countries,
and thirdly, that the amount of capital involved should be permissible.

It is important to mention that during the first phase each of the four
Ministers has the right to veto a proposal, and during the second phase
each of the two Ministers has the right to veto. I think this process will
ensure that any venture abroad by a water board will be subject to close
scrutiny and ring-fencing in order to protect the South African consumer,
who is supplied by a particular water board, from being detrimentally
affected by the board’s international ventures.

The second phase is the actual consideration of a water board’s application
to operate abroad. This is done in consultation with the Minister of
Finance.

I now put this amendment for your approval, hon members. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members, I rise on behalf of
the ANC in support of the Water Services Amendment Bill before us today. As
the Minister said, this Bill will, on approval of this House, enable the
water boards in South Africa to perform activities outside the borders of
South Africa.

At the same time, we are paying tribute today to the late Oliver Reginald
Tambo who was born on this day. His legacy lives on in South Africa.
Comrade O R left us a significant and enduring heritage, one that enhanced
our new Constitution, one that contributed to the inclusive and equitable
policies of our democratically elected government and one that affirmed the
abiding vision of the ANC itself.

The amendments are enablers for the extension of current skills and
capabilities to the rest of the continent in the delivery of basic services
by Africans for Africans. Therefore, they should facilitate the delivery of
services, and be seen to assist the agenda for the delivery of basic
services, ensuring adequate infrastructure and promoting stability.

It is befitting that on 8 October this year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee
informed the world that it had decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for
2004 to Madame Wangari Maathai for her contribution to sustainable
development, democracy and peace.

As we debate this Bill today to enable water boards to perform activities
outside the borders of South Africa, we appreciate the fact that Madame
Maathai chose to improve the low economic status of women through, amongst
other things, the protection of forests, water catchment areas, and so on.

This Bill will – and the services to be received must - contribute to more
and similar activities in Africa. As Nepad has identified the protection of
the indigenous African tropical forests and rainforests; our soil, rivers,
lakes and water resources; our biodiversity; our wildlife and natural
habitats; and our coastal areas and oceans as a priority task, this
amending Bill will enable South Africa to further contribute to this
process. It is conceived as important to enable parastatals to make their
contribution to Nepad, and as forms of expertise and capacity-building. The
principle of parastatals and state-owned enterprises operating
extraterritorially is not something new to South Africa.

This amending Bill will allow water boards to make a contribution, as
Eskom, Transnet and others have done and are doing.

Water is a basic service and like all basic services it is a key driver for
socio-economic development, peace, stability and democracy in the national
context. South Africa is a key player in the Nepad programme for the
development of Africa. It has a responsibility to share its capacity,
knowledge and expertise with the rest of Africa.

Exchanging capacity and expertise demonstrates the spirit of the Freedom
Charter. Indeed the Freedom Charter says: “The doors of learning and
culture shall be opened.” And here South Africa is doing that and sharing
its experience beyond its borders. The principles of the Freedom Charter
are still valuable today, because we are sharing in the country’s wealth.
Here, we are spreading the country’s wealth even beyond our borders. In
this instance, it would be the wealth of knowledge that we would be
contributing.

Because of our geographic limits in terms of the availability of water,
very careful attention must be paid to the location of new settlements. The
long-term environmental costs of sourcing water from neighbouring countries
and provinces must be given greater consideration. Hence, we participate in
activities outside the country.

We are confident that when permission is granted to water boards to perform
activities outside South Africa, that this will be done with the utmost
responsibility and with consideration towards the people of South Africa
too. Therefore, we ask that this Parliament, through the Portfolio
Committee on Water Affairs and Forestry, be empowered with this information
on a regular basis.

Secondly, as we enable the activities of the water boards when permission
is granted, they should give due consideration to the institutional reform
strategy process currently under way in the department, to institutional co-
operation and decision-making, to guidelines and principles, to the
allocation of roles and responsibility, and to the identification of key
stakeholders.

The ANC, in its manifesto in 2004, correctly said and reflected that our
task over the next five years with regards to Southern Africa, Africa and
the world is to continue to work to contribute whatever we can so that,
together with all the people of our region and the continent, we address
political stability and the economic and social problems that confront all
of us, leading to the victory of the African Renaissance.

Our own Chief Albert Luthuli, Africa’s first Nobel Peace Prize winner and
who at the time was the president of the ANC, said in his acceptance
speech:

  Scientific inventions, at all conceivable levels, should enrich human
  life, not threaten its existence. Science should be the greatest ally,
  not the worst enemy of mankind.


More importantly, there should be a relationship between society and the
right to life. The right to life is water. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chair, hon Ministers and  hon  members,  I  would  like  to
reiterate what we as the DA have always said that where there is  a  meeting
of minds, the DA is ready, willing and able to make a  contribution  to  the
development of this country and  to  make  sure  that  South  Africa  is  an
investor-friendly   environment   which   can   meaningfully   address   the
unemployment situation we find ourselves in today.

It is a known fact that South Africa is a water-stressed country.  Therefore
it is very important to exercise  water  conservation  methods.   I  do  not
believe that anybody can argue with the fact that water is life and life  is
water.  The DA supports the Water Services Amendment Bill.

The Bill seeks to amend section 30 of Act 108 of 1997  by  the  addition  of
the following subsections:

      The Minister must, in consultation with the Minister of  Finance,  the
      Minister of Trade and Industry and the Minister of Public  Enterprises
      and by notice in the Gazette, determine the nature of activities  that
      a water board may perform outside the boarders of  the  Republic;  the
      countries in which such activities may be performed; and  the  maximum
      amount of capital that a water board may take out of the Republic when
      an activity contemplated in subsection(4) is performed.


      The Minister may,  in  consultation  with  the  Minister  of  Finance,
      authorise a water board to perform an activity outside the borders  of
      the Republic.

Water boards are established in terms of section 28 of  the  Water  Services
Act, Act 108 of 1997, in terms of which a service  area  is  determined  for
the water board. This service area is understood  to  mean  a  service  area
within the Republic of South Africa. As a water board is a  statutory  body,
it only has the powers conferred upon it by statute. Should a  water  board,
therefore, wish to operate outside the borders  of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, it lacks the statutory authority to do so.

As I have mentioned, South Africa is water stressed, but Africa is blessed
with natural and human resources. An urgent need has, therefore, arisen to
create statutory authority to enable water boards to operate
extraterritorially.  It is conceived as important to enable parastatals to
make their contribution to Nepad, also in the form of expertise and
capacity-building.

If the Americans can think up a space programme to go to the moon  and  come
back, surely we can if  the  political  will  is  exercised.  Water  can  be
channelled from the Great Lakes region to the south  via  the  DRC,  Angola,
Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. Clearly, technology is so advanced  that
there can be no legitimate excuse to say that it cannot be done.

If our lives are dependent on water, then you cannot put a  price  on  life.
I know that some will argue that it is too expensive,  but  we  can  have  a
project of that magnitude in view of the fact that  we  now  have  the  SADC
region. Also, unemployment is a problem throughout the  region.  I  envisage
this kind of project  to  be  a  SADC  RDP.  It  could  be  a  double-barrel
programme,  with  electricity  generators  constructed  along  the  way   in
countries where there is a shortage of  electricity.  And,  of  course,  our
water problems could be solved in that way.

I am sure that  we  could  also  address  the  issue  of  food  security  by
implementing viable agricultural programmes, because we  would  have  enough
water for irrigation schemes. If one looks at the flow of wasted water  from
the Great Lakes region all the way to  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  I  think  that
common sense should prevail. I would like to  urge  our  Minister  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry to initiate exploratory talks with the SADC  region.  I
would like to believe that they do have . . . [Time expired.]


Mr M W SIBUYANA: Chair, although there is still much more work that needs
to be done within our own borders, we believe that South Africa’s water
boards have much to offer countries outside our borders.

Our neighbours in Southern Africa and in the rest of Africa can benefit
from the expertise and experience that these water boards have gained over
the years. They can therefore contribute to improving the lives of many
people.

In the past there was legal uncertainty as to whether water boards could
operate outside the borders of South Africa. The service areas of the water
boards, established in terms of the Water Services Act, Act 108 of 1997,
were understood to mean service areas within the borders of South Africa.
This amendment to the Act will now provide much-needed certainty around
this important issue.

There are already water boards that have expressed interest in operating
outside the South African borders. This proposed amendment to section 30 of
the Water Services Act will provide for a process to authorise
extraterritorial activities of water boards.

As I mentioned earlier, there is still much that we need to do for the
people within our borders as there are still many areas that, and many
people who, have inadequate access to water. We hope that the water boards
will not embark on activities in other countries while ignoring or not
giving attention to the people and communities within our borders who are
so rightfully deserving. I thank you.



Ms S N SIGCAU (Sylvia N): Chairperson and hon members, although this is a
very short Bill, it raises a very complex and problematic issue regarding
water boards operating outside South Africa.

Whilst we welcome the inclusion of four Ministers in the decision-making
procedure that will lead to permission being granted for such
extraterritorial activity, we remain concerned. The fact remains that there
are overwhelming water service needs inside the borders of this country.

Without disputing the objectives of Nepad, our first priority must remain
the citizens of this country. We urge the Ministers to consider any such
applications with great circumspection. Water boards must realise that
their first duty is to the people of South Africa. However, the UDM
welcomes the Water Services Amendment Bill. I thank you, Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, this is a simple Bill with far-reaching
consequences. It would not be an overstatement to say that if we want our
water-poor region to be a success, a precondition must be the wise and
productive use of our limited water resources.

Often, as with food, water availability is not the problem, but
distribution is the problem. In the field of distribution, our water
boards, with almost a century of experience, have an enormous amount of
technology. The advice of South Africa’s water boards have been sought from
the Middle East and Africa in the fields of water purification, impounding,
transport, management, distribution, the application of industrial water
and so on.

We have seen the benefits of co-operation in protecting the natural habit
in the great transnational wildlife parks. We can do the same with
transnational co-operation with catchments and water.

Our great water boards, as I have said, have a huge amount of experience.
The ACDP believes that the Bill will help us protect our vital water
interests; provide for co-operation, technology transfer and potential
joint ventures with our neighbours; unlock large opportunities for regional
development; and will allow us to assist others in raising capital for
water projects internationally as well as in the financial hub of
Johannesburg.

Our water boards have long experience in this. They are well known in the
capital markets of Europe, and they have an impressive track record which
they can share with others. This will create economies of scale for joint
projects and unlock opportunities for co-operation within the framework of
Nepad, which this legislation will underpin. It will allow us to use and
stretch the limited and scarce technical capacity in our region in this
field for the common good.

In fact, our water boards are already working, and this will simply
regularise some activities that are already taking place. I remember being
very proud when I stood on a golf course in Bahrain and knew  that it was
being watered by water which has gone through desalination – South African
technology – at 90 000 gallons a day and that this technology was home-
grown. I thank you. The ACDP supports this measure. [Applause.]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, the NP supports the Water Services Amendment
Bill. The NP is of the opinion that granting water boards the power to
operate outside the borders of the Republic of South Africa and without
being prejudicial to local municipalities, would not only be in the
interests of South Africa, but also in the interests of the African Union,
Nepad and the Southern African countries.

Besides delivering a service, our water boards would also empower the
respective countries requesting their services with knowledge - the
necessary skills that they lack – and regional development. I thank you,
Chair.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the supply of fresh running water to so many
poverty-stricken areas in the Republic of South Africa has been
successfully supported, and yet still many areas need to be supported.
There have been recent concerns, shared by the public at large, of possible
water restrictions and shortages.

The MF has no objection to water boards operating extraterritorially as
long as such operations are convened under the applicable Ministers’
supervision, authority and discretion. The MF agrees that this will
contribute to our efforts in terms of Nepad. We support this supervision as
long as it does not compromise water services to local South Africans or
the authorities of local municipalities in this regard.

Further, the public needs to know that the government, together with the
water services boards, aims to supply all South Africans with clean,
healthy water and that the needs of our people are always first and
foremost.

Further, the public should be advised that extraterritorial water services
would by no means compromise any South African’s access to clean running
water. Considering the fact that the earth is primarily made up of water,
it is hoped that a solution will soon be reached to correct the water
shortage. The MF supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): I now call the hon B G Mosala, who
is making his maiden speech. [Applause.]

Mr B G MOSALA: Chairperson, hon behalf of the ANC I also rise to support
this Bill.

Eighty-seven years ago on 27 October, Comrade Oliver Reginald Tambo, a
legend in our struggle who contributed to our existence in this Chamber,
was born. Today, as I participate in the debate on this amending Bill, I am
driven by the spirit of this giant who liberated us from the shackles of
the ordeal that was apartheid. We salute you, comrade.

If not for the historic reburial of Comrade Mxolisi Majombozi, a young
lion, by the ANC Youth League, the ANC Youth League would have been at the
graveside of this legend today. We salute you, comrade. May your undying
spirit, as we remember your birthday, rest in peace.

Water boards, as bulk suppliers of this life-giving commodity, fulfil an
extremely critical role in the economy of our country. It is a role that
most of us would easily take for granted, but it is a function that ensures
that the wheels of industry keep turning, that power is generated and that
life in our homes proceeds normally.

When a water board is established according to section 28 of the Water
Services Act, Act 108 of 1997, a service area within which the board may
operate is determined. This House has already alluded to this, but it is
important to emphasise that this service area hitherto has had to be within
the borders of the Republic of South Africa.

The Water Services Amendment Bill now seeks to provide statutory authority
for a water board to operate extraterritorially as a statutory body.
Confining the boards to trading solely within the borders of South Africa
has clearly been stifling their capacity to compete globally. They are now
being given the opportunity through this Bill. We can only hope that they
will face this challenge responsibly.

Proper control and monitoring measures have been built into this Bill in
the sense that there will be interministerial consultation, and the nature
of the activities will be monitored and will have to be approved. Even the
countries in which such activities may be performed will have to be
approved. The amount of capital that a water board may take out of the
Republic will also have to be determined and approved.

There is absolutely no doubt that South Africa, as an acknowledged world
leader in water services and water-resource management, is yet to prove
that this Bill will benefit the Republic of South Africa and its people.
Our contribution to Nepad has already been alluded to.

[Chairperson, it is important that I should clarify that our government,
led by the majority party, is prepared to develop and strengthen water
business and to make water business easy between our country and
neighbouring countries as well as those that are far from us. We have to
understand that water is an essential commodity that everyone has the right
to.

Water is life. We have to again understand that by this law, the government
does not say water has a rightful owner, nor that water business is only
for the chosen few. But we have to understand that there are those who have
committed themselves to purifying water, and to preparing it for
consumption. People like that are given an opportunity to do business with
other countries. Parties that are in the country get this right.]

We also have to note, as some concerns have been raised, that water is not
being privatised. This Bill must not be seen as an attempt to privatise
water services. The Bill clearly enhances the potential for skills
transfer, job creation and capacity-building. It is a Bill that makes it
easier for countries to bridge the infrastructure gap.

Metsi a tswang mehloding e Lesotho a phalla dinokeng tse phallang

hotle hakaakang ho sebedisa bokgoni le boitsebelo ba rona ka tshebediso ya

[Water from the Lesotho source runs through rivers that are in our country.
That water develops our economy. How beautiful it is to use our expertise
and skills when using the property of neighbouring countries.]

The Bill recognises that Africa has an abundance of natural resources and
that the people who hold the key to her development live on this continent.
We remain convinced that stability on the continent of Africa will emerge
if African countries assist in developing one another in the spirit of
Batho Pele. This Bill aims to achieve this objective.

In the run-up to this moment, the stakeholders who participated in the
hearings that discussed the Bill showed tremendous support. They showed
concern at times, but will continue to engage in this matter. Together,
with water, we shall improve the lives of South Africans.

We appreciate and value the support that we seem to have received from the
opposition. We note all the concerns raised. To those who opposed this
Bill, we invite you to read it once more, because we
suspect that you might not have understood the contents sufficiently. The
ANC supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Thank you very much, Deputy
Chair. Deputy Chair, I just want to thank all the members who participated
in this debate, lead by the very capable chairperson of the portfolio
committee, Connie September. I thank all of you for your support and I know
that you will help in monitoring the implementation of this Act.

Mr Maluleke, regarding the issue that you have raised about SADC, there are
a number of such initiatives that are already under way, and we will inform
you when the time comes. Somebody said that our people remain a priority. I
think it was the hon Sigcau. We definitely cannot agree with you more. That
is why we are regulating this initiative. I had the pleasure of addressing
the water boards - their association. They understood fully what this
initiative meant for them.

In conclusion, I would just like to say that there can be no better way to
honour O R Tambo than extending services to Africa that will contribute to
sustainable development in the spirit of the African Renaissance. Thank you
very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

  CONSIDERATION OF NINTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS –
                                    ESETA
  CONSIDERATION OF TENTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS –
                                  ETDP-SETA
Mr F BEUKMAN: Chairperson, thank you for the opportunity to present on
behalf of Scopa the following reports to the House. I would like to say a
special word of thanks to cluster 1 of Scopa, under the able leadership of
the hon Pierre Gerber, who evaluated the financial statements and reports
of the Auditor-General and these institutions.

The reports refer to five Setas or Sector Education and Training
Authorities. Yesterday there was a discussion in the House on the subject
of education and training authorities that highlighted the role of these
institutions and the need for them to function effectively. From the
perspective of Scopa, we are especially interested in their progress with
regards to governance, financial management and adherence to prescribed
financial procedures.

The financial statements of the Setas have been audited in terms of section
188 of the Constitution, read with sections 3 and 5 of the Auditor-General
Act, and with section 14 of the Skills Development Act.

Although the five Setas received unqualified audit reports from the Auditor-
General, there are various issues in relation to investment policy,
internal control and internal audit that need urgent attention. The
mentioned Setas should report to Parliament what steps are practically
implementable to rectify the current deficiencies and weaknesses.

With reference to the sixth report, namely the Chemical Industries
Education and Training Authority, Chieta, Scopa recommends that within two
weeks of tabling this resolution, Chieta provide Scopa and Parliament with
the following: a copy of the investment policy for unspent funds, which
includes consideration of both risk and return, full details of the
investment portfolio of unspent funds, and a document strategy on how it
intends to utilise its unspent money for the intended purposes, while also
ensuring value for money.

With regard to the seventh report, namely the Construction Education and
Training Authority, or Ceta – that’s not a rugby team, but a Seta - we
especially referred to matters emphasised by the Auditor-General. The
committee noted with concern the transfer of assets and liabilities. The
transfer of assets, amounting to more than R5,8 million, and liabilities in
excess of R4,2 billion, belonging to the now abolished Building Industry
Training Board and the Building Industry Training Scheme, has not been
finalised. The consultants who investigated the matter are currently in
dispute with the Department of Labour and this is delaying the finalisation
of the process.

Regarding the internal audit, as a result of the fact that the internal
audit function was established in March 2003 and will only be fully
functional in the next financial year, the Auditor-General could not place
any reliance on the work of the internal auditor. There is also no
materiality, and a significant framework has yet to be developed as
required by Treasury regulations. The committee expects the accounting
authority to expeditiously rectify the issues in question.

Then, with regard to the eighth report, namely the Diplomacy, Intelligence,
Defence and Trade Education and Training Authority, Didteta, a matter
emphasised by the Auditor-General was the nonapproval of procurement
policy. This specific Seta had not yet approved its procurement policy.
Therefore, there was no formal basis for authorisation of acquisition of
goods and services. The board should therefore indicate why Parliament
should not regard this as an irregular expenditure in terms of the PFMA.

With regards to the internal audit and audit committee, Scopa is concerned
that the audit committee was only established in February 2003 and that
possibly, as a result, the audit committee was not in a position to fully
comply with its reporting requirements in terms of the Treasury
regulations. Also, there was no materiality and a significant framework had
not been developed, as required by Treasury regulations. Scopa expects the
accounting authority to expeditiously rectify the issues in question.

The committee also recommends that within two weeks of tabling this
resolution they also provide Parliament with an investment policy, as well
as full details of the investment portfolio of unspent funds.

Then, with regard to the ninth report, namely the Energy Sector Education
and Training Authority, Eseta, there are weaknesses with regard to internal
control. We also believe that certain weaknesses with regard to the
segregation of duties and the proper delegation of authority should be
rectified. With regard to internal audit and the audit committee, we also
believe that rectification should take place with regard to requirements
indicated by the Treasury regulations.

Then, the final report is the tenth report, which deals with the Education
Training and Development Practices Sector Education and Training Authority,
ETDP-Seta. One of the matters emphasised by the Auditor-General was
weakness in internal control. The following internal control weaknesses
were identified: a complete fixed-asset register was not available, and the
approved budget and the budget recorded on the accounting system reflected
an unreconciled difference. The committee expects the accounting authority
to expeditiously rectify all identified weaknesses.

In terms of those five reports, we believe that it is urgently necessary
that these Setas rectify these matters and report back to Parliament so
that we can have progress reports with regard to those matters. Thank you
very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move that the
Reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

 THE IMPACT AND CHALLENGES OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON POVERTY REDUCTION AS WE
                     CELEBRATE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT MONTH

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, as October is Social
Development Month, we must celebrate our achievements. As the ANC
government, we have done a lot to improve the lives of the people of our
country.

Tshifhingani tsha muvhuso wo fhiraho, vhathu vha Afurika Tshipembe vho

Tshivenda paragraphs follows.)

[During the time of the previous regime, the people of South Africa were
highly affected by the legacies of colonialism, racial and gender
discrimination as well as other oppressive laws. They were living in
poverty, squalor, and starvation and did not have equal access to social
economic security. Ten years of democracy was based on nation-building,
reconciliation and the strengthening of development structures to build and
improve democracy. During this period we managed to issue sufficient grants
to maintain children and to offer free health-care services to children
younger than six years.

The government announced that it would increase the funds to maintain
children until they are 14 years of age. It is anticipated that the
increment would be accessible to 3,2 million children in the next 10 years.
To manage such a huge number, the government introduced a phased approach
whereby children are clustered according to their age groups. For example
children who are seven and eight years old were supposed to have been
registered for the grants in 2003-2004, while those between nine and eleven
years were supposed to have been registered in 2004-2005, whereas all other
age groups are supposed to be registered in 2005-2006. This programme will
carry the responsibility of ensuring that these grants are adhered to.]

There has long been concern that the provinces do not have the capacity to
administrate social security efficiently and effectively. One of the areas
of particular concern is the fact that when money is allocated to provinces
as part of their equitable share, there is no guarantee that the money
earmarked for social grants will not be used for other provincial
priorities than what it was intended for. The department has repeatedly
been taken to court over the suspension of grants, and repeatedly the
courts have ruled against the department.

A review of the regulations of the Social Assistance Act, Act 59 of 1992,
has not been completely successful in eradicating the problem of the
suspension of grants. During February 2003 another judgment was passed
against the government. In the light of these challenges, and in the light
of the recommendations made by the Taylor committee, Cabinet has in
principle given approval for the establishment of a dedicated national
public entity to administer and pay grants. This means that full
responsibility for the social grants function may shift to the national
government.

[At the moment South African children can access the following grants: the
foster care and care dependency grants. Except for these grants, there are
still many different kinds which South African people are enjoying. Some of
them are, the grant in aid, the war veterans grant, the grant for the aged
and the grant for the disabled.

Presently, approximately 5 million South African children are receiving
support grants. This brings the money the government is paying for each
child per month to R769 million. Children are also getting food at schools.
The greatest segment of this amount totaling 24,3% is being paid at KZN per
month. The Eastern Cape province follows with 16,7%, Limpopo with 16,7%,
Gauteng with 12,6%, Mpumalanga with 8,3%, North West with 8,1%, Western
Cape with 6,1%, Free State with 5,7% and lastly the Northern Cape with
1,6%.]

Basically, foster care grants are paid to more than 200 000 people in South
Africa every month. The amount of R110 million a month goes to KwaZulu-
Natal, the larger recipient of foster care grants. This allowance is the
greatest segment of the grant. It is followed by the Eastern Cape, the Free
State, the Western Cape, Limpopo, Gauteng, the North West, the Northern
Cape and Mpumalanga.

A total of more than 78 000 South African children are receiving the care
dependency grant. This amounts to approximately R58 million, which is being
paid out to beneficiaries on a monthly basis. In his 2004-05 Budget Speech,
the Minister of Finance announced a general increase in the amounts paid
for various grants.

follows.)

[We have many children who are receiving money. There are 3500 projects
whereby people were given funds totaling R521 million. As we are talking,
there are many children who are receiving grants. We are still faced with a
huge challenge with regard to our people who are living in poverty. The
government is disseminating grants. Some children cannot go to school,
whereas others cannot pay school fees. We have children who are suffering
from HIV/Aids, homeless children and child-headed households.

We are taking into consideration that all we have achieved was made
possible as a result of the co-operation between the government, NGOs and
the nation as a whole. That is why we say that we must unify and act
collectively in meeting all the challenges facing us. I would like to call
on our social partners and the NGOs to strengthen our working relationships
in order to accelerate the motto: A people’s contract for a better life for
all our people.]

We have a people’s contract for a better life for all our people. Let us
take up all these challenges together.

Rothe ro sedza lifhasi nga u angaredza sa zwe Muphuresidende vha ri kha ri
lwe na vhushai. Ndi a livhuwa. Tshanda ntha ha tshinwe. [U vhanda zwanda.]
(Translation of Tshivenda paragraph follows.)

[Let us take up these challenges together. We are all looking at the global
world as a whole as the President has urged us to wage a fight against
poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms H WEBER: Thank you, Madam Chair. Social Development Month should be a
month of great celebration but, alas, it is confined to those who receive
their grants timeously and without many hassles, and to those who have a
job. We are therefore seeing many a disillusioned, frustrated South
African. We are witnessing people being put in positions - which they are
not qualified for - to balance out job equity. This not only leads to
frustration but to inefficient productivity. Although the government has
attempted to relieve poverty through various grants being paid out, this is
a far cry from creating jobs.

There is nothing more uplifting for a breadwinner than to leave his or her
home to go to work and bring back money for which he or she has put in a
hard day’s work. This, unfortunately, is a scenario for about half the
population. The rest linger around, disillusioned and losing their self-
worth. Some are trained, but have been retrenched. Others look for
training, but the doors are closed. How often do we see notices that say,
“No jobs”?

The paying of grants does help to put some food on the table but, as the
hon Minister rightly said, we must avoid becoming a welfare state. The
government did come up with black economic empowerment with an eye on
giving the previously disadvantaged a chance to better themselves. This,
unfortunately, has only created a few billionaires to the detriment of the
masses.

The DA has had policies in place which have been worked out and proven to
be economically viable. Our basic income grant would be an easier grant to
manage. Such a grant would not discriminate against unemployed young men or
have a proviso that a young girl must have a child to access such a grant.
It would kick-start young entrepreneurs to at least try to help themselves.

Child support grants are proving to be unmanageable, with those really
needing them having difficulty in getting the necessary documentation
required to access these grants. It is laudable that the grant recipient
age limit is to be increased but, still, this is not creating jobs as the
government promised.

The National Development Agency, NDA, which set out to be a good
institution, is now dysfunctional, thwarted by fraud and corruption. This
once more is proof that the government has a problem with implementing many
of its policies. Setas, which also seemed to be a good idea, are also
suffering at the hands of incompetent administrators.

There are blueprints out there, and I am sure that we should be looking at
proven ways of training and of creating jobs. The DA believes that greater
faith should be placed in the private and NGO sectors as delivery
mechanisms for poverty relief. Experience has shown that spending vast sums
of money on the creation of new expensive bureaucratic structures to
deliver poverty relief over time simply results in the poor being short-
changed.

The DA’s aim is to get the best, most cost-effective and affordable aid
directly to poor people. Thus, one creates bigger individuals and smaller
government. The government’s policy of helping those people receiving
grants to start food gardens by supplying them with starter packs of seeds
also seemed like a good idea but, once more, has been weighed down with
bureaucracy as people have to wait for the Department of Agriculture to
show them how to create a food garden. Many an NGO has had great success in
such fields and, I am sure, if given the opportunity and some government
funding would make successes of such ventures. This would have the desired
effect of people being able to feed themselves.

A further major challenge facing South Africa is how to address the ever-
increasing problem of child-headed households. We have the situation of
children bringing up children. Not only is this causing children to
suddenly become adults, but it is also depriving them of going into a
profession of their choice and depriving them of a childhood.

South Africa has a wealth of talent and job opportunities waiting to be
created, were it not for unnecessary bureaucracy, inefficient delivery and
government interference. Free the economy and encourage normal job creation
and we will have a poverty-free country.

In 1996, small, medium and micro enterprises were to be promoted by
government, but the people have found it difficult to get the required
training. Government would do well to establish business support centres in
disadvantaged areas that are easily accessible to as many people as
possible. This is one of the many suggestions that the DA has in its policy
for job creation. The training of people to run a business would prevent so
many small businesses from being closed down in many rural areas. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mnu M J BHENGU: Mama Somlomo neNdlu yakho ehloniphekile, selokhu saqala
ukufika kuleli Phalamende ngo-1994 siye size njalo lapha ngaphambili
sizokhuluma ngobubha nangokuhlukumezeka, njengoba singabantu abampofu.
Kukhona into eyodwa kodwa esiye sikhohlwe ukuyisho: ukuthi ubuphofu lobu
buyawuhlukumeza umqondo womuntu, bubuye futhi buhlukumeze nobuntu bomuntu
uqobo. Kuphinde kwenze into ebuhlungu kakhulu ngoba kuthatha ubuhlakani
bomuntu abuphiwe uNkulunkulu kwehlise izinga labo. Lokho-ke kudalwa isimo
esisodwa sohlelo lwamaBhunu okwakhuthiwa i-apartheid.

. . . Manje-ke mina ngifuna kube khona okwenzekayo, singalokhu siza lapha
ngaphambili sizothi . . .  (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M J Bhengu: Madam Speaker and hon members, since we arrived here in
Parliament in 1994, it has been our practice to come to the podium and talk
about poverty and abuse since we are poor people. There is something that
we tend to forget: That poverty renders frustration, demoralisation and
reduces the person. Poverty also hampers the intelligence of a person that
was given to him by God.

All this was created by the apartheid system. Therefore, I want us to do
something and stop coming here to say. . . ]

. . . poverty reduction, poverty reduction, poverty reduction. Let us get
action. For instance, I want to know: Do departments prioritise poverty
programmes, or do they put them aside and concentrate on other problems? I
want to whether there is any synergy amongst departments in implementing
poverty reduction programmes. Isn’t it time to have a single directorate
that will concentrate on actually establishing all the poverty reduction
programmes?

Asikakafiki leso sikhathi lapho sizoba nomuntu oyedwa ozothi, “Cha, manje
ngisebenza indaba yokunciphisa ububha nobuphofu”? Thina njengamalungu
ePhalamende silokhu sigqoka kahle bese sizokhuluma lapha kodwa abantu
bakithi emakhaya le bayahlupheka. Ngendlela abahlupheka ngayo … Kubuhlungu
kabi ngoba abanye bethu abakwazi ukuhlupheka. Manje lapha sisuke sikhulume
ngezibalo zama-statistics namaphesenti. Konke lokho kuwumbhedo ngoba abantu
bayahlupheka. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)
The time has not yet come where a person will come forward and say: No, now
is the time to work towards alleviating hunger and poverty. As members of
Parliament we dress smart and continue to debate here, yet our people in
the rural areas are starving. If you look at the degree of their
starvation, its quite painful because some of us here have not experienced
starvation. Our problem is we come here and rush to talk about figures and
statistics. Action of this kind is frivolous because our people are
starving.]

Even policy formulation should be done in such a manner that there is co-
ordination and synergy of all these poverty reduction programmes.
Therefore, the IFP says the time has come for us to embark on a holistic
perspective when we talk in terms of poverty reduction. We should actually
begin to teach our people to become independent and self-reliant, instead
of embarking on piecemeal solutions that only ease the brunt of poverty.
This is because we believe that human development for self-reliance and
sustainability is what the government should focus on in terms of policy
formulation for poverty reduction.

We believe that understanding the dimensions of poverty is essential to the
formulation of policies and programmes which aim to reduce poverty. That is
why measuring performance and sustainability becomes vital, but
understanding the depth and extent of poverty fully is only the first step,
which is necessary but not sufficient to achieve poverty alleviation.

Ngakho-ke ngithi, nansi inselelo: Iminyango ayiqale ibhukule ukuze abantu
bakithi babone ukuthi ngempela uhlelo lokwehlisa ububha nobuphofu luyenzeka
ngokubonakalayo. [Ihlombe.][Therefore I invite you to this challenge. The
departments should start with the implementation of poverty alleviation
programmes. [Applause.]]

Mr M DIKO: Madam Chair, as we celebrate Social Development Month, the
Minister of Finance has expressed his concern regarding the rapidly
expanding demands that social grants place on the Budget. He described this
as unsustainable. One cannot help but notice the irony: Before the election
there was a big rush to encourage people to register for social grants, but
afterwards we are told that this is an unsustainable burden on the
government.

At the heart of this issue is the responsibility of government to reduce
poverty and the mechanisms that it uses to achieve this goal. The UDM does
not dispute the urgent and overwhelming need to assist the many poor
people. However, we are saying that the main way of dealing with poverty
eradication would be job creation.

Job creation remains the most important priority. And, whilst government
assures us that there are plans currently afoot to deliver jobs, we must
remind them that throughout their 10 years there have always been plans,
strategies and summits. The pertinent question is whether the latest plans
will deliver the promised jobs and how we would monitor progress in this
regard.

We believe that improved performance with regard to job creation will
ensure that social development and the proper upbringing of our people
become a reality and therefore give impetus to our freedom. Thank you.

Mr L W GREYLING: The ID’s vision for South Africa is of a country where
every person can realise their true potential through either being employed
or creating employment for others. In this society, nobody will have the
need for social assistance as they will be able to provide a sustainable
livelihood for themselves.

This is, no doubt, a vision which many of us share in this House. But, the
present reality, unfortunately, dictates that this will merely remain a
dream for many years to come. We need to face the facts. Despite the
efforts of government in extending the social security net, millions of
South Africans still live in abject poverty.

Unemployment and the tragic legacy of a divided society are in many cases
responsible for this situation. Unfortunately, though, even with the best
policy and political will in the world, overcoming this legacy will take
many years. Unemployment in South Africa is of a structural nature and its
causes are far more complex than simple labour laws.

As we believe in a caring state, the ID believes that the government needs
to extend the social security net so that the millions of impoverished
South Africans who do not qualify for any of the five grants can also
receive assistance from the state.

The ID recognises the increase in budget share that is dedicated to social
assistance grants in South Africa, but we need to recognise that this money
is also spent on developing our people. In many communities, these grants
are the only injection of money that they receive and can, through the
multiplier effect, increase economic activity.

A universal basic income grant needs to be considered and not a means-
tested one, as the DA proposes. Means tests simply direct resources into a
bureaucracy and create huge administrative burdens. The system is already
reeling under this effect, as I saw on a recent visit to a pay station in
KwaZulu-Natal.

I spoke to people who had had to wait in line for more than seven hours,
only to be informed that they had to come back the following month to see
if their grant had been approved. They are forced to do this for months on
end. We need to restore dignity to our people and reform these
administrative systems. A comprehensive social security net will also break
the dependency that people have on employed workers and other poverty-
stricken families who are forced to look after them. We need to do this,
because it is the right thing to do. [Time expired.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Chair and hon Deputy Minister, I am not entirely sure
why we are celebrating. Perhaps, it’s because the annual report of the
Department of Social Development has now been tabled. We understand reasons
for the delay include senior management vacancies, pressure caused by the
establishment of the National Social Security Agency and a management
crisis at the National Development Agency – not a rosy picture.

The challenges facing government in terms of poverty reduction are great
and, in my opinion, this department is burdened with too wide a
responsibility, rendering it ineffective in its role both as service
provider and in social development. Job creation and skills development
projects are weak and floundering, not due to lack of enthusiasm but lack
of expertise, experience and skill.

Where is Labour? Where is Trade and Industry? Where is Agriculture and Land
Affairs? This should be their baby. Growing the economy and developing
skills cannot be the primary focus of the only portfolio handling social
services or, should I say, not handling them.

On a trip to the Eastern Cape I recently witnessed, once again, the
enormity of the task facing Social Development. Without budgets or capacity
to deliver services to abandoned babies; neglected, abused and orphaned
children; children in trouble with the law; the elderly; the sick; the
dying, money spent on development initiatives is a mockery.

We witnessed the department’s efforts in extending grants, providing early
childhood development and skills development, and job creation projects.
Clearly, policy is being implemented, and funds are going to development
and poverty alleviation projects, but these projects are at the direct
expense of desperately needed social services. Escalating substance-abuse
issues, for example, cannot hope to get the necessary attention, despite
work on a new master plan, because there is just no budget.

In response to ACDP queries on the impact of certain policies including
grants, assurances were given that assessments were under way. The
challenges are ominous; the impact, frankly, minimal. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Deputy Chair and hon
members, let me first take this opportunity to thank the House for having
introduced this timely debate on the impact and challenges of government
policies on poverty reduction. Its relevance and significance are uplifted
by the fact that October is Social Development Month.

This being our seventh Social Development Month since the advent of
democracy and given that we are at the tail end of the tenth anniversary of
the celebration of the International Year of the Family, the department has
focused its efforts on strengthening families and communities for a better
quality of life for all, especially our children.

To achieve this, the Department of Social Development over the past decade
has focused its attention on creating a caring society. These goals require
that we accelerate our service delivery system from a welfare-based system
to a social development-oriented system. Inherent in this system is a
people-centred-development approach. This has required a departure from a
problem-centred approach to a solutions-oriented approach that builds the
requisite skills while creating self-employment and sustainable
livelihoods.

The latter twin objectives are not without challenges. It is therefore
appropriate that at this time and in the context of our 10-year
celebrations, we pause and review the challenges confronted by government
with regards to policies and programmes aimed at poverty eradication.

Such a review, which has been conducted in the form of a discussion paper,
has provided us with valuable lessons and is the basis of our fresh mandate
and social contract, as elaborated on by President Mbeki during the state
of the nation address.

These lessons have included the transformation of the Public Service
through the adoption of a co-operative governance framework and enabling
legislation such as the PFMA; the improvement of service delivery through
the National Planning Framework and Integrated Development Plans; and the
broadening of access to services such as health care and education as
displayed by adult literacy rates that are currently up to 83%.

In order to enhance social justice, the department, together with its
various partners, has drafted a model for service delivery. This model will
provide a national framework that will give guidelines for developmental
service delivery. The draft service delivery model was tabled at the recent
Minmec. It is aimed at ensuring that services are delivered with ethos and
with the values derived from the eight Batho Pele principles. The
implementation of this model will improve systems, work processes and
institutional structures, which will collectively improve service delivery
at every level and location.

The model will only work properly if it has all the necessary human
resources required and if it is implemented in partnership with all those
that share our common vision of a better life for all. This approach is not
only a polemic standpoint, but one that will assist in building social
cohesion through community-based, nongovernmental and faith-based
organisations. Such partnerships are necessary to realise the
constitutional right of access to social security, which remains one of the
key social development priorities in the context of comprehensive social
security.

We have conducted a yet-to-be-released report, which interrogated the
economic impact of social grants on particular sectors of our communities.
I am pleased to confirm that the current social security system as a whole
reduces by 45% the total rand destitution gap. In simple terms, this means
that a whole lot more people would be poorer without social grants.

It is because of this - the inconsistent norms and standards across
provinces - and in response to the reported fraud and corruption in our
system, that we remain committed to ensuring that the Social Security
Agency is operational by April 2005. Again, to effectively attain this, we
will require partnerships.

These partnerships have also created a basis for the Moral Regeneration
Movement to restore dignity, respect, pride and optimism. Such partnerships
provide the potential for intensifying the fight against the scourge of
drug abuse through the creation of community-based prevention programmes.
In addition, the department has embarked on a full-scale youth development
programme to ensure that our young people use the opportunities available
to them for a better life.

The Minister pointed out in his budget address to this House that poverty
alleviation and unemployment could not be addressed in isolation from one
another. Similarly, as stated previously by President Mbeki in his state of
the nation address and reiterated by Minister Manuel yesterday, a society
in which large sections of the population depend on social welfare cannot
be sustainable.

Poverty eradication should be addressed within a wider set of developmental
strategies and programmes, which include all departments and all spheres of
government. The central location of poverty eradication means that it is a
key criterion by which submissions to the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
should be measured and by which all government developmental programmes are
judged by Cabinet.

This department intends to provide a number of work opportunities for South
Africans through the Expanded Public Works Programme. In the social sector,
work opportunities are being created in the areas of early childhood
development and in community and home-based care programmes.

In addition, given the short-term nature of such work opportunities, the
department will also focus its efforts on facilitating access to credit and
financing for entrepreneurial projects for young people through
initiatives, such as the National Development Agency and the Umsobomvu
Youth Funds.

The special commitment by the business sector to exploring synergies
between corporate social investment and public investment initiatives must
be pursued and strengthened in pursuit of creating sustainable work
programmes.

Therefore, the critical task is to consolidate, formalise and
institutionalise partnerships in the social development sector. This will
be achieved by following up on the commitments made during the Growth and
Development Summit. All commitments are focused explicitly on combating
poverty and creating work opportunities.

The role of Social Development is just one contributor to the broader
collective process of reflecting and interrogating the relationship between
social development policy and poverty eradication. This will require that
we pay careful attention to the economic fundamentals and the social
imperatives. Such attention requires integrated government programmes.

Some of the integrated government programmes include the Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme, the Urban Renewal Programme, the
Expanded Public Works Programme, the Integrated Municipal Infrastructure
programmes and Working for Water programmes.

The two main co-ordinating strategies for development are the Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme.
These seek to co-ordinate all development programmes across the three
spheres of government and parastatals to ensure maximum impact. In
particular, they seek to ensure that developmental programmes are targeted
to meet basic needs whilst identifying potential, so as to respond to the
Integrated Development Plans.

Given that the core responsibility of all departments is to eradicate
poverty, Parliament has a significant role to play in monitoring the
implementation of commitments made during the Growth and Development
Summit. In this regard, progress reports on the various clusters of
government have been posted on the government website, in addition to being
in annual departmental reports.

Changing population trends show that there is an increase in the number of
potentially economically active people as a result of large numbers of
young people entering the labour market. Young people aged between 10 and
19 constitute the largest part of the population. Furthermore, women and
youths aged between 15 and 24 are experiencing the most difficulty entering
the mainstream economy and the labour market. They also represent the
groups that are the most vulnerable to HIV/Aids and unplanned pregnancies.
All these factors necessitate the socio-economic integration of young
people into our society as a priority.

Therefore, the priorities are youth skills development programmes and the
location of youth development structures in the Presidency, with similar
structures in provinces and in the Department of Social Development in
order to collectively ensure the economic integration of young persons.

The department has a particular focus on strengthening families, and also
offers the potential of providing capacity and utilising the skills of
older persons, a large number of whom carry the burden of supporting family
members who are unemployed, sick and abandoned.

Given the increased coverage of grants at a rate above inflation, the key
challenge that remains in improving social security in the next decade is
to ensure more effective delivery to rural beneficiaries, a reduction in
the incidence of fraud and corruption, the development of a framework for
comprehensive social protection, and the reduction of the number of people
dependent on grants through job creation.

In addressing the link between poverty and development, it is imperative to
reach beyond the borders of South Africa. President Thabo Mbeki, in his
opening address at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, said: “All
of us understand that the goal of shared prosperity is achievable because,
for the first time in human history, human society possesses the capacity,
the knowledge and the resources to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment.”

This places a responsibility on us as this House to ensure that the issues
of poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment are placed firmly on the
agendas of regional, continental and global organisations. I therefore take
this opportunity to welcome the location of the Pan-African Parliament on
our shores in the hope that this will advance the above objective.

It is also my pleasure to inform you that South Africa will chair the
review process on the implementation of the Copenhagen commitments at the
World Summit on Social Development. A precursor to this will be a meeting
of the region’s social development Ministers, in line with our UN
resolution elaborating on the social dimensions of Nepad.

I was fortunate to participate in the extraordinary summit of the African
Union in Ouagadougou earlier this year, which emphasised the importance of
tackling poverty through a comprehensive programme to extend social
protection to the poor. In addition, all governments recommitted to
implementing Nepad development plans and to mainstreaming vulnerable groups
such as women, the youth and the physically challenged into Nepad
development plans.

Given the extent of the poverty of the majority, despite the relative
positive indices of growth at this stage in our economy, it comes as no
surprise that as we remove the barriers to access to the constitutional
right to social security, people are registering in large numbers.

But the challenge, as the Minister of Finance said, is to ensure that those
who qualify for the grants have access and those who don’t are removed to
improve the management of the system.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Deputy Minister, your time has
expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: As I have reported, the
department is making steady progress to improve the management …

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Can I just finish my sentence?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Yes. If it is one sentence,
certainly.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: As I have reported, the
department is making steady progress to improve the management of social
grants and introduce systems to eliminate fraud and corruption. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr W D SPIES: Hon Chair, it’s been stated on various occasions that the
government is a people-centred government. Their aims are to uplift people,
to create opportunities and to eradicate poverty. Whilst these aims are
commendable and although the FF Plus supports initiatives aimed at
strengthening communities, we should never stop questioning the ways and
means to achieve them.

In our view, too many expectations are based on government grants and
racially based initiatives, such as affirmative action and black economic
empowerment – BEE - in the fight against poverty. According to the United
Nations Human Development Report released this year, 22 million South
Africans still live below the poverty line. White people occupy about 2
million of the 11,8 million formal jobs that exist in our economy. Even if
all these 2 million people were to vacate their jobs in favour of the
previously disadvantaged, we would still be left with 20 million very poor
and jobless people. To develop and heal our society, it’s not only the job
seekers who are important but also the creators of jobs and wealth.

Close to a million highly skilled professional young South Africans have
left South Africa in the past 10 years. It is estimated that, with every
professional who leaves the country, eight potential job opportunities are
lost as a result.

Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad, former prime minister of Malaysia, said at the end
of his career: “These few Malays” referring to people who benefited from
their policies, “for they are still only a very few, have waxed riches …
because of the policy of a government supported by a huge majority of poor
Malays. It would seem that the efforts of the poor Malays have gone to
enrich only a select few of their own people.” May we learn from the
experience of others, and let us find and start using their right medicine
to heal the wounds of our society. I thank you.

Mr B E PULE: Thank you, Madam Chair. Social development is one of the most
important aspects of a caring nation. As we celebrate Social Development
Month, the reduction of poverty will remain a hollow euphemism unless the
government has measures in place to maintain the equilibrium between
population growth and available resources.

Much has been said about the redistribution of wealth as opposed to the
creation of wealth. Let us create wealth first and then redistribute it.
The inflow of people into South Africa impacts negatively and therefore
poses a big threat to the reduction of poverty because resources are not
limitless. The dependency syndrome and other kinds of entitlement, in some
instances orchestrated by government itself, also pose a big threat to
poverty reduction. People must work to deserve their needs.

There has to be a concerted effort in skills training and, of course, in
the transfer of skills by those who have them. There has to be aggressive
empowerment of people in small, medium and micro enterprises in order to
alleviate unemployment. School curricula must be such that those who
complete their education are juxtaposed with the mainstream of the economy
of the country and the labour market.

Mo go kgonegang teng a mongwe le mongwe a tshele ka mofofotso wa phatlha ya
gagwe. Ke a leboga.[Where it is possible, let us all work hard. Thank you.]

Mr N T GODI: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members, the evil that was white
domination consigned the majority of our people to extreme levels of
poverty. The struggle for national liberation and social transformation
imparted the desire to change these unbearable material conditions. It is
therefore correct and necessary to continually reflect on the extent to
which government policies respond to these challenges of poverty
eradication.

Broadly, the main thrust against poverty has been predicated on employment
creation, assistance to our people to start their own businesses, and
social grants. In the limited time that we have, we would like to focus
superficially on social grants.

There is abundant evidence that since the advent of democracy, the number
of people who now access grants has more than tripled. Millions of our
people have been lifted out of absolute poverty to relative poverty. This
means that there are no elderly persons, orphans or children within the
qualifying age who cannot access state assistance. With the high rate of
unemployment, this has become the mainstay of many families in the poor
African communities.

It, however, needs to be noted that there are challenges facing the
recipients and society at large. The unsuspecting elderly are pounced upon
by all manner of vultures selling all sorts of schemes, which gobble up
their disposable incomes. The fundamental purpose of the grants does get
defeated. Legislative measures need to be looked at to protect the elderly
from these rapacious vultures. The pension paypoint committees piloted in
Bushbuckridge, Limpompo, can be an additional measure to help the elderly.

The overwhelming majority of our people welcome and have benefited from the
child support grant. Our kids no longer have to go hungry because their
parents are unemployed. But, of course, there is a handful of irresponsible
parents who do not use these grants judiciously and for the benefit of
their kids. There are, for example, reports that some single parents misuse
these grants to improve their appearance or buy things that do not benefit
the children. During a provincial visit we heard of cases in which kids
were withdrawn from crèches because their parents pleaded poverty, even
though they received their government grants. [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Chair. We are a government brought to the
people by the people. We are representative of those who voted us into this
authority and we are bound by our national Constitution to ensure that we
are a government for the people. The MF reaffirms this commitment to
catering for the needs and best interests of all South Africans.

As Parliament, we are vested with the task of legislating in terms of the
best interests of our people, as advocated by the national Constitution
that governs supreme. No Bill shall be passed as law if it contravenes the
values and provisions of our democracy enshrined in this document. Thus,
all Bills and policies are passed with this in mind.

Ten years into our democracy we are still challenged in many spheres by the
aftermath of the apartheid regime, not to mention our cumbersome debt that
seriously hinders our advancement. The reality is that poverty,
unemployment, crime and our social economic status are serious challenges
in South Africa. What is even more real is our government’s commitment to
poverty alleviation and social development. This may be visibly noticeable
in our achievements of the past 10 years. All our efforts are for the
benefit of our people.

The MF is committed to securing a better life for all by coming to this
podium and ensuring that every Bill or policy that we debate is sensitive
to the needs of our people and, most importantly, that it contributes to
efforts aimed at poverty alleviation and social development.

The MF is aware of the hardships that so many South Africans continue to be
challenged by, but I stand here to reaffirm our commitment to reaching each
and every South African in paving the way for a better life for all.
Government policies may not always attain the results we want, but they
certainly instil the right intent. South Africans, be confident; we are not
giving up and we shall deliver. Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

Mr B M SOLO: Chair, hon Ministers, hon Deputy Ministers and hon members,
since the inception of democracy the ANC has made clear commitments with
regard to social development. In the 2004 election campaign manifesto, the
ANC expressed its vision very clearly.

For the purpose of this debate, I will only address two issues. The first
is the reduction of poverty by half through economic development,
comprehensive social security, land reform and improved household and
community assets. The provision of social grants is not a solution to the
problem. I think people should have listened very carefully to what the
President and the Minister of Finance said yesterday.

The second issue is that we must ensure that all South Africans, especially
the poor and those at risk - children, the youth, women, the aged and
people with disabilities - are fully able to exercise their constitutional
rights and enjoy the full dignity of freedom. To that extent, we will go
the extra mile to ensure that they enjoy these.

These ANC programmes have been incorporated in government policy. Indeed,
within the context of South African social problems, the government has
taken huge strides to address social problems by providing effective social
welfare services and development programmes that empower the poor,
particularly the previously disadvantaged communities, communities in rural
areas and those in informal settlements.

The ANC-led government formulated policies that alleviate the plight of
vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, women, the youth, the
unemployed, people with disabilities and the underemployed. It is mainly
through the Department of Social Development that government has introduced
these programmes. These programmes have a positive impact on the lives of
the many South Africans who deserve them.

For those doubting Thomases who stood here and spoke about things they
themselves don’t understand, allow me to illustrate these programmes. Apart
from social grants, there are clear welfare programmes, starting with
children up to the most vulnerable person.

Regarding children, the ANC-led government introduced what is called the
Early Childhood Development programme. This programme supports and promotes
the care of children from a young age. If one moves around in the so-called
townships, informal settlements and rural areas, one sees a myriad of
crèches that look after children. A substantial number of these get support
from the state in many forms, including finance, and this has created a lot
of jobs for our people out there.

The implementation of the national school nutrition programme has also
contributed towards making an impact on poverty. This programme is premised
on community participation, and mobilises communities to develop food
gardens. As we know, the primary goal of the programme is school feeding,
while also using resources invested in the programme by government to
create sustainable livelihoods for local communities, particularly women.

We are not saying all that looks good is so. We are aware that many of
these crèches still do not get financial support for many reasons, some
relating to regulation criteria and standards set out by various
institutions. This is a matter that the Portfolio Committee on Social
Development and the department is seized with.

Needless to say, social development is key to building a caring society
that can develop not only socially, but economically as well. That is why
the ANC manifesto calls upon all of us to work towards creating jobs, not
for me to have a better life, but for all of us. This is a contract that as
a country, as a nation and as the government we need to honour.

With regard to unemployment, institutional arrangements have been created.
The creation or establishment of organisations, such as the National
Development Agency and others, was solely for that purpose. We all know
that through an Act of Parliament the NDA was created to deal with the
question of poverty eradication. This, once more, has shown how determined
the ANC-led government is to deal with this matter.

President Thabo Mbeki has already indicated that by the year 2015 we need
to have halved poverty. Accordingly, the NDA has been working on this
matter in a systematic way. A number of community-based organisations have
been established. These organisations have a range of projects such as
baking, sewing, dressmaking, small-scale farming, brickmaking, to mention
but a few. The grants received from the NDA enhance livelihood, security
and self-reliance.

Madam … err Deputy Speaker … [Laughter.]

Sekela-Somlomo, njengoko senditshilo, ezi nkqubo …[Deputy Speaker, as I
have already said, these programmes….]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, may I clear it up for
everybody? It is just “hon Chairperson”.

Mr B M SOLO: Sihlalo, njengoko sendichazile, ezinye zezi nkqubo zibancede
kakhulu abantu phaya emakhaya nakwiidolophana ezincinci. Ndingathanda
ukunika imizekelo ngoba abanye ababoni, amehlo avalekile, ababoni nendlela
le abahamba kuyo ukuba iphuculiwe. Abanye besinabo Kwazulu-Natal, bayibona
imizamo eyenziwa ngabantu ukuze baphile impilo engcono besebenzisa uncedo
abalinikwa ngurhulumente ukuze bazimele.

Ndiyayazi ukuba ikhona imibutho yasekuhlaleni, omnye wayo yiNgqayizivele
ophaya kwilokishi iMpumelelo, eDevon, kwiphondo laseGauteng. Lo mbutho
uneenkqubo zawo, ndicinga ukuba zintathu: zokubhaka; ukwenza ifenishala;
ukuthunga nokunitha.
Le misetyenzana inempumelelo.

Bonke abantu bangakhwela inqwelomoya, mhlawumbi ngomso lo, bakhawuleze baye
kuzibona. Zikhona, asithethi ngezinto ezingekhoyo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Kwakhona, siyafuna ukutsho ukuba iinkqubo ezingama-408 ziyaqhuba kulo lonke
eli, ngakumbi phaya emakhaya. Izolo oku besiKwaZulu-Natal, sayibona indlela
abantu abazimisele ngayo ukuba olu ncedo luncinci balunikwa ngurhulumente
bakwazi ukuziphilisa ngalo. Basibonisile amaphulo abawaqhubayo. Abanye
bethu bebekhona bezibonela ngamehlo abo. Mhlawumbi kufuneka sibafunele
ezona ndondo zakhe zankulu. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B M SOLO: Chairperson, as I previously explained, these programmes are
of great assistance to people in the rural areas and in small towns. I
would like to give some examples as others do not see these developments.
When we visited Kwazulu-Natal, members did witness community efforts on
development to better their lives with the help from government.

There is a community-based organisation known as Ngqayizivele in Mpumelelo
Township at Devon in the Gauteng province. This organisation has three
successful projects ranging from baking, carpentry, sewing and knitting.

Members are permitted to go and observe these projects because they exist.
[Applause.]

We want to allude to the fact that there are about 408 running programmes
in the whole of South Africa, especially in the rural areas. In KwaZulu-
Natal, we observed the way communities appreciate the little help they get
from government in order to sustain their lives. They have demonstrated to
us some of their projects and members who were there have witnessed those.
If they did not see anything, they probably need spectacles.]

Over and above that, there are a whole range of programmes that are service-
driven for the elderly, those who are infected with HIV and Aids . . .

. . . ngakumbi phaya emakhaya, eziqhutywa yimibutho yasekuhlaleni ethe
yamamela ikhwelo likaMongameli elithi abantu mabavuke bazenzele. Abantu
bayayenza loo nto ngoba bangenile kwesi sivumelwano kunye ne-ANC, esithi
asingorhulumente kuphela oza kukwazi ukulwa nobuhlwempu, nabo mababe
nendima abayidlalayo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[. . . but more especially those in the rural areas. Programmes are
community driven especially after the President’s call that people must
work for themselves. People are doing that because they have committed
themselves together with the ANC to do things themselves, as they realise
that poverty relief does not lie only in the government’s hands but that
they need to play a role as well.]

The President has previously stated that any society based on social grants
will become unsustainable.

Andiyazi ke le mibana kuziwa nayo apha, ngoba leyo into siyibonile siyi-
ANC, norhulumente uyibonile, ukuba ikhona imizamo eyenziwayo. Siyazi nokuba
izolo uMphathiswa utshilo ukuba masibe nendlela esenza ngayo ukuba abantu
bangaxhomekeki kumalizo nokuphiwa ngalo lonke ixesha. Loo nto siyayivuma.

Sitsho ukuba makulungiswe uqoqosho. Ntonje uqoqosho lubanjwe ngabantakwabo.
Babalekile nemali, enye bayifihle phantsi koomatrasi, enye bayivalele kula
mazwe onke. Abayikhuphi le mali. Boyiswa nakukuhlawula abasebenzi babo.
Banee-akhawunti ezityebileyo ezingaka. Bahleli nayo le mali. Leyo yenye
yezinto ekufuneka sizijonge. Enye imali bayivalele phaya, bathi yimali
yepenshoni, baza kuyisebenzisa xa bekwipenshoni. Imali abahleli nayo
ibalelwa kwiibhiliyoni.

Mayikhutshwe le mali, ukuze size kukwazi ukwenza imisebenzi. Mababahlawulwe
imali efanelekileyo abasebenzi babo. Ngaloo ndlela uqoqosho luya kukwazi
ukuba lungaphucuka. Bayabona ukuba indodla enikwa abantwana ngurhulumente
noko ibe nefuthe kuqoqosho.

Nivile ukuba ushishino lwabathengisa ngemiyingana, oo-Sales House noo-
Woolworths, iivenkile zabo, bazuzile kakhulu, iziswana zibomvana. Kodwa
bayakhongozela, besithi abayazi ukuba imali engaka ivela phi.

Siyacela ke ukuba bathethe nabantakwabo, bona abaphethe iinkampani nabanye
babo bahleli koomaBhrithane, koomaMelika nakulo lonke eli. Ezinye iimali
zabo zivalelwe e-Switzerland. Mabakhuphe imali babhatale abasebenzi
ngendlela efanelekileyo. Mabadale imisebenzi baxhase nemizamo yabantu.
Ngaloo ndlela uqoqosho noko luya kutsho lushukume. Siyabulela. [Uwele-
wele.] [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I do not understand the purpose of some of the issues that have been
presented during this debate because we as the ANC and the government do
acknowledge the efforts. Yesterday, the Minister of Finance said that we
must devise a strategic plan that will limit people’s dependency on
government grants. We accepted that.

The economy needs to be developed. Their brothers are holding economic
growth back. They have run away with the money of which a part is hidden
and the other is invested offshore. They cannot even give salaries to
employees. They have huge bank accounts. We must strategise around that.
Other sums of money are invested in pension funds. Their revenue amounts to
billions of rands.

The money must be redirected and be used effectively. Employees must be
paid reasonable wages. In this way the economy can be developed. They can
see that the social grant given to children has its positive impact on the
economy.

The credit chain stores, such as Sales House and Woolworths have made
tremendous profit and they are rich without knowing where the sums of money
are coming from.

We ask them to talk to their capitalist friends who own companies and those
who live in Britain, America and all over the world. Some of their money is
invested in Switzerland. They must give employees what is theirs. They must
create employment and help people in their efforts. In that way the economy
can develop. We thank you. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

              may have jurisdiction over human rights matters arising from
              sources referred to in that Article, and this will overlap
              with the jurisdiction of the Human Rights Court and may give
              rise to concurrent jurisdiction on disputes pertaining to
              human rights matters, unless the Court of Justice itself
              excludes jurisdiction;

         4. the Court of Justice may not hear appeals from the African
              Court on Human and Peoples' Rights and the African Court on
              Human and Peoples' Rights may not hear appeals from the Court
              of Justice,

         recommends that the House, in terms of section 231(2) of the
         Constitution, approve the said Protocol.

         The Committee further recommends that, should the Executive
         consider permitting third parties to submit cases before the Court
         of Justice in terms of Article 18(1)(d), a prior request be tabled
         in Parliament for approval.

     Request to be considered.
