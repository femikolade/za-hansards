Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting  of
the Council I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  two Johannesburg  suburbs,  Hillbrow  and  Westbury,  previously
           described as dirty and crime-ridden, were cleaned up  through  a
           Government   clean-up   programme   called   the   Environmental
           Intervention Project and through the assistance of  hundreds  of
           volunteers;


       (b)  City Power repaired broken streetlights and installed lights  in
           dark alleys and  walkways  and  also  repaired  road  signs  and
           robots;


  (2) further notes that this initiative has been given input from  various
       stakeholders, including the SA Police Service, Pikitup,  City  Parks,

        TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that this week marks the tenth anniversary of the Convention to
       Combat Desertification;

       scientific,  technological  and   financial   resources   to   enable
       developing countries to combat desertification.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I have pleaded with you to  insert

       others  in  our  society  to  follow  their  example  but  will  also
       demonstrate  how  South  Africans  have  found  ways  of   overcoming
       adversity and are able to succeed against all odds.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Debate on Vote No 28 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I take  this  opportunity  to  welcome  the
Minister and wish you well for your next five years and the challenge  ahead
of you. You are welcome to this House. You may address the House.

The  MINISTER  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Thank  you,  Madam
Chairperson and members of the House. We find ourselves in the  unusual  and
reversed position this year of  debating  this  Budget  Vote  in  the  NCOP,
before we do  so  in  the  National  Assembly.  To  some  this  may  seem  a
counterconvention,  but  I  believe  it  is  also   loaded   with   positive
significance. There are few other portfolios in which the close  partnership
and the co-operation between the national, provincial and local  governments
is more  critical  for  success,  or  in  which  there  are  greater  public
opportunities to deliver on the President's injunction  to  grow  the  first
economy, and to intervene decisively in the second.

As a former delegate to the NCOP, I'm greatly  pleased  today  to  have  the
opportunity of presenting my first Budget Vote in this Chamber.  I  approach
the task of leading the Department of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,
both with great enthusiasm and no small  amount  of  caution  -  enthusiasm,
because I can think of no task more important, and  more  exciting.  In  the
first 10 weeks alone of our new Government, we've held the biggest and  most
successful  tourism  indaba  to  date,  and  we  have  celebrated   National
Environment Week, and we have launched a new domestic  tourism  campaign.  I
also say with "caution", because in less than a month and  a  half,  I  have
experienced firsthand the passion and emotion that is  unleashed  on  issues
such as toll-road developments, beach bans on 4x4 vehicles, and  of  course,
the culling of the tahrs of Table Mountain.

The wide-ranging nature of environmental affairs and tourism does  not  lend
itself to complete coverage within the scope  of  a  single  Budget  speech.
With the understanding of the members, today I would like to  focus  on  two
areas of particular relevance and concern to this House. These  focus  areas
are, firstly, the protection and the management  of  our  marine  resources,
especially the fishing  sector;  and  secondly,  the  importance  of  closer
tourism  co-operation  and  development,  especially  in  our  new  domestic
tourism growth campaign launched last week.

I would also like to request increased assistance from  the  representatives
of the provinces  here,  and  also  the  intensified  partnership  in  these
endeavours, as well as local government represented by Salga. On  Monday  in
the National Assembly debate I shall deal with issues such  as  our  poverty
relief programmes, the expansion  of  our  protected  areas  and  a  further
regulation and the enforcement of  environmental  protections.  But  members
should please feel free to raise any issues of concern to them, and  I  will
address those in my reply.
In the light of our celebrations of 10 years of democracy I  would  like  to
begin today by confirming that by next May our department  will  have  taken
possession of four new state-of-the-art environmental  patrol  vessels,  all
four to be named after  prominent  South  African  women,  whose  lives  and
deaths have become symbols of courage, dedication and  singular  commitment.
The spirit of Lillian Ngoyi, Sarah Baartman, Victoria Mxenge and Ruth  First
will live on in these vessels, as they and their crews form the  nucleus  of
what is effectively the first functional coastguard for South  and  Southern
Africa.

As members have seen during the National Environmental  Week,  we  have  now
declared another four marine protected  areas,  or  MPAs,  as  part  of  our
programme  to  create  sustainable  marine  resources.  The  Table  Mountain
National Park, Bird Island, Aliwal Shoal and the Pondoland  MPAs  bring  the
stretch of South African coastline under protection, much closer to the  20%
target set for 2010 at the World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  and
also the World Parks Congress.
Another major success has been the effective  prosecution  of  environmental
crimes, in the new, now not so  new,  specialised  environmental  courts  in
Hermanus in the Western Cape and also in Port Elizabeth. The Hermanus  court
has a prosecution success rate of 70%. That's very  high.  An  expansion  of
these courts to KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng should be the next step  over  the
next 12 to  18  months.  These  measures  are  all  linked  to  the  ongoing
strengthening by our department of our enforcement and compliance  capacity,
both in marine and coastal management and  more  broadly,  in  environmental
affairs.

As the members from our coastal provinces will be able  to  confirm  because
of first-hand experience, there are  few  people  more  passionate  or  more
vocal than a South African  fisherman  or  fisherwoman.  The  allocation  of
fishing rights will always remain a high-profile and  thorny  issue  because
it impacts so directly and immediately on the lives of coastal families  and
communities. We must recall - and I would like to take your minds back -  in
1994 there were only about  350  rights  issued,  and  only  to  white-owned
companies. Today, more than  5  830  individuals  and  companies  have  been
granted  fishing  rights  with  more  than  60%   previously   disadvantaged
ownership, and more than 70% from the SMME sector.

Therefore, I'm pleased to announce that we will take the next step and  that
I am able to announce today that preparations  are  well  advanced  for  the
next round of fishing rights allocations, the long-term  rights  of  between
eight and 15 years. This  process  will  take  place  next  year  across  19
commercial fisheries, and we anticipate receiving and evaluating  more  than
5 000 applications. The  result  of  these  new  allocations  will  be  much
improved stability and certainty in the fishing industry, and those  of  you
who know that industry well, will understand the  stability  that  long-term
rights will  bring;  and  especially  to  our  smaller  operators  for  whom
financing has been exceedingly difficult, or in some cases  even  impossible
without long -term guarantees. We will gazette our new fisheries  policy  by
July.

I'm also pleased to announce the new measures that  we  are  instituting  to
ensure that the allocations process is raised to a level where the  fairness
and  the  legality  of  rights  issued  is  assured.  Independent   forensic
auditors, who have already been employed, will  examine  both  officials  as
well as the fishing applicants. Separate and independent project  management
specialists and lawyers have also been retained as another level  of  checks
and balances. These forensic auditors have been briefed to verify, not  only
the permit holder's conduct in the different fisheries, but  also  to  carry
out lifestyle audits of staff members to ensure  that  no  staff  member  is
influenced to underreport catches, or act in any other wrongful manner.

We are also in the process of examining  all  our  checks  and  balances  to
ensure  that  an  even  better  system  of  fishing  rights  allocations  is
developed, in which the integrity and credibility  of  the  allocations  are
beyond question. And once again,  those  members  who  intimately  know  and
understand this industry will  understand  how  important  it  is  that  the
integrity and credibility of our systems are beyond question.

As far as holders  of  rights  are  concerned,  our  department  issued  171
notices to those who appeared to have contravened their  permit  conditions,
which include overfishing. In addition, together with the Scorpions and  the
department's forensic auditors,  we  are  currently  engaged  in  two  high-
profile audits and investigations into illegal  and  unreported  fishing  in
the abalone and pelagic industries, the results of which will  be  announced
in the near future.

Chairperson, the last four years has shown that,  on  average,  two  working
days out of every week is  spent  by  senior  officials  in  our  department
attending to queries from individual members of the fishing  community.  Now
clearly, there is a need for better co-ordination of interests  and  queries
within  less  organised  fisheries.  Some  of  the  fisheries  are   already
organised to a certain extent.

For this reason, Chairperson,  our  department  will  be  looking  into  and
encouraging, over the  next  12  months,  each  of  our  commercial  fishing
sectors, from the net and line fisheries to the hake  longline  and  lobster
fisheries, to establish reputable  and  representative  industry  bodies  to
speak for their members' interests.

Ons is absoluut daartoe verbind om met  ons  diverse  vissersgemeenskappe  -
daar's uiteenlopende belange - saam te werk, en om hulle te oortuig dat  die
volhoubare benutting van dié bron die enigste opsie is vir  die  huidige  én
vir die volgende  geslagte.  Voordat  enige  regte  toegeken  word,  is  ons
daartoe verbind om  so  wyd  moontlik  in  oorlegpleging  te  tree  met  ons
vissersgemeenskappe. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We are absolutely  committed  to  co-operating  with  our  diverse  fishing
communities - there are diverse interests - and to persuade  them  that  the
sustainable utilisation of this source is the only option  for  the  present
and for the future generations. Before any  rights  are  allocated,  we  are
committed  to  negotiating  with  our  fishing  communities  as  widely   as
possible.]

Although much has changed  for  the  better  in  South  African  fishing,  I
believe that the plight of our subsistence fisherfolk is  deserving  of  our
focused attention - ons bestaansvissers. [our subsistence fisherfolk.]

To this end I will be conducting, from  next  month,  a  series  of  fishing
imbizos in which we will travel the length of our coast,  starting  in  Port
Elizabeth on 20 July - and those times  and  venues  will  be  advertised  -
Saldanha on 29 July, Fish Hoek and Gansbaai on 30 July,  and  KwaZulu-Natal,
Lamberts Bay and Port Nolloth in September.

We will meet with the fisherfolk and their families.  We  will  explain  our
approach  to  the  management  of  resources.  But  also  very  importantly,
Chairperson, we will take their advice on how best to  develop  our  fishing
policies, particularly with regard to the smaller commercial fisheries  like
line and net  fisheries.  I  would  like  to  give  the  assurance  that  we
understand some - I hope most - if  not  all  of  the  problems  about  that
specific sector, and we would like to hear our fishermen and women  tell  us
that directly and at first hand.

In albei dié prosesse wil ons graag ons kommunikasie met  die  visbedryf  en
die vissersgemeenskappe verbeter. Ons  gaan  afhanklik  wees  van  die  noue
samewerking én ondersteuning van ons kollegas in die provinsiale  regerings,
sowel  as  in  die  plaaslike  regerings.  Nog  'n  gebied  wat  baie   noue
samewerking tussen ons departement en die  ander  sfere  van  regering  gaan
verg, is die bemarking van ons nuwe plaaslike groei-strategie.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In both these processes we would like to  improve  our  communication  with
the fishing industry and  the  fishing  communities.  We  are  going  to  be
dependent on the close co-operation and support of  our  colleagues  in  the
provincial governments, as well as in the local  governments.  Another  area
which is going to need very close co-operation between  our  department  and
the other spheres of government is the marketing of  our  new  local  growth
strategy.]

This is the first time that such a campaign has ever been attempted on  this
scale, binding all nine provinces and our national  Government  to  convince
our people that holiday travel in South Africa is both affordable  and  that
it is worth exploring. The domestic tourism market is  already  worth  about
R49 billion, only 13% less than  the  value  of  our  international  tourism
market. It is estimated that there is an emerging group of over 6,3  million
South Africans with the resources and the desire  to  travel,  but  most  of
them never do because they believe it is unaffordable, or that there are  no
holiday options that appeal to them within our own country.

Driven by our department, SA Tourism and  the  Provincial  Marketing  Forum,
the process to turn this situation around has already  been  underway  since
June last year. Our unique South African brand  that  has  been  the  result
rests on four essential South African experiences, that is adventure,  urban
vibe, affordable luxury and discovery.  It  is  this  identity,  this  South
African brand,  which  has  resulted  in  the  Sho't  Left  media  campaign,
launched last week in Langa. We want South Africans to travel  more  in  our
own country.

I would also like to encourage all of our provinces to play  their  part  in
nudging South Africans to explore and to discover the wonder and  beauty  of
our own country. This campaign offers an excellent opportunity to  all  nine
provinces to create greater awareness about what  they  offer  in  terms  of
leisure travel.

As with the domestic growth campaign, another aspect of tourism that  is  of
direct importance to this House is our transformation plan. For  some  years
Government has been encouraging transformation in the industry, and  despite
the many successes that  we  have  achieved  we  know  that  no  one  should
underestimate the hard work that remains to expand  the  ownership  and  the
benefits of tourism in South Africa to include all our people.

One of the critical tourism transformation interventions of  our  department
this year will be the  development  of  a  BEE  scorecard  for  the  tourism
industry. I shall be announcing the appointment of a task team  on  13  July
to advise me on this process. We are doing  this  in  partnership  with  the
Tourism Business Council of South Africa.

The  scorecard  will  be  informed  by  the   Broad-Based   Black   Economic
Empowerment Act, developed by the DTI, and it  will  provide  clear  targets
and timeframes for the transformation of  the  industry.  The  clearer,  the
better, then there is no misunderstanding. Provinces will need  to  play  an
active role in this  process,  and  we  will  inform  and  invite  provinces
shortly, because implementation of the scorecard will happen  at  provincial
and local levels, and these spheres of government will also  be  central  in
monitoring the implementation of the scorecard.

Chairperson, we know that the response of many within the tourism sector  to
calls for transformation is that the will to transform is  not  met  by  the
skills to do so. We understand that the key to future success in tourism  is
training and skills development of the highest order, and this  is  why  our
department will, from the end of  this  month,  June,  be  taking  over  the
funding of the Tourism  Enterprise  Programme.  Initiated  by  the  Business
Trust over four years ago, this  business  linkages  programme  has  already
facilitated  more  than  R1  billion  worth  of  transactions,  and  created
thousands of jobs.

Particularly in the light of the Growth and Development Summit Agreement,  I
am pleased to announce that we have now secured funding  from  the  Treasury
to continue this programme - R10 million  this  year,  with  a  further  R12
million and a further R15 million in the next two financial  years.  We  are
particularly pleased that the Business Trust will continue to assist  us  in
a public-private partnership to the further value of R5 million this year.

We will be agreeing on specific provincial targets for  the  programme  with
our provincial co-ordinators as soon as the Memorandum of Understanding  has
been signed by the end of this month. The Department is  also  finalising  a
SMME training package and it will be piloted in August this year.

Ter afsluiting, alles is in plek vir omgewingsake en toerisme  om  van  krag
tot krag te groei oor die volgende vyf jaar,  die  volgende  dekade  én  die
volgende geslag. Die sleutel tot daardie sukses is  die  ondersteuning,  die
samewerking en die vennootskappe  van  die  belangegroepe  wat  vandag  hier
teenwoordig is. [In conclusion, everything is in place so  that  environment
affairs and tourism could grow from strength to strength over the next  five
years, the next decade and the next generation. The key to that  success  is
the support, co-operation and partnerships of the interest groups  that  are
represented here today.]

I would like to express my excitement to the NCOP about the team of  MECs  -
most of them are here today - for environmental  affairs  and  tourism  with
whom it will be my pleasure to work for the  next  five  years.  This  is  a
critical portfolio, which has been blessed by skilled and dedicated men  and
women in every province.

My appreciation must also be recorded to the team in  our  department  under
the leadership of our Director-General, Dr Olver, our  Ministry,  and  every
statutory body for their professionalism and their  unflagging  energy.  The
transition involving a new Minister is almost never easy, but  this  process
has  been  both  smooth,  efficient,  and   an   accomplishment   worth   of
recognition. I would like to thank the role-players whom I have mentioned.

I would also like to take this  opportunity  to  convey  to  the  House  the
greetings of our Deputy Minister, Ms  Rejoice  Mabudafhasi,  who  sends  her
sincere regrets about  not  participating  in  this  debate  today.  She  is
currently attending a very important international meeting and she  will  be
back I believe by tomorrow morning. I would also like to thank  all  of  the
members of this House who worked with our department during  the  last  term
of government, and also to welcome those who  have  joined  us  in  the  new
term; and I was glad  to  see  a  number  of  very  experienced  members  of
Parliament also from the NCOP on the select committee.

A special word of thanks must be extended  to  Rev  Moatshe  and  the  other
members of the select committee for all of the work that  has  already  been
invested in the Budget Vote deliberations. I have  no  doubt  that  we  will
continue to work in close partnership in facing the challenges ahead of  us.
I thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much, hon  Minister.  It  is  no
mistake that your Budget Vote starts in the  NCOP.  The  House  is  actually
reminding you that you were once the Rotating  Chairperson  of  this  House.
You therefore have to complete your work in the NCOP.

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson of the National Council of  Provinces,  Minister
of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  together  with  your   department,
Ministers, members representing provinces, and  permanent  members  of  this
House, I convey my greetings to you. Peace unto you!
HON MEMBERS: Peace unto you!

Rev P MOATSHE: I like your spontaneous response. [Laughter.]

In this year's national and provincial elections the  nation  spoke  in  one
voice that they now appreciate what has been done for  them.  They  conveyed
their thanks by accepting an invitation to enter  into  a  partnership  with
the great giant of politics, the ANC, to create jobs and  eradicate  poverty
and hunger.

Hunger is in danger. It is facing the toughest opponent. Our  South  African
citizens have entered into an agreement to wage  war  against  unemployment,
and to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty  and  hunger.  The  rectangular
vision of the department confirms a better life for South Africans with  the
power to growth, tourism and environmental awareness.

The people's contract indicates to the National Council  of  Provinces  that
one has to work hard because nothing comes easily.  Tourism  is  a  valuable
industry. It has the power to grow in the local  and  domestic  market.  The
aim of the department  is  to  generate  interest  in  tourism  locally  and
abroad, and to remove all barriers to growth.

It is a valued industry to create  jobs  that  attract  investments  to  our
country. This department intends  to  support  the  expansion  of  networks,
which are efforts to create jobs, black economic empowerment,  or  BEE,  and
to speed up change. South Africa has started to be  one  of  the  developing
countries in tourism and is a foreign tourist attraction.]

SA Tourism received a  government  grant  of  R68,7  million  for  marketing
activities and maintenance of its infrastructure. Government  contributed  a
further R150 million for a joint  international  marketing  initiative  with
the business community. The total revenue  of  SA  Tourism  in  the  2002-03
budget was R130,9 million. The majority of these funds, R219  million,  came
from  the  state  grant,  with  R68  million   made   by   formal   business
contributions.
Considerable progress has been made in increasing tourism activity.  Despite
the recent, general  global  slowdown,  South  Africa  is  one  of  the  few
countries where tourism has grown significantly.  The  increased  effort  to
market South Africa internationally is one of the main reasons for this.  In
addition, through the poverty relief fund more than R232  million  has  been
spent on tourism projects across the country, mainly on the  development  of
infrastructure and tourism products. Initiatives to  achieve  transformation
in  the  tourism  industry  have  included   the   development   of   strong
partnerships,  tour-guiding  training,  tourism  safety  and  an  innovative
tourism-grading scheme.

The implementation of the International Tourism Growth Strategy will be  one
of the main areas of work in the department. The campaign  to  market  South
Africa  abroad  has  been  intensified,  with  extra  funds   allocated   to
international marketing through SA Tourism. An increasing effort to  develop
domestic tourism is to run parallel with this.

Die  Wêreldkongres  vir  Volhoubare  Ontwikkeling:  die  wêreldkongres   ten
opsigte van aaneenlopende  stabiele  ontwikkeling,  waarvan  Suid-Afrika  in
2002 die gasheer was, is 'n bewys van die  vaardighede  waaroor  Suid-Afrika
beskik om die uitdaging te aanvaar  ten  opsigte  van  die  integrering  van
maatskaplike     ontwikkeling     met     ekonomiese     vooruitgang      en
omgewingsbeskerming. Wêreldwye vennootskappe wat gevorm  is  om  armoede  in
Suid-Afrika uit die weg te ruim sal in die  volgende  dekade  'n  belangrike
rol  speel  met  die  ondersteuning   van   die   implementering   van   die
kongresooreenkoms. Suid-Afrika  sal  beslis  aktief  betrokke  wees  by  die
ontwikkeling van die program van die Kommissie  vir  Aaneenlopende  Stabiele
Ontwikkeling, om ook verantwoordelik te wees  vir  die  monitering  van  die
implementering  van  die  Kongresuitsette  vir   die   volgende   10   jaar.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The World Congress for Sustainable  Development:  this  world  congress  on
continuous stable development, of which South Africa was the host  in  2002,
is evidence of the skills South Africa has at its  disposal  to  accept  the
challenge regarding the integration  of  social  development  with  economic
progress and environmental conservation. Worldwide  partnerships  that  were
formed to eliminate poverty in South Africa will play an important  role  in
the next decade  in  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  congressional
agreement. South Africa  will  definitely  be  involved  in  developing  the
programme for  the  Commission  of  Continuous  Stable  Development  and  be
responsible for monitoring the implementation of Congressional  outputs  for
the next ten years.]

Before I deal with fishing - marine and coastal management - I want to  hint
at the subject of aquaculture. The MCM is in  those  provinces  where  there
are shores and seas. But if this Government were to take cognisance  of  the
aquaculture concept, all the provinces would be able to  have  fish  because
they would be breeding fish in their own areas.  Even  in  the  most  remote
places in the rural areas, people would be able to breed fish  and  to  have
food on  the  table.  This  becomes  a  challenge  for  the  Departments  of
Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  of
Agriculture and of Land Affairs. The select committee will come to  a  point
at which these  departments  will  be  invited  to  look  at  the  issue  of
aquaculture. How best can it be implemented in South Africa?

We are happy to hear that there are provinces already  which  have  embarked
on an aquaculture. I learned that they are  KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,  the
North West province and the Western Cape. The select  committee  will  still
be going out to see this project, but aquaculture is a  long-term  plan  for
South Africa. Countries like Norway  which  have  no  marine  resources  any
longer, have resorted to aquaculture. This implies that  in  the  future  we
may encounter the same problem. Therefore it will be wise for  us  to  start
now.

Die Wet op Lewende  Mariene  Hulpbronne,  Wet  18  van  1998,  sit  'n  breë
raamwerk uiteen vir die bestuur  van  seevissery,  die  toegang  van  regte,
transformasie  en  bemagtigingsaangeleenthede.   Tesame   daarmee   is   die
toekenning   van   die    reg    op    seevissery    geherstruktureer.    'n
Regtetoekenningseenheid  is  in  2001   op   die   been   gebring   om   die
toekenningsproses te bestuur. Terselfdertyd is daar `n nuwe  wetsontwerp  in
plek wat langtermynregte hanteer. 'n Nuwe fooistruktuur is ook nou in  plek.
Verder is die toekenning van  langtermynvissersregte  ook  die  laaste  jaar
afgehandel, wat  drasties  gelei  het  tot  stabiliteit,  deursigtigheid  en
eerlikheid in die bedryf.

Die Lewende Mariene Hulpbronnefonds word gefinansier deur  sy  eie  inkomste
en ook deur toelaes vanaf die Regering soos bepaal in  artikel  10  van  die
Wet op Lewende Mariene Hulpbronne. Die fonds se  eie  inkomste  word  verkry
van heffings op  visvangste,  permitte,  hawefooie  en  opbrengste  uit  die
verkoop van gekonfiskeerde produkte.  Die  bedrag  wat  die  fonds  van  die
Regering ontvang het, is R155 miljoen. Hierdie bedrag sluit in R147  miljoen
vir die aankoop van nuwe  vaartuie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The Marine Living Resources Act, Act 18 of 1998 provides a broad  framework
for the management of  the  sea-fishing  industry,  the  access  to  rights,
transformation  and  empowerment  opportunities.  Together  with  this,  the
allocation  of  sea-fishing  rights  have  been   restructured.   A   rights
allocation unit was established to manage the  allocation  process.  At  the
same time, a new Bill was implemented to regulate long- term rights.  A  new
fee structure has also been implemented. Furthermore, the allotment of long-
term fishing rights was finalised in the last year, drastically  leading  to
stability, transparency and honesty in the industry.

The Marine Living Resources Fund is being financed by its own income  and  a
government  grant,  as  stipulated  in  section  10  of  the  Marine  Living
Resources Act. The fund derives its income from levies on  fish  -  catches,
permits, harbour  fees  and  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  confiscated
products. The fund has received  R155  million  from  the  Government.  This
amount includes R147 million designated for the buying of new vessels.]

The  department's  objectives  for  the  environment  are  to   ensure   the
sustainable  management  of   natural   resources   and   to   protect   the
environmental rights of all  South  Africans,  particularly  the  previously
disadvantaged. Many of the more obvious  effects  of  pollution  on  health,
safety and the environment have been identified  in  policy  and  are  being
addressed through legislative and  other  means,  including  the  Integrated
Pollution  and  Waste  Management   Policy,   the   increasingly   effective
environmental impact assessment process and the plastic bags  agreement  and
regulations. The following pieces of legislation  have  been  developed  and
are currently before Parliament with a view to promulgation in  early  2004:
the National  Environmental  Management:  Air  Quality  Bill,  the  National
Environmental Management  Amendment  Bill,  the  Environmental  Conservation
Amendment Bill, and the National Environmental Management  Second  Amendment
Bill. However, much work is still  required  to  identify  and  manage  less
obvious but undoubtedly significant issues.

[The committee dealing with  environmental  affairs  and  tourism  wants  to
confirm to the Minister and the department that there will be  co-operation.
There are so many challenges to be faced and much to facilitate in  changing
and improving the lives of South African citizens. This is the  time  to  do
it. I thank everyone. [Applause.]]

Mr B MALAKOANE (Free State): Hon Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson,  Minister,
MECs present, permanent delegates and special delegates, it  is  a  pleasure
for me to share with you what  I  have  to  say  today  in  support  of  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Budget  Vote.  May  I  first
begin by congratulating the Minister on his appointment to  this  portfolio,
and I just wish and hope that our relationship with  him  will  be  showered
with all the blessings for us to continue  working  together  for  the  next
five years.

On the environmental front, whenever composite indicators are used  to  show
how Government has affected the  lives  of  South  Africans,  the  essential
composite indexes worth using have always been the ones showing the  social,
economic and political impact, but most of all the quality  of  life,  which
is part of the  social  impact.  This  has  been  used  to  measure  broader
environmental impacts  arising  from  health,  education  and  environmental
policies developed.

The inclusion of the right to  environmentally  sustainable  development  in
the Constitution has emphasized the importance of  the  sustainable  use  of
natural resources in  the  South  African  context.  The  country's  natural
resources are the nation's natural capital and they play a significant  role
in overall sustainable development and poverty alleviation. This  is  echoed
by Agenda  21,  which  is  an  action  plan  and  blueprint  on  sustainable
development adopted by 178 governments  at  the  United  Nations  conference
held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

The past decade has seen natural resource  management  and  conservation  in
South Africa move squarely  into  an  arena  concerned  with  human  rights,
access to natural resources, equity and  environmental  sustainability.  The
Government's focus on the  more  equitable  distribution  of  the  right  of
access to natural resources is an assertion  that  with  greater  equity  in
access comes the recognition that resources can only be sustainably  managed
through the  participation  of  resource  users  and  beneficiaries  in  the
planning, control and conservation of the resources themselves. This has  to
be encouraged and taken further. We support this as the Free State.

Conservation  areas  create   opportunities   for   local   communities   to
participate in the management of protected areas, and in the  process  share
in the benefit of tourism, thereby improving their lives. In many  parts  of
the country this has not happened, yet it is an economic imperative  because
it provides the  basis  for  substantial  and  sustainable  economic  gains.
Millions of rural South Africans depend upon these biological resources  for
their day-to-day survival. Therefore  access  to  this  ``natural  capital''
provides a crucial  contribution  to  livelihoods,  which  is  an  important
buffer against  poverty  and  an  opportunity  for  self-employment.  It  is
therefore a ``hidden'' economy on its own at play.

It is estimated that in Gauteng alone the informal medicinal plant trade  is
worth R21 million per annum, while in KZN the trade is  worth  R60  million.
This is a huge trade indeed. It must be pushed and nurtured. The Free  State
has begun and everybody is invited to join.  It  is  for  this  reason  that
community-based natural resource management has been a particular focus  for
many of the rural development initiatives that put  emphasis  on  community-
based nature conservation and ecotourism.

That is why the maintenance  of  the  rehabilitated  wetlands  in  the  Free
State, in particular, is not only ensuring  the  availability  of  water  to
sustain the wetlands as a habitat for  biodiversity  and  to  provide  much-
needed ecological services to the surrounding community,  but  it  is  still
providing jobs to about 120  people  to  the  value  of  approximately  R2,5
million to date.

The implementation of the Bioregional Strategy, which entails the  expansion
and consolidation of the current system of protected areas from  6%  to  8%,
is under way, and this is evidenced by the expansion of  the  Addo  Elephant
National Park, with the acquisition of  new  land  for  this  purpose.  This
merely emphasizes the importance of protected areas.

Commercialisation of tourism facilities and services within protected  areas
is an example of  efforts  to  improve  management  efficiency  and  revenue
generation from protected areas. This is  a  plus  for  the  integration  of
tourism and environmental awareness.
The inter-provincial yellow fish conservation  programme  initiated  by  the
Free State province aims at conserving  rare  species  and  promoting  their
tourism potential. It has achieved great success with the  establishment  of
the informal aquatic conservation area of approximately  680  km  stretching
from Barrage to Bloemhof Dam. Fly-fishing of this species is increasing  and
this is also affecting and boosting the Free State's tourism market.

The transfrontier conservation areas, which  are  cross-border  conservation
areas, accord with the vision of Nepad of  social,  economic  and  political
integration within provinces. That's  why  we  have  the  Maluti-Drakensberg
Transfrontier Project in the Free State, which  is  a  project  between  the
Free State and Lesotho, and the Xhariep  [between  the  rivers]  Complex,  a
project involving the Free State, Eastern  Cape  and  Northern  Cape.  In  a
nutshell,  the  integration  of   environmental   awareness,   bio-diversity
management and eco-tourism promotion have to  be  packaged  as  an  economic
development tool.
On the tourism development and promotion front, tourism development and  the
formation of tourism promotion agencies  play  an  important  role  in  this
regard. The recognition of the value of these bodies bestows unto  them  the
crucial responsibility of  marketing  the  country  and  the  provinces  and
feeding  the  tourism   information-seekers   with   accurate   and   useful
information. The Free State will be joining the fray as from September  this
year.

The  important  partnership  between  provincial   tourism   agencies,   the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and SA Tourism is  res  ipsa
loquita - it is self-explanatory - and it cannot be  done  without.  It  was
described as ``sine qua non" by Mr Raju yesterday.

It therefore becomes imperative  for  tour  packages  to  be  developed  and
successfully placed in the market. We are doing it in the Free State.  Media
tours for domestic,  national  and  international  journalists  have  to  be
developed and continued for this is  important  in  packaging  and  managing
information that is so critical in  enhancing  the  tourism  thrust.  It  is
needless to say that audio-visual media would  be  of  major  assistance  in
this regard.

The development  and  launch  of  tourism  routes  and  tourism  information
centres, such as the Goldfields tourism route in  the  Free  State,  through
partnerships between districts within provinces,  is  important  for  mutual
gain and has to be encouraged. The Free State is beginning  to  realise  the
success thereof, and we are on course to developing many more.

The  development  and   launch   of   cultural   heritage   routes   through
partnerships, and within regions and districts,  should  also  be  amplified
and emphasised. With the rich cultural heritage prevalent in  this  country,
cultural tourism becomes inevitable. We have to exploit it.

The training of township  bed-and-breakfast  aspirants  should  be  embarked
upon and promoted for the benefit of the previously disadvantaged  that  are
entering the hospitality  market.  The  Free  State  had  arranged  for  the
training of 15 people, mostly women, in the northern  Free  State  district,
by an accredited hospitality trainer from the University  of  Pretoria,  and
the individual participants  received  skills  on  how  to  manage  bed-and-
breakfast establishments. We need  to  train  many  more,  because  bed-and-
breakfast business has  to  be  taken  back  to  the  townships.  There  are
friendly and professional men and women out there who are ready and  willing
to climb onto the bandwagon.

Through our widespread schools and colleges, and  partnerships  between  the
Education department and departments of tourism,  we  would  be  inculcating
the spirit of tourism awareness and tourism value that for any  one  tourist
visiting this country, province or any part of our local government,  a  few
jobs are being created as  a  result.  Come  2010,  we  would  be  having  a
passionate, tourist-friendly nation.

Through our vast and soon-to-be-upgraded sports  facilities  for  2010,  and
broad-based support of our  local  and  provincial  teams,  the  partnership
between the Departments of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,  Sports,  Arts
and Culture has to be recognised and encouraged for  it  breeds  and  builds
the passion for our cultural heritage and promotes sports tourism.

Through our state-of-the-art medical facilities, with  various  specialities
available here and unavailable there, in partnerships with  the  departments
of health in provinces, we would be indirectly  promoting  medical  tourism.
And we are aware that this is slowly and progressively emerging, as  is  the
case with those who would  like  to  change  their  faces  or  change  their
bodies, that is plastic surgery.

In conclusion, Chairperson, we, again, have to  integrate  tourism,  leisure
and heritage into an economic development tool. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J W LE  ROUX:  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to thank Premier Fishing for the lovely gift and I  am  sure  we
are all going to enjoy our snoek for supper tonight. Thank  you  very  much,
gentlemen.

Agb Voorsitter, Minister, LUR'e en kollegas, gedurende die  afgelope  aantal
jare was ons baie gelukkig om uitstekende ministers van omgewingsake  te  hê
en ons wens dan ook ons nuwe minister alles van die heel beste toe.

Veral gedurende die termyn  van  mnr  Moosa  het  bewaring  baie  aandag  en
publisiteit geniet en die breë gemeenskap het al hoe meer  onder  die  besef
gekom van hoe belangrik die  omgewing  waarin  ons  leef,  geword  het.  Die
privaatsektor het ook 'n al groter rol begin speel - hy is so groot  en  dan
loop hy nog voor ons in ook - en veral mense  soos  dr  Rupert  en  mnr  Ton
Vosloo, sowel as talle groot sake-ondernemings, het bewaring  met  woord  en
daad ondersteun.

Die groenes, en soos neerhalend na verwys is as die ``groenetjies'', het  al
belangriker begin word. Besluitnemers besef vandag  dat  miljoene  mense  in
Suid-Afrika baie trots is op ons omgewing en dat roekelose besluite net  nie
meer geduld sal word nie.

Die grootste uitdaging is nog steeds die botsende belange  van  ontwikkeling
teenoor  bewaring.  Oor  die  jare  het  dit   duidelik   geword   dat   die
ontwikkelaars feitlik altyd die oorhand gekry het. Daar is talle  voorbeelde
wat as bewyse kan dien oor hoe  skadelik  dit  vir  die  land  kan  wees  as
verkeerde besluite geneem word.

Die vernietiging van ons geboue-erfenis  is  daar  vir  almal  om  te  sien.
Pragtige historiese geboue het plek gemaak vir  glaspaleise  en  vulstasies.
Dorpe en stede se karakters is vir ewig vernietig  net  omdat  besluitnemers
geswig het voor  ontwikkelaars  en  stadsbeplanners.  As  Kapenaars  net  na
Tafelberg kyk en die drie  hoë  torings  teen  die  berg  sien,  weet  hulle
presies wat ek bedoel.

Ek wil dan ook aan die Minister voorstel dat 'n  paneel  kundiges  aangestel
moet word om hierdie vraagstuk  van  botsende  belange  op  te  los.  As  'n
ontwikkelende land het ons groot ontwikkeling nodig,  en  nuwe  riglyne  van
hoe die ontwikkelaar, sowel as die omgewing, se belange beskerm  moet  word,
moet neergelê word.

In baie gevalle besit grond- en geboue-eienaars bates wat vir  die  nageslag
behoue moet bly, maar finansiële oorwegings dwing eienaars om te  ontwikkel.
In sulke gevalle behoort daar meganismes te wees om eienaars aan  te  moedig
om nie te ontwikkel nie. So 'n aksie sal ten minste talle historiese  geboue
van sloping red. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon  Chairperson,  Minister,  MECs  and  colleagues,  we  have  been   very
fortunate during the past few years  to  have  had  excellent  ministers  of
environmental affairs, and we also wish our new Minister everything  of  the
very best.

During the term of Mr  Moosa,  in  particular,  conservation  received  much
attention and publicity, and the broad public came to realise more and  more
how important the environment in which  we  live  has  become.  The  private
sector also started playing a bigger role - he is so big, and then he  still
crosses the floor - and especially people such  as  Dr  Rupert  and  Mr  Ton
Vosloo, as well as many large business  enterprises  supported  conservation
by word and deed.

The greens, and those who were called "little greens" in a  derogatory  way,
became more and more important. Decision-makers today realise that  millions
of people in South Africa  are  very  proud  of  our  environment  and  that
reckless decisions will no longer simply be tolerated.

The greatest challenge is still the  conflicting  interests  of  development
versus conservation. It has become clear  over  the  years  that  developers
have virtually always gained the upper hand. There are many  examples  which
can serve as evidence about how harmful it can be for this country if  wrong
decisions are taken.

The destruction of our heritage as far as buildings are concerned  is  clear
for everyone to see. Beautiful  historical  buildings  made  way  for  glass
palaces and filling stations. The character of towns  and  cities  has  been
destroyed forever, simply because decision-makers yielded to developers  and
town planners. Capetonians need only look at  Table  Mountain  and  see  the
three high towers at the foot of the mountain to know exactly what I mean.

I would therefore suggest to the hon the Minister that a  panel  of  experts
be appointed to resolve this problem of  conflicting  interests.  We,  as  a
developing country, need a lot of development, and new guidelines as to  how
the interests of the  developer  as  well  as  the  environment  are  to  be
protected must be established.

In many cases owners of land  and  buildings  own  assets  which  should  be
conserved for posterity, but financial considerations force  the  owners  to
develop. In cases such as these there  should  be  mechanisms  to  encourage
owners not to develop. Such an action would at least  save  many  historical
buildings from demolition.]

That brings me to the issue of dune mining in Pondoland. As you know,  there
is an Australian company that is putting tremendous pressure  on  Government
to allow mining to take place  in  the  Pondoland  Park.  To  allow  foreign
investors to destroy our heritage is totally unacceptable.

Everybody who has  had  the  pleasure  of  visiting  this  area  will  never
understand how anybody can ever wish to destroy probably the most  beautiful
coast in the world. To use job creation as an excuse to mine  here  is  just
not true. If Government helps the ecotourism groups to  develop  tourism  in
Pondoland, many more sustainable jobs will be created and at the  same  time
this pristine area will be saved for generations to come.  I  urge  Minister
Van Schalkwyk to visit this area as soon as possible. I am  sure  that  once
he has seen for himself what heaven on earth means, he will never allow  the
destruction of the dunes.

I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister what is happening  in
and around the Addo National Park. At Addo we have the combination of  sound
management, totally dedicated staff and sufficient funds. In the space of  a
few years this Cinderella park  has  been  turned  into  the  most  exciting
tourist destination in South Africa. I will not be  surprised  if  the  Addo
Park surpasses even the Kruger National Park in time to come.

I urge members of this House to visit the Addo Park  as  soon  as  possible.
Nowhere in the world can a tourist view the range  of  wildlife  and  scenic
beauty as at Addo. Whale watching, visiting Bird  Island,  seeing  elephant,
lion,  kudu,  bushbuck  and  the  rest  in  one  park  is  an  unforgettable
experience.

The management of the  park  succeeded  in  creating  a  spirit  of  working
together with staff, the private sector and adjacent  farmers  to  create  a
better life for thousands of people in  and  around  the  park.  Mr  Lucious
Moolman and his team deserve special mention for the way in which they  have
upgraded the facilities and the effort they  have  made  to  introduce  new,
innovative experiences for visitors. The major role  that  honorary  rangers
play in supporting the staff  in  our  national  parks  also  needs  special
mention.

I believe Minister Van Schalkwyk plans to visit the Addo Park in due  course
and I suggest that he should also visit the Baviaans Nature Reserve.  It  is
my view that, in future, the Baviaans should be linked to the Addo Park.  If
this can happen the Eastern Cape would be well on its way  to  becoming  the
tourist destination in South Africa.

Die beoogde stortingsterrein wat nou so erg in die nuus is in  die  Oos-Kaap
by Grasrug naby Addo-park en naby die sitrusplase wek baie groot kommer.  Ek
versoek u om so dringend moontlik na hierdie probleem te  kyk.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The envisaged dumping site at Grasrug in the Eastern Cape  near  Addo  Park
and the citrus farms, which is receiving so much coverage  in  the  news  at
present, is cause for great concern.  I  request  you  to  investigate  this
problem as urgently as possible.]
Lastly, it has become a problem that tourists are being overcharged in  many
places in  the  country.  Obviously  there  are  many  exceptions,  but  the
perception that  South  Africa  is  not  a  value-for-money  destination  is
damaging the industry. The strong  rand  makes  us  even  less  competitive.
Added to the problem is  the  fact  that  in  many  cases  our  service  and
hospitality industries are not up to world standards. I  visited  a  popular
hotel in Stellenbosch frequented  by  tourists,  and  was  amazed  that  the
cheapest glass of wine was R38 and that the expensive wines were  priced  at
over R1 000 per bottle. Tourists are very important people  and  must  never
feel that they are being cheated. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  members,  may  I  remind  you  that  you
should not walk between the Chair and the member who is speaking.

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson,  Minister,  MECs,  special  delegates  and  hon
members, South Africa's biggest asset is its people: a rainbow  nation  with
rich and diverse cultures. Although South Africans come from  many  cultural
traditions, they belong to one nation - a dynamic blend of  age-old  customs
and modern ways that build a South African society to create a  better  life
for all.

The greatest challenge for South Africa and the rest  of  the  world  is  to
improve the quality of human life for both present  and  future  generations
without depleting its natural resources. This can only be  achieved  through
sustaining a  healthy  natural  environment  which  supplies  raw  material,
absorbs and treats  waste  products,  and  maintains  water,  soil  and  air
quality. Food security, water provision and  climatic  stability  depend  on
ecosystems  that  function  properly,   stable   levels   of   biodiversity,
sustainable rates of resource extraction and  minimal  production  of  waste
and pollution.

The Government, the Minister and the department have taken several steps  at
national, provincial and local levels which include reforming  environmental
policies, ratifying  international  agreements  and  participating  in  many
global and regional sustainable development initiatives. And,  from  what  I
have heard from the Minister, these initiatives are still ongoing.

We need to bear  in  mind  that  the  following  aspects  are  essential  to
sustaining our growing population: equitable access  to  clean  water,  land
that is able to support agriculture and air that  is  free  from  pollutants
that are detrimental to our health. By giving priority to environmental  and
tourism issues, the Minister exercises equity and justice. It  is  the  poor
who have been denied access to natural resources or who live next  to  waste
dumps.

Voorsitter, graag wil ek  net  die  Minister  geluk,  sterkte  en  voorspoed
toewens met die taak wat voorlê. Ek hoor die Minister noem in  sy  toespraak
'n paar belangrike aankondigings oor wat gaan plaasvind in die toekoms.  Ons
wil die Minister bedank vir sy toegewydheid om daadwerklike pogings  aan  te
wend om die armoede wat bestaan vas te vat, en dat hy nie soos die  DA-leier
en 'n vorige lid van die Huis, mev Antoinette Versfeld, ons  mense  loop  en
kwaadmaak het met hul leë beloftes en verdraaiing van die waarheid nie.

Die DA-leier en mev Antoinette Versfeld  het  ons  mense  op  Struisbaai  in
Augustus verlede jaar gaan besoek, en ek haal aan uit die Business  Day  van
Augustus:  ``Tony  Leon  says  that  the  Government  is   causing   coastal
communities `one hardship after another' through mismanagement.''

Ek wil net vir die agb DA-leier en die DA-lede  sê,  om  vir  ons  mense  om
verskoning te gaan vra vir die valse uitlating, want baie het gebeur  en  is
nog steeds aan die gebeur vir die ontwikkeling en opbou  in  die  visbedryf.
Die  Minister  het  aangekondig  dat  hy  vis  imbizo's  gaan  hou  in   die
vissersgemeenskappe om die visbedryf verder uit te  bou,  en  ons  verwelkom
dit, Minister. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, I would like to wish the  Minister  good  luck,  strength  and
success with the task ahead. I hear  that  the  Minister  mentions,  in  his
speech a few important announcements about what is going to  happen  in  the
future. We want to thank the Minister for his dedication  in  making  actual
attempts to deal with the poverty that exists, unlike the DA  leader  and  a
former member of the House, Mrs Antoinette Versfeld, who  are  going  around
making our people angry with their empty  promises  and  distortion  of  the
truth.

The DA leader and Mrs Antoinette Versfeld visited our people  in  Struisbaai
in August last year, and I am quoting  from  the  Business  Day  of  August:
``Tony Leon says that the Government is  causing  coastal  communities  `one
hardship after another' through mismanagement.''

I just want to tell to the hon DA leader  and  the  DA  members  to  go  and
apologise to our people for  these  false  statements,  because  a  lot  has
happened and is still happening to develop and build the  fishing  industry.
The Minister has announced that he is going to hold fishing imbizos  in  the
fishing communities to further expand the fishing industry, and  we  welcome
this, Minister.]

For the NNP the aim of sustainable development is to provide for  the  needs
of the current generation in a manner that does not jeopardise the  capacity
of  future  generations.  Economic  activity  and  mismanagement  could   be
extremely damaging and even destructive. The NNP  supports  the  initiatives
aimed at committing companies and communities to  economic  activities  that
are not harmful to nature and mankind. The NNP supports the Budget  Vote.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Ms S E MABE: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  hon  Deputy  Ministers,  hon
members and special delegates, ladies and gentlemen, I  must  add  my  small
voice  in  congratulating  the  Minister  for  his   appointment   to   this
challenging yet exciting portfolio.

The environment is the strategic sector of our society. It is an  area  that
brings and sustains life to living  organisms.  It  is  also  an  area  that
buries and hides the nonliving organisms.

My talk today, as I'm now becoming a veteran of this House,  will  focus  on
waste management. The banning of thin plastic bags was a  good  decision  by
Government because it assisted in enabling  us  to  control  or  manage  the
pollution of our environment caused by plastic bag littering in  our  parks,
veld and streets. Plastic bags were also a  danger  to  animals,  especially
cows, because once they ate them they died. It also  reduced  the  potential
for filling waste disposal sites, thus, once they were regulated, more  land
for developmental purposes could be released.

During  public  hearings  the  industry  failed  to  present  statistics  on
potential job losses. Government presented its views on sustainable  use  of
the environment and potential jobs that will  be  created  through  tourism,
because tourists want to  see  the  beauty  of  our  landscape  rather  than
plastic bags litter. Therefore the  cost  of  banning  the  manufacture  and
import of thin plastic bags in relation to job losses was far outweighed  by
the benefits of saving our environment for future generations.
Tyres are our most important instruments for  transportation  of  goods  and
people  from  one  point  to  another.  They  are  recyclable  as  retreads.
Therefore,  it  is  important  that  more  people  and   organisations   are
encouraged  to  be  more  involved  in   programmes   of   recycling   tyres
consciously.  It  means  that  the  department  must,  in  future,   present
programmes that encourage recycling of tyres  in  our  country,  since  they
take a lot of space in our landfill sites. Incentives and punitive  measures
must accompany the programme of recycling.  The  studies  or  research  show
that a lot of jobs could be created.

Glass is not biodegradable, which means that the space it occupies does  not
get reduced even if it has been there for decades. This is more  reason  for
the department to develop a programme of recycling also in  this  area.  The
department and the spheres of Government must lead an  overall  campaign  in
our country that promotes the three Rs,  that  is  to  reduce,  recycle  and
reuse. The second overall  campaign  should  be  to  encourage  and  support
municipalities in educating and providing resources to  households  to  sort
out waste from  their  homes.  All  municipalities  across  the  length  and
breadth of our country should be supported  by  the  other  two  spheres  of
Government in collecting waste on a regular basis from where people live  in
the townships, informal settlements, hostels,  mines,  villages,  towns  and
cities of our country.

Rights also go hand in hand with responsibilities. In the implementation  of
the peoples' contract, we call upon all our people from all  walks  of  life
to revive the tradition of the 80s by building the  peoples'  parks  in  the
spirit of Letsema. The process of moving  the  responsibility  for  landfill
sites from the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  to  the  Department
of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  is  commendable,  because  it  will
promote an  integrated  waste  management  system.  However,  it  should  be
speeded up and an audit of legal and illegal  landfill  sites  is  required.
The establishment and continued  funding  of  environmental  courts  by  the
Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  and  the  Department  of
Justice and Constitutional Development is therefore commended. However,  the
presiding officers and prosecutors need to  be  retrained  in  environmental
law.

As far as the prevention of air pollution is  concerned,  we  recognise  and
commend the efforts of Government, led by the  Minister,  in  encouraging  a
move to a cleaner technology. Companies like Iscor  in  the  Vaal  Triangle,
Sasol in Free State, Mondi in Merebank, Saiccor in uMkomaas and others  have
to change their way of conducting their business  activities  and  implement
the policy of Government as outlined above.

The effects of the status quo have caused serious illness to the people  who
reside near those companies. The highest law of the land,  in  Chapter  2  -
Bill of Rights, puts an obligation upon  the  democratic  and  developmental
state to ensure that its citizens live in a clean and healthy environment.

In the recent past, we have seen and experienced a lot of disasters such  as
floods in Mozambique and droughts in most parts of our country.  The  latter
has forced our Government to declare those affected  parts  of  our  country
disaster areas. We have just come out of that disaster.

We also have seen floods in some parts  of  the  United  States  of  America
where many people were killed and a lot of  property  was  destroyed  -  the
list  is  endless.  Given  this  real  state  of  affairs,  a  programme  to
proactively prepare  for  disasters,  which  must  include  sectors  of  our
society, must be activated, especially  regarding  farmers.  This  programme
will ensure that  the  devastating  effects  of  disasters  are  avoided  or
prevented.

As far as the asbestos issue is concerned, South Africa had the  courage  to
stop the mining of asbestos  in  the  interests  of  our  people  and  their
environment. However, difficulties are now arising because  Zimbabwe  has  a
thriving asbestos industry and they transport it to  Durban  via  our  rails
and roads. In addition, many Zimbabwe-based industries are starting  to  set
up businesses in South Africa. This is a complex problem that  requires  the
intervention of Foreign Affairs.

Another problem relates to the  expense  of  certain  asbestos  substitutes,
which make it difficult for asbestos use to be phased out rapidly  in  those
instances. In addition, there is a problem of secondary pollution from  mine
dumps, roads paved with asbestos, old  township  houses  and  rural  schools
with asbestos ceilings. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms T  ESSOP  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson,  Minister,
fellow MECs, special delegates, hon members,  I  rise  to  congratulate  the
Minister in the delivery of the budget speech today and congratulate him  on
a number of initiatives that he spelled out in his budget  speech.  Also,  I
want to immediately say that as the MEC responsible for  this  portfolio  in
the  Western  Cape  we  will  definitely  look  forward  to  a  very   close
partnership with you, Minister, and the initiatives that you have  mentioned
today - and especially with regard to your planned fishing  imbizo  for  the
month end of July. We  look  forward  to  co-operating  with  you  in  those
imbizos. I am sure when you indicate that there are  very  few  people  more
passionate and more vocal than the South African fishermen  or  fisherwomen,
I am certain hon Minister that you have not yet met the  taxi  industry.  In
my previous portfolio I  have  had  the  privilege  of  being  part  of  the
passionate and vocal group of taxi operators in this country.

We have a lot to celebrate today.  We  are  celebrating  a  very  resounding
victory for the ANC at a national level, but in  the  Western  Cape  we  are
also celebrating particularly the victory of the ANC and the deep honour  of
finally becoming part  of  the  rest  of  South  Africa.  But  we  are  also
celebrating our 10 years of democracy and I think it would be useful for  us
to reflect on the achievements in the environmental sector over the past  10
years.

It was only a mere 10 years ago that the environment was wrongly  upheld  as
something that had to be protected and utilised for  the  enjoyment  of  the
privileged few in this country. The  majority  of  our  people  had  limited
access to the natural wonders of our province and the rest of  the  country.
Brown environmental issues, like pollution and  waste  management,  and  its
linkages with human health, which had a direct impact  on  the  majority  of
the poor, received little or no attention.  It  was  therefore  no  surprise
that the environmental management was not  seen  as  the  key  component  of
economic growth and development. But since 1994  we  have  made  significant
strides and progress towards the realisation of  environmental  rights.  The
last decade has seen natural resource management and conservation  in  South
Africa move squarely into an arena concerned with human  rights,  access  to
natural resources, equity and environmental sustainability.

When the Constitution was adopted in 1996, the Bill  of  Rights  included  a
number of key environmental issues  including  the  right  to  a  clean  and
healthy environment and  the  right  to  have  access  to  water,  food  and
shelter. Section 24 in our Constitution enshrines our  environmental  rights
in terms of which everybody is  entitled  to  an  environment  that  is  not
harmful to their health or wellbeing. This clause also places an  obligation
on government to take certain  positive  steps,  such  as  legislating  that
pollution and ecological degradation be prevented, conservation be  promoted
and ecologically sustainable development be secured, while at the same  time
promoting economic and social development.

Although the concept of a right to an environment, which is not  harmful  to
our wellbeing, has not been fully defined, it can be said that  the  use  of
the environment in a morally responsible  way  has  an  intrinsic  value  to
people and therefore, needs to be preserved. We also have the obligation  of
safekeeping the environment for future  generations.  Our  exposure  to  the
global arena in the last 10 years has also  led  us  to  a  paradigm  shift,
which recognises very clearly the role natural resources  and  environmental
management as a  foundation  of  economic  and  social  development.  In  an
increasingly global context the environment has become the key to  our  very
survival.  Climatic  changes,  biodiversity  laws  and   diminishing   water
resources are challenges we  face.  Our  economy  is  reliant  on  soil  for
agriculture; on fish for food and our biodiversity for  tourism;  herbs  and
medicinal plants that are being promoted in the Free State - I  am  glad  to
hear, hon MEC - for health  care;  and  minerals  for  industry.  The  prime
example is the dependence of our rural  communities  on  natural  resources.
People living in these  rural  areas  remain  the  most  vulnerable  if  the
environmental degradation is not curbed, and  in  South  Africa  sustainable
development is fundamental to the  transformation  and  growth  of  our  new
democracy.

For us in South Africa, however, poverty eradication is  still  one  of  our
most critical challenges, and it is clear that our biggest priority  in  the
next 10 years of our democracy will be addressing poverty. Job creation  and
empowerment  initiatives  in  tourism,   fishing,   conservation   and   the
environmental sectors have contributed as well to this war  against  poverty
and inequality. It is in this context that  the  Western  Cape  government's
vision of building the  Western  Cape  as  a  home  for  all  is  critically
important and this vision is embraced by iKapa elihlumayo,  the  growth  and
development strategy for the Western Cape. In  striving  towards  delivering
on our commitment to iKapa elihlumayo, my  department  has  focused  on  two
critical areas: firstly, an integrated law reform process, and developing  a
provincial spatial development framework.

In respect of the integrated law reform process, it is the department's  aim
to integrate  three  critically  interrelated  but  currently  nonintegrated
processes and procedures related  to  environmental  planning  and  heritage
impacts and approvals. The objective of this law reform process  is  to  cut
the red tape. The current lengthy and  unpredictable  and  almost  certainly
costly processes, is not helpful  to  promoting  a  sustainable  development
agenda in the Western Cape and therefore this becomes  a  critical  priority
for us in this department. It is clear that we have moved a long way in  the
past decade in the  progressive  realisation  of  environmental  rights.  We
recognise this with a clear acknowledgement that still much  more  needs  to
be done.

The fundamental approach to the environment and sustainable  development  is
a rights-based one and the notion of environmental justice  is  implicit  in
South Africa's Constitutional environmental rights. Equal access to  natural
resources, social transformation, meeting basic human  needs  and  enhancing
the quality of life of all our people are key components to addressing  both
environmental  rights  and  environmental  justice.  A  critical  challenge,
however, in moving forward in  the  next  decade  will  be  to  address  the
seeming  contradictions   between   socioeconomic   rights,   the   possible
contestation between environmental rights  on  the  one  hand,  and  on  the
other,  rights  like  access  to  water,  food  and  shelter  which  pose  a
particular challenge. This is a challenge we  need  to  rise  to.  It  is  a
challenge that requires of  us  robust  debates  and  honesty.  There  is  a
perception that certain privileged sections of our society try  to  maintain
the privileged positions at the expense of the poor and  marginalised  under
the guise of the green banner.

If we are truly to achieve our Western Cape government's vision  of  a  home
for all then we need to openly  address  this  perception.  Polarisation  at
both ends of the environmental development debate might not be  helpful.  In
conclusion, I want to say that this Government has certainly  revolutionised
their views on the environment  in  the  last  decade.  We  have  a  lot  to
celebrate and we have a lot to look forward to - and I believe that our  hon
Minister will definitely rise to the occasion. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  M  M  MACKENZIE  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chair,  hon  House,  namalunga
ahlonishwayo [hon members], first of all I should like to  congratulate  the
Minister on his appointment. I don't think that  he  fully  appreciates  the
exact load that he has still to carry, but it is going to be  huge,  let  me
assure you.

I wish, at the outset, to stress  the  importance  of  sound  management  to
maintain the delicate balance between tourism and the environment.  We  have
heard that tourism is vital for the economy of  this  country  and  that  is
quite true, but it must never, ever be at the expense  of  the  environment.
The importance of recognising that  the  dedicated  people  who  manage  the
biodiversity in our parks and protected areas are normally not  commercially
inclined, I think, should be emphasised. But they are essential to the  task
of maintaining a high-quality natural environment.

Tourism, on the other hand, is a commercial operation and when  it  accesses
our parks and protected areas it must be on the basis  of  a  visitor  or  a
tenant of biodiversity or conservation. As I have  stressed,  and  I  repeat
again, a careful balance between  tourists'  minimum  requirements  and  the
sustainability of integrity in our conserved areas is essential.

I want to tell you a short story. In  order  to  facilitate  the  access  of
tourists to one of the major parks in  KwaZulu-Natal  they  built  a  tarred
road. The vehicles went faster and  they  didn't  bump  as  much  and  there
wasn't any dust and the tourists were very happy, until a tourist bus had  a
prang with a rhino. And then they put speed bumps on the tarred road. So,  I
think the House might see where we are going here in  that  Parkinson's  law
starts running amok and you end up defiling the environment in order to  try
and appease the needs of the  tourists.  It  is  therefore  unacceptable  to
allow degradation in order to satisfy or facilitate  tourism.  This  is  the
thin edge of the wedge, or, in the words of an author in England  who  shall
remain nameless, it's the story of the little girl who said, ``But I'm  only
a little bit pregnant''.

A large sector of our underprivileged society sadly cannot afford  the  high
rates that are charged for our overseas tourists. This needs,  Mr  Minister,
to be urgently addressed. It can perhaps be linked  in  an  empowerment  and
growth initiative where we link  it  with  the  establishment  of  community
conservation areas where, again, a careful  structuring  of  joint  ventures
between the private sector and conservation and tourism will  be  needed  in
order to establish a lodge, but never foregoing the equity that is  required
by the small communities that normally abound and abut our major parks.

The systematic development of these community conservation areas  has  shown
huge strides in KwaZulu-Natal and it is gratifying to note that all that  is
left to do now is to  establish  tourist  outlets  and,  as  always  in  new
conservation, these should be on the periphery of a conserved area  and  not
slap-bang in the middle, as happened in our  recent  past  when  they  built
huge hotels and so on inside the conserved area. That is going backwards.

If a comparison is ever made, it should be with the major parks  of  America
- they start in Alaska and they go all the way down to Florida - where  they
have learned  their  lesson  and  have  gutted  those  parks  of  all  human
habitation and tourist destinations which used  to  pollute,  in  their  own
way, in that they attracted bears and all sorts of other animals to eat  out
of their rubbish pits, as has happened here in this country in Skukuza  with
baboons. We don't need to learn that lesson; it's been learned  for  us.  We
must  be  very  careful  in  order  to  maintain  a  pristine,   undisturbed
environment that will carry on attracting tourists for years  to  come,  and
not spoil it today for a quick buck.

Marine and coastal management, in order to be  effective,  it  is  believed,
needs more teeth against offenders and abusers, in  much  the  same  way  as
conserved areas. The controls on  harvesting  from  the  coastline,  in  all
categories, can only be enforced  if  sufficient  policing  occurs  and  the
fines for offenders are high enough to be  a  deterrent.  Again,  I  have  a
short story. Here, in the Cape,  it's  called  elf;  in  KwaZulu-Natal  it's
called shad. There's a shad season, and it is a magnificent fish, but  there
is a legal limit to shad. As a result, frequently when it has been  found  -
it is a jumping fish - in a thick line of bush up behind the  fishermen  and
they are asked whose fish it is, they say they don't know but  they  believe
it's the new species called the Natal bush-jumping bream.
I am delighted to hear of the measures that you have taken with  regard  to,
let's say, better controls of this marine environment. The Greater St  Lucia
Wetland Park was an ambitious undertaking and I am very pleased  to  report,
as a close observer, that it is becoming a positive initiative. There  is  a
steadily growing integration of the new management with the old  and  it  is
definitely succeeding, notwithstanding the 4x4 ban.

There are, however, some clouds on  the  horizon  here.  There  are  planned
hotels at Cape Vidal and at Perriers Rocks. Again, there are several  things
that need to be adhered to: firstly, the  very  close  co-operation  of  the
surrounding communities with regard to their equity share in  these  hotels;
and secondly, that they are environmentally placed in such a way  that  they
do not offend the eye or the observer  with  regard  to  their  impact.  The
incorporation of local communities is  being  handled  in  this  Greater  St
Lucia Wetland Park with a deft touch and here - and it's  a  thing  we  very
seldom do in our speeches - I must  recognise  the  efforts  of  one  Andrew
Zaloumis, who has done a fantastic job, and he continues to do  so.  He  has
shown sensitivity in his arduous task and  you're  lucky  to  have  him,  Mr
Minister.

I am sure that your department is aware of the lessons learned,  as  I  said
earlier, by the huge American parks. They have even gone so  far  as  saying
that entry into the parks can only be on foot, horseback or by  an  electric
bus. I think that should send a message right the way  through  conservation
and if this message isn't observed we will not be able to  re-establish  the
integrity of those reserves afterwards. You will know that  people  pressure
and vehicles always lead to downgrading the quality and the integrity  of  a
conserved area.

Much has been said about environmental education, but not  enough  has  been
done. We're expecting a huge population of mainly  disadvantaged  people  to
embody and embrace a modern and sophisticated thought process, which is  the
observance of the  preservation  of  our  biodiversity,  when  they  haven't
enjoyed it. They have not been there and learned how it  works  and  why  it
should work. If we go back in our recent history  we  will  know  that  they
were denied the opportunity of  continuing  in  their  traditional  role  of
arbiters and of ombudsmen and  of  husband  to  the  environment  through  a
denial of their access to it.

Linkage with education is essential here;  but  not  only  education.  I  do
believe  that  a  sustained  effort  must  be  made  in  the  exposure,   in
particular, of the leaders in this huge sector of  disadvantaged  people  to
the environment in order that they can have their own resonating  effect  in
their areas of influence. [Time expired.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I also want  to  echo  the  sentiments  of  other
members in congratulating the Minister on  his  new  appointment.  It  means
that ... samewerking is baie belangrik in omgewingsake. As u  u  samewerking
aan ons gee, doen ons dieselfde. [...  co-operation  is  very  important  in
environmental affairs. If you give us your  co-operation,  we  will  do  the
same.]

Environmental affairs and tourism seem to suggest that we are talking  about
two things that do not have a common ideology. An environment  that  is  not
appealing or does not offer any scenery that will  attract  the  human  mind
cannot attract tourism. I believe that South Africa's people  have  a  knack
for finding fresh solutions that are sustainable, and that  this  will  have
an impact on the lives of those who were not part and parcel of tourism.  An
everlasting solution will help towards building a better  tomorrow  for  all
South Africans. This will be an inspiration to anyone outside  South  Africa
and encourage tourism.

Our country has so much to offer in terms of  tourism.  Natural  vegetation,
as can be experienced at Kirstenbosch in the Cape, has much to offer.  There
are so many species of plants and trees that one can study, but who  of  the
locals go to Kirstenbosch? Probably only a few  of  us  go  there.  Hluhluwe
Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal and the Kruger  National  Park  in  Mpumalanga
can both boast that they have the big five there. How many of us  go  there?
Because of finance, very few of us go there.

The Sudwala Caves in Mpumalanga also has a long  history.  How  many  of  us
have visited it? That history has probably been forgotten. Nobody  remembers
what happened when the Zulus chased Nkosi Sobhuza and he  hid  there.  There
is still a mark at the entrance from the fire made by the  Zulus  when  they
wanted to suffocate him with smoke. But nobody knows that history. Go  there
and find out the history.

I also want to mention Wonderboom in Pretoria in Gauteng. I don't  know  how
true its name is. Nobody can go close to that tree. They say that  when  you
go to  it,  it  just  "bathi  ikhala  njengembuzi."  [cries  like  a  goat.]
[Laughter.] But we don't know how true it is.

The IFP would like to see a programme  that  starts  at  school  level  that
encourages our children  to  visit  their  historical  places  without  high
costs. We thank the Minister and his department for  introducing  the  Sho't
Left programme that suggests it's  possible:  ``Laat  waai!''  [Get  going!]
This program is an eye-opener for many things to  come.  But  to  make  this
happen, we should devise means of  creating  ways  of  meeting  an  ordinary
South African citizen's pocket. If we know our  environment  very  well,  we
will be more able to entertain  our  visitors  from  other  countries.  It's
possible. ``Laat Waai!'' [Get going!]

It cannot be  denied  that  South  Africa  has  one  of  the  richest,  most
biologically diverse and most oceanographically complex marine  environments
on earth. While we boast about our big five, let no one forget that we  have
the big sea five - namely the whale, shark, dolphin, marlin  and  tuna.  But
to go back - I know that I probably have very little time left - I  want  to
appeal to the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to  look  into
the following matter. I have heard a story about the  deforestation  of  the
Madimbo Corridor. I think I will not go into what Nkosi Khorombi  Mutele  of
the Mutele tribe said about this. The department  of  environmental  affairs
and tourism in Limpopo says that it is  unable  to  intervene  until  issues
such as the land claim is settled. The nature reserve belongs to  the  SANDF
and the Mutele tribe wants half of it.

As u, Minister, in hierdie saak kan ingryp, kan ons die  natuur  bewaar  vir
ons toekoms en vir ons kinders. Ek dank u.  [Applous.]  [If  you,  Minister,
could intervene we can conserve nature  for  our  future  and  that  of  our
children. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs B N DLULANE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, hon special  delegates
in the House, let me  first  join  the  House  by  congratulating  you,  hon
Minister. Welcome in this House. This is  the  House  that  will  help  take
whatever decisions made by  your  department  to  the  people  of  the  nine
provinces.

Firstly, our President on the occasion of the state of the  nation  address,
committed the Government of South Africa  to  more  active  intervention  on
behalf of the people trapped in the second  economy.  Therefore,  as  public
representatives,  currently  and  recently  mandated  by   an   overwhelming
majority of our people, by our presence here today we also commit  ourselves
to  eradicating  poverty  amongst  our  people,  especially  the  previously
disadvantaged, so that we strengthen their confidence  in  the  nobility  of
humanity and help sustain their hopes for a glorious life for all.

This, therefore, indicates that not all has been achieved. There is still  a
lot to be done. The  fact  that  we  are  at  least  still  far  above  many
countries should not make us  complacent.  But  as  South  Africans  with  a
common destiny and goal, we should all be committed  to  the  implementation
of the people's contract to create work and fight poverty.  This  will  also
serve as a mirror where all hon  members  in  this  House  will  assess  and
evaluate our roles as public representatives as to whether, in our time,  we
have  had  an  impact  on  the  lives  of  ordinary  South  Africans  -  the
illiterate, homeless, hungry, those  dying  from  preventable  diseases  and
also victims of unhealthy working conditions.

I want to confine my speech to the activities  of  the  marine  and  coastal
management branch of the department. It was unfortunate  that  the  Minister
dealt with this sector vigorously. I will try to change my  speech  as  time
goes by. It is gratifying to note the following  achievements,  namely,  the
declaration recently of the four new marine protected areas;  that  we  have
now come to completion of the four year commercial fishery  rights  process;
the recent opening of the second environmental court in Port  Elizabeth,  as
well as the planned upgrading  of  it  to  regional  court  level;  and  the
awarding of an additional 850 subsistence fishing rights to  communities  in
KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.

There is still the ongoing problem of the poor level of service  to  fishing
communities - an area still in need of a  lot  of  improvements,  despite  a
number of changes having been made to the system a year ago.  That's  why  I
have said that I will be changing my speech, because I have  a  document  in
front of me from the communities from my area, the Eastern  Cape.  It  is  a
cry for help from the community on the Wild Coast.

Perhaps the presentation of our Minister today is aimed at us -  the  people
of the  Eastern  Cape.  Perhaps  he  will  provide  some  answers  to  their
complaints. Today I listened carefully when the Minister said  that  fishing
imbizos would be held with  commercial  fishing  in  the  Eastern  Cape  and
KwaZulu-Natal during next month. But I'm pleading that if  they  still  have
some time whether those areas, especially those people  that  have  come  to
Parliament, can't  be  included?  They  are  not  here  to  present  to  the
committee - they have just come to me as the representative  of  that  area.
Could they please be included?

This imbizo will help the department  and  the  communities,  because  these
three areas that they will be visiting are on the other side of the  Eastern
Cape. So, if you can check your dates, 20, 29 and 30 July,  could  you  also
include the other side of the Eastern Cape, the former  Transkei,  the  area
of Lusikisiki where the poorest of the poor live. I've seen  that  in  other
areas, even in that province, you as a department have delivered.

We say, ``Halala! Huntshu!''  to  Marine  and  Coastal  Management  for  the
relief they created for our people in the  Working  for  the  Coast  project
where a considerable number of jobs for  youth  and  women,  in  particular,
were created. But a lot still needs to  be  done  -  and  it  can  be  done.
Something has been done, even in the area where I'm from, but we cannot  run
away from the fact that there are those who are still  not  benefiting  from
this poverty alleviation in subsistence fishing.

The emphasis on the Centani region in the Eastern Cape and  other  areas  in
KwaZulu-Natal is  commendable,  as  the  communities  along  the  coast  now
actively  participate  in  upgrading  their  environment  while   they   are
improving their lives at the same time. The Working for  the  Coast  project
resulted in more than 55 teams  of  workers  forming  along  South  Africa's
coast to upgrade the environment, with  many  of  them  starting  their  own
small businesses. Congratulations, please carry on with the good  work,  but
a lot can still be done. The marine and coastal  management  branch  is  the
economic hub of this department, Government and country. It is  the  driving
force in the national economy, its products account for  about  30%  of  the
country's  national  Gross  Domestic  Product,  thus  it   has   development
potential.

We note with appreciation the achieved level of transformation in  the  2001
rights allocation, unsurpassed anywhere in  this  country.  [Interjections.]
The opinion of the hon member behind me means that the select committee  and
standing committee must physically visit the area of Pondoland in  order  to
assist the Ministry and the department by hearing the views  of  the  people
on the ground. [Applause.]

Mr P G MASAULLE (Eastern Cape): Thank you  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and
hon MECs as well as hon members of this House. Many speakers before me  have
congratulated the Minister and I would like to join  them.  I  may  as  well
borrow from hon MacKenzie when he makes the observation that indeed  in  the
department the Minister has very competent officials. He mentioned  one  and
I would like to say that indeed there are many and I think it is a  resource
that will ensure that hopefully the Minister succeeds. Having said  that,  I
wish to say that we want to table a few issues in welcoming the Budget  Vote
that we support. Some of these issues are under consideration  already,  and
some we wish would receive more attention, be it  by  way  of  consolidation
and acceleration.

I am aware that the Minister most  recently  visited  our  province  and  we
welcome that. Indeed, its an indication of a commitment to consult with  and
engage provinces on matters that have  a  bearing  on  those  provinces.  We
think that it is a matter that we want to hale and  encourage  the  Minister
to proceed with, and from  his  speech  it  is  a  very  clearly  elaborated
commitment to that venture. We think it is welcome because it epitomises co-
operative governance and that is what I want to spend time on.

I cannot agree with the Minister more in  saying  that  the  brief  of  that
department is so wide-ranging that it cannot be  a  speech  of  tabling  one
Vote which would have  covered  all  those  aspects.  And  indeed  even  the
commentary that I listened to in the debates does confirm the  diversity  of
the opinion around some of the issues that have to do with  the  department.
Surely, it is quite a mammoth task.

So far working apart does not assist but rather compromises our  ability  to
make a very significant impact. We have observed  developments  that  indeed
through efforts of trial and error we have reached a  point  where,  between
the provinces and the national department,  an  effort  towards  integrating
and aligning the vision and mission as well as the strategic objectives  has
been arrived at. We think that it must now be taken to  a  higher  phase,  a
phase  of  actual  implementation  to  ensure  as  we  say,  guided  by  the
Constitution, that we have one Government which is able to move  all  of  us
in step in terms of ensuring delivery to our people.

If I may just pick up on the environmental sector, particularly the  attempt
to ensure proper funding of  that  sector  given  its  contribution  to  the
country's GDP. We hale and welcome the attempt of the establishment of  ten-
by-ten between all  the  provinces,  the  national  department  as  well  as
National Treasury as a way of  trying  to  ensure  that  funding  for  these
programmes in the environmental sector are indeed properly provided for.  We
think that we will implore the Minister to look into that and encourage  and
accelerate it. We think from there better rewards can be achieved.

Related to the law reform process, we have seen  going  through  this  House
and through the provinces a number of pieces of legislation  and  amendments
that have been effected. We think that attempts like the ones  I  have  just
alluded to, the ten-by-ten, etc,  and  other  fora  should  be  explored  to
ensure effectiveness  of  these  pieces  of  legislation  that  are  passed,
because  without  appropriate  funding  we  may  not  be  able   to   ensure
enforcement and compliance with all the intentions  of  these  Bills.  There
are a few issues that require  immediate  intervention,  we  think.  One  of
those, the issue of mining which hon member Le Roux has  commented  on,  was
the reason the Minister had visited us in the province. We would  only  want
to   encourage   greater   co-operation   between   national    departments,
particularly those that are involved such as the Department of Minerals  and
Energy as well as the Department of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism.  And
if need be,  we  must  create  an  environment  where  our  counterparts  at
provincial as well as local level are brought  in  so  that  Government  can
speak with one voice on these matters. Because it may not do us any good  to
have in the same government departments a difference of views  on  important
development matters that have a bearing on a number  of  issues,  let  alone
the wellbeing of our environment, we do think that there needs to be  better
co-ordination; and we  are  committed  to  ensuring  that,  indeed,  we  act
together to realise the potential that we have.

The second matter that I want to talk about is the issue of the  roads.  Hon
MacKenzie spoke about the road through the reserve, etc - the N2  toll  road
specifically. We have made our views known on the matters as a province  and
to the best of our recollection we share the same views with the  Department
of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. We think that those matters  that  are
outstanding and the concerns that have been raised have to be  listened  to,
considered properly and the matter be laid to  rest  in  the  best  possible
manner with all the views having been heard.

Lastly, let me address the issue of the proclamation of the national  parks.
Even there we think that we have moved closer to one another. In fact, I  do
not think there is as yet any other  difficulty  in  terms  of  taking  this
matter to its logical conclusion. The Minister has our  support  in  respect
of this, particularly the Pondoland Park marine area  and  all  the  matters
related to that. We want to  see  those  things  concluded  as  speedily  as
possible.

The other hon members have spoken at length on  the  issue  of  tourism  and
again coming from a province like ours, a very beautiful province  like  the
Eastern Cape, it is such a critical matter that it is very much  central  in
terms of all the endeavours to try and deal with the legacy, the  challenges
of development and poverty alleviation, etc.

We look forward with keen interest and I have taken note that  the  Minister
has, through this platform, extended  an  invitation  for  participation  in
exploring the question of the BEE scorecard in the tourism sector.  We  look
at that with keenness, we want to participate and thank you once  again  for
having been invited to participate in that process.

In conclusion, I am trying to emphasise co-operation  and  co-ordination.  I
am saying that the Minister has taken the bull by the horns in this  respect
and we welcome that. We want to see more of that because we believe that  we
can only succeed in all these challenges and they become  much  easier  when
we confront them collectively. Once again we wish to support the  Vote,  the
Minister and his department and wish them well in their endeavours.

Mnr W WATSON: Agb Voorsitter, in hierdie debat wil ek my graag rig  tot  die
kwessie van toerisme, maar ek dink u sal my vergun om my vir 'n enkele  paar
oomblike tot die Minister te rig.

Ek wil die Minister gelukwens met sy aanstelling, hierdie  nuwe  aanstelling
van hom - ek dink hy sal verstaan as ek my nie wil uitspreek daaroor  nie  -
maar ek wil tog hier in die Huis 'n beroep  op  hom  doen  om  nie  soos  sy
kollegas in die ander debatte verplig te voel om net die DA aan te val nie.

Die afgelope weke, in dié Huis, is die debatte gekenmerk  deur  aanvalle  op
ons sprekers, eerder as om krities te luister na  wat  gesê  is  en  om  dit
analities te bespreek. Tydens die vorige sitting het  die  agb  lid  Kenneth
Sinclair,  wat  hier  voor  my  sit  en  lid  is   van   die   Minister   se
strokiesprentparty, in die debat  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  ...  'n  kulkunsie
uitgevoer in dié Huis, mnr die Minister, deur 'n blanko foptoespraak  op  te
skeur toe hy ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr W WATSON: Hon Chairperson, in this debate I would like  to  address  the
issue of tourism, but I believe you will allow me to  address  the  Minister
for a few moments.

I wish to  congratulate  the  Minister  on  his  appointment,  on  this  new
appointment of his - I believe he will  understand  if  I  do  not  wish  to
express an opinion on that - but I nevertheless want to appeal  to  him  not
to feel obliged to attack only the DA here in the House, as  his  colleagues
do in other debates.

In recent weeks, debates in this House have been marked by  attacks  on  our
speakers, rather than listening  critically  to  what  was  being  said  and
discussing it analytically. In the  last  session  the  hon  member  Kenneth
Sinclair, who is sitting here in front of me and belongs to  the  Minister's
cartoon strip party, in the debate  ...  [Interjections.]  ...  performed  a
conjuring trick in this House, hon Minister, by tearing  up  a  blank,  fake
speech when he ... [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, Order! I am making a  point  of
order from the Chair. Can you kindly concentrate on the debate and not  make
reference to the speech of the previous debate, please?

Mr W WATSON: I am delivering preliminary remarks to the  Minister  like  all
other speakers are allowed to do. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I said not to make a reference to  the
previous debate.

Mr W WATSON. Very well, I will not mention anybody, but a  speech  was  made
and that we can't get away from.

'n Agb lid het 'n foptoespraak gelewer deur 'n blanko papier  op  te  skeur,
en toe die res van die jeugdebat gebruik om die DA aan te val. Pleks van  om
op die jeug te mik, was sy toespraak dus in die geheel 'n aanval op die  DA.
Die enigste raakpunt tussen die onderwerp van die debat en sy toespraak  was
die groeiende, energieke jeudigheid van die vierjarige DA,  in  teenstelling
met  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  ...  magbehepte,  stagnerende   90-jarige   ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[An hon member made a fake speech by tearing up a blank piece of  paper  and
then used the rest of  the  youth  debate  to  attack  the  DA.  Instead  of
addressing the youth, his whole speech was an attack on  the  DA.  The  only
connection between the topic of the debate and his speech was  the  growing,
energetic  youthfulness  of  the  four-year-old  DA,  in  contrast  to   ...
[Interjections.]   ...    power-hungry,    stagnating,    90-year-old    ...
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Let me take  a  point  of  order.  Hon
member, could you take your seat? Hon Watson, can you take your seat?

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, on a point  of  order,  I  think  the  member  is
disrespectful to the Chair. You have made a ruling that no reference  should
be made to the previous debate in the House, which  happened  on  the  15th,
but the member continues to undermine the ruling. Now I would  request  that
the member respects the presiding officer. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The order is sustained  and  I  really
want to warn the hon member that you do not make reference to the debate  of
the 15th. Proceed with your speech. Thank you.

Mr W WATSON: I apologise hon Chair. I thought you said I  should  not  refer
to the speaker. That is what I  heard.  I  won't  carry  on;  you  saw  what
happened. I would rather refer to the speaker from the  same  party  earlier
in this debate where, instead of focusing  on  the  debate  of  tourism  and
nature conservation, he again attacked the DA. They have nothing else to  do
and I suspect they are acting on instructions.

Maar kom ons los dit daar. Blaffende honde byt nie. Ek vertrou  werklik  dat
hierdie toesprake nie 'n opdrag van hoër op is nie. [But let us leave it  at
that. Barking dogs don't bite. I really trust that these  speeches  are  not
as a result of an instruction from higher up.]
Let me get back to tourism. We are blessed with so many  splendours  in  our
wonderful country that  it  is  no  wonder  that  tourism  is  probably  the
industry with the biggest growth potential today. However, one of the  major
issues facing the industry is the availability of properly  trained  tourism
officials and staff and it  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  growth  of  the
industry as such.

The DA suggests that the many training facilities lying dormant  and  unused
all over South Africa should be utilised as centres  for  the  training  and
education  of  tourism  officials  and  for  that  matter,  of  rangers.  My
province, Mpumalanga, is the pantry, the powerhouse and  the  playground  of
South Africa alone. I can quote many examples,  such  as  the  Elijah  Mengo
College  of  Education  near  Gutshwa  Hoek  and  the  Ngwenya  College   at
Kwanyamazane. Both are very close to  Nelspruit  where  one  of  the  soccer
stadia for 2010 is to be erected. Just across the  border  at  Bushbuckridge
in Limpopo you will also find the previous college of  education  is  now  a
very underutilised community centre  where  the  massive  infrastructure  is
falling to pieces and the roadways are not good.

A start was made in Mpumalanga in this respect  with  the  establishment  of
the MTA, the so-called Mpumalanga Tourist Academy that is  a  joint  venture
between the provinces, the departments of education,  economic  affairs  and
tourism. The project was earmarked to start earlier this  year,  I  believe,
but I am informed that whilst the latter  departments,  the  departments  of
economic affairs and tourism had fulfilled their  financial  obligations  no
funds have been forthcoming from the  Department  of  Education.  I  realise
that such actions would be provincial competencies but I am  sure  that  the
Minister, having the wellbeing of tourism in the whole of  South  Africa  at
heart, will be able to influence his colleagues and these  Minmecs  that  he
heads in this regard. Another major stumbling  block  in  the  roll  out  of
tourism is the state of ... [Time expired.]

Mnr P W SAAIMAN (Noord-Kaap): Baie  dankie,  agb  Voorsitter.  Ook  van  die
Noord-Kaap se kant af, ons gelukwense aan u as Minister,  agb  Minister,  en
die departement. Ons ervaar 'n sterk, nuwe dinamiek van u kant  af  wat  ons
baie bemoedig, veral die wyse waarop  u  bereid  is  om  op  praktiese  wyse
sensitiewe sake te  benader.  Ons  is  dankbaar  daarvoor.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr P W SAAIMAN (Northern Cape): Thank you very much, hon Chairperson.  Also
from the side of the Northern Cape, our congratulations to you as  Minister,
hon Minister, and the department. We are experiencing a strong, new  dynamic
from your side which encourages us, especially the manner in which  you  are
prepared to approach  sensitive  matters  in  a  practical  manner.  We  are
grateful for that.]

Hon Chairperson, I'm  glad  that  the  hon  Minister,  in  introducing  this
debate, has referred so widely to the fishing industry, for it is  an  issue
of much concern to the Northern Cape people and in particular to  those  who
are making their living from the sea. South Africa's western  coastal  shelf
is one of the richest marine ecosystems in  the  world,  and  much  of  this
shelf is in the Northern Cape waters. On the other hand, one can  rightfully
ask, is this province getting its fair share?

As  ons   egter   kyk   na   die   haglike   lewensomstandighede   van   die
vissergemeenskappe suid van Hondeklipbaai en daarvandaan noord tot  by  Port
Nolloth en verder wat in dié gebied woon, is dit duidelik dat ten spyte  van
die visbronne in hul hinterland, min daarvan oorspoel na hul  kant  van  die
draad. Van hierdie dorpies in geheel het in  die  verlede  hul  ontstaan  te
danke gehad aan die visbedryf.  Die  bestaande  viskwotabeleid  het  daartoe
gelei dat die inwoners van dié dorpe, in 'n groot  mate,  totaal  geïgnoreer
is en dat die  visserspioniers  hier  in  absolute  hongersnood  en  ellende
verkeer. Dít terwyl die uitkoms langs hulle in die see is, maar volgens  wet
mag hulle dit nie aanraak nie.

Die Noord-Kaapregering, sy politieke leiers  en  hierdie  vissergemeenskappe
het my versoek om dié geleentheid te gebruik om aan u te sê dat  die  Noord-
Kaap beslaan bykans 380 km van hierdie Weskuskuslyn waar  tonne  vis,  kreef
en ander marinebronne geoes word, en ons dring  nou  aan  op  ons  regmatige
deel sodat ons armoede en werkloosheid aan dié kusgebied kan bekamp.

Selfs die maatskappye wat werk  hier  verskaf  het  in  die  visfabrieke  in
Namakwaland het hul infrastruktuur opgepak en nader  aan  die  Kaap  getrek.
Gesprekke met  vissermanne  is  deurspek  met  diepe  ontevredenheid,  selfs
hartseer en teleurstelling. Hulle is veral  besorg  oor  die  min  tot  geen
viskwotas en die nyweraars wat die bedryf na die Kaap  toe  trek  -  en  dit
nadat hulle klaar winste gemaak het - ongeag die nadelige  invloed  wat  hul
optrede inhou vir die plaaslike bevolking.

Terwyl daar waardering is vir die  onlangse  lynvispermitte  vir  sukkelende
bestaansvissers, gaan daar 'n roepstem op van dié gemeenskappe dat die  nuwe
sisteem waarvolgens kwotas toegeken gaan word  'n  beter  bedeling  vir  die
mense van die Noord-Kaap sal moet bring. Ons sien uit na die  imbizo  wat  u
in Port Nolloth  gaan  hou  in  September,  want  dit  is  belangrik  dat  u
eerstehands by ons mense hoor wat die situasie is en hoe  dit  verbeter  kan
word.

Ons is gereed om hierdie groter kwotas te hanteer  om  groter  tonnemaat  te
verwerk, maar ons is ook deeglik bewus van die werklikhede ten  opsigte  van
ons marinebron. Die vis word minder  en  nie  meer  nie,  hoewel  ons  almal
aandring op meer. Ons verstaan dat dit goed  bestuur  moet  word  sodat  dit
volhoubaar kan wees, én bly, vir ons almal en vir ons  kinders  hierná.  Ons
verwelkom dus reeds die ingestelde maatreëls om  ons  viswaters  te  beskerm
teen rowers.

Die wêreld se vangste het sedert 1989 van 89  miljoen  ton  gestyg  tot  100
miljoen ton in 2000, waar dit vasgestel is, maar ons weet mos dat in 13  van
die wêreldoseane of sogenaamde "global oceans'' word daar  alreeds  te  veel
vis gevang. Daar word bereken dat die wêreld se gebruik van  vis  'n  tekort
van 37,5 miljoen ton teen 2010 gaan toon. Dié druk op ons  marinebronne  sal
verlig moet word. Daar is 'n oplossing en  wêreldwyd  word  die  bron  reeds
aangevul met akwakultuur, maar Afrika en Suid-Afrika lê  dormant  sover  dit
akwakultuur betref.

In hierdie Raad - en ons het dit vandag weer beleef - hoor ek  die  afgelope
twee jaar hoe die eerwaarde Moatshe, voorsitter van die gekose  komitee  oor
dié portefeulje, en andere, herhaaldelik pogings aanwend om  ons  aan  boord
te  kry  én  te  motiveer  om  betrokke  te  raak  by  die  bevordering  van
akwakultuur, en om onder andere met vis te begin boer.  Daar  is  sowat  262
spesies  waarmee  wêreldwyd  reeds  geboer  word.  China  is  die   grootste
produsent van 57% van  die  wêreldhoeveelheid  wat  geoes  word;  Asië  17%;
Europa 11%; maar Afrika produseer net 0,4%.

Die  Noord-Kaap   het   alles   wat   nodig   is   om   'n   noemenswaardige
akwakultuurindustrie te vestig. Ons moet die leiding neem, want  dit  is  'n
uitstekende gereedskapstuk om nie  net  voedselsekerheid  te  verseker  nie,
maar ook om talle werkgeleenthede te skep en om armoede die nekslag  toe  te
dien. In die Noord-Kaap is ons besig om 'n taakspan te  oorweeg  om  stukrag
aan die ontwikkeling van so 'n nywerheid in die provinsie te  gee.  Ons  sal
die projek met die agb Minister wil deel en saam met hom die pad  wil  loop.

[If, however, we look at the  shameful  living  conditions  of  the  fishing
communities living in this area south of Hondeklip Bay and from there  north
to Port Nolloth and further, it  is  clear  that  notwithstanding  the  fish
resources in their hinterland, very little of it flows over  to  their  side
of the fence. Some of these  towns  owed  their  existence  totally  to  the
fishing industry. The existing fishing quota policy led to the residents  of
these towns being largely ignored and that the fishing pioneers  are  living
in absolute hunger and misery there. This while relief is to be  found  next
to them in the sea, but according to law they are not allowed to touch it.

The Northern Cape  government,  its  political  leaders  and  these  fishing
communities requested me to use  this  opportunity  to  tell  you  that  the
Northern Cape covers approximately 380 km of  this  West  Coast  line  where
tons of fish, crayfish and other marine resources are being  harvested,  and
we are  demanding  our  fair  share  so  that  we  can  combat  poverty  and
unemployment in this coastal area.

Even the companies that supplied work  here  in  the  fishing  factories  in
Namaqualand packed up their infrastructure and moved  closer  to  the  Cape.
Talks with fishermen are  larded  with  dissatisfaction,  even  sadness  and
disappointment. They are especially concerned about the few  or  no  fishing
quotas and the manufacturers moving the industry to  the  Cape  -  and  this
after they had already made their profits - regardless  of  the  detrimental
influence their actions have on the local population.

While  there  is  appreciation  for  the  recent  line-fishing  permits  for
struggling existing fishermen, a cry goes up  from  these  communities  that
the new system according to which quotas will  be  allocated  must  bring  a
better dispensation for the people of the  Northern  Cape.  We  are  looking
forward to the imbizo you will be  having  in  Port  Nolloth  in  September,
because it is important that you hear for yourself  what  the  situation  is
and how it can be improved upon.

We are ready to handle these bigger quotas to process more tons, but we  are
also thoroughly aware of the realities with regard to our  marine  resource.
The fish are getting less and not more, even though we are all insisting  on
more.  We  understand  that  it  has  to  be  managed  well  for  it  to  be
sustainable, and remain so, for all of us and for our children after us.  We
therefore already welcome the established measures to  protect  our  fishing
waters against plunderers. The world's catches  increased  from  89  million
ton in 1989 to 100 million ton in 2000, where it has been estimated, but  we
know that in 13 of the world oceans, or  so-called  global  oceans,  already
too much fish is being landed. It is estimated that the world's use of  fish
will show a shortage of 37,5 million ton by 2010.

This pressure on our marine resources will have to be relieved. There  is  a
solution and worldwide the  resource  is  already  being  supplemented  with
aquaculture, but Africa and South Africa lie dormant as far  as  aquaculture
is concerned.

In this Council - and we experienced it again  today  -  for  the  last  two
years I have been listening to how the Reverent Moatshe, chairperson of  the
select committee on this portfolio, and others repeatedly attempt to get  us
aboard and to motivate us to get involved with the promotion of  aquaculture
and to, inter alia, start farming with fish. There  are  about  262  species
already being farmed with worldwide. China is the largest  producer  of  57%
of the world quantity being harvested; Asia  17%,  Europe  11%,  but  Africa
only produces 0,4%.

The  Northern  Cape  has  everything  needed  to  establish  an  aquaculture
industry of note. We have to take the lead, because  this  is  an  excellent
tool not only to ensure food security,  but  also  to  create  numerous  job
opportunities and to deal poverty a deathblow. In the Northern Cape  we  are
busy considering a task team to give driving power  to  the  development  of
such an industry in the province. We would like to share  the  project  with
the hon Minister and work alongside him.]

More research is needed to harness the full potential of aquaculture in  the
region, for the possibilities are enormous. The Northern Cape  has  numerous
competitive advantages, such as unpolluted, clear  and  fresh  water;  cheap
land;  good  infrastructure;  and  the  will  to  expand  our  research  and
development base.

We are already  producing  oysters  and  are  looking  into  expanding  this
industry. The demand for abalone exceeds the supply  and  the  opportunities
that exist here to export our  farming  technology  for  abalone,  which  is
developed  in  South  Africa,  have  potential.  Freshwater   and   seawater
ornamental fish production have all the potential to bloom in South  Africa,
given the difficulties the Asian farmers are experiencing in terms of  water
quality, disease and poor environmental management.

The Northern Cape is uniquely placed to enter this market on a large  scale,
because it has the suitable conditions for farming  both  marine  ornamental
fish on the West Coast  and  freshwater  ornamental  fish  along  the  Lower
Orange  River.  We  are  also  investigating  at  the  moment  the  suitable
harvesting of and the adding of value to our fish source in our local dams.

With all the demands on our marine resources and the  challenges,  as  spelt
out here today, now is the time to develop  an  alternative  marine  source,
like the chicken industry, an industry that will feed  the  multitudes  with
aquatic chickens. [Laughter.]

Wanneer die agb Minister oor toerisme praat, en toe hy  die  ``Sho't  Left"-
veldtog bekendgestel het, kon ek nie anders nie as om opgewonde te raak  oor
die  unieke  toerisme,  ekotoerisme,   avontuurtoerisme   en   menige   meer
natuurlewetoerisme wat ons in die Noord-Kaap kan bied.  Net  in  die  Noord-
Kaap bestaan dié omstandighede nog.

'n Redelike groep mense volg reeds die son na die  Noord-Kaap,  maar  daar's
ruimte vir meer. Die Noord-Kaap se sterreland  geniet  reeds  internasionale
erkenning, en ons edelgesteentes en diamante is alombekend.  Die  Noord-Kaap
is  net  'n  ``sho't  left''  en  'n  ideale  bestemming  vir  plaaslike  en
internasionale   besoekers   opsoek   na   die   onontdekte   harmonie   van
onaangeraakte natuur wat nog in die Noord-Kaap en min ander plekke bestaan.

Vir die toeris bied die Noord-Kaap 'n  uiteenlopende  verskeidenheid.  Binne
30 jaar na die eerste diamant ontdek  is  in  Hope  Town  was  Kimberley  'n
vooruitstrewende stad van wêreldgehalte. Dié dorp was selfs die eerste  plek
wat elektriese straatligte gehad het.

Jaarliks word Namakwa in sy  mooiste  baadjie  getooi  deur  blomme,  en  'n
hanetree verder  word  die  prag  en  praal  gekontrasteer  met  die  dorre,
saagtandberge van die Richtersveld - ideal  vir  viertrekvoertuigverkenning.
Die Kalahari huisves 40 van Suid-Afrika se 67 roofvoëlspesies.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When the hon Minister talks about  tourism,  and  when  he  introduced  the
``Sho't Left'' Campaign, I couldn't help but get excited  about  the  unique
tourism, ecotourism, adventure tourism and many  more  kinds  of  wild  life
tourism that we can offer in the Northern Cape. It is only in  the  Northern
cape that these circumstances still exist.

Quite a number of people are already  following  the  sun  to  the  Northern
Cape, but there is room  for  more.  The  Northern  Cape's  starry  land  is
already receiving international recognition  and  our  precious  stones  and
diamonds are known by all. The Northern Cape is only a  ``sho't  left''  and
an ideal destination for local and international visitors in search  of  the
undiscovered harmony of untouched nature which still exists in the  Northern
Cape and very few other places.

The Northern Cape provides the tourist with a wide variety. Within 30  years
after the first  diamond  was  discovered  in  Hope  Town,  Kimberly  was  a
progressive world-class city. This town was even the  first  place  to  have
electric streetlights.

Every year Namaqualand is dressed in its most beautiful garment of  flowers,
and a stone's throw further this pomp and splendour  is  contrasted  by  the
barren,  saw-toothed  mountains  of  the  Richtersveld  -  ideal   for   4X4
expeditions. The Kalahari houses 40 of South Africa's 67  species  of  birds
of prey.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr P W SAAIMAN: Just to conclude, Chairperson.

Die bekende Kgalagadi-oorgrenspark lê knus tussen  Botswana  en  Namibië  se
grense. Hier speel die groot troppe bokke en wilde katte  deurgaans  kat-en-
muis  met  mekaar.  Dankie,  Meneer   die   Voorsitter.   [Tyd   verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The well-known Kgalagadi  Transfrontier  Park  is  nestled  snugly  between
Botswana and Namibia's borders. Here the large herds of buck and  wild  cats
play a game of cat-and-mouse. Thank you, Chairman. [Time expired.]]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  I  must  make  the
following observations. As much as I don't want to make  it  unpleasant  for
anybody, I think there must be consistency when I make a  ruling  that  your
time is up and it should be observed by everybody else. If I  allow  you  to
proceed in the way members have been proceeding, I'll be seen to be  partial
by other members of the House, and that would be a legitimate  claim.  So  I
really want to appeal to members that when I make a ruling about the  expiry
of your time it should be strictly observed, OK? I  now  call  the  hon  Rev
Adolph. [Interjections.] OK, I now call the hon R Tooley.

Mr R TOOLEY (Limpopo): Hon Chairperson, Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,
hon MECs and hon delegates to the NCOP, it is  a  privilege  and  honour  to
address this august House  on  this  particular  day,  and  we  welcome  and
support the Budget Vote.

We acknowledge and commend the transformation that has taken place  in  this
department over the past 10 years. Environment and tourism, like most  other
jurisdictions in our province, fall within  one  particular  department  and
that is something of concern. These two structures, namely, environment  and
the parks board, in our province are responsible  for  managing,  protecting
and ensuring that any development that  takes  place  is  in  a  sustainable
manner and that our biodiversity is protected for future generations.

If we consider that the Limpopo province has some 54 nature  reserves,  each
with unique  environs,  the  responsibility  of  the  parks  board  and  the
department to manage them is  enormous,  particularly  as  we  are  a  rural
province.  The  issues  of  deforestation  and  land  claims  are   enormous
challenges.

As a committee we are very concerned about the continuous  cuts  in  budgets
in our province. There has been a reduction in both the environment  section
and the parks board by some R20 million. The parks board's major task is  to
implement the tourism growth strategy  and  to  continue  to  transform  the
tourism industry, create jobs and ensure that the issue  of  black  economic
empowerment is central to the development.

As the Limpopo Parks and Tourism  Board  is  responsible  for  these  nature
reserves, we have, as a committee, requested management  plans  and  budgets
for all 54 of them. This is not micromanaging, but rather  we  trusted  this
would highlight the shortcomings of  underbudgeting  and  in  future  ensure
that the entities are funded appropriately, especially as tourism is one  of
the pillars of the province's growth and development strategy.

As a committee we are of the opinion that the amount that  is  budgeted  for
environment may cause this particular directorate not to carry out  what  it
is legally and constitutionally required to. The sector is understaffed  and
one of our major revenues is the  issuing  of  hunting  licences.  We  raise
millions of rands by issuing hunting licences and we feel  that  this  won't
really assist us in increasing  our  revenue  -  something  that  we  should
concentrate on. Waste management is  another  responsibility,  but  we  have
been assured that the department will be in a  position  to  minimise  waste
and pollution through the Integrated Waste and Pollution Management Plan.

The process of commercialisation of the 15 game reserves identified  by  the
parks board has been  a  long  time  coming.  We  have  been  informed  that
transaction advisers - an interesting title to have -  have  been  appointed
to fast-track the commercialisation of these reserves.

Coming to tourism, and  off  a  very  low  base  as  the  Limpopo  province,
considering our history, the N1 north has improved substantially.  The  only
problem is that, perhaps because we do have an alternative, the cost of  the
tollgates might be something that is reducing the tourists  from  coming  to
visit us. There is an alternative - as I have mentioned - and  I'm  sure  we
will be attracting them more and more as time goes on.

We have a number of tourism icons, one of them  being  the  Modjadji  Nature
Reserve, which has ancient cycads, and the Nynsvlei,  which  is  a  declared
Ramsar Site. We have these waterfowl that migrate  annually,  and  then  the
enormous  area,  Waterberg,  which  is  one  of  the  relatively  successful
biospheres.

The province has two  biosphere  reserves  that  have  been  established  or
identified by the ICUN. The second one is the Kruger to  Canyons  Biosphere.
The Kruger to Canyons Biosphere has the biggest challenge.  We  are  talking
about the Bushbuckridge area, which all of you are  aware  is  an  extremely
poor area in the east going up to the Wolkberg in  the  west,  which  is  an
enormous area.

The funding of these biospheres and the Africanisation  of  this  particular
concept continues to be a challenge. We are of the  opinion,  however,  that
biospheres can assist in improving people's lives and be a  vehicle  through
which funding can be channelled to implement  poverty  alleviation  projects
such as the sustainable use of natural resources. The third  biosphere  that
I mentioned  and  which  is  still  in  its  infancy,  is  the  one  in  the
Zoutpansberg.

The establishment  of  these  particular  forms  of  land  use  must  remain
inclusive and all communities must be part of the process, and  we  need  to
be vigilant about that. We must  remember  that  this  particular  land  use
originates in the Northern Hemisphere.

Coming to poverty alleviation projects, the hon Minister  did  mention  that
he would be mentioning this in the  National  Assembly,  that  the  national
department has implemented one in the  Vhembe  District,  particularly  Lake
Fundudzi. So I apologise if I  jump  the  gun,  Mr  Minister.  This  poverty
alleviation  project  of  R5  million  is  having  an  enormously   positive
influence on the seven communities that live  around  Lake  Fundudzi.  These
include the establishment of nurseries of contractors to  build  gabions  to
prevent the continuous silting up of this only natural lake that we have  in
our country.

As all of you should know, this  is  a  mystical  lake  and  has  myths  and
legends; an icon that we should protect. As those of you who come  from  the
Limpopo know, you may not look directly at this lake, but rather  turn  your
back to the lake and look at it  through  your  legs.  The  myth  goes  that
should you look directly at the lake you would become infertile, but  should
you look through your legs, fertility will persist. [Laughter.]  We  commend
the department for implementing this project  and  for  continuing  to  push
back the frontiers of poverty. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, we will continue to persist so that  these  two  directorates
in our province,  namely,  tourism  and  environment,  continue  to  receive
appropriate budgeting and that they continue to carry out what we stated  in
our election manifesto about our peoples contract  to  improve  their  lives
and create wealth. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you very much, Chairperson. This  is  my
first visit here, so I need to know how to get the  seat  back.  Firstly,  I
would like to congratulate the hon Minister  on  his  appointment.  We  have
come a long way together  and  I  am  sure  that  the  relationship  between
KwaZulu-Natal, the Minister and  his  department  is  going  to  be  a  very
fruitful one. I would  also  like  to  congratulate  former  senator,  Joyce
Kgoali, on her appointment. I do not think that there are very  many  people
in this Council  that  can  call  themselves  senators.  There  is  Mohammed
Sulliman there, sitting at the back. Unfortunately, we are  not  allowed  to
keep the title of senator  but  we  served  here  from  1994  in  this  very
Chamber, which was configured differently then.

I want at the outset to thank the hon  Minister  for  his  presentation  and
just indicate to him that I am certainly not going to  follow  my  colleague
the hon Tooley here in talking about toll plazas  because  enough  has  been
said about the Wild Coast Toll Plaza.  I  think  we  as  a  province  and  a
legislature have not formulated a firm position, so I will  stay  away  from
the Wild Coast Toll Plaza affair.

Having said that, I would just like to comment on  a  few  issues  that  the
Minister raised in his presentation here  today.  One  relates  to  domestic
tourism and I would like to indicate to him that  I  agree  fully  that  all
provinces, I think, have not as yet fully  exploited  the  domestic  tourism
potential. There is still a long way to go  and  in  KwaZulu-Natal  I  think
half the population there has not seen the sea. I  think  this  is  an  area
which we can exploit by getting our children and adults  down  to  the  sea,
and that will stimulate domestic tourism.

Having said that, I think domestic tourism revolves around a province  being
able to arrange particular events. For instance, starting from next week  we
have  major  events  on  the  Durban  beachfront,  the  winter  events,  and
yesterday  we  also  had  the  fantastic  Comrades  Marathon.  I   want   to
congratulate the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town  for  producing  two
gold medalists, Farwa Mentoor, who was the first South African home  in  the
women's section and the Russian, Vladimir Kotov, whom I  understand  is  now
also a resident of Cape Town. Well, not for KwaZulu-Natal to be outdone,  we
also had Willie Mtolo who was  the  first  KwaZulu-Natalian  and  the  first
South African man home.

I was on the plane earlier this afternoon and I  met  a  gentleman  who  has
visited 132 countries already and I asked him how he found South Africa  and
he had very good things to say  about  South  Africa.  He  said  it  is  the
paradise of Africa and it is not surprising, hon Minister,  seeing  that  we
have all the natural heritage, we have the beauty of the  country,  we  have
the heritage that my colleague from the Free  State  and  my  colleague,  Mr
Mzizi, have spoken about. I think these are things that we need  to  exploit
as well if we want to attract tourists. What I believe we have to do  is  to
ensure that we have the competitive edge in  terms  of  attracting  tourists
and making South Africa a prime tourist destination for people  from  around
the world.

Mr Minister and Chairperson, there are quite a few issues  that  I  want  to
raise but time will not allow me to raise them all. But, I think that it  is
important that we flag some of those issues. Firstly, let me  indicate  that
I think I am the only MEC here who has a very interesting portfolio  because
we configured  our  portfolios  differently  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  It  is  the
portfolio of arts, culture and tourism. I found, in the last  six  weeks  or
so, that there is a  wonderful  nexus  between  arts,  culture  and  tourism
because we can use our arts and culture to bring tourists  to  the  province
and I hope that from the lessons that we  can  forward  to  other  provinces
that maybe they will also configure their portfolios accordingly.

One of the issues that I wish  to  raise  is  the  question  of  safety  and
security. I think there is a perception, certainly  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  that
when you visit the province you are going to get  mugged.  Sometimes  people
call it a perception but it is a reality. Our own Premier's daughter  and  a
friend at the Tourism Indaba were mugged between  the  ICC  and  the  Hilton
Hotel, which is a walking distance of 200m or so. I think we have  to  allay
this perception and reality that exists and to that end I think we  need  to
make a concerted effort as provinces, as local government  and  as  national
Government to see how we can add to what the SA Police Service is doing.

I have requested our finance committee in the legislature to make  available
an amount of R1 million so that we can  initiate  what  we  call  a  tourist
watch system where there would not be police in the sense  of  the  word  as
policemen and policewomen, but we could have  some  synergies  with  the  SA
Police so that there is some comfort not only for domestic tourists but  for
international tourists also. I hope that they approve the funds and if  they
do not, that probably the national  department  for  the  sake  of  national
interest would see to it that all the provinces are  given  some  money  for
conditional grants, so that we can deal  with  this  concept  of  a  tourist
watch. That is the first issue that I wish to raise.

The second issue is one that revolves around the 4x4 vehicle ban and I  know
that the hon Minister has indicated that he will provide more  details  when
he addresses the National Assembly. KwaZulu-Natal, I think, is  one  of  the
provinces where one of our crown jewels is  our  coastline,  just  like  the
Western Cape and some of the other provinces.

I agree with my colleague the hon Maurice McKenzie  wholeheartedly  that  we
have to strike a balance between the environment  and  economic  development
just as we struck that balance when we were in Chile,  South  America,  when
it came to the issue of ivory. Some of the officials  will  know  very  well
how we managed to convince international countries to  support  our  concept
of sustainable use. But, I think that in terms of tourism it  has  quite  an
impact when you completely ban the 4X4s.

At one stage I was MEC for Environmental Affairs  and  Agriculture  and  the
issue of recreational use was on the table. I think this issue is  something
that we need to look at again in cases where we have very  restricted  areas
with strict conditions. Working with local government on this,  it  will  be
possible for people who are disabled to get on the beach. We must work  with
marine biologists and others to ensure that if we  allow  restricted  access
to the beaches it is going to be  in  areas  that  are  not  environmentally
sensitive.

I hope that at some stage, Mr Minister, before the final position  is  taken
we could have a further consultative process so that we can have  a  win-win
situation. It is important that we  attract  tourists,  but  it  is  equally
important that we do not damage our environment as so many other  colleagues
have said.

My colleague, Maurice McKenzie, also touched on the issue of the Greater  St
Lucia Wetlands Park, which is a wetland authority established  in  terms  of
section 9 of the Act. Whilst we have that as a world heritage site, we  have
the Drakensberg Ukhahlamba which is a  section  8  authority,  in  terms  of
which some authority within the province should manage  everything  in  this
world heritage site. I think we need to sit and  talk  seriously  about  the
management of these world heritage sites so that there  is  no  conflict  or
tensions between existing authorities within a  province  and  an  authority
appointed in terms of section 9. This is a further issue  that  I  think  we
need to look at as we go along.

I am glad that you also touched on the issue of the BEE scorecard. You  will
certainly get the support of  KwaZulu-Natal  in  whatever  way  we  will  be
active participants and we welcome the formation of this task team you  have
spoken about. In the same vein we also welcome the fact that the  department
is taking over the tourism enterprise programme. And here too we in KwaZulu-
Natal are in active partnership with the private sector because  we  do  not
believe that the Government on  its  own  will  be  able  to  stimulate  the
economy to such a degree that we will be able to create  jobs  for  all  the
people, and we know that the demand out there is quite great.

I would also like to suggest to this House and to Madam Chair  that  we  get
at least the Portfolio Committee on Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  to
visit all our provinces just to get a sense of what is happening. You  know,
I used to sit here as well and I know that sometimes  you  speak  from  what
you think you know about your province, even if you come from it, and  there
are others who speak about the province and  they  do  not  know  where  the
province is and these are colleagues from outside. I think  it  would  be  a
useful exercise if members of the Council do visit our provinces so that  we
can take them around and show them some of our tourism destinations  and  so
that they can enjoy what each of our provinces can offer. I hope  that  when
that happens we as MECs can also  be  included  in  these  visits  to  other
provinces. It would be a very useful exercise.

With us having won the 2010 bid to host the World Soccer Cup I think  it  is
also important for us  to  start  working  together  particularly  from  the
tourism angle. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms L BROWN (Western Cape): Chairperson, I want to inform the hon MEC,  Singh
that we don't call the Western  Cape  ``the  home  for  all''  for  nothing.
That's where we can also have Russians winning the Comrades Marathon.

Let me formally congratulate Mr Van Schalkwyk as well. In fact, this  is  my
boss at national level who has had me working very hard already.  Informally
I have congratulated you, but please let me also add my voice to  those  who
have congratulated you.

As I congratulate you formally, sir, let me also  just  say  that  you  must
rest assured that your initiatives in the Western Cape  around  creating  an
economically sustainable fishing industry will receive attention.  They  are
really very important for us and they will help us to extend  and  start  to
deal with the two large areas that we have decided on in  the  Western  Cape
in order to fight poverty and  create  jobs.  There  is  a  whole  range  of
initiatives that I raised in the economic  development  portfolio  committee
the other day, but I know that those are issues that  we  will  be  able  to
address again.

Tourism in the Western Cape has of  course  grown  very  significantly.  The
international tourist arrivals grew from 1,3 million in 2002 to 1,5  million
in 2003. Accolades have been showered on Cape Town and  it  has  been  voted
number five in the BBC's 50 places to see before you die. It has been  voted
the best city in Africa by the World Travel Awards. Of course, tourism is  a
very  untransformed  industry.  It's  an  industry  that  is  still  largely
controlled by white business, but through the new ANC/NNP  Government  there
has been a lot of goodwill from  large  companies  that  are  interested  in
transforming this industry.

Domestically the Western Cape received  almost  25%  of  all  local  tourism
expenditure. It has provided a direct injection of more than R21 billion  to
the provincial economy. The growth in tourism  has  been  accompanied  by  a
major increase in foreign direct investment in the hotel industry, and  this
includes the 480-room Arabella Sheraton hotel.

Last week we were very privileged to host  the  launch  of  the  Sho't  Left
Campaign by the Minister and South African Tourism, in Langa.  It  was  very
good for us because of the significance  of  Langa  as  the  oldest  African
township in the Western  Cape.  Langa  is  also  the  home  of  many  famous
artists, jazz artists and the late Brenda Fassie. But it  also  demonstrates
that townships within the Western Cape are not part of the  overall  tourism
industry.

It was significant that we had an opportunity to say:  ``Yes,  come  to  the
Western Cape and experience its full tourism experience. You can go  to  the
winelands and you can listen to karaoke in Mitchell's Plain. You can  go  to
Table Mountain and you can listen to music and eat African food in  Langa.''
This is one of our big initiatives that we want to see happening  here.  The
communities are vibrant. However, the only  thing  that  gets  sold  is  the
perception that our townships are crime-ridden, disease-infested and so  on.
Our townships are vibrant, full and they make sense to people  who  live  in
those communities. This is an opportunity for us to use tourism as a way  of
creating jobs within communities.

Very soon we will be launching the Cape Flats legacy tours. This  will  give
us an opportunity to connect those communities to the rest  of  the  Western
Cape. This will enable tourists who come to the province to  experience  the
whole of the Western Cape. Very recently the President opened the Cape  Town
International Convention Centre. This was done two months ahead of  schedule
with  a  budget  under  R582  million.  It  is  very  significant  that   my
predecessors in this portfolio have assured me that BEE companies  did  over
48% of the projects which were worth about R288 million.

Various global events  have  been  successfully  hosted  here.  We  had  the
Cricket World Cup  and  the  President's  Golf  Cup.  These  will  serve  as
attractions regarding tourism possibilities during  the  2010  Soccer  World
Cup within the Western Cape.  The  Destination  Marketing  Organisation  for
Cape Town and the Western Cape was established to eliminate  duplication  of
marketing  activities.  This  will  enable  us  to  market  Cape  Town,  the
winelands and the Western Cape very broadly across the  world.  We  see  one
entry point through which we will be able to market  everything  within  the
Western Cape.

The second tourism showcase was  held  and  it  showcased  emerging  tourism
products and also exposed emerging businesses  to  local  buyers.  This  was
aimed at strengthening  the  confidence  of  local  buyers  with  regard  to
emerging tourism  products,  and  it  was  coupled  with  tourism  awareness
workshops that reached more than 400 participants.

Safety and security is a very big issue for  us.  As  soon  as  one  tourist
experiences a safety  and  security  problem,  it  creates  ripples  in  the
international community. The hon Singh raised this issue as  well.  We  held
an international conference in the Western  Cape  to  try  to  address  such
incidents. We also looked at how we could sell the Western Cape - warts  and
all - because everywhere in the world one could possibly be mugged as  well.
This has been quite successful and I really encourage people to look at  it.
It's encouraging because it helps the Western Cape and every other  province
to be a gateway to the rest of South Africa.

We are trying to formalise a system to register tourist  guides.  This  will
provide easy analysis of the tourist guide  fraternity  in  terms  of  where
guides are, the numbers  of  those  who  are  registered  and  the  area  of
registration. To ensure that we build a home for all in  this  province,  we
have trained deaf tourist guides. We have discovered that this  is  a  niche
market that has not been tapped. We will have to do an impact study  to  see
what effects this would have on tourism within the Western Cape.

We strongly support the national Government's initiatives aimed at  building
greater representivity in the tourism sector.  We  are  in  the  process  of
engaging and we will continue to engage big and small  stakeholders  in  the
province to develop a strategy for tourism and  black  economic  empowerment
for this province. As I said before there  is  enormous  goodwill.  This  is
about creating the facilities, environment and opportunities for  people  to
interact with one another.

A tourism human resource development strategy is aimed at  trying  to  match
skills with black economic empowerment as well as  promoting  excellence  in
tourism across the board. We need to find a way to ensure  that  we  empower
both black and white people who participate in tourism.  People  often  talk
about poor service, and this happens across the board. We  have  to  try  to
get this right as well. All of that can happen in tourism. We  can  do  very
well and many people  can  come  to  our  shores.  However,  if  we  as  the
Government do not intervene in the way tourism has been run,  it  will  just
be business as usual.

We have an integrated tourism entrepreneurship  support  programme  that  is
aimed at providing targeted support  to  black  businesses  in  tourism.  It
focuses on capital, expertise and access to  markets.  This  programme  will
enable us to monitor the impact of our intervention. As I said  earlier,  we
are going to put enormous energy into ensuring that the Cape  Flats  tourism
route becomes a reality and that a significant number of tourists are  taken
to  the  Cape  Flats.  Tourists  should  not  only   experience   our   poor
neighbourhoods, but the uniquely Western Cape wining, dining,  entertainment
and sightseeing. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N S  MTSWENI  (Mpumalanga):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  members,  MECs  here
present, ladies and gentlemen,  I  want  to  join  my  other  colleagues  in
congratulating the Minister on his new appointment and to  say  that  I  was
fortunate to have worked with the Minister for a very long time. So  I  hope
that because we have both been on the committee on Communications,  we  will
be  able  to  make  sure  that  there  is  good  communication  between  the
department and the provinces.

This debate comes to this House at a time in our history when the people  of
South Africa are remembering June 16 - June 16  of  1976  being  of  special
significance in the soul of the majority of our people. The  month  of  June
is auspicious for all South Africans, because it is not only  in  the  month
of the youth, but it is also during  this  time  that  Environment  Week  is
celebrated.

People in cities, towns and villages are equally able to celebrate what  the
month of June stands for, because our people are  living  in  very  exciting
times, exciting times in which villagers and city people have  equal  access
to Government institutions that allow them to determine their  own  destiny.
Everywhere one travels - to any  corner  of  the  country  -  one  gets  the
pleasant sense that the issues of environment and tourism are  beginning  to
touch the lives of ordinary people in a positive way.

Women  in  villages  are  now  empowered  to  integrate  their   traditional
knowledge of caring for the environment,  passed  down  from  generation  to
generation, to enrich the management  of  biodiversity  for  sustainability.
The nondestructive and the  nonexploitive  manner  in  which  the  sensitive
tourism packages are  being  implemented  provides  hope  for  cultural  and
environmental sustenance.

Not so very long ago  the  apartheid  government  was  writing  policies  to
conserve the natural  environment.  The  apartheid  policies  excluded  much
indigenous knowledge and systems of the  African  majority.  Naturally,  the
policies resulted in conflict with the indigenous leadership of the  African
majority. The African majority and  their  institutions  were  perceived  by
those in authority to  be  a  threat  to  biodiversity  and  the  growth  of
tourism.

It was for  this  reason  that  many  African  kingdoms  and  amakhosi  were
stripped of their land and possessions to  make  way  for  conservation  and
tourism development. Access to what became protected  areas  was  denied  to
African people, even those areas that for centuries were sacred  places  for
cultural activities and festivities like Umemo,  Incwala,  Ingoma,  Umhlanga
and many more places of spirituality.

The majority of our people who stood in long queues in 1994 to give the  ANC
an overwhelming mandate to govern our country  came  back  10  years  later.
They stood in queues again in 1994, 10 years into the  new  democracy.  This
time they were even more determined to ensure that the  third  term  of  our
democratic Government was given a chance and the space to complete what  was
started in 1994.

The people of this country in their numbers saw a real change  in  terms  of
the restoration of human dignity in the policies of the Government that  was
led by the ANC,  despite  the  fact  that  there  were  a  great  number  of
apolitical predictions, even from otherwise rational quarters, that the ANC-
led Government had all the makings of a government  that  would  plunge  the
country into an  unprecedented  oblivion,  that  the  environment  would  be
ruined  and  the  tourism  potential  destroyed  forever.  These  predictors
assured those who were willing to  listen  that  the  ANC  constituency  was
disillusioned and divided. However, contrary to these predictions  the  ANC-
led Government has made significant strides in its  efforts  to  uplift  the
standard and life of all the people of this  country,  particularly  in  the
area of environmental management.

As we celebrate a decade of freedom, we want to salute all  the  heroes  and
heroines who held up the spirits of the nation under the worst  and  hardest
of conditions in order to get us to where we are today. Women  and  children
in impoverished rural areas and informal  settlements  deserve  our  special
salute for their will and resolve to fight on. Women all  over  the  country
fight on, despite the  many  challenges  that  face  them  -  challenges  of
underdevelopment, hunger and malnutrition.

We also want to  salute  the  Government  for  introducing  progressive  and
developmental legislation on the environment. The law  reform  process  that
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has embarked  upon  must
be applauded.  The  policies  and  legislation  will  see  the  transfer  of
important mandates to provinces and local government,  ensuring  smooth  and
co-ordinated environmental management  and  governance  in  these  important
delivery  points  of  Government.  Provinces  and  the  local   spheres   of
government stand to gain more  during  the  subsequent  integration  of  the
legal instruments on the environment. The law  reform  process  will  enable
there to be an even  clearer  role  for  provinces  in  order  for  them  to
promulgate their own  regulations  that  will  ensure  proper  environmental
planning and compliance monitoring.

Unlike the laws and policies that were promulgated by the apartheid  regime,
the new laws are taking cognisance of  the  needs  of  our  people,  not  as
objects but as active participants. The current legislation puts the  people
at  the  heart  of  decision-making  and  is  geared   towards   sustainable
development. The framework of the legislation put in place seeks  to  ensure
that what we consume today is not to the detriment of the future.

Ladies and gentlemen, our province stands together  with  the  rest  of  the
people of South Africa in welcoming the budget. Limited as it  is,  we  hope
that it will begin to ensure that the programmes, policies  and  legislation
of the department are realised. We from the province also want  to  join  Mr
Singh of KwaZulu-Natal in coming up with strategies on how we are  going  to
make sure that our visitors are looked after, because in Mpumalanga you  all
know that we had a situation in which some of our visitors were  mugged  and
some killed. So now, jointly, with the Department of Safety and Security  we
are coming up with a strategy to make sure that  this  does  not  happen  to
them. And we are also finding ways to ensure that we protect  our  visitors.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms H F MATLANYANE: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs, hon  members,
I find it  very  interesting  that  the  DA  takes  offence  when  they  are
attacked, as they always attack other parties. But let me not dwell on  that
because time has attacked them.

South Africa has become one of the fastest growing tourism  destinations  in
the world. Tourism is a key industry with the potential for  growth  in  the
international and domestic markets. As a labour-intensive  industry  tourism
helps to create jobs and attract foreign investment.

The department's objective is  to  stimulate  tourism  demand  in  both  the
domestic and international markets by removing obstacles to growth,  and  it
aims  to  expand  supporting  infrastructure,  and  promote  black  economic
empowerment, job creation and transformation in the industry.  The  majority
of South Africans are not aware of the opportunities  in  the  promotion  of
domestic tourism. In raising general awareness the priority is to  intensify
initiatives such as Tourism Month and the Welcome Campaign,  the  aim  being
to encourage South Africans to travel within the country,  to  make  tourism
products accessible  to  all  South  Africans  and  to  create  a  safe  and
welcoming environment for visitors.

Tourism contributes about 7,1% to GDP and employs an  estimated  3%  of  the
South African workforce. It is projected that in 2010 South African  tourism
will employ more than 1,2 people directly or  indirectly,  not  taking  into
account the fact that we will be hosting the World Cup in 2010.

The  tourism  branch  leads  and  directs  tourism  policy  formulation  and
implementation in terms of national tourism growth. In partnership  with  SA
Tourism, the provincial tourism authorities, the tourism industry and  other
relevant stakeholders aim to ensure and accelerate  the  practical  delivery
of  tourism  benefits  to  the  broad  spectrum  of  South  Africans   while
maintaining sustainability and quality of life.

The  White  Paper  on  Tourism  provides  a  policy  framework  for  tourism
development and entails the  following  programmes:  a  special  empowerment
programme for capacity-building mostly  in  our  bed-and-breakfast  industry
and in our  tour  guides  industry,  tourism  infrastructure,  investigation
programmes,  the  identification   of   public   infrastructure,   and   the
mobilisation of funds to aggressively market South Africa.

With regard to launching a domestic and  travel  campaign,  a  collaborative
tourism cluster  process,  which  will  provide  the  framework  for  taking
tourism into the next millennium, has been launched.  The  process  aims  to
achieve collective action amongst  keen  stakeholders  to  enhance  tourism-
marketing investment and skills and infrastructure development.

The Tourism Forum is an advisory body that  advises  the  Minister,  and  it
comprises government, business, public institutions  and  labour  to  ensure
the  growth  and  development   of   the   tourism   sector.   The   tourism
transformation strategy  places  more  emphasis  on  developing  black-owned
business within  the  industry  by  raising  the  proportion  of  Government
expenditure going to these businesses from 30% in 2001-02, to 50%  in  2004-
05.

A database of the Black Tourism  Transformation  Forum  was  established  to
promote  black  economic   empowerment   with   representatives   from   the
department, the DTI, the Department of Labour, the Tourism Business  Council
of SA, the Department of the  Public  Service  and  Administration  and  the
Independent Development  Corporation.  The  department  also  formulated  an
information booklet  entailing  the  funding  opportunities  and  assistance
programmes available to SMMEs, a handbook on tourism support programmes  and
posters to create awareness about illegal tour guiding.

An  amount  of  R232  million  has  been  committed  and  spent  on  tourism
development projects aimed at  creating  jobs  and  alleviating  poverty  in
South Africa. These projects  promote  the  development  of  community-owned
tourism  products  such  as  lodges   and   the   development   of   tourism
infrastructure, including roads, information centres  and  tourism  signage.
They are categorised as  product  development,  infrastructure  development,
capacity-building and training, and the establishment of SMME  and  business
development projects.

We need to encourage the Welcome campaign, hon Minister,  launched  in  1999
by your predecessor. The campaign encourages all South Africans  to  embrace
tourism  and  to  share  in  South  Africa's  riches  and  natural  cultural
heritage, and it is run as a national  general  awareness  campaign  through
road shows and community outreach programmes.

A basic customer  service  training  programme  was  introduced  to  educate
trainers to run the programmes for  learners,  who,  after  completion,  are
awarded a certificate and lapel badge. This programme,  which  targeted  the
training of about 500 trainees by December 2003, is called SA Host. I  think
that if we could take this forward and take it  to  the  rural  areas,  most
especially in Limpopo, this would go a long way.

Human  resource  development  is  considered  one  of  the  pillars  of  the
development of a new, responsible  tourism  culture  in  South  Africa.  The
department supports the introduction  of  travel,  tourism  and  hospitality
studies as subjects in school. The SA Tourism Institute initiated  a  number
of projects supporting the learning  environment  of  teachers,  high-school
learners  and  employees  in  the  tourism  industry  through  the  Tourism,
Hospitality and Sport Education  and  Training  Authority.  As  the  ANC  we
support the budget. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Thank  you,  Chairperson.
I would like to start out by conveying my appreciation to all  the  members,
starting with the chairperson of the  select  committee,  Rev  Moatshe,  the
MECs and all the other members for wishing me well with this portfolio.  I'm
looking forward to it.  I  do  not  underestimate  the  challenges  in  this
portfolio for one minute. I understand that there are a lot of tough  issues
that will have to be dealt  with;  decisions  to  be  taken  in  a  decisive
manner; and also some controversial issues that we would like to  deal  with
together in a spirit of  co-operation  and  co-operative  government  -  the
words of my  colleague  from  the  Eastern  Cape,  the  chairperson  of  the
standing committee.

Now I must say that some of the contributions tickled my interest  in  terms
of what some of the provinces have to offer. My colleague Mr Mzizi  referred
to Wonderboom; and my colleague Mr Tooley, who is out of the  House  at  the
moment, referred to the lake in Limpopo; while Mr Saaiman  referred  to  the
equatic chickens in the Northern Cape. [Laughter.] I want to see  those,  Mr
Saaiman. I'm going to visit you soon to see what that is all about.

Then I would also like to give my assurance to colleagues that this  is  one
portfolio in terms of which I believe we must all do our utmost in order  to
lift it out of the party-political arena. The environment and nature do  not
recognise borders that we draw on maps. They  do  not  recognise  levels  of
government. They do not care about different political  parties.  So  it  is
good that we all work together to ensure that we achieve success.

Now, in the 10 minutes I have to speak I would like to  deal  with  most  of
the issues that my colleagues raised. Regarding those  issues  that  I  will
not be able to deal with  now,  we  will  answer  the  specific  issues  and
questions that members directed and raised in writing.

On the issue of domestic tourism I would like to  thank  members  for  their
support for the campaign that we  announced  last  week.  It  is  absolutely
vital that we succeed with this campaign. The countries that are  successful
internationally with  regard  to  tourism  -  France,  Spain,  Italy  -  are
successful because they have built domestic tourism as  the  foundations  of
their  tourism  industries.  The  international  tourism  industry,  however
important it is, is a  vulnerable  industry.  The  exchange  rate,  security
concerns, etc, are all issues that affect international tourism  very  much.
Therefore, we must make  sure  that  we  develop  domestic  tourism  as  the
foundation for our tourism industry in this country.

When we celebrated Youth Day yesterday we took a number of young  people  to
one of our national parks - the Table Mountain National Park  took  them  up
the mountain. There we discussed the importance  of  young  people  in  this
country also taking co-ownership of the environment, because it is  part  of
their future. We have some very innovative,  creative,  good  programmes  in
the department already. The Kids in  Kruger  programme  already  makes  sure
that 800 young people per month get the opportunity to  visit  our  national
parks. This is something that most of them never had the opportunity  to  do
before. Last year the People in the Environment programme  numbered  over  3
500 young people who had never had the opportunity before. When I was  there
yesterday it was conveyed to me that the cable  car  company  in  Cape  Town
here in the Western Cape had run a programme  over  the  past  three  years,
which created an opportunity for 100 000 children from  certain  communities
who never had the opportunity before to go up the mountain.

When I stood on the other side of the mountain yesterday with one of the co-
ordinators, a woman of, I suppose, 25 years plus old - now I know we  should
never guess the age of women - she was very emotional when we looked to  the
Kommetjie area where she came from. She said: "Until now I  have  never  had
the opportunity to come up the mountain; at my age this is the  first  time;
and I never thought that I would see Ocean View from up Table Mountain."

So what we must understand is that together we must create that  opportunity
for millions of our people. There's an emerging market  of  over  6  million
people who would like that opportunity and we  must  make  it  possible  for
them: children from Alexandra to see a sunset in the Kruger  National  Park,
and many other opportunities that some of us simply take for granted.  So  I
would like the co-operation from the provinces and from local government  to
make that a reality for many of our people.

Some colleagues mentioned 2010. Of course we are all immensely proud of  the
fact that we won the bid. But what we must never forget is  that  2010  will
not solve all our problems in the country. We must also plan for 2010.  With
regard to tourism very specifically, we must understand that there  are  new
markets that we must now focus on for 2010. The  Spanish-speaking  countries
of South America and those in Europe, and the Portuguese-speaking  countries
of Brazil and those in Europe have not, up to now, been at the  top  of  our
agenda when it came to our normal tourism. We must now shift  the  focus  to
start including those countries when we talk about 2010 and  the  importance
of that for tourism.

The hon Minister Brown from the Western Cape remarked on the BEE  scorecard.
Now, our first choice is to convince the players in that  market  that  they
must take co-ownership and responsibility of that  process  of  empowerment.
We don't want to unilaterally legislate as  a  first  option.  But  if  they
don't come on board willingly, then we will have no other  option.  We  want
them to take responsibility and co-ownership. Then all of us  will  be  more
successful.

A number of colleagues mentioned the issue of Pondoland. Now,  that  is  one
of the critical areas that we will have to solve on the  environmental  side
and also on the developmental side. Some of the members here -  Mr  Le  Roux
and others - referred to the  natural  problem  that  one  always  has  with
development on the  one  side,  and  conservation  on  the  other.  This  is
something that we have to live  with  and  for  which  we  have  to  find  a
balance.

However, with regard to Pondoland, there are a  number  of  issues  that  we
will have to resolve there: the issue of mining, the issue of  the  proposed
toll road; the issue of the wildlife park. We  will,  hopefully,  over  time
solve all those issues. I  would  like  to  assure  my  colleague  from  the
Eastern Cape, the chairperson of the standing committee, that we would  like
to do that in a spirit of  co-operation,  co-operative  governance  and  co-
ordination. That is why I went down to meet with the premier and members  of
the Cabinet on Monday and why I will also be visiting Pondoland on 23  July.
I'm convinced that the Minister of Minerals and Energy  will  also  join  me
and, hopefully, one of the other Ministers will also  have  an  interest  in
what we have to do in that area. I hope that it will  also  be  possible  to
meet with the king, because he has never been  consulted  firsthand  in  the
past. I think it is important that we do this and pay our respects  in  that
regard.

As a number of those issues are on appeal, are on my desk or  on  their  way
there, I believe that it is not proper to say anything now, because I  would
like to deal with those issues in the proper manner and with an  open  mind.
The first thing that we will have to do  with  regard  to  Pondoland  is  to
agree on a vision for that area. Do we want an ecotourism  vision  for  that
area? That will make all our decisions easier. If we say that we would  like
the traditional kind of development there, then we will take  certain  other
decisions. So it is important that we agree on a vision  for  Pondoland  and
that area first.

With regard to the mining, I would like to  say,  quite  frankly,  that  I'm
opposed to mining in that area, but that decision is  the  decision  of  the
Minister of Minerals and Energy.  It  is  a  unique  area,  because  of  the
history of mining in this country, in terms of which that Minister also  has
the responsibility of deciding on EIAs,  and  not  this  Minister.  When  we
agree on a vision I hope that we will be able to address all  those  issues.
We are opposed to mining there for a  very  simple  reason.  The  centre  of
endomism in that area is where the proposed  mining  may  take  place.  When
visiting that area on Monday I was told that there were  unique  animal  and
plant species that one found only  there  and  nowhere  else  in  the  whole
world. For instance, the Pondo Palm only grows on one side  of  one  of  the
rivers there, etc. Those are all factors that we who care cannot ignore  and
that we must stand up for.

On the issue of fishing: the hon Minister Essop mentioned that, as  did  the
hon MEC Saaiman and the hon member Dlulane.  We  will  continue  with  those
imbizos and see how many communities we can make part of  that.  I  have  no
doubt in my mind that there is one category of people that  we  must  relook
at again, and they are the subsistence fishing communities  in  the  coastal
areas. Hondeklipbaai in the Northern Cape is a good example.  I  would  like
to give the MEC the assurance that we will look at ways to  ensure  that  in
the next round of allocations a whole community like that  is  not  excluded
again.

I visited Paternoster recently. We have a wonderful new  fish  market  there
that the provincial government built - costing millions of rand - but  there
are no fish. So those are all the issues that we must look at,  making  sure
that the fishermen and fisherwomen also understand that it is resource  that
we must also manage and protect. That is the balance we must find.

In this regard I would like to inform the House that the term of  office  of
the DDG responsible for the Marine and  Coastal  Management  branch  of  the
department, Mr Horst Kleinschmidt, expires shortly  and  that  he  will  not
continue. I would have  preferred  him  to  continue,  because  I  think  he
deserves a lot of credit for turning that industry around  and  establishing
credibility and  integrity  -  much-needed  credibility  and  integrity.  He
conveyed to me his reasons for not wanting to renew his  contract  and  that
he would like to enter into a new phase in his life. I would like  to  thank
him on behalf of Government for the success that  he  has  achieved  on  our
behalf. I  would  like  to  wish  him  well  when  he  leaves  our  service.
[Applause.]

Regarding budget issues, the hon member Tooley  raised  that.  I'm  actually
glad he raised that, because I did not want to raise  that  issue.  However,
because he raised it I would just like to  briefly  point  out  one  or  two
issues. These we will discuss at the Minmecs and with the MECs.  Colleagues,
if we are talking about making tourism a  success,  then  we  must  put  our
money where our mouths are. When I asked for the latest budget  figures  the
day before yesterday I was quite disappointed to see  that  in  one  of  our
provinces the budget for marketing tourism had decreased  by  33%.  In  that
same province the budget for tourism development had decreased by  63%.  Now
we cannot say that we  are  serious  if  we  do  this  to  our  budgets  for
marketing and for tourism development. With regard  to  some  of  the  other
provinces, I must say that there is one province's budget that is up by  30%
- oh, no, it is up 23% - another is up by 11%, and so on. So  that  is  good
news. But I think we must sit down and we must also plan budget-wise.

With regard to waste management, the hon member Mabe  refers.  I  see  she's
not here now; she has left the Chamber. Maybe I should then just say that  I
will deal more comprehensively with issues of waste management on Monday  in
the National Assembly. The plastic bag ban will only make  sense  if  it  is
the first step in starting to manage waste. Therefore we must  also  address
the other waste streams, and I will refer to some of these  and  to  pending
regulations and initiatives on Monday in the National Assembly.

With regard to the marine-protected areas - an issue which was  raised  when
we announced this, as I said in my introductory  speech  -  there  has  been
this very important step that has taken us closer  to  that  20%  objective,
that is 20% of our coastal area. We will only succeed if we understand  that
we must be able and have the ability to enforce  what  we  announce.  If  we
simply announce these protected areas  without  any  enforcement  capability
and capacity, the poaching will just go on as it has up  to  now.  Therefore
we are going to use the patrolling vessels that we will  receive  shortly  -
the first one in October and others shortly afterwards - and other  measures
we have available as well as the green Scorpions. The  provinces  also  have
some enforcement and compliance  capacity  and  capability.  Colleagues,  we
must start using these, otherwise all  our  good  intentions  don't  mean  a
thing. We will work closely  to  ensure  that  we  are  successful  in  that
regard.

I will then conclude by thanking all my colleagues  for  a  good  debate,  a
very constructive debate. There were some  good  proposals.  Regarding  some
other matters, I will be dealing with those  in  the  National  Assembly  on
Monday. Those members who raised very specific  issues  and  questions  will
receive answers in writing. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 18:10.
