                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

              (Resumption of Debate on Subject for Discussion)

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam Speaker, hon members,  the  day  before
yesterday the hon Annelizé van Wyk participated in the debate on  the  state
of the nation address. In her thoughtful and  challenging  contribution  she
asked: Who are you and what are you going to do?

In this regard she said: ``In a political  context,  there  are  those  with
whom referring to the past is very unpopular. They would  rather  ignore  it
or prefer to act as if South Africa has no past''.

Responding to some remark made by a member of the House, she said: ``I  have
dealt with my own past''. [Applause.] In other words, she  has  not  treated
her past as something to which there should be no  reference.  She  has  not
elected to ignore either her individual past or her own role  in  fashioning
our country's past.

With her permission, let me hon members something  about  the  hon  Annelizé
van Wyk's past, the past she has dealt with and not ignored.

In a sense we can say she was born into the apartheid system.  She  grew  up
in Pretoria, attended the University of Potchefstroom and came back to  work
in Pretoria on completion of her studies.
Her father worked at Correctional Services. Obviously a  trusted  member  of
these services, as  NCO  he  drove  the  vehicle  which  transported  Nelson
Mandela from Pretoria to Cape Town  on  his  way  to  his  incarceration  on
Robben Island. By the time he retired, he had risen to the rank of general.

Throughout her school years, Annelizé lived within the narrow  and  defining
confines of a prison precinct. On completion of her university studies,  she
worked  for  Military  Intelligence.  Later  she   worked   at   the   state
institution, the Human Sciences Research Council.

When she went into politics, naturally she chose the National Party  as  her
political home. [Interjections.] She worked as a National Party activist  in
the 1987 and 1989 elections in the then Transvaal, and  she  served  on  the
Transvaal Information Committee  of  the  National  Party  during  the  1992
referendum. From 1994  she  served  as  a  New  NP  member  of  the  Gauteng
legislature, resigning in 1997 to join Roelf Meyer in helping  to  form  the
UDM. She joined the ANC last year. [Applause.]
By any standard, especially in the  context  of  present-day  South  Africa,
this is not a comfortable past, intimately linked as it is to the  apartheid
security services and the NP during its days as the party of apartheid.

It cannot be a comfortable past, given that some of those  who  suffered  at
the hands of the apartheid forces of repression, of which the  hon  Annelizé
van Wyk and her father had been members, are with us here in this House  and
everywhere else where she may  go,  doing  her  work  as  a  member  of  her
political organisation and a member of the National Assembly.

Equally, it surely required great courage, honesty  and  personal  integrity
for her to allow us to speak openly about her  past  and  herself  wrestling
with the demons of her past so that she can live at peace with the  present.
[Applause.]

For my part, I would like to convey my deepest respect  to  her  and  humble
appreciation of the example she has set. [Applause.] I am not  certain  that
if I were in her position, I would have had the courage and honesty she  has
shown. To her, for the example she  has  set  and  the  leadership  she  has
provided, I would like to extend my sincere thanks. [Applause.]

I know, and many of us know, that there are others in our country  who  have
failed to show the courage and honesty of an Annelizé  van  Wyk.  These  are
the people she said find reference to their past  unacceptable,  who  prefer
to act as if South Africa has no past.

The January 30-February 5, 2004 edition of Engineering News carries an  open
letter to the  President  written  by  the  editor,  Martin  Creamer.  After
commenting on the legacy of apartheid we inherited, he wrote:


  This is a legacy that cannot be swept away overnight. Bad  memories  will
  linger. We should, therefore, thank the likes of Bishop Desmond Tutu, who
  led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission process in a way that did not
  allow those memories to fester. Instead, he and the  other  commissioners
  created the possibility for the emergence of a  common  consciousness  of
  past pains. This process will help us, black and white, in  tackling  the
  challenges of the future with a better sense  of  history.  If  genuinely
  internalised, this memory will ensure a sense of common purpose shaped by
  a deep desire to redress past ills.

Annelizé van Wyk asked the questions: Who are you and what are you going  to
do? Martin Creamer has responded in part by saying that we should  cultivate
``a common consciousness of past pains''. He has said that a  shared  memory
and a shared and better sense of  our  history  ``will  ensure  a  sense  of
common purpose shaped by a deep desire to redress past ills''.

Martin Creamer went on to say:


  Much has been achieved in the first decade of freedom  ...  However,  the
  last ten years also have to be viewed simply as a good start in  building
  true racial, social and economic liberation. Much still has to  be  done.
  To paraphrase Winston  Churchill,  we  are  merely  at  the  end  of  the
  beginning. Seriously challenges still confront us and  we  are  going  to
  require skill, effort and  resolve  to  overcome  them.  The  number  one
  challenge,  as  we  see  it,  relates  to  the  scourge  of  poverty  and
  unemployment ... While we have no doubt about  the  Government's  serious
  intention to confront this challenge, we do  feel  that,  at  times,  the
  required capacity [urgently] to  meet  these  demands  [relating  to  the
  eradication of poverty] has not been put in place.

It is exactly because we are ``merely at the end of  the  beginning'',  with
much that must still be  done,  to  arrive  at  ``true  racial,  social  and
economic liberation'', that Annelizé asked the questions: Who  are  you  and
what are you going to do? Many of the hon members who  participated  in  the
debate answered these  questions  as  their  circumstances  and  consciences
dictated.

Some  said  that  they  were  the  best  representatives  and  guardians  of
democracy in our country. Accordingly, their answer to the  question  ``what
are you going to do?'' has been that their task is to gain in strength,  the
better to be able to  play  their  role  as  the  best  representatives  and
guardians of democracy in our country and beyond.

They have argued that the very definition of democracy centres  specifically
on the concept and practice of  a  strong  and  effective  opposition,  made
particularly important in our country  by  what  they  see  as  an  imminent
threat of the emergence of a one-party dictatorship.

I would like to suggest that as democrats we should accept these answers  as
deeply felt and honestly stated. We may very well  contest  the  correctness
of the self-definition by some as the  rightful  democratic  watchdogs  over
the rest of us. But we must surely accept that we  have  neither  the  right
nor the power to stop these claiming the role they attribute to  themselves,
however much we might think that  what  they  say  about  themselves  merely
signifies that the wish is father to the thought.

Yet others have said that they are the best  representatives  and  guardians
of Afrikaner interests specifically, and  white  interests  in  general.  In
their interventions they specified the matters of concern to  them,  ranging
from affirmative action to issues of language, religion, schools and  crime,
especially against white farmers. In this context,  the  hon  Cassie  Aucamp
said: ``There is a problem with your concept of the  one  nation  ...  which
one?''

The hon Aucamp raised an interesting conceptual problem when he said:


  Yes, the ANC also preaches diversity, but the ANC model for ``diversity''
  is  that  every  institution,  every  organisation,  should  reflect  the
  demographics of the country. The  result:  every  institution  looks  the
  same.  Every  school  becomes  a  parallel-medium  school.  There  is  no
  diversity.

I believe that it would have been very instructive if, during a debate  that
would hopefully focus on assessing the work of a  decade  and  project  into
the next, we had given ourselves time to discuss this kind of issue. But  it
did seem to me that some inside and  outside  this  House  sought  to  focus
exclusively on the trees and refused to see the forest.

Thus we avoided dealing with the important questions implicit  in  what  the
hon Aucamp said, namely: What do we mean when we speak of  a  nonracial  and
nonsexist society and what does the ``equality clause'' in our  Constitution
intend that we should do with our country!

The hon Tony Leon found what we must presume he thought was a clever  answer
to these questions when he said:


  The truth is that we must distinguish between two nations.  Not  a  black
  and a white nation. Rather, we are faced with the South African dream  on
  the one hand, and the South African reality on the other.

The hon Cassie Aucamp said his party, National  Action,  was  ``not  a  mere
uncle in the political business  for  Afrikaners'',  while  the  hon  Pieter
Mulder made it clear that the FF-Plus spoke for  the  Afrikaners  when,  for
instance, he said:


  As Afrikaners, we  fought  and  won  that  fight  [against  the  language
  policies of Lord Milner] and will do it again ... It must  be  clear  why
  Afrikaners see new Lord Milners in South Africa and  a  repeat  of  their
  history, struggling against a colonial power.

Not to be outdone, the hon Tertius Delport also spoke for the DA  to  affirm
the special interest of his party  in  the  welfare  of  the  Afrikaners  in
particular and the whites in general, as did the hon Koos van der  Merwe  on
behalf of the IFP.

But once again, with  regard  to  those  who  see  themselves  as  the  best
representatives and guardians of Afrikaner interest in particular and  white
interests in general, we cannot contest the right of these hon  members  and
their political organisations to answer the  questions  ``who  are  you  and
what will you do?'' as their circumstances and  consciences  dictate.  They,
too, have a democratic right to decide for themselves who they are and  what
their role will be.

Indeed, in today's Business  Day  Steven  Friedman  argues  the  point  that
``there are few democracies in which identities do not play a major role  in
how many people vote''. He says:


  If our citizens are driven by identity, we need to recognise that  people
  will  be  concerned  not  only  about   whether   democratic   government
  ``delivers'' to them but also about whether it seems to care about  them,
  to treat them with dignity and respect. And so we need to be as concerned
  about whether everyone feels included as about Government ``delivering''.
  We need to recognise people  as  citizens  whose  need  for  dignity  and
  respect is as great as that for Government services. Democracy  can  work
  if voters vote who they are, not what they want - as long as  we  conduct
  politics in a way which recognises that and builds on it, as long  as  we
  accept who are voters are and leave it to Henry  Higgins,  the  character
  depicted by Bernard Shaw, to fail at trying to turn them into  what  they
  are not.

These  correct  observations  do  not  seek  to  deny  the   importance   of
``delivery'' in its narrower  sense.  In  this  regard,  we  must  note  the
consensus that seems to have emerged during the debate  concerning  many  of
the challenges our country faces.

This  encompassed  issues  of  poverty  and  unemployment,  crime,   health,
including the matter of HIV  and  Aids,  education  and  training,  economic
growth and development, housing, corruption, moral regeneration and  so  on.
Of course, matters relating to the rest  of  the  world  were  also  raised.
These relate to the  challenges  of  African  renewal,  including  Zimbabwe,
peace  in  the  Middle  East,  international   terrorism   and   issues   of
multilateralism versus unilateralism.

With regard to the domestic issues, I would  like  to  venture  the  opinion
that what many of us said, including the  Government,  is  that  during  our
first decade of democracy we did not succeed in eradicating  the  legacy  of
colonialism and apartheid. Or, to put this in Martin Creamer's words:


  The last ten years also have to be viewed  simply  as  a  good  start  in
  building true racial, social and economic liberation. Much still  has  to
  be done ... We are merely at the end of the beginning.

I believe that it bodes well for our country that we seem  to  have  reached
this level of consensus about the challenges we face. Undoubtedly and  quite
naturally, our views will differ as to what should be  done  to  respond  to
these challenges. The forthcoming elections will provide our people with  an
opportunity to  decide  which  of  the  various  party  responses  to  these
challenges they consider the most  credible  and  which  among  our  various
parties they consider the most dependable,  as  our  country  continues  the
struggle to eradicate the legacy of centuries of racism and apartheid.
Those who hold the view that the situation in our  country  is  worse  today
than it was 10 years ago will have the opportunity to  convince  the  people
that this assertion is in fact true. In  this  regard,  the  hon  Tony  Leon
said:


  ... the South African reality is that for millions of our fellow citizens
  life is no better now than it was in  1994  ...  In  spite  of  political
  freedom, life is actually worse.

The hon Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi echoed this sentiment when he said:


  ... poverty in rural areas is today worse than before 1994, when we  took
  over the running of this country.

Others, such as the hon Bantu Holomisa of the UDM and P H  K  Ditshetelo  of
the UCDP, will also have the possibility to convince the people about  their
rather  strange  economic  views,  in  terms   of   which   the   successful
interventions to correct the disastrous macroeconomic  imbalances  inherited
from the apartheid years are themselves the very cause of  the  perpetuation
of  the  socioeconomic  inequities  we  also  inherited   from   the   past.
[Applause.]

But having developed some consensus, and not  necessarily  unanimity,  about
the core challenges our country faces, we will still have to return  to  the
questions that the hon Annelizé van Wyk posed: Who are you and what are  you
going to do?

We will still have to respond to Martin Creamer, to  say  whether  we  agree
with him that, despite our partisan political differences, we need to  share
``a common consciousness of past pains'', whether we agree that ``a  [shared
and] better sense of [our] history'' would help all of us, black and  white,
to develop ``a sense of common purpose shaped by a deep  desire  to  redress
past ills''. Our responses to these propositions will turn on how we  answer
the questions of who we are and what we are going to do.

The hon Chief Whip of the Majority Party, Nkosinathi Nhleko, said:
  More and more people of South  Africa  are  progressively  uniting  in  a
  people's contract to accelerate the process of eradicating the  apartheid
  legacy, [which] they have together identified ... as their common enemy.

The hon Renier Schoeman said:


  You correctly work on the premise,  Mr  President,  that  in  unity  lies
  strength ... and that the extent of the challenges  requires  that  unity
  and strength for a collective effort to overcome them.

The hon Musa Zondi said:


  The IFP is immensely proud to have  played  a  significant  role  in  the
  reconciliation process and in the  nation-building  project  since  1994,
  under the leadership of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. We did not stand  on
  the sidelines. We were not afraid to  become  involved.  Whilst  the  IFP
  participated in the national Government to  advance  nation-building  and
  reconciliation, the ruling party's magnanimity in  allowing  the  IFP  to
  contribute to the nation's governance was, I believe,  unprecedented  ...
  The road to national unity is a long journey. We may not even complete it
  in our lifetimes, but we have made a beginning.

The hon Ismail Vadi invited us to ``listen to the voices of  ordinary  South
Africans, who go about their daily lives building our nation''.

The hon Miss Rajbally said:


  Greater achievement depends on us all and whether we really want  to  see
  South Africa improve, for if we do, we will unite ourselves in doing  so,
  for together we are a stronger nation.

To return to what Nelson Mandela said 10 years ago,  which  we  quoted  last
Friday:


  And so we must, constrained by and  yet  regardless  of  the  accumulated
  effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for  ourselves
  what we want to make of our shared destiny.

On Friday, speaking on behalf of the Government and not the ANC,  I  pointed
out some of our country's  principal  achievements  as  we  have  worked  to
define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.

I reported on the Government's perspectives about what we will  need  to  do
during our second decade of liberation to move further forward  towards  the
realisation of the goal of building a people-centred society.

In this regard, I must repeat that during this past decade we  have  put  in
place the whole range of critical policies that must enable us  successfully
to confront the challenges many of  us  identified  during  the  debate.  It
would indeed have been a signal failure on our part if, in 10 years, we  had
failed to produce the policies that we need to move  our  country  from  its
apartheid  past  to  the  prosperous  nonracial  and   nonsexist   democracy
visualised in our Constitution. And I am certain that this has not been  one
of our failures.

Nelson Mandela was released from prison 14 years ago today. Since  then,  as
Martin Creamer said, ``much  has  been  achieved  in  the  first  decade  of
democracy''.

In this context, we rejoice with those of  our  people  who  today  will  be
returning to their beloved District  Six  here  in  Cape  Town.  [Applause.]
Among them are Mr Dan Ndzabela, who is 82 years old  and  was  removed  from
District Six in 1959, as well as Ebrahim Murat, who is 83 years old and  was
removed from his home in 1967.

Madam Speaker, I would also like to draw our attention to  the  achievements
of two young South African students.

The first is a Grade  11  student  at  Fezeka  Senior  Secondary  School  in
Gugulethu who won the Africa leg of  a  worldwide  essay  competition  ``Red
Rover goes to Mars''. She will shortly leave our shores, as one of  the  hon
members  said,  to  represent  Africa,  joining  15  students   from   other
continents, as student astronauts at NASA in the United States.  [Applause.]
May I acknowledge Nomathemba Kontyo, a very special visitor in  our  gallery
today. She is sitting up there. [Applause.]

May I, on behalf of  the  Government  and  all  South  Africans,  extend  my
congratulations to Nomathemba for her  wonderful  achievement.  We  have  no
doubt that she will do our country and continent proud.

Madam Speaker, hon members, I also want to take the opportunity  to  mention
a young student from Bushbuckridge in Limpopo who has become, at the age  of
14, the youngest person to have registered at Unisa. [Applause.]  Sanelisiwe
Sambo's evident special abilities and intelligence were  recognised  by  her
school in Hazyview and her school career was allowed to be accelerated.

May I therefore take the opportunity to congratulate her on her  achievement
and wish her well  in  her  studies  as  a  Bachelor  of  Commerce  student.
[Applause.]

What these happy instances  show  is  that  we  are  indeed  moving  forward
towards the achievement of true racial, social and economic  liberation,  as
Martin Creamer put it.

I must also say that none of us could have avoided being moved by  what  the
hon  Dr  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi  said  when  he  pointed  out  his  own  able
contribution to the process  of  national  reconciliation  in  our  country,
noting correctly that if we have failed, it will not be because we have  not
tried. I am certain that all of us agree with  him  that  ``the  really  new
South Africa must be built with the commitment and  sacrifices  of  all,  to
make it become a decent and prosperous place for all''.

I believe that all of us should be proud  that  history  has  given  us  the
possibility to contribute to this historic outcome.

I thank all members for their contributions to the debate. Thank you,  Madam
Speaker. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 14:29.

     Recommendations of the Joint  Ad  Hoc  Subcommittee  on  Oversight  and
     Accountability which were adopted by the Joint Rules  Committee  on  25
     March 2003:


         The Report of the Joint Rules Committee on  the  Implementation  of
         the Recommendations of the Joint Ad Hoc Subcommittee  on  Oversight
         and Accountability, dated 17 November 2003, was  published  in  the
         ATC of the same day. The Report did not contain  the  full  set  of
         recommendations of the Subcommittee.


         At its meeting held on 26 November 2003, the Joint Rules  Committee
         resolved that the full set of resolutions contained  in  the  final
         report  of  the  Joint  Ad  Hoc  Subcommittee  on   Oversight   and
         Accountability be published in the ATC.


         The following is  the  full  set  of  resolutions  including  those
         published on 17 November 2003:


         Developing an understanding of oversight
         Recommendation 1


         The Subcommittee recommends that:
         1.1      Parliament  through  the  Joint  Rules  Committee   (JRC),
              compiles   a   document   "landscaping"   the   Constitutional
              provisions dealing with the inter-related themes of Oversight,
              Accountability, Transparency and responsiveness, and outlining
              international trends. Such  a  document  should  also  include
              inputs from key constitutional negotiators either in the  form
              of commissioned research or essays, (preferably both).


         1.2     Following  the  tabling  of  the  abovementioned  document,
              debates, workshops and discussions should  be  programmed  and
              organised within Parliament, first  amongst  MP's  themselves,
              and then later on  expanded  to  include  other  stakeholders.
              These debates and discussions should have as  their  objective
              the development of a broad understanding of the Oversight Role
              and Purpose of Parliament within our Constitutional democracy.


         Coordination between the Houses


         Recommendation 2


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         2.1     The JRC initiate a process  aimed  at  drafting  guidelines
              for portfolio and select committees to  allow  inter-alia  for
              joint planning of oversight work.


         2.2     A process should be initiated  to  establish  protocols  to
              ensure structured  communication  between  committees  through
              streamlining of the committee section, which would  allow  for
              more effective and formal communication between committees  of
              both Houses that embark on mutual interest oversight work  and
              briefing sessions.
         Building Parliament's Oversight Capacity


         Recommendation 3


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         3.1     The  Joint  Rules  Committee  begins  a  process  aimed  at
              producing  a  long  term  institutional  Vision  and   Mission
              Statement   aimed   at   building    Parliament's    oversight
              capabilities through adequate resourcing and capacity building
              in committees, Constituency offices  and  within  Parliament's
              administrative  support  structures  -   in   particular   the
              Committee section where a record-keeping system, and  tracking
              mechanisms are required to be established.


         3.2     Parliament adopts a policy requiring  each  new  Parliament
              to assess and review its oversight  capabilities  once  during
              its five-year lifespan.
         Institutions Supporting Democracy


         Recommendation 4


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


            The matters of independence of the ISD,  the  more  co-ordinated
              interaction between Parliament and the ISD, the  effectiveness
              of the oversight role of the ISD, their  budgetary  procedures
              and their accountability to Parliament, be the  subject  of  a
              more extensive consultation process that  should  involve  all
              role-players. This  kind  of  process  we  believe  should  be
              initiated by Parliament and that it would be for Parliament to
              decide how best to engage in this process.


         Developing and Institutional Memory


         Recommendation 5


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


            Parliament, urgently takes measures to develop a  Best  Practice
              Guide to capture, inter alia, the best oversight practices  of
              committees and the  experiences  of  chairpersons  of  various
              Select and Portfolio Committees.


          Fine tuning and development of Oversight Mechanisms


         Recommendation 6


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         6.1     Parliament commissions  an  audit  of  the  various  bodies
              exercising public powers pr performing  public  functions  and
              which should in  addition  be  clearly  delineate  which  line
              function departments are responsible for the various organs of
              state. Portfolio and Select Committees within parliament  will
              consequently assume the necessary oversight responsibility.


         6.2     Parliament through the  JRC  develops  a  policy  aimed  at
              meeting  its  constitutional  obligations   set   out   in   s
              55(2)(b)(ii).


         6.3     Such a policy  should  consider  the  necessity  for  basic
              legislation giving effect to s 55(2) on  issues  of  oversight
              and accountability and dealing especially with organs of state
              directly accountable to Parliament.


         6.4     The JRC develops a policy  allowing  for  more  debates  on
              committee oversight reports to be  programmed.  These  debates
              should take the form of MPs raising issues of concern based on
              the report tabled and Ministers responding to those issues.


         Introducing Oversight Mechanisms: Accountability Standards Act


         Recommendation 7*


         The Subcommittee recommends that:


         Option 1
         Parliament  should  begin  a  formal  process  of  evaluating   its
         oversight activities as distinct  from  its  legislative  role  and
         developing a manual on Accountability and  Oversight  for  MPs  and
         Committees,  with  the  intention  of  constantly  developing   and
         refining such a manual.


         Option 2
         Parliament should adopt  the  recommendation  as  proposed  by  the
         consultant's that an Accountability Standards Act be enacted.


         (* Joint Rules Committee still has to decide  on  which  option  to
         adopt)


         Bringing Parliament's oversight role to bear on the Budget Process


         Recommendation 8


         The Subcommittee noting the  inextricable  link  between  effective
         Parliamentary  oversight  and  Parliament's  role  in  the   budget
         process recommends that:


         Parliament develops a formal process to enact legislation in  terms
         of section 77(2) of the Constitution.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Public Auditing  Function,  dated  3
     February 2004:


         The Ad Hoc Committee on Public Auditing  Function  was  established
         by Resolution of the House (see Minutes of Proceedings of  National
         Assembly, dated 24 June 2003, p 700) and mandated  to  introduce  a
         bill on the objects contained in a legislative  proposal  reviewing
         the public auditing function, which was submitted  to  the  Speaker
         by the Audit Commission (see Announcements, Tabling  and  Committee
         Reports, 2 June 2003, p 518)


         The Ad Hoc Committee reports as follows:


         That it has completed its task for which  it  was  established  and
         wishes to submit its report as well  as  to  introduce  the  Public
         Audit Bill  [B1  -  2004]  (National  Assembly  section  -  75)  by
         submitting a copy thereof to the Speaker in  accordance  with  Rule
         243.


         Prior notice of the introduction of  the  bill  was  given  in  the
         Government  Gazette,  No  25064,  dated  5  June  2003,   by   this
         Parliament, and an  explanatory  summery  of  the  draft  bill  was
         published in the same Gazette.
         The Gazette also contained invitation  to  interested  persons  and
         institutions  to  submit  written  representations  on  the   draft
         legislation to the Secretary to Parliament before 25 June 2003.  On
         that basis, the Committee held public hearings where  public  input
         was entertained.


         In addition, the Committee consulted with: the chairperson  of  the
         Portfolio Committee on Defense, the  Auditor-General,  the  Speaker
         of the National Assembly, the Presidency, the  National  Department
         of Intelligence, the  Department  of  Defense,  the  South  African
         Police Service and the National  Treasury.  The  Ad  Hoc  Committee
         wishes to take this opportunity to thank all  those  who  willingly
         provided  their  valuable  input  and  guidance  to  the   Ad   Hoc
         Committee.


         Accordingly,  having  spent  a  considerable  amount  of  time   in
         consultations and deliberations on the draft bill  over  that  past
         few months, the Ad Hoc Committee wishes to put its  recommendations
         to the House as follows:


         The Auditor-General is a Chapter Nine institution in terms  of  the
         South African Constitution and  as  such,  is  accountable  to  the
         National Assembly. Until now the National Assembly has not  decided
         upon or established a mechanism in terms of section 55 (2)  of  the
         Constitution through which Chapter Nine bodies should  account.  In
         this regard, the Ad Hoc  Committee  recommends  that  the  National
         Assembly, through its Rules Committee, gives effect to  section  55
         (2) of the Constitution by establishing an oversight  mechanism  to
         which the  Auditor-General  should  account.  This  will  have  the
         effect of replacing the current Audit Commission,  which  comprises
         Members of the National Assembly, Members of the  National  Council
         of Provinces and members of civil society.


         The  Committee  also  recommends  that  the  Rules  Committee  also
         considers that the sole mandate of the new oversight  mechanism  be
         oversight over the Auditor-General. The reasons for this being:


         -  That the work of the Auditor-General  concerns  the  quality  of
              work of the Executive Government and  issues  of  independence
              which go beyond those of the other Chapter Nine bodies;


         -   The  nature  of  the  work  of  the  Auditor-General  is   more
              technically specific than  that  of  the  other  Chapter  Nine
              bodies. Therefore, this requires an oversight  mechanism  that
              dedicates its attention to  its  work  and  has  a  particular
              understanding and knowledge of the institution;


         -    The   Auditor-General   is   the   National   and   Provincial
              Legislatures' most important and single  biggest  supplier  of
              oversight information. And as such, it is an integral part  of
              the  conventional  accountability  chain  prescribed  by   the
              Constitution;


         -  In terms of its size and resources, it is  substantially  bigger
              that all the other Chapter Nine bodies considering its budget,
              infrastructure and personnel; and


         -  As the only Chapter  Nine  body  that  does  not  receive  funds
              through any Vote, there is  particular  oversight  requirement
              regarding its income and expenditure.


         The  above  considerations  make  it  increasingly  desirable  that
         members who will serve on the envisaged  oversight  mechanism  will
         be able to concentrate their attention on the  specific  attributes
         of the Auditor-General and to  become  appropriately  knowledgeable
         in this regard.
         It is also recommended that all  practical  considerations  of  the
         new oversight mechanism conform to the existing  National  Assembly
         rules and practices.


         Our final  recommendation  is  that  the  provisions  in  question,
         regarding the introduction of the new oversight structure  and  its
         replacement of the existing  Audit  Commission,  only  be  effected
         from 1 April 2004.


     Report to be considered.
