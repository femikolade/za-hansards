The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I would  like  to  inform  members  that
there is one speakers' list to deal with the first, second and third  orders
of the day.

Once more, before I go to the speakers' list, I  would  like  to  thank  all
three Ministers who agreed when we requested that we  cluster  this  debate.
It is more than merely the clustering; it is for our  understanding  on  how
the department works as well, particularly  as  the  NCOP.  This  clustering
helps us so that when we go the provinces we understand  what  is  happening
within the departments. We want to thank all three Ministers  for  accepting
this type of clustering and putting this into one debate.

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 6 - Public Works; Vote No 29 - Housing; Vote No 33 - Transport:

The MINISTER OF  PUBLIC  WORKS:  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, my colleagues the Ministers of Housing and Transport, the  Deputy
Minister of Public Works, MECs for public  works,  the  Chairperson  of  the
Select Committee on Public Works, hon members, the director-general and  his
team, including  provincial  heads  of  departments,  distinguished  guests,
ladies and gentlemen, I must  explain  before  I  speak  that  I  was  never
consulted.

Today, as we deal with the Public Works Budget, we have in mind  the  people
out there who are keen to know what we as a department will  do  to  deliver
on our mandate and to honour the people's contract.

Five years ago we  punctuated  our  operations  with  a  call  for  improved
service delivery characterised by  an  intensive  implementation  phase.  We
simply entitled our pledge Mintirho ya vulavula [Actions speak  louder  than
words] and we vowed to stop at nothing better than  improving  our  business
processes and other practices. We are encouraged by  the  progress  we  have
made.

Regarding service delivery and programme  improvement,  our  starting  point
was  a  transformation  process  aimed  at   realigning   the   departmental
operations in order to deliver a high quality  service.  Thus  the  regional
operations of  the  department  have  been  strengthened  through  capacity-
building and delegations of powers to make  client  satisfaction  a  central
focus of  their  business.  A  generic  service  level  agreement  has  been
developed to formalise service relationships between my department  and  our
clients.

It is my honour to table my department's appropriation of R4,8  billion  for
this fiscal year. Whilst this amount represents a 10% increase  compared  to
the previous year, it is  still  not  sufficient  to  meet  all  our  needs,
particularly regarding the maintenance backlog on government  buildings.  In
this  regard,  my  department  is  currently  developing   a   comprehensive
maintenance plan so that we can make more convincing and credible  arguments
for increased funding for maintenance in the forthcoming year.

Nine hundred and seventy capital  works  projects  are  already  at  various
planning stages for this financial year. These projects  are  spread  across
the nine provinces, with the Western Cape commanding the highest  number  of
projects - 168. The rest are  broken  down  as  follows:  North  West,  162;
KwaZulu-Natal, 152; Gauteng, 132; Eastern Cape, 107;  Mpumalanga,  83;  Free
State, 81; Northern Cape, 50 and Limpopo, 24.

Provision of physical accommodation to Government and  its  departments  for
enhanced public service delivery remains a key function  of  my  department.
In the previous financial year we spent  R1,85  billion  on  capital  works,
including R364 million on planned  maintenance  as  part  of  our  extensive
building  programme  nationally.  Major  progress  made  includes  the  R108
million upgrading of the Port Elizabeth magistrate's office. There  is  also
the construction of two magistrate's  courts  for  justice  in  the  Gauteng
province; one is being completed at a cost of R50 million  in  Randburg  and
the other R43 million in Tembisa. The other projects involve  the  upgrading
and maintenance of the Klerksdorp Prison in the North West and the  Cullinan
Prison  in  Gauteng,  which  will  cost  R90   million   and   R70   million
respectively. In the Free State we  are  currently  busy  with  construction
totalling R15,5 million  for  a  new  maternity  ward  at  the  Bloemfontein
Military Hospital, as well as completing the Namahadi  Police  Station  near
Frankfort at a cost of R15,3 million.

Seventeen new properties were acquired and registered at  the  Deeds  Office
at a total cost of R16,77 million. The majority  of  these  properties  were
for the purposes of accommodating the South African Police Service  and  the
Scorpions.

The Gauteng province was the major beneficiary of  this  process,  with  the
acquisition of a farm for the Scorpions worth  R9  million  and  five  other
properties below R1 million were acquired on behalf of the  SAPS.  The  next
highest number of properties the department bought went to the  Free  State.
The Department of Public Works acquired  three  properties  in  the  Eastern
Cape on behalf of the Department of Water Affairs and the SAPS  and  two  in
the Western  Cape  on  behalf  of  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs.  The
department acquired two properties in the Northern Cape for the SAPS,  while
Mpumalanga and North West acquired one property each as  a  result  of  this
process. An amount of R2,3 million will be spent to purchase 4  064  ha  for
revenue services in  support  of  the  Golela  border  post  development  in
Mpumalanga.

In the period under review, we disposed of 121 properties  in  extent  of  4
565 ha, with an estimated value of R45 million for purposes of land  reform,
low-cost  housing,  municipal  infrastructure,  government   to   government
transfers and commercial gain.

When divided according to provinces, the disposal process looks as  follows:
Limpopo saw the disposal of  1  456  pieces  of  land,  while  KwaZulu-Natal
disposed of 976, 1 073 ha. The rest of the provinces  are  as  follows:  the
Eastern Cape, 856,6;  the  Free  State,  3,1;  Gauteng,  393,3;  Mpumalanga,
834,3; the Northern Cape, 637,104 and the Western Cape 39, 6356.

A total leasing amount of just over R1  billion  was  budgeted  in  2003-04,
indicating demand and associated costs for  accommodation  and  space.  When
broken down according to  provinces,  the  following  picture  emerges:  the
Department of Public Works  budgeted  R410  million  for  Gauteng  and  R101
million for KwaZulu-Natal. The  rest  of  the  provinces  were  as  follows:
Mpumalanga  with  R48  million;  Limpopo,  R42,4  million;  Gauteng,    R130
million; the North West, R46,4 million; the Western  Cape,  R123,5  million;
the Eastern Cape, R86 million; the Northern Cape, R26 million, and the  Free
State, R47 million. The department is concerned about the condition of  both
government-owned and leased buildings, and is  proactively  preparing  plans
to address the issue.

Coming to black economic empowerment: Black economic empowerment as  defined
and embraced by Government informs all aspects of our business.

The designs for the new generation of prisons have been completed,  and  the
construction of new prisons  will  proceed  in  2005-06  on  behalf  of  the
Department of Correctional Services. The  four  prisons  will  be  built  at
Kimberley, Nigel, Leeuwkop and Klerksdorp. Each prison will be  built  at  a
cost of  R220  million  over  a  22-month  construction  period.  To  create
opportunities for  small,  medium  and  large  construction  companies,  the
building work has been divided  into  20  separate  nominated  subcontracts,
ranging from R1,4 million to R120 million, which will be the main contract.

In 2003-04 contracts to the total value of  R791  million  were  awarded  to
emerging contractors under the Emerging Contractor  Development  scheme,  of
which R88  million  went  to  women-owned  enterprises  under  the  Emerging
Contractor Development programme, and I'm proud to say  to  the  House  that
women are really up and coming in the  construction  industry.  The  Western
Cape province awarded R35,8 million of its contracts to women,  followed  by
Gauteng, the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern  Cape,  Mpumalanga  and
Limpopo, but I don't have the figure for the  Eastern  Cape.  This  year  we
shall be convening  a  national  workshop  on  best  practices  in  emerging
contractor development with the provinces.

Coming  to  the  Expanded  Public  Works  programme:  I'll  start  with  the
community-based  one.  At  its  height,  the  community-based  public  works
programme  was  the  flagship  of  Government's  poverty-alleviation   drive
through rural  infrastructure  development.  For  a  decade  the  department
targeted rural  poverty  brought  about  a  lack  of  basic,  but  essential
infrastructure, including rural roads.

In that period the community-based  public  works  programme  invested  over
R2,5 billion in six provinces. All-in-all, 4  047  community  infrastructure
projects were implemented, resulting in the creation of more  than  167  000
job opportunities, of which 48% went to women and 30% to the youth.

Amongst us today we have women  of  note,  whom  we  invited  and  who  even
attended the assembly yesterday. They are Mrs N Tshalata  and  Mrs  T  Dube.
They are with us - I don't know where they are  seated  in  this  particular
assembly. What I want  to  say  is  that  uMama  Tshalata  is  part  of  the
Vukuzakhe community  development  project  of  KwaMachi  near  Harding,  who
recently led  other  women  in  discussions  with  Government  to  establish
poverty-alleviation projects in their rural community.

Mrs Dube is a farmer par excellence, and was nominated  last  year  for  the
Female Farmer of the Year Award for her work with other women at one of  our
projects at the Ndaya Community Production Centre. We have several of  these
women and they're doing a sterling job.

At the Growth and Development Summit last year,  Government,  trade  unions,
business and civil society agreed on the need for an extended  public  works
programme or EPWP. The objective of the EPWP is  to  utilise  public  sector
budgets to reduce and alleviate poverty.  This  programme  will  target  the
following  groups:  those  who  are  educated,  but  are  unemployable;  the
unemployed; the unskilled; people not  receiving  grants;  rural  and  urban
poor; people with disability, and we find that with the youth about  70%  of
that group is unemployed and it is high time we did something about it.

We are expecting that there will be a million opportunities created, and  we
intend to do this through increasing the  labour  intensity  of  Government-
funded  infrastructure  projects;  creating  work  opportunities  in  public
environmental  programmes,   like   Working   for   Water;   creating   work
opportunities in public social  programmes,  like  community  care  workers;
utilising general Government expenditure on goods and  services  to  provide
the  work  experience  component  of   small   enterprise   learnership   or
incubation;  other  possible  economic  sector  initiatives  include   micro
enterprise development.

Over the first five years we  conservatively  estimate  that  the  programme
will, through the infrastructure sector, create about 900 000 jobs;  in  the
environmental and cultural sector create 200 000 jobs; in the social  sector
create 20 000 jobs; in the economic sector, which has  not  been  calculated
to finality, create about  3  000  jobs  and  the  Department  of  Transport
actually falls under this, and the Minister has even better  figures  me  at
this particular moment.
We have already signed  memoranda  of  agreement  with  the  following:  the
National Treasury and the construction industry; the  Development  Bank,  to
work with provinces and municipalities to improve their  capacity  to  spend
on infrastructure and the Department  of  Labour  to  fund  and  manage  the
training of workers. The Construction Education and Training  Authority  has
already put in place 10 unit  standards  accredited  by  the  South  African
Qualifications Authority. These  will  enable  the  training  of  engineers,
government officials, contractors and site supervisors.

The  Research  Centre  for  Employment  Creation  in  Construction  at   the
University  of  the  Witwatersrand  will  provide  bursaries  and   research
fellowships to infrastructure  students  and  researchers.  The  aim  is  to
produce cadres of engineers who understand labour-intensive technologies.

Five municipalities and provinces, namely the Western Cape,  the  Mpumalanga
department of public works, the  Oliver  Tambo  district  municipality,  the
Ethekwini metropolitan council and the roads agency of Limpopo  are  already
implementing 288 of the 930 labour-intensive construction  enterprises.  And
I hope that within the next two weeks we'll begin to  get  information  from
the other provinces.

Statistics SA will  collect  data  through  the  labour  force  and  general
household surveys. This programme is mainstreamed, as  we've  said,  on  the
budgets  of   departments,   provinces,   municipalities   and   state-owned
enterprises.  The  large-scale  labour-intensive  provincial  and  municipal
infrastructure  programme  involves  ring-fencing   R15   million   of   the
conditional infrastructure to provinces and municipalities, the  rest  comes
from quite a number of other departments and adds up to a  figure  of  about
R100 million.

We have  engaged  the  Business  Trust  regarding  the  establishment  of  a
facilitation fund  to  support  capacity  building  and  innovation  in  the
Extended Public Works Programme. The British  department  for  international
development will contribute to this fund, and we have  had  a  lot  of  help
from the ILO and our thanks go to the Absa Bank, that  has  actually  agreed
to fund some of the contractors.

The  Human  Sciences  Research  Council  has  developed  a  monitoring   and
evaluation framework for this programme to collect data, which  will  assist
the department and me to report on our progress regularly  in  a  scientific
manner to the nation.

We are currently in advanced talks  with  the  Department  of  Minerals  and
Energy and the Department of Housing on their roles in the  Extended  Public
Works Programme, and the role of Housing is fairly extensive.

The department has finalised the  appointment  of  staff  for  the  Extended
Public Works unit, which will be the driving force  behind  the  success  of
the programme. After the successful launch of the programme  in  Limpopo  on
18 May 2004 there is a lot of enthusiasm among  stakeholders,  and  this  we
witnessed during our roadshows to the provinces and in the meetings  we  had
with the SA Local  Government  Association.  What  is  interesting  is  that
someone wrote to the department to say that he wanted to  be  instructed  in
bricklaying and baking - you can see how contrary those two are, but  it  is
a sign of enthusiasm.

In order to ensure the major contribution of our metros and cities, we  have
requested the SA Cities Network to commission an investigation into how  all
nine members of the network can contribute to the programme. We invited  one
of the contractors from Gundo Lashu  -  which  is  the  programme  that  was
launched by the President - a woman called Reinet Mhlarhi, who  owns  Lulama
Construction - she is also here somewhere -  which  is  currently  employing
hundreds of people in the rural areas of Limpopo to build  provincial  roads
using highly labour-intensive construction methods, and  who  wrote  to  the
President to thank him for the opportunities provided  to  her  through  the
Limpopo Public Works Programme. I would really like to say to  hon  members,
and especially the MECs, that that programme in Limpopo is  worth  visiting,
and getting to know some of the  lessons  it  brings.  It  is  a  very  good
programme.

The SA Government has set  a  number  of  priorities  for  the  construction
industry to create an enabling environment  for  the  industry  to  develop,
transform  and  grow.   These   priorities   include   skills   development,
innovation, increased investment and the transformation of the  industry  to
deliver on the needs of the South African society.

The construction industry's aging skills profile  provides  a  challenge  to
transfer knowledge and to ensure that the South African  youth  participates
in the construction industry in the future. Hon  members,  please  help  us.
Encourage the youth to look into this industry as one of  the  opportunities
for them, because, as  I'm  saying,  the  type  of  people  you'll  find  as
engineers and professors and so on are more or less people of  my  age,  and
we need a lot of revitalisation.

For this purpose, we have actually identified a  number  of  initiatives  to
promote the image of the industry, and to improve  the  overall  performance
and growth of the industry. These initiatives include:  procurement  reform;
innovation  and  absorption  of  innovation;  making   South   Africa   more
attractive for fixed investment; accelerated skills development to ensure  a
quality workforce; ensuring a  healthy  workforce  through  improved  labour
practices; investing in research and technology development;  improving  the
quality of construction products;  facilitating  mega  projects,  and  these
things we intend to do even with partners who  are  of  international  note;
improving  the  functionality  of  public  buildings  to   enhance   service
delivery.

We have actually identified a number of areas to move the industry into  the
21st century. These include: transferring  knowledge;  maximising  potential
in the workplace; technological innovation;  process  improvements;  use  of
information technology, and sustainability of the construction industry,  as
well as that of the built environment.

We are looking forward to what will come as a result of  the  fact  that  we
are going to be hosting the 2010 Soccer World Cup, because it will  bring  a
lot of infrastructure work and create the intended jobs.

We have what we call an incubator programme. The purpose  of  the  incubator
programme is  to  create  an  enabling  environment  within  which  selected
existing contracting enterprises can develop  into  sustainable  contracting
enterprises,  to  ensure  that  black-owned  medium-sized  contractors   are
developed to become sustainable businesses.
We still have the problem of fronting. Fronting really poses a great  threat
to the realisation  of  Government's  vision  for  economic  transformation.
Thus, the  CIDB  register  of  contractors  and  other  related  procurement
policies are the main tools through which the department intends  to  combat
fronting. The credentials  of  all  suppliers  will  be  checked  rigorously
before they are registered with the department,  and  we  mean  to  do  just
that.

The Department of Public Works  will,  together  with  the  private  sector,
jointly launch an intensive public and stakeholder relations  campaign  over
a period of a week in October 2004, aimed at repositioning the industry  and
emphasising its importance in the growth and  development  of  our  country.
The construction week will also aim at attracting school leavers  and  other
postgraduate students to careers in the industry.

Plans to convene a construction  summit,  which  is  being  co-ordinated  by
Nedlac,  are  in  place.  Various  stakeholders  are  already  involved   in
discussions to develop a charter for the sector. This will be followed by  a
comprehensive implementation and monitoring  plan  to  ensure  that  efforts
yield the desired results.

We are making a  contribution  to  Nepad.  Public  Works,  as  part  of  its
contribution, has formed a partnership with the Ministry of Defence and  the
CSIR, which will develop a strategy that  will  lead  to  peacekeeping  that
encompasses a strong developmental component. The concept  of  developmental
peacekeeping has received the support from  the  Presidency  and  the  Nepad
Secretariat.

Fifty-seven trainees have completed the basic  military  training  component
of the Military Skills Development  programme.  The  department  has  signed
agreements with each of the 57  graduates  in  order  to  assist  them  with
placement or further education and training in 2005.

The challenges faced by the department and the  South  African  construction
sector are not unique to this country. It is for this reason  that  we  will
spearhead an initiative to establish a forum of  public  works  departments,
initially in the SADC region  and  in  other  regions  in  future.  I'll  be
convening a conference of African  ministers  of  public  works  to  discuss
challenges facing the construction and  property  industries,  job  creation
and poverty-alleviation projects on the continent. This will be part of  our
contribution to Nepad, as African ministers of public works.

In conclusion, as we look back over the last 10 years of democracy,  we  are
quite pleased with the progress we  have  made,  both  in  terms  of  policy
formulation and in terms of implementation. However,  as  indicated  by  the
President, the next five years are going to be focused on delivery,  and  we
are committed to meeting that.

I would like to thank you all for attending, especially  those  of  you  who
travelled from far to attend this session. Last,  but  not  least,  I  would
like to thank the team from the Department of Public Works.

This decade represents a new dawn in  our  historic  social  pact  with  the
people of this country. The ever-present queues  of  work  seekers  and  the
beggar at every intersection on our way  to  work  remind  us  every  waking
minute of what stands at the centre  of  the  people's  contract,  which  is
delivery. It is the delivery of jobs and skills that will  move  the  masses
of our people from the second economy, so that they  assume  their  rightful
place in the first economy. We then make this clarion call today for all  of
us to come on board. Let us put the shoulder to the wheel. Let  us  make  it
happen. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Thank you, Chairperson.  Members  of  the  National
Council of Provinces and all protocol observed, the central  tenets  of  our
policy, in brief, can be based on  six  pillars,  which  I  now  proceed  to
determine.

Firstly, we are shifting away from  quantity  to  quality  housing.  In  the
past, the quest to meet the huge demand in housing drove  us  unfortunately,
to concentrate on numbers. We will now be dealing with the  two  components,
which are not mutually exclusive. While we  deliver  on  quantity,  we  will
also be concentrating on the quality of the product that we deliver.

The second pillar is accelerated delivery. The greatest housing need  is  in
areas of economic activity and we have realised that we are  not  delivering
at the rate at which people are drawn into these  centres.  Even  though  we
have received world acclaim for the rate of our delivery, when  we  consider
the historical legacy from which we move, it becomes clear that we  have  to
pick up the pace.

A third leg of our strategy deals with corruption and maladministration.  We
intend to deal with this wherever it  rears  its  ugly  head.  Many  of  our
people in the past have complained and we, on our part,  have  responded  by
setting up a special investigative unit that  will  help  us  understand  to
what extent these complaints are  prevalent  and  whether  they  are  indeed
true, and, if they are, we will act on them. Having assessed that,  we  will
then be able to deal decisively with the problem.

Fourthly, we will give support to black economic empowerment companies.  The
fifth component will involve  the  development  of  medium-density  housing,
including rental stock. Sixthly, and finally, we  intend  to  drive  towards
the eradication of informal settlements.

Our people have taken recognition of the  achievements  of  Government  over
the past 10 years through  the  Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme.
Houses that have been delivered are 1,6 million and  2,4  million  subsidies
have been approved. This rate of delivery has been at the  average  rate  of
160 000 units per  annum,  which  peaked  modestly  in  1998.  The  results,
therefore, of the first 10  years  of  democracy  relating  to  housing  are
tangible. They have vastly improved the living conditions of our people  and
unblocked the freeze that apartheid placed on housing.

However, due to backlogs, in part, we  are  still  faced  with  the  serious
challenge  of  informal   settlements   in   Duncan   Village,   Crossroads,
Mshenguville, Lamontville, Soweto on Sea and the banks of the Jukskei  River
in Alexandra; and more recently, in Winnie Mandela Park, Joe Slovo  and  the
N2 corridor in Cape Town.

Our people still find themselves in conditions of squalor,  deprivation  and
marginalisation. Year in and year out they  experience  flooding  and  fires
which take away their prized  possessions.  Left  on  their  own,  they  are
unable to escape these conditions that kill  their  pride  and  dignity,  to
which they were previously condemned because  of  their  colour.  For  them,
tomorrow is too late.

Year in and year out we respond to them on an  emergency  basis,  as  if  to
accept that the conditions of squalor found in  informal  settlements  could
be regarded as the norm, so that when ravaged, by fires and flooding  alike,
we declare them  disaster  areas.  Yet,  we  know  that  the  phenomenon  of
informal settlements continues to be the challenge that  blights  the  total
achievement of our government in delivering a better life for all.

It is in this context that we have declared  war  on  informal  settlements.
These  settlements  are  characterised  by  poor  quality  of   life,   high
unemployment, impermanent shack housing and a lack of convenient  access  to
social and economic opportunities such as health care, education, sport  and
recreation, and local formal employment.

Living in such settlements, commonly experienced, is the trauma of  personal
and property crime, often more so  than  in  other  parts  of  the  city  or
country. Policing and access to emergency services  in  the  case  of  fire,
sickness or injury are made even more difficult by the lack of  roads.  And,
because  there  is  often  no  electricity,  people   living   in   informal
settlements are restricted in the type of  income-generating  projects  they
can pursue. I am very glad to hear that hon  Minister  Sigcau  here  has  an
elaborate plan and I am hoping that it will make tracks  into  the  informal
settlements.

 Our focus in this new decade  of  freedom  will  therefore  be  to  upgrade
informal settlements. We will eradicate them on river banks,  flood  plains,
rubbish dumps, dolomitic land and sinkholes. In the overcrowded  houses  and
backyards of Soweto, KwaZakhele and Khayelitsha, we will ensure that  people
can choose to relocate in order to access land, basic  services  and  decent
shelter to rent or to own.

The focus will be on providing housing and  basic  services  on  a  priority
basis to those who currently occupy shacks and have  no  access  to  running
water, sanitation or electricity. We will be pushing back the  frontiers  of
poverty by reducing the housing backlog.

With increasing urbanisation, those without  decent  shelter  in  our  urban
conurbations have grown. It is for this reason  that  we  believe  that  our
attention must shift to specifically address informal settlements  directly.
The upgrading of informal settlements will present great  challenges,  given
the  complex  nature  of   consultations   required   with   community-based
organisations and individual beneficiaries, in ensuring that  we  take  into
consideration the various needs, circumstances and desires of our people.

Appropriate solutions will be provided for rural-based families who come  to
the cities to seek employment, young urban families  requiring  mobility  in
order to respond to economic opportunities or  those  who  have  left  their
overcrowded family behind to make a new start, and people with  disabilities
or other special needs who require access to social facilities.

The President, in his state of the nation address, said we  would  build  on
our experiences of the past 10 years to intensify the housing programme.  He
said that we would develop a  comprehensive  programme  dealing  with  human
settlement and social infrastructure, including  rental  housing  stock  for
the poor.

He said we would, in the next three years, spend R15,2 billion to  help  our
people to have access to basic shelter. He committed us  to  addressing  the
trend in some  provinces  where  there  has  been  a  slow-down  in  housing
delivery, as well as addressing the broader question of  spatial  settlement
patterns and the implications of this in our efforts to  build  a  nonracial
society. Further, through housing delivery, we will assist in delivering  on
the water and sanitation targets.

The human settlement and infrastructure programme will comprise three  major
thrusts: The development  of  medium-density  housing,  informal  settlement
upgrading and the  development  of  social  infrastructure  in  well-located
areas.

We will identify, together with the Departments of Land Affairs  and  Public
Works, in our  conurbations,  suitably  located,  affordable  land  for  the
development of medium-density housing in inner city areas, infill  sites  in
suburban areas, and vacant land that is  in  close  proximity  of  areas  of
employment.  This  will  constitute   the   comprehensive   land-for-housing
programme which we should complete  in  the  next  three  months.  It  will,
further, constitute specific resource allocation for  social  infrastructure
in existing and new housing development areas through the  human  settlement
redevelopment programme fund, allocation for which has already been made  in
the 2004-05 budget. This fund will also be prioritised for the upgrading  of
informal settlements.

In the urban-based metropolitan areas, a clear need for rental  housing  has
been determined, with rural migrants not wanting to invest  their  resources
to meet their urban housing needs. In addition,  young  families  depend  on
mobility to secure economic opportunities and  therefore  remain  transient.
To respond to this need, we  have  facilitated  the  development  of  rental
housing stock through the promulgation of the Rental Housing Act of  1999  -
which regulates the roles and responsibilities  of  landlords  and  tenants,
and establishes a framework for the efficient management of rental  housing.
Rental housing policy will be concluded this year  and  the  rental  housing
subsidy will be implemented from the beginning of the next financial year.

The comprehensive programme to be submitted to Cabinet by the  end  of  July
will include  land  acquisition,  medium-density  development  strategy  and
financial models, inner  city  regeneration  programmes,  measures  for  the
enhancement of the secondary housing market, the principles  of  the  rental
housing policy and rental housing subsidy, and  a  revamped  social  housing
programme together with the social housing policy, in order to ensure  well-
capacitated institutions and to manage rental  stock.  This  programme  will
prioritise informal settlement areas, sparsely populated suburban areas  and
inner city areas,  in  order  to  change  the  spatial  settlement  patterns
through integration and the building of a nonracial society.

Resulting from discussions with  Cabinet  and  our  housing  MECs,  we  have
agreed to devote ourselves to fast-tracking delivery; building the  capacity
of municipalities to operate more effectively at all  levels;  upgrading  of
informal settlements; relocation to new development  areas;  enhancement  of
social crime-prevention through all our housing interventions;  rooting  out
corruption and maladministration in the housing programme;  promoting  urban
efficiency and renewal; racial integration through sound  spatial  planning,
and through support for medium-density residential  development;  increasing
rental opportunities for the poor;  and,  maximising  the  redistributionary
benefits and black economic empowerment through the housing process.

Our  interventions  focus  on  promoting  good  governance   and   attaining
sustainable, integrated human settlements. With respect to good  governance,
we will focus on  an  efficient  and  effective  system  of  government  and
optimise the potential of all stakeholders to constructively  contribute  to
our goal of housing the nation.

We will establish the necessary policy and regulatory  environment,  systems
and  procedures,  human  and  financial  resources,  and  an  organisational
culture that strives for excellence throughout the  institutional  machinery
collectively responsible for achieving the  housing  mandate.  At  municipal
level, we will focus our  efforts  particularly  on  building  capacity  for
municipal  officials,  councillors  and  emerging  contractors   to   ensure
efficient delivery of housing.

It is clear, as the housing programme has  matured  over  the  last  decade,
that certain vested interests have begun to operate and  to  take  advantage
and abuse the system of benefits that has been put in  place.  In  the  more
extreme cases, this can be referred  to  as  clearly  corrupt  practices  by
officials and individuals from the private  sector,  or  even  by  community
members.

The department will establish, as I have indicated, a special  investigative
unit in the office of the director-general that will  explicitly  deal  with
fraud, corruption and maladministration in all our housing programmes.  This
directorate will closely liaise with provincial departments  and  all  other
stakeholders  responsible   for   fighting   corruption   to   ensure   that
investigations are carried out effectively. Furthermore,  it  will  finalise
the  outstanding  cases  of  fraud  and   corruption   with   the   National
Prosecutions Authority.

The department has already appointed KPMG as a second task team  to  support
the work of the directorate in the  elimination  of  fraud,  corruption  and
maladministration in the implementation of national housing programmes,  and
will  immediately  establish  a  toll-free  whistle-blowing  hotline  to  be
stafled 24 hours a day in order to enable members of the  public  to  report
any allegations of fraud and corruption. A report of their findings will  be
submitted to Parliament by the end of the year.

The contribution that housing projects make to  improving  urban  efficiency
will  continue  to  be  pursued  in  partnership  with   other   departments
responsible for investing in the built environment. The  benefits  of  urban
efficiency, of development on well-located land, at  higher-built  densities
with  appropriate  typologies  of  housing,  combined  with  the  range   of
facilities needed to support economic development,  and  appropriate  tenure
arrangements,  are  to  be  pursued  through  the   medium-density   housing
programme.

We are revising the current policy to replace it with  a  policy  that  will
enable the  creation  of  humane  conditions,  and  one  that  will  provide
affordable and sustainable housing opportunities on either a rental or  home
ownership basis. A few pilot redevelopment projects that  could  inform  the
revision of the current policy, and which could provide certain examples  of
best practice,  were  launched.  The  department  also  prepared  a  set  of
technical specifications for the upgrading or provision of new services  and
the  redevelopment   of   hostel   buildings.   The   enhancement   of   the
implementation guidelines,  which  will  direct  the  redevelopment  of  the
Public Sector Hostels Redevelopment Programme, will be finalised by the  end
of this financial year.

Effective from 1 April 2002, Government introduced the  principle  that  all
qualifying housing subsidy beneficiaries must contribute  towards  achieving
access to the benefits of the housing subsidy. The objective of this was  to
ensure that subsidy beneficiaries participated in the  resolution  of  their
housing needs, that an environment was established to instil  a  culture  of
savings, and that the value of  the  assets  provided  through  the  housing
subsidy could be realised by the beneficiaries.

The low-income housing sector has the potential  to  contribute  further  to
the objectives of  the  Extended  Public  Works  Programme,  that  has  been
outlined here by the  hon  Minister,  through  infrastructure  provision  in
delivering some of its programmes, such as the Greenfield  housing  projects
and the presidential pilot projects on rental housing,  informal  settlement
upgrading and emergency housing. Although the  technology  employed  in  the
infrastructure component of housing delivery is  already  aligned  with  the
Public Works Programme ideals, we are further hoping  that  we  will  engage
the CSIR in  assisting  us  with  further  research  in  this  respect.  The
department will finalise its input for the social and  economic  sectors  by
the end of June.

We will be embarking on an imbizo to find out from  communities  what  their
needs are, and secondly, what it is that they are willing to  contribute  in
this partnership. Working closely with the  Departments  of  Provincial  and
Local Government, Transport, Water Affairs and Forestry,  Public  Works  and
Land Affairs and Agriculture, we will be ensuring that the money  set  aside
for subsidy purposes is actually used for the  top  structure,  because,  as
you would know, one of the reasons for the bad quality of  houses  we  spoke
about  earlier  is  the  fact  that  most  of  the  subsidy  is   used   for
infrastructural development. From what I have discussed, it  is  clear  that
what we shall then be delivering to Cabinet at the end of July, is  the  how
and how many in respect of our new strategy. That is our commitment.

Housing allocation is based on a formula, which  determines  the  allocation
of budgets to provinces, and it has been brought  into  line  with  the  new
census information, so that the resources that are available  are  given  to
areas where there is the greatest need. The value of the housing subsidy  is
now increased annually to keep pace with inflation. The allocations  to  the
provinces are made as  follows  for  the  2004-05  financial  year:  To  the
Eastern Cape we shall award R598,9  million;  to  the  Free  State  R385,641
million; to Gauteng R1,1 billion; to KwaZulu-Natal  R748,463 million and  to
the Limpopo region we shall give   R369,818  million.  [Interjections.]  You
could  increase  your  population,  that  would  increase  your  output.  To
Mpumalanga we give  R296,457  million  and  to  the  Northern  Cape  R89,442
million - they too could increase their population. To  the  North  West  we
give R421,378 million and to the Western Cape R 446,035 million.  The  total
estimated budget for the financial year 2004-05 is R4,5 billion.

In addition, the  following  grants  will  be  made  this  year  to  housing
institutions: We will  give  Servcon  R37,16  million,  the  Social  Housing
Foundation  Agency   R15,347   million,    and   to   the   National   Urban
Reconstruction  and  Housing  Agency  R3,034  million.  The   total   budget
allocation  for  the  Human  Settlement  Redevelopment  Programme  for   the
financial year is R115,5 million.

Finally, in the National Assembly  yesterday,  we  had  the  honour  of  the
presence of ex-Minister of Housing,  Sankie  Mthembu-Mahanyele.  We  invited
her over, because we felt that we, as  Government,  did  not  give  her  the
proper recognition for all the work that she had done. She  kindly  accepted
the invitation. She graced our Budget  Vote  yesterday.  Unfortunately,  she
could not make it today. However, through you, I would like to extend,  once
again, our heartiest gratitude  to  her.  The  international  community  has
already awarded her for the work she has done in housing. I  would  like  to
think that perhaps at some point we will find the opportunity to honour  her
for this appropriately. [Applause.] As I indicated yesterday, the  late  Joe
Slovo gave much to housing. He gave us his polices and  his  esteemed  name,
and all he got out of it was naming of  a  few  informal  settlements  after
him. Perhaps we can also honour him in some way. [Applause.]

 Unfortunately, Minister Bridget Mabandla did not stay long enough  even  to
have an informal settlement named after her.  [Laughter.]  But,  because  we
have her in our midst, we will continue interacting with her  to  say  thank
you on a regular basis for her hard work. To all their  hard  work,  I  will
add my bit so that we can accelerate the delivery of houses.  I  thank  you.
[Applause].

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, hon Minister. Kgoshi  Mokoena  says  that
he can assure you that with your authority they will begin, with  speed,  to
increase their population in Limpopo. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Hon Chairperson and delegates, it gives me  great
pleasure, as Minister of Transport, to present my budget to  the  NCOP,  for
it allows all of us to reflect on the impact that transport has  and  indeed
must have on the daily lives of our people across the length and breadth  of
South  Africa.  But  allow  me  firstly,  to  take   this   opportunity   to
congratulate the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson  on  their  election
as presiding officers of this honourable House.

Transport, contributing between 7%  and  30%  of  the  GDP  -  depending  on
whether the informal and taxi components are included - is at the centre  of
our Government's  efforts  to  achieve  growth  and  development.  I  cannot
overemphasise the fact that a good and efficient transport system  is  vital
to the functioning of the economy as a whole  and  the  wellbeing  of  South
African people.

Transport is to the economy what the veins and arteries  are  to  the  human
body, namely the conduit of life that determines the health  of  the  system
as a whole. Multimode transport systems perform the  vital  task  of  moving
people and goods efficiently, and there are many challenges that all  of  us
face to ensure that we keep them working. The  Department  of  Transport  is
allocated a budget of over R6 billion,  which  will  increase  progressively
over  the  Medium-Term  expenditure  framework  period.  We  have  set   the
department some very strategic priorities, which will define  our  work  and
activities over the  next  five  years.  A  critical  area  of  focus  is  a
logistics system, characterised by efficient flow of freight that  promotes,
rather than undermines, our economy's competitiveness.

The poor performance of the transport system, as a key-input sector  of  the
South African economy, is imposing huge costs on business  activity  in  our
country. It is therefore necessary to restructure the  transport  system  to
make sure that the logistics  does  not  act  as  a  restraint  on  economic
growth,  employment  and  sustainable  development.  The  need   to   remove
blockages within our ports and rail is an  urgent  necessity.  However,  the
focus on freight logistics is not only about removing blockages  within  our
systems. It is also about development of new strategic corridors within  the
country and the SADC region as whole.

We will adopt an integrated approach to use transport systems as a  catalyst
to stimulate new development corridors in various regions of  our  Republic.
The development of these strategic corridors should also serve  as  a  guide
to  where  transport  infrastructure  will  be  located   in   future.   The
development of all these corridors must  link  up  with  nodal  and  spatial
development initiatives to prevent  areas  outside  of  the  corridor  being
delinked from the rest of the South African economy.

An example of one such initiative is the Kei rail  project  in  the  Eastern
Cape, the upgrading and  developing  of  new  facilities  along  the  Umtata
Amabele railway line in the Eastern Cape, linked to a new network  of  rural
access  roads  and  community  projects.  We  envisaged  increased  economic
activity for one of the poorest areas of our society. A second challenge  is
to establish a public transport system that is effective,  efficient,  safe,
reliable, and co-ordinated in both urban and rural areas.

The allocation of the subsidies for commuter rail and buses is now  done  in
a very transparent manner. I must remind hon members that  public  transport
subsidies are in  fact  financial  interventions  by  Government  to  foster
equity access to transport, through the affordability of basic  services  in
socioeconomically depressed areas. However, subsidies must be targeted  more
coherently and effectively than before to make  travel  more  affordable  to
millions of our commuters in South Africa.

We are obliged, as the Department of Transport, to  ease  the  burden  of  a
costly transport system on our  public,  therefore  I  have  instructed  the
Department of Transport to complete a review of the current  subsidy  system
and to align it with our stated objectives as soon as possible.

I believe that this will include the question  of  subsidisation  of  taxis,
for, as hon members are aware,  more  than  60%  of  commuters  use  minibus
taxis, whilst out  of  an  estimated  2  million  migrant  workers  in  this
country, 850 000 use unsubsidised public transport.

Allow me, therefore, to highlight two  interventions  that  we  believe  are
critical to the delivery of public transport.  In  the  first  instance,  we
have begun work on a merger of Metrorail, Shosholoza Meyl and  the  SA  Rail
Commuter  Corporation  (SARCC).  The  fragmentation  of  the   institutional
framework has made it very  difficult  for  Government  to  deliver  a  rail
commuter service that meets our objectives of  a  public  transport  system.
This will not be a simple exercise, and requires the  participation  of  all
stakeholders, including organised labour,  as  we  tackle  this  problem  of
bringing together commuter and long-distance rail. We trust  that  a  merged
entity will ensure a more streamlined  commuter  rail  service  as  well  as
focus investment in the rolling stock. At the same time, this  should  allow
Spoornet to focus its capacity  on  the  critical  challenge  of  increasing
volumes by 30% in the next period.

One  area  where  there  is  closer  collaboration  between   the   national
Government and the provinces is in respect  of  subsidies.  The  department,
through all provincial departments of transport, awards contracts by  tender
to bus operators for the provision of public transport services.  Currently,
there are 34 interim, 2  negotiated  and  58  tendered  contracts  involving
approximately 7 500 buses. On average,  passengers  receive  about  R198  in
subsidies per month, which equals 6,7% of the average household income.  Our
Government will be spending more than R2,1 billion  on  bus  subsidies  this
current financial year.

The tender processes should aim to achieve our  objectives  of  a  safe  and
effective public  transport  system,  whilst  meeting  other  transformation
objectives. We have agreed with the provinces that a minimum of 30%  of  all
contracted services should be  set  aside  for  companies  with  a  50%  HDI
(historically disadvantaged individual) equity,  whilst  the  remaining  70%
should have an ownership equity of 35%. We  believe  that  this  is  key  to
facilitating the entry of  black  players  in  the  bus  industry  in  South
Africa.

Another critical area that needs our urgent attention  is  the  emphasis  on
the construction and maintenance of roads in rural areas,  including  access
roads. The lack of infrastructure, and reliable public  transport  in  rural
areas  in  particular,  continues  to  deny   socioeconomic   opportunities,
sustainable livelihood, education and recreation to millions of  our  people
who cannot realise their full potential. The delivery of  quality  transport
infrastructure in the rural areas of our country is a prerequisite  for  the
eradication of asset and income poverty amongst our people.

Our  socioeconomic  situation  demands  labour-intensive  methods   in   the
delivery of social and economic infrastructure,  as  my  colleague  Minister
Sigcau highlighted. Already some progress  has  been  made  to  use  labour-
intensive construction methods in the delivery of roads infrastructure.  For
example, the SA National Roads  Agency  has  begun  to  redirect  increasing
amounts of its expenditure,  approximately  30%  at  present,  towards  road
construction and maintenance through labour-based methods.

We are also encouraging provinces to ensure  a  similar  reorientation.  I'm
encouraged by initiatives undertaken by provinces  aimed  at  ensuring  that
infrastructure  delivery  meets  the  requirements  of  the   Public   Works
Programme as co-ordinated by the national Department of Public  Works.  Some
of the programmes being implemented in the provinces  include  Zibambele  in
KwaZulu-Natal, Gundo Lashu  in  Limpopo,  Vukuzakhe  in  the  Eastern  Cape,
Zenzele in the Western Cape, Gauteng's Labmax  and  Mpumalanga's  Community-
Based Public Works Programme.

Labour-intensive technologies are fundamental to our efforts  at  employment
creation, skills development and creating critical  assets  for  communities
and the whole economy. But more needs to be done, and not only in  terms  of
access roads  and  small  projects.  It  is  important  that  we  execute  a
significant shift towards labour-intensive technologies within  the  overall
public spending on infrastructure.

Such is the poor state of maintenance of many  of  our  roads  that  I  must
indicate to this honourable House that, together with the provinces and  the
roads agency, we will consider reclassifying certain  strategic  roads  from
provincial to national, if this is the only way to ensure the allocation  of
sufficient funds for upgrading and maintenance work.

Finally, I wish to state to  this  House  that  we  shall  move  with  speed
towards the completion of the  process  of  establishing  the  Road  Traffic
Management Corporation (RTMC). I have  instructed  both  the  Department  of
Transport and the chief executive of the RTMC that I'm keen to  launch  this
statutory body as soon as possible. The road traffic management  corporation
is a partnership between the three spheres of government to  strengthen  our
Government's  collective  capacity  for   road   traffic   management.   The
establishment of this RTMC, based as it is on the principle of  co-operative
governance, will give concrete meaning to co-operation and  mobilise  powers
and resources across the three spheres of government to  bring  end  to  the
lawlessness on our roads. There can be no  dilly-dallying  in  this  regard.
Thank you, Chair and members. [Applause.]

IPHINI LIKASIHLALO WOMKHANDLU KAZWELONKE WEZIFUNDAZWE  (Mnu  M  J  Mahlangu:
Siyabonga  kuNgqongqoshe  wezokuThutha,   umhlonishwa   uRadebe.   Uzwile-ke
mhlonishwa ngesikhathi ukhuluma lapha ukuthi bekukhona abantu  abahlekayo  -
angazi noma ubezwile yini? Sengithanda ukwazi ukuthi kanti laba  bantu  yini
le engaka abakade beyihleka. Umhlonishwa uthe kukhona  indawo  eMpuma-Koloni
ebizwa ngokuthi amaBele. Ngesilungu, igama  elithi  "amabele"  lisho  ukuthi
"breasts".  [Uhleko.]  Leyo  ndawo-ke  ayibizwa  ngamabele   kodwa   kuthiwa
amaBhele. [Uhleko.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Thank  you,  Minister
of Transport, hon Radebe. You heard, hon Minister,  when  you  were  talking
here, that there were people who were laughing. I do not know if  you  heard
them. I would like to know what these  people  were  laughing  at.  The  hon
Minister said there was a place called ``amabele'' in the Eastern Cape.  The
word is the equivalent of the word ``breasts'' in English.  [Laughter.]  The
name of that place is not ``amabele'' but ``amaBhele''. [Laughter.]]

Order! Thank you, hon Minister. I now call the  next  speaker,  who  is  the
acting chairperson of the Select Committee on Public Service, Mr R J Tau.  I
am told that this is his maiden speech. I hope it won't be controversial.

Mr R J TAU: Let's see when I have finished,  Chair.  Hon  Chair,  Ministers,
MECs, special delegates -  protocol  observed  -  our  engagement  in  these
Budget Votes is located within an understanding of a  signed  contract  with
our people on 14 April 2004 - a contract in which  our  people  resolved  to
take  an  active  role  in  the  transformation  and  development  of  their
socioeconomic conditions. It says that together with  our  people  and  with
the limited resources at our disposal that change can happen.

We note that population growth, of  course  at  uneven  levels  in  all  our
provinces, puts as a result, therefore, an unequal pressure on provinces  in
terms of housing delivery. At the same time, we further observe  a  slowdown
in housing provision, as also observed by the President in his state of  the
nation address.

In elaborating on the aspects of the contract with our people in  his  state
of the nation address, the President called on the Department of Housing  to
develop a comprehensive  programme  to  deal  with  human  resettlement  and
social infrastructure, including rental housing stock for the  poor,  to  be
presented  to  Cabinet  within  three  months.   The   President   committed
Government  to  addressing  the  broader  question  of  spatial   settlement
patterns, and the implications of this in Government's efforts  to  build  a
nonracial, nonsexist and democratic society, by  pledging  to  fast-track  a
programme to help our people gain access to basic shelter.

The department incorporated  these  priorities  as  its  policies  into  its
strategic plan for the 2004-05 financial year. As we accept the  fundamental
objective of the department as that of ensuring  that  every  South  African
has access to a permanent residential structure within a  sustainable  human
settlement, which guarantees security  of  tenure,  privacy  and  protection
against negative elements, we therefore resolve that housing  the  poor  and
the rural masses is the department's core function and that it  is  left  to
us is to ensure that our people live to realise these  objectives.  We  have
also noted with interest  the  manner  in  which  the  department  seeks  to
address the backlogs,  identified  by  the  President,  in  some  provinces,
whilst at the same time appreciating the role the department has played  and
continues to play in  restoring  the  dignity  of  our  people  through  the
provision of  housing.  That  also  goes  for  the  acknowledgement  of  the
challenges faced by the department in trying to  address  all  these  issues
without being told to do so.
A housing summit held in 2003 identified key policy gaps and further  worked
out research and policy needs which, in essence, is its  agenda  which  will
be finalised this year, thus adding impetus to  the  housing  programme.  In
the same breath we further agree with the need to  improve  the  quality  of
housing. We further seek to standardise the capacity of houses  -  that  is,
the number of square metres throughout  all  provinces,  albeit  noting  the
scarcity or the unavailability of land in  provinces  such  as  the  Western
Cape.  We  therefore  encourage  a  close  working  relationship  with   the
Department of Land Affairs in an attempt to resolve the  challenge  of  land
availability for the poor.

We need to improve and increase the rental housing stock and to ensure  that
most housing finance by private institutions is encouraged in terms  of  the
Financial Services Charter. We welcome the commitment by the  department  to
improving the capacity of provinces and local government  to  implement  the
Government's housing policy and strategy. In its endeavour  to  improve  the
lives of our people, it is the committee's view  that  the  department  must
work towards removing the blockages by ensuring that  farmworkers  are  also
built better houses in order to improve their lives and  the  conditions  in
which  they  live.  While  noting  the   challenges   that   go   with   the
transformation of hostels into family  units,  we  appreciate  the  progress
made thus far and  commit  ourselves  to  working  with  the  department  in
ensuring that this reaches its finality.

We note the fundamental objective of the Department of Transport, namely  to
establish a national transport system that enables the national,  provincial
and  local  provision  of  efficient,  affordable   and   fully   integrated
infrastructure and services that  best  meet  the  transport  needs  of  our
people and workers and that promote economic and social  development,  while
being  environmentally  and  economically  sustainable.  We  appreciate  the
efforts by the department to  streamline  all  components,  particularly  in
rail transport, for there to be better co-ordination and monitoring  of  our
transport system. We also applaud the department in  its  intention  to  use
targeted   subsidies   and   a    high-quality    comprehensive    transport
infrastructure network to upgrade key public facilities that, in  the  main,
are used by the poor and workers. By so doing, the  department  expresses  a
commitment to the  promotion  of  infrastructure  investment  that,  amongst
other things, includes a drive towards  extending  job-creation  initiatives
by supporting investment in intensive labour projects.

The  committee  made  the  following  observations  as  a  result   of   the
presentations: firstly, the Medium-Term Expenditure Estimate  for  transport
infrastructure is R1,4 billion, which represents an increase of  12,7%  from
the previous year. In terms of all  the  programmes,  as  the  details  were
presented to us, it is our  view  that  while  there  has  been  an  overall
increase in these programmes - we have seen a sharp  increase  in  rail  and
bus services, that is 3,6% and 7,1% respectively between the period  2003-04
- in 2004-05 taxi operations and public transport operations  experienced  a
decrease of 55,2% and 23,8% respectively for the  same  period.  It  is  our
view therefore that more money must be spent on transport  safety  in  order
to make a shift towards assisting the public, workers and the rural poor  in
terms of transport safety in all provinces.

 It is also our view that as the department will be embarking on  a  process
to finalise its municipal  transport  plans  and  the  provincial  transport
frameworks, municipalities and provinces must be consulted  because,  in  so
doing, capacity will also be built at that particular level. That also  goes
for the strengthening of the Road  Traffic  Management  Corporation.  I  say
thank you very much to the Minister for committing himself to ensuring  that
the corporation becomes a success. However, we also encourage MECs  to  play
an active strategic role in this process.
We also wish to commend the department for having  uncovered  corruption  in
the Road Accident Fund and for putting systems in place to deal with it.  In
that regard, we believe the department to revisit the  Satchwell  commission
report and identify areas that  can  be  used  as  lessons  for  the  better
functioning of the fund. While noting the efforts made  and  the  challenges
faced by the department in the taxi  recapitalisation  process,  it  is  our
view that the department should treat this matter with caution.

In its efforts to ensure that there is a considered attack  on  poverty  and
unemployment, Government initiated the Expanded Public Works  Programme.  In
so doing, the department aims to draw in large  numbers  of  the  unskilled,
unemployed and rural poor that have been designated to the periphery of  our
economy. Key to its programme objectives is the creation  of  jobs,  poverty
alleviation, investment in social  and  economic  infrastructure  and  human
resource development through the training of participants in the programme.

As a lead department in the Expanded Public Works Programme, the  Department
of Public Works will strive to drive this programme and be  responsible  for
co-ordination and integration across all organs of state.  It  is  our  view
that the department must take concrete steps to ensure that the  concept  of
expanded  national  programmes  is  fully  understood  within   and   beyond
Government. The department also aims to  optimise  cost-effective,  quality,
labour-based methods of  construction  by  providing  support  for  emerging
contractors and by implementing responsive and uniform procurement  policies
and mechanisms to track developments and focus on objectives and targets.

During the previous financial year we have seen 80 000 jobs  being  created,
which represents an amount of  51%,  with  70  contracts  being  awarded  to
previously disadvantaged contractors and to women in particular. We  believe
there is a need to put more effort into and to focus on  these  attempts  to
address the inequalities that exist within our economy.

We observe that we engage in these Budget Votes during Youth Month  and,  as
a result, we need to take into account that this particular sector  is  hard
hit  by  poverty  and  unemployment.  About  70%  of  the  people  who  find
themselves in poverty are young people below the age of 35.  This  challenge
is deepened by the fact that the economically active population  is  growing
owing  to  school-leaver  levels.  This  poses  serious  challenges  to  the
budgets, as debated today, of all three departments. We  therefore  call  on
all departments, under the leadership, of course, of Public  Works,  to  put
in place systems that will ensure that young  people  are  absorbed  through
their labour-intensive programmes.

As the President announced, the Co-operatives  Bill  will  be  presented  to
Cabinet,  if  not  to  Parliament,  in  September.  It  is  important   that
departments must work out mechanisms to prepare young people to be ready  by
then. This can happen through their  training  budgets  by  introducing  the
concept of co-operatives and, in so doing, we simply imply  as  a  committee
that it is not necessary to wait for September.

We also call on all three departments to  ensure  that  they  develop  youth
policies to guide all the programmes of the departments on youth  employment
strategies,  training  and  mentoring.  We  applaud  departments  for  their
efforts in ensuring that they buy into  the  programme  of  absorbing  young
people through their learnership  programmes.  Central  to  addressing  this
challenge is the unemployment of young rural women. Through the building  of
rural roads and houses and the development of rural  infrastructure  -  that
is the construction of clinics, schools, bridges, etc -  young  rural  women
should be empowered through knowledge and skills development.

We observe with great pride the fact that all departments have put in  place
systems to combat  corruption,  working  closely  with  the  law-enforcement
institutions of this country. All the Votes that we are  engaging  in  today
have set up internal systems to fight corruption. The screening of  tenders,
and their approach  and  commitment  to  the  notion  of  broad-based  black
economic empowerment signal that the time for fronting and  internal  tender
syndicates is over. It is therefore  our  responsibility  as  Parliament  to
assist the departments by working closely with them. We hope  we  will  also
enjoy the same co-operation through speedy responses to the  cases  reported
by members when they do their constituency work.

All departments have declared their commitment to the  2010  World  Cup  and
Nepad. Development of  the  national,  regional  and  continental  transport
network system and the improvement of our roads infrastructure - the jam  on
the N2 brought to our attention the possibility that  most  of  the  players
might be late for their games - the  construction  of  quality  houses,  not
only rental stock but also for visitors and the creation of  jobs  in  order
to  bring  about  socioeconomic  stability,  are  just   examples   of   the
commitments by the departments.

Thus, on behalf of the committee, we want to move that we adopt the  budgets
as presented to the Council. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, acting  chairperson.  I  now  call
the chairperson of the standing committee on local  government  and  housing
for the Northern Cape, the hon Mr C A T Smith.

Mnr  C  A  T  SMITH  (Noord-Kaap):  Agb  Voorsitter,  baie  dankie  vir  die
geleentheid. Agb minister Sisulu, agb minister Sigcau, agb minister  Radebe,
die spesiale afgevaardigdes na hierdie Huis, lede van die Huis, dit  is  die
eerste keer dat ek die geleentheid het om in  hierdie  Huis  te  kan  praat.
Laat my dus toe om u almal hier teenwoordig vandag  hartlik  geluk  te  wens
met u verkiesing tot u betrokke portefeuljes. Ek bid dat  die  God  wat  ons
almal dien u met die nodige wysheid sal seën sodat ons  tot  diens  van  die
mense van hierdie land kan wees.

Agb minister Sisulu, die  Noord-Kaap  is  baie  trots  op  wat  ons  in  die
afgelope vyf jaar kon doen ten opsigte van behuising.  Ek  herinner  my  aan
die tannie van Mier wat 60 jaar oud was en vir die eerste keer 'n  huis  kon
besit en gesê het hoe dankbaar sy is dat sy vir  die  eerste  keer  in  haar
lewe so 'n eiendom kan hê. Die Noord-Kaap is egter ook 'n  unieke  provinsie
met unieke probleme. So is ons onder meer die grootste provinsie wat  gebied
betref, met die kleinste  getalle.  'n  Verdere  probleem  vir  ons  is  die
fiskale beginsel dat toekennings bereken word  per  capita.  Dit  veroorsaak
dat ons die kleinste gedeelte van die Begroting daar kry.

Wat egter 'n verdere probleem is, is die afstande tussen  punte  waar  diens
gelewer moet word. As 'n mens  byvoorbeeld  'n  huis  in  Kuboes  langs  die
Oranjerivier naby aan die grens van  Namibië  bou,  is  dit  1  100  km  van
Kimberley af. Die grootte van  'n  subsidie  in  Kaapstad,  Johannesburg  en
Kimberley sal nie meer dieselfde wees as die  subsidie  in  Kuboes  nie,  as
gevolg van vervoer en al die ander aspekte wat  daarmee  gepaard  gaan.  Ons
wil u dus vra om asseblief daaraan aandag te  skenk  sodat  ons  gehelp  kan
word met hierdie probleem.

'n  Verdere  probleem  wat  ons  het,  is  ook  die  finalisering  van   die
sensusgetalle. Hierdie sensusgetalle bepaal dat daar  nou  minder  mense  in
die Noord-Kaap is. Ons wil die korrektheid en juistheid van daardie  getalle
betwyfel. Ons wil graag die advies wat u ons gegee het  met  betrekking  tot
hoe ons die getalle in die provinsie meer kan maak,  aanneem,  maar  ons  is
bang ons kom in die moeilikheid by die Minister van Gesondheid! Ten  opsigte
van hierdie getalle wil ons ook graag vandag 'n pleidooi  lewer  in  hierdie
agbare Huis dat u ook daaraan sal aandag skenk om ook tog vir ons  van  hulp
te wees.

Ons het 'n probleem van ongeletterdheid. In die omgewing van  Sutherland  en
Fraserburg kry ons nog plaaswerkers wat by konserwatiewe wit boere op  plase
werk waar die dopstelsel en verpligte kinderarbeid nog algemene  praktyk  is
en waar mense nog agter op die bakkie moet sit wanneer  die  kwik  op  -11ºC
staan, terwyl die hond voor langs die baas sit, want ons  mense  en  kinders
mag nie op die miesies se plek sit nie. Dis die soort omstandighede wat  ons
nog daar aantref. Nou wil ons vra dat u dit tog in ag  sal  neem  wanneer  u
ook die toekenning aan die Noord-Kaap bereken.

Ons het verskillende redes waarom daar ook 'n agterstand  ontstaan  het  wat
die lewering van huise betref. Hierdie agterstande het  ontstaan  as  gevolg
van die swak dienslewering van swak diensleweraars wat ons in  hierdie  Huis
wil pleit nooit weer gebruik moet word nie, en wie se name  op  'n  swartlys
geplaas moet word sodat hulle nie verder mense kan uitbuit nie. Ons wil  dus
ook by die Minister smeek dat aandag ook daaraan gegee sal  word  sodat  ons
hierdie agterstande wat ontwikkel het, sal kan uitwis.

Ons ag behuising 'n baie belangrike aspek van die volkskontrak wat  ons  met
die mense gesluit het. Behuising moet werkgeleenthede vir  ons  mense  skep.
Nooit weer moet daar net gebruik gemaak word van die groot maatskappye  nie.
Die Noord-Kaap het 'n sensitiewe ekonomie waarin, so  word  ons  geadviseer,
die  klein-  en  mediumskaalmaatskappye   die   oplossing   sal   wees   wat
werkskepping betref. Ons wil pleit dat  dit  só  gereël  sal  word  dat  die
gewone man en vrou ook sal kan  kwalifiseer  om  werk  te  kan  kry  by  die
projekte waarin huise tot stand gebring word.

Apartheid het ons mense se huise en grond gesteel, en ons as  nuwe  Regering
het nou die taak om dit vir hulle terug te  gee.  Vergeet  die  verskriklike
finansiële tekorte; verstaan ons die dilemmas  wat  daar  bestaan?  Ons  wil
hier sê die ANC-regering van die Noord-Kaap is toegewyd  om  die  huise  vir
ons mense terug te gee en te bou. Ons wil ons Minister vra om  ons  te  help
om dit te doen.

Ons wil vandag in hierdie Huis ook aan haar agting en erkenning gee vir  die
feit en  die  beginsel  wat  sy  bring  ten  opsigte  van  kwaliteit  versus
kwantiteit. Ja, daar was so 'n fase waartydens dit nodig was  om  kwantiteit
te handhaaf, maar nou is dit belangrik dat ons 'n huis ... [Tyd  verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C A T SMITH (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, thank you  very  much  for
this opportunity. Hon Minister Sisulu, hon  Minister  Sigcau,  hon  Minister
Radebe, the special delegates to this House, members of the House,  this  is
the first time that I have the opportunity to speak in this House. Allow  me
therefore sincerely to congratulate all of you present here today  sincerely
on your election to your relevant portfolios. I pray that the Lord  whom  we
all serve will bless you with the necessary wisdom so that we  could  be  of
service to the people of this country.

Hon Minister Sisulu, the Northern Cape is very proud of what  we  were  able
to do with regard to housing during the past five years. I remember the  60-
year-old woman from Mier who was able to own a house for the first time  and
who had said how grateful she was that for the first time in  her  life  she
could have such a property. However, the Northern  Cape  is  also  a  unique
province with unique problems. We are, for  example,  amongst  other  things
the largest province  as  far  as  area  is  concerned,  with  the  smallest
numbers. A further problem for us is the fiscal principle  that  allocations
are calculated per capita. This results in our getting the smallest part  of
the Budget there.
A further problem, however, is the distances between points  where  services
must be delivered. For example, if one builds  a  house  in  Kuboes  on  the
Orange River near the border of Namibia, it is 1 100 km from Kimberley.  The
size of a subsidy in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Kimberley  will  no  longer
be the same as the subsidy in Kuboes because of transport and all the  other
aspects associated with it. We therefore want to ask you please  to  address
this so that we could receive assistance with this problem.

Another problem we have is the  finalising  of  the  census  figures.  These
census figures indicate that there are now  fewer  people  in  the  Northern
Cape. We want to query the correctness of those figures. We  would  like  to
accept the advice you gave us  with  regard  to  how  we  can  increase  the
figures in the province, but we are scared of getting into trouble with  the
Minister of Health! With regard to these numbers,  we  would  also  like  to
appeal in this honourable House today that you will also  pay  attention  to
this to provide us with some assistance as well.

We have a problem of illiteracy. In  the  neighbourhood  of  Sutherland  and
Fraserburg we still get farmworkers who work on farms of conservative  white
farmers, where the ``dop'' system and compulsory child labour are still  the
general practice, and where people still have to sit in the back  of  trucks
when it is -11°C, while the dog sits in front, next  to  the  boss,  because
our people are not allowed to sit on the madam's seat. This is the  sort  of
circumstances we still find there. We want to ask  you  to  take  this  into
consideration whenever you calculate the allocation for the Northern Cape.

We have various reasons as to why a backlog also developed  as  regards  the
delivery of houses. These  backlogs  developed  as  a  result  of  the  poor
service delivery of poor service deliverers, and we want to appeal  in  this
House that they should never be used again, and that their names  should  be
put on a blacklist so that they would not be  able  to  exploit  people  any
more. We therefore  also  want  to  appeal  urgently  to  the  Minister  for
attention to be given to  this  problem  so  that  we  can  eliminate  these
backlogs that have arisen.

We regard housing as a very important aspect of  the  people's  contract  we
have entered into with the people. Housing should create  job  opportunities
for our people. Never  again  should  only  large  companies  be  used.  The
Northen Cape has a sensitive economy in which,  according  to  what  we  are
told, the small and medium-scale companies will be the solution  as  far  as
job creation is concerned. We want to request that it will  be  arranged  in
such a way that the ordinary man and woman will also  be  qualified  to  get
work at the projects relating to houses being built.

Apartheid stole the houses and land of our people, and it is  our  task,  as
new  Government,  to  return  these  to  them.  Forget  about  the  enormous
financial shortfalls; do we understand the existing  dilemmas?  We  want  to
say here that the ANC government  of  the  Northern  Cape  is  dedicated  to
giving the houses back to our people and to build them. We want to  ask  our
Minister to help us do this.

Today, in this House, we also want to pay our respects and  acknowledge  the
fact, and the principle she brings, regarding quality versus quantity.  Yes,
there was a phase during which it was necessary  to  sustain  quantity,  but
now it is important to us that a house ... [Time expired.]]

Mr S A MKHIZE (Gauteng): Madam Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon MECs,  member
delegates and comrades, I believe that I  represent  the  smart  province  -
Gauteng.

The Department of Housing has noted the challenges and the work to  be  done
in fulfilling the promises made during the  elections.  The  challenges  and
the programme, outlined by the President in his state of the nation  address
and by the Premier in his state of the province address,  will  continue  to
form part of our work as we strive to deliver houses  to  the  poor  in  our
province.

The high number of people converging in our province in search of  a  better
life and in search  of  employment  opportunities  will  continue  to  be  a
challenge,  and  our  plans  are  therefore  geared  towards  meeting   such
challenges. One of the critical, most urgent challenges,  is  to  accelerate
the programme of ensuring that the homeless and those who  live  in  squalor
have decent houses built on well-located  land  and  have  access  to  basic
services such as water, sanitation and electricity.

As part of dealing with poverty  and  unemployment  and  building  safe  and
sustainable communities, the department has identified areas  where  housing
development will take place as part  of  Government's  contribution  to  the
people's contract to create work and fight poverty.

New housing  projects,  as  well  as  the  upgrading  and  formalisation  of
informal settlements will be implemented through the  incremental  approach.
We will enrol all our essential services projects with the  Expanded  Public
Works Programme - a nationwide programme  aimed  at  drawing  a  significant
number of unemployed into productive work.  Here  we  will  be  specifically
targeting youth out of school and out of work, thereby contributing  to  the
process of empowering and capacitating people who are unemployed.

Through the essential services programme we will formalise and upgrade  more
than 51 000 stands, currently in informal settlements,  during  the  current
financial year. Two hundred thousand more stands  will  be  formalised  over
the next five years. Only those informal settlements  earmarked  for  future
upgrading will be formalised. We will  also  be  working  closely  with  the
municipalities and other role-players to prevent  further  proliferation  of
informal settlements.

Linked to essential services will also be  two  other  programmes.  Firstly,
the People's Housing Project (PHP) will be further enhanced to maximise  its
intended outcome. This will  depend  on  the  participation  of  our  people
themselves in housing and will also create strong  community  structures  to
continue  mobilising  community  resources  and  energies  well  beyond  the
delivery of housing. For this reason, through the PHP, we will establish  20
housing support centres per year,  starting  this  current  financial  year.
This will be established in areas such as  Kanana,  Thulare,  Diepsloot  and
Ivory Park, to mention just a few.

The other programme following  from  essential  services  is  the  community
building programme. This is a new programme. It aims to blend  institutional
capacity of the  private  sector  with  community  resources.  Through  this
programme we will deliver

10 000 housing units per annum and create 50 000 short-term  jobs  per  year
in the context of the Expanded Public Works Programme.

The Premier of Gauteng, Mbhazima Shilowa, has identified  the  formalisation
of all informal settlements  in  Gauteng,  thereby  contributing  towards  a
comprehensive, consolidated and integrated infrastructure  programme  as  an
absolute priority. In this regard we have already engaged  the  services  of
the regional professional teams, the  RPT,  and  have  set  up  a  Programme
Management Office, PMO, to speed up the roll-out  and  delivery  of  service
stands  in  many  informal  settlements.  In  this  regard,  we  shall   not
disappoint.  We  have  already  turned  various  informal  settlements  into
construction sites.

The following projects are already  under  way:  Tswane  -  13  129  stands,
Metsweding - 840 stands, the Western District - 1 776  stands,  Johannesburg
North - 7 486 stands, Johannesburg South - 21 428  stands,  Ekurhuleni  -  8
638 and Sedibeng - 320 stands. In order to ensure  long-term  sustainability
of these interventions, we are also putting in place mechanisms  to  involve
people  from  the  beginning  of  the  planning  process  right  up  to  the
implementation  stage.  We  want  our  people  to  take  ownership  of  this
development, but also to be our partners in the people's contract.  To  this
extent, one of the RDP's performance measures will be the  extent  to  which
people have been involved from the planning stage.

Looking at the time given, I think it would not be proper to dwell  only  on
the priorities, but also to look at other  issues.  We  strongly  feel  that
these are the key policy constraints in relation to the key deliverables!

The national policy requires that beneficiaries must contribute  R2  479  in
order to get access to the subsidy and  to  a  house,  except  if  they  are
involved in the People's Housing Process.  The  experience  in  Gauteng  has
shown that beneficiaries are unable to make the R2 479  contribution,  which
has caused major delays in projects.

National policy requires that the property must be transferred to  the  name
of the beneficiary prior to the beneficiary  taking  occupation.  The  risks
associated with leaving the house vacant while the transfer is taking  place
are too high. Therefore, the recommendation is that national  policy  should
allow beneficiaries to  take  occupation  ...  [Time  expired.]  [Applause.]
Amandla!

Mr K PANDAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam  Chair,  with  the  limited  time  at  my
disposal, I will be speaking on Budget Vote 29 - Housing.  Firstly,  I  wish
to thank the hon Minister for her presentation budget this morning.
Despite the effort of the Department of Housing, it will  be  very  hard  to
accept that the requirements, regulations, guidelines and standards  set  by
the  legislation  have  been  followed.  Hence,   many   service   providers
throughout the country have failed us, but above all failed our  people.  It
has become apparent that there  is  reluctance  in  the  private  sector  to
invest substantially in our efforts, and the capacity  of  local  government
entities to provide solid integrated development is lacking.

The delivered houses, in most cases, are  of  bad  quality,  as  has  become
evident in the plethora of reports  in  the  national  and  regional  press.
Houses are falling down after mild rain,  the  structures  are  of  inferior
quality. The infrastructure that was supposed to be part of  the  integrated
development is lacking. For how long are our people going  to  suffer  these
indignities? The state's noble intentions of sheltering the poorest  of  the
poor are defeated by these proven realities.
It has become apparent in the process of service and delivery that there  is
a lack of capacity within the ambit of the national,  provincial  and  local
government sectors, which creates a  serious  impediment  to  a  smooth  and
successful integrated  development  framework,  as  described  in  the  laws
associated with the much  talked  about  Integrated  Development  Programmes
(IDPs). This is a problem that needs to be researched and tackled head on.

Research emanating from the University of KwaZulu-Natal has  indicated  that
there is a serious level of dissatisfaction amongst our people  with  regard
to the process of service and delivery of houses in relation  to  integrated
development. Thus, capacity-building programmes,  at  all  levels,  need  to
continue. This can be rectified,  especially  through  the  development  and
growth of the creation of a solid group of housing entrepreneurs within  the
African communities who will not only boost their  economic  viability,  but
also give new meaning to the concept of ubuntu.

There have been a series of reports regarding rampant maladministration  and
corruption in the  housing  departments  throughout  the  country  that  are
serious barriers to accelerated service delivery. We cannot  allow  a  small
number of unscrupulous thieves and fraudsters to stop  our  gallant  efforts
towards creating a more humane society. The growth in  MTEF  allocation  for
the periods 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, with increases in  the  budget  of
34%, 15% and 11% respectively, is a good sign. Thank  you.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Ministers Radebe, Sisulu  and
Sigcau, it is an honour and a privilege for me to be able to  represent  the
people of the North West province in this House. In my work here,  I  intend
to be motivated by the best interests of those at whose pleasure I serve.

The centrepiece of the ANC's election campaign was a promise of one  million
jobs to be achieved  through  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.  This
promise was not made with absolute honesty, however,  because  the  Expanded
Public Works Programme will not deliver the kind of  sustainable  employment
that genuine economic  growth  will  achieve,  and  that  the  multitude  of
unemployed  so  desperately   need.   The   programme   will   provide   job
opportunities for less than 3% of the unemployed  per  year,  and  the  work
will last for an average of  just  six  months,  after  which  most  of  the
beneficiaries will revert to a state of unemployment. We must be honest  and
responsible enough not to pretend that the Expanded Public  Works  Programme
(EPWP) can permanently roll back unemployment  or  eradicate  poverty.  Only
sustainable economic growth at 5% or 6% per annum can do that.

It is enormously  revealing  that  the  EPWP  makes  provision  for  special
conditions of employment at wages lower  than  the  minimum  wage  and  with
reduced obligations  for  employers.  This  is  an  open  admission  by  the
Government that the onerous labour laws  to  which  the  private  sector  is
subject are a major cause of our intractable unemployment problem.

A two-tier labour market, such as  the  Government  is  introducing  in  the
public sector, is one simple means of creating  a  ladder  between  the  two
economies to which the President referred recently. It is an  approach  that
should be extended to the private sector  in  high  unemployment  areas  and
labour intensive industries across the country.

Finally, I want to build on a point made by the  Ministers  of  Defence  and
Sport recently. The EPWP is an opportunity to treat South Africans as  South
Africans, and not as  representatives  of  racial  groups.  I  call  on  the
Minister to ensure, therefore, that the EPWP  will  be  open  to  all  South
Africans in need of work and skills, and  will  not  be  reserved  only  for
those from particular racial groups. [Interjections.]

Having said all that, a public works programme does  have  a  place  in  our
overall policy programme as a means of temporary  poverty  alleviation,  and
even more crucially, as a means to transfer the kinds of  skills  that  will
make the beneficiaries employable on a permanent basis.

I hope this will be the focus of the programme and we in the DA will  fulfil
our oversight duty in  an  effort  to  ensure  that  it  is.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Before  I  proceed  to  call  the  next
speaker, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the presence of  the
delegation from the Joint Parliamentary Commission on Human  Rights  of  the
British Parliament, led by the Rt Hon Ms Jean Causton. They  are  up  there.
You are welcome to our second House of Parliament. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Deputy Chairperson, Chair  of  Chairs,  hon  Ministers,  hon
MECs, special delegates and members of the House, I just want  to  find  out
if it was the member's maiden speech this morning, which  I  think  it  was.
There is a convention in Parliament that if it is your  maiden  speech,  you
don't attack. But if people do not have respect, or if people  do  not  want
to  work  with  the  Government,  they   just   do   whatever   they   like.
[Interjections.]

The NNP shares the Department of Transport's  vision  to  have  a  transport
system that builds a  better  life  for  all  and  its  mission  to  promote
affordable  transport  access  and  mobility  that  is  safe,  reliable  and
internationally competitive. As we know, although the Government has done  a
lot and is still doing a  lot  to  change  the  transport  system  that  has
developed through the disparities arising  from  the  previous  patterns  of
spatial development, our people must still travel long distances to  get  to
work or school at high cost. The Minister,  the  department  and  all  role-
players must keep on finding ways  and  means  to  improve  and  expand  our
infrastructure, to reduce the cost of public transport, and to  make  public
transport safe for our people.

Behuising lê vir almal ná aan die hart. Die NNP  steun  Minister  Sisulu  en
die departement se verklaring: "Oorlog verklaar  teen  plakkersbuurte''.  'n
Huis is die plek waar 'n mens  basiese  waardes  aanleer.  Dit  is  waar  jy
respek vir ander se besittings, eiendom  en  vir  jou  gemeenskap  leer.  As
mense gehelp word om huiseienaars te word, versterk ons  dié  waardestelsel.
Daarom  moet  ons  saamstaan  om  die  doelwitte  te  bereik  om  ordentlike
behuising te bied vir die miljoene mense wat dit  verdien.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Housing is close to all our hearts. The NNP supports  Minister  Sisulu  and
the department's statement: "Declare war against squatter areas". A home  is
the place where one learns basic values. That is where  one  learns  respect
for the possessions of others, their property and for  one's  community.  If
people are helped to become home owners, we strengthen  this  value  system.
Therefore we must stand together to achieve the goals  of  providing  decent
housing for the millions of people who deserve it.]

The Department of Public Works  and  all  role-players  must  take  concrete
steps to ensure that the concept of the Expanded Public Works  Programme  is
fully understood and supported within and outside Government, because  South
Africa is a country where various cultures merge to  form  a  unique  nation
that is proud of its heritage. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Thank you, hon Chair. Hon Chair,  let  me  join
the Ministers in congratulating the Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson  and
all the office bearers in the House. I don't know whether this is my  maiden
speech, but hon Chairperson, the Minister has spoken about housing.

I have a prepared speech. I will just look at highlights, because if I  read
the speech it would be a repetition of what the Minister has said.  The  two
speeches have so much in common, which is a positive sign.

Chairperson, whilst we have  achieved  major  successes  in  our  quest  for
efficiency in executing our housing  development  programme,  especially  in
relation  to  the  involvement  of  previously  disadvantaged   construction
companies,  including  women  and  the  youth,  there  are  still   enormous
challenges ahead of us. We have a strategy of housing development,  we  have
achieved results and we have learnt some lessons, especially in  helping  us
unlock various administrative blockages which  delayed  housing  development
on the ground. Key to the strategy  is  the  role  played  by  our  emerging
contractors, the streamlining of the payment regime,  partnership  with  the
commercial banking sector  and  training  institutions,  tightening  of  our
quality control systems and internal reorganisation.

We are in the process of establishing an  emerging  contractors  empowerment
council in the province, and we think that  through  it  we  will  earnestly
begin the process of transferring power to  the  historically  disadvantaged
people.

The Growth and Development Plan of the province highlights job creation  and
poverty alleviation as key provincial priorities. For  housing  development,
the department will ensure that the frontiers  of  poverty  and  joblessness
are pushed back further and further.

As poverty is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of  the  province,  at
the Alfred Nzo and O R Tambo District Municipality  areas,  as  well  as  in
informal settlements that are  often  affected  by  flood  disasters  within
Nelson  Mandela  Bay  and  Buffalo  City,  the  bulk  of  the  housing  fund
allocation this financial year will be directed to these areas in  order  to
address   this   problem.   Housing   for   emergency   circumstances   will
progressively support communities  affected  by  or  prone  to  these  flood
disasters in the province.

The following strategic objectives will drive the  current  financial  year:
Systematic elimination of the housing backlog in  the  province;  monitoring
and evaluation of the delivery of quality housing; facilitation  of  housing
development and management capacity among municipalities;  co-ordination  of
housing  assets  management;  job  creation  and  skills  development;   and
strengthening the provincial economy.

The department will systematically facilitate access to well-located  public
and private land for housing needs. The compilation  of  data  of  available
land  is  considered  to  be  of  paramount  importance  in   this   regard.
Municipalities will be assisted towards proactive acquisition  of  land  for
housing purposes. An amount of R598,9 million has been  made  available  for
housing this financial year, and the  department  intends  building  23  149
housing units this year.

Eradication of the bucket system will continue  to  receive  primary  focus,
with the implementation of various projects throughout  the  province.  This
is one of the programmes aimed at restoring people's  dignity  and  ensuring
that the poorest of the  poor  enjoy  access  to  appropriate  housing  with
waterborne sewerage. In this regard we have budgeted R38, 212  million.  The
current backlog has been calculated at 64 768 throughout the  province.  The
areas of focus will  be  Umzimvubu,  Elundini,  Koukamma,  Kouga,  Lukhanji,
Mhlontlo,  Mnquma,  Ntabankulu,  Nxuba,  Nyandeni,   Senqu,   Tsolwana   and
Umzimkhulu.
The  following  municipalities  were  allocated  funding  during  the   last
financial  year  and  the  programme   continues:   Qawukeni   Municipality,
Sakhisizwe, Sundays River Valley, Makana and Inxuba Yethemba.

The main focus for the current financial year, amongst other  things  -  I'm
skipping certain portions, Chairperson - is building institutional  capacity
of municipalities to manage and implement housing development projects.  The
department will embark on  housing  consumer  or  beneficiary  education  to
ensure that communities are equipped with information on housing.

The department has developed a capability model  for  municipalities,  which
will   provide   for   the   ultimate   accreditation   of   municipalities.
Implementation of this model will be  done  in  phases,  starting  with  the
metro, Buffalo City and the 6 district  municipalities  over  the  next  two
years.

The disestablishment of the housing development board led to  the  immovable
properties being vested in the department. In this  regard,  the  department
will undertake a proper audit of these properties with a view to  developing
an authentic property register.

With regard to job creation, we have  targeted  a  minimum  of  25%  of  the
current capital budget allocation for utilisation by women, youth and  other
groups that are designated.

The establishment of the Emerging Contractor Empowerment Council  this  year
to  facilitate  empowerment  of  emerging  contractors  in  the   technical,
business  and  financial  fields  is  pertinent.  This  is  being  done   in
collaboration with partners such as the Emerging  Contractors  Associations,
Women in Construction, Youth in  Construction,  the  Construction  Education
and Training Authority, the National Home  Builders'  Registration  Council,
the Construction Industry  Development  Board,  financial  institutions  and
municipalities. This is a partnership we should put together  to  strengthen
the emerging contractor industry.

With regard to contributions to the strengthening of the  economy,  we  will
build partnerships with the DBSA, Rapid  Infrastructure  Development  Agency
of  the  Koega  Development  Corporation  and  the   Construction   Industry
Development Board.

Chairperson, we will  step  up  the  implementation  of  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme in Ngangelizwe, Mdantsane and in Motherwell,  Port  Elizabeth.  In
this regard, we have also found it imperative as a department  to  link  the
redevelopment of Duncan Village to the Mdantsane  Urban  Renewal  Programme.
Together with the municipality, we have budgeted R120 million over the  next
five years. Plans are afoot. We will launch this project during  the  course
of this year.

In addition to that, we have budgeted R6,6 million for the  Mdantsane  Urban
Renewal step-up. The same  amount  has  been  budgeted  for  Motherwell  and
Ngangelizwe.

Finally, we have a few projects that we have put  together  which  we  think
are  very,  very  important  and  pertinent  in  terms  of  the   Minister's
pronouncements today. There are two projects of the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme that we will launch soon. One is at Elundini, which is  a  bridge,
built by the community, next to the border with  Lesotho.  In  South  Africa
they built a bridge using the chasis of two buses.  We  have  allocated  for
these special projects R358 000 to help this community develop  or  build  a
better  bridge  and  internal  roads.  This  will  be  linked   to   housing
construction in the village.

The second one is at Mbekweni village in Lukhanji  Municipality  near  Sada.
We have allocated an amount of R1 million for this one ...
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  MEC,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr G NKWINTI: Thank you very much, the end of my speech. [Applause.]

Mr M SKWATSHA (Western Cape): Thank you very much, Chairperson, Minister  of
Transport, Comrade Jeff Radebe, Minister of Housing,  Sis'  Lindi,  Minister
of Public Works, and all protocol observed.

Our people voted in large numbers on 14 April. They gave our Government  the
mandate to reduce unemployment and poverty by half  in  2014.  They  further
told Government to reduce unemployment by half through the creation  of  new
jobs, through skills development,  the  provision  of  assistance  to  small
businesses, the creation of opportunities for  self-employment  and  working
towards sustainable livelihood.

A further instruction was to ensure that our people  have  skills  that  are
required by the economy and that resources are provided  across  society  to
encourage self-employment with an education system that  is  geared  towards
productive work, good citizenship and a caring society.

They said that over the next five years we  must  create  one  million  jobs
through the Expanded Public Works  Programme,  spend  over  R15  billion  to
facilitate the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment  Programme,  intensify
assistance to Umsobomvu  Youth  Fund  and  assist  unemployed  graduates  to
acquire work skills.

They  said  that  we  must  pursue  these  and  many  other  programmes,  in
partnership with all sections of our society, united in a people's  contract
to create work and fight poverty.

Chairperson, both budgets of Public Works  and  Transport  presented  to  us
today respond to these challenges and the tasks given us by  our  people  in
the past election. I may just add that  even  the  Budget  Vote  of  Housing
responds to this.

I would like to commend the national Department of Public Works  for  having
implemented a comprehensive Community-Based Public Works Programme  and  the
policy refinement exercises which improved the impact  of  these  programmes
in the past 10 years.

Our ability to respond in a dynamic manner to the needs  of  our  people  by
implementing  the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme  has  led   the
International Labour Organisation to describe these programmes as "the  best
public  works  programme  in  the  developing  world",  citing  its  labour-
intensive  construction   methods   and   job   creation   potential.   This
acknowledgement formed part of yet another positive affirmation of the  ANC-
led Government's commitment to building a better life for all our people,  a
better and prosperous Africa, and a just and fairer world.
Chairperson, the people of the Western Cape  have  also  demonstrated  their
preparedness  to  play  their  role  in  the  realisation  of  the  national
priorities by voting for the ANC in large numbers. We have, accordingly,  as
government of the province, made an announcement that as part of  the  first
100 days of government activities we shall launch our Extended Public  Works
Programme. I will, in my budget speech on Tuesday, be  announcing  the  date
of the launch and the money allocated for this programme.

The month of June is Youth Month, and this is observed in  honour  of  those
young men and women who engaged the enemy in the struggle for freedom.  This
month we commemorate the heroes and heroines of our  struggle  who  fell  on
June 16. My department, working together with the  department  of  community
safety, will provide financial support for some of  the  activities  of  the
Bambanani (working together) project in the province. This  project  targets
mainly young men and  women  who  are  volunteering  and  co-operating  with
government to build safe and secure communities.  Bambanani  forms  part  of
our provincial Extended Public Works Programme.

In our 2004-05 budget speech, I will be making announcements  on  our  plans
to build new schools for historically disadvantaged communities.  I  believe
that the provision of school buildings in these communities is an  important
contribution to ensuring that our children  and  the  youth  exercise  their
right to education. Through our school building programme, we will not  only
be  creating  jobs,  but  we  will  be  creating  opportunities  for   black
businesses in the construction industry  as  part  of  our  contribution  to
broad-based economic empowerment. Other infrastructure development  projects
include the building of a number of new hospitals in the province that  will
be accessible to all communities, especially the disadvantaged communities.

Chairperson, the Minister of Transport has indicated that  while  a  lot  of
work and resources have gone into improving public transport since 1994,  we
are still far from having a system which is reliable, efficient,  affordable
and provides an integrated service  to  the  citizens  of  this  country.  A
renewed focus on public transport is necessary, if we  are  to  achieve  any
further improvements in the system and also put the country  in  a  position
to host the 2010 Soccer World Cup successfully.

In the City of Cape Town, we  have  embarked  on  an  ambitious  project  to
initiate the improvement of public transport in the province. This  project,
called the Klipfontein Corridor Project, is the first phase of the  Mobility
Strategy and  will  link  communities  along  the  corridor  to  social  and
economic centres. Local economic development will be  encouraged  along  the
corridor, so will the building of bridges between communities  long  divided
by the notorious apartheid system.
This project will also provide a shining example of co-operative  governance
between three different spheres of government. Although we and the  City  of
Cape  Town  initiated  the  project,  Minister   Radebe's   department   has
identified this project as a pilot  project  from  which  lessons  extracted
will inform plans in other cities in the  country  for  the  improvement  of
public transport. I want to take this opportunity to thank  Minister  Radebe
for the continued support we have enjoyed from his department.

Chairperson, many of you  have  observed  that  the  African  population  is
visible in the city during the day and is hardly noticeable in the  evening.
This social and cultural trend is a manifestation of the effects of  decades
of political, social and economic marginalisation of the African  people  in
the Western Cape. As we tackle  the  task  of  creating  work  and  fighting
poverty in the second decade of our freedom, we are faced with the  peculiar
task of undoing the marginalisation of African  people  in  this  particular
province.

As  part  of  tackling  this  and  many  other  challenges,  the  provincial
government has developed a Home for All and Ikapa Elihlumayo strategies.  My
department will use assets that are in  its  custody,  and  in  co-operation
with other departments, to facilitate the integration of communities in  the
Western  Cape  which  have  been  divided  by  apartheid  human   settlement
patterns. We urge the national department to reinforce this  initiative  and
use the strategic assets it owns  in  the  province  to  pursue  such  noble
objectives. We  shall  ensure  that  our  infrastructure  development  plans
facilitate economic activity and development in  historically  disadvantaged
areas.

Lastly, I firmly believe that these and many other initiatives constitute  a
major leap  forward  in  the  realisation  of  our  strategic  objective  of
creating a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South  Africa.  I
hereby support the Budget Votes. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D D MABUZA (Mpumalanga): Hon Deputy Chair  of  Chairs,  hon  Chairperson,
hon Ministers, MECs in our midst and hon members, I feel honoured  today  to
be afforded this opportunity to take part in this very important  debate.  I
regard it as very important in many ways because it happens in a  year  that
will go down in the annals of history as unforgettable.  It  is  a  year  in
which we are celebrating 10 years of our democracy; a year in which we  have
successfully held our free and fair democratic elections; a year  in  which,
as Africa, we have been afforded the rare opportunity of hosting the  Soccer
World Cup in 2010; and a year in which  a  very  important  month  has  been
dedicated to our youth and our future leaders.

All of the above I have mentioned serve as an  indication  of  the  road  we
have travelled thus far as a country, a road that presents a sense  of  hope
to all our people that  tomorrow  will  be  a  better  day;  the  hope  that
tomorrow there will be food, the hope that tomorrow there will  be  shelter,
water and jobs. This Government has scored many successes over the  past  10
years, which give the people of this country at large, even the  opposition,
confidence in the direction the country is taking.

The Expanded Public Works Programme, which has been launched  together  with
the Community-Based Public Works Programme, is but one instrument that  will
go a long way towards addressing the vexing  problems  of  unemployment  and
hunger. Through these programmes, Minister, we agree  fully  with  you  that
the  rural  and  poor,  men  and  women,  people  with   disabilities,   the
unemployed, the unskilled and the youth stand to benefit. We stand ready  as
a province to make our own contribution, to play our part in bringing  about
the one million jobs that must be created.

Above all, this programme will take our infrastructure status to  reasonable
and acceptable heights, allowing us to close the gap between our  first  and
second economies by creating more and more opportunities for our  people  to
take active roles in the economy. This  programme  will  further  boost  the
skills levels of our people, making them better artisans and  entrepreneurs,
capable of employing themselves and employing others.

We welcome the allocation. It will  go  a  long  way  towards  tackling  the
challenges before  us,  though  we  acknowledge  that  the  backlog  is  too
immense. We are on board and ready to travel  with  you,  Minister,  in  our
quest to build  a  nonracial,  nonsexist  democratic  and  prosperous  South
Africa, a South Africa better poised to play its  rightful  role  in  Africa
and the world at large.

The state of our roads in the province ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Thank you, Deputy Chair of  Chairs.  With  respect  to  the
Housing Budget Vote, the DA welcomes  the  announcement  of  the  inflation-
linked subsidy increases. We would also like to see a review of the  cut-off
point in the earning levels of beneficiaries  who  qualify  for  a  subsidy,
which should be raised from the current maximum income of R3 500 per  month,
an amount that has been the same since the inception of the subsidy scheme.

Two years ago I drew the attention of this House to the problem of  builders
and  suppliers  not  bothering  to  submit  tenders  for  low-cost   housing
contracts, because the  quality  of  their  work  and  materials  made  them
uncompetitive.  A  major  irrigation  company  informed  me  that  they  had
restructured their business to  remedial  work,  replacing  the  substandard
piping installed  in  Government  contracts  with  cheaper  contractors  who
supplied inferior building materials and pipes in order to win contracts.

When the Minister referred  to  the  NHBRC's  investigation  in  her  speech
yesterday, this indicated that our worst fears had  been  realised,  and  we
can only hope that the training programmes she has announced will  begin  to
address this problem. I fear that training alone will  not  be  enough,  and
greater oversight with respect to quality  control  will  need  to  be  more
rigorously implemented by the  NHBRC  to  prevent  repetitions  and  further
wastage in the future.

The NHBRC is now well established and some  meaningful  conclusions  can  be
drawn from its recent track record. During 2001 and 2002 nearly  two  thirds
of funds collected through enrolment and registration fees were absorbed  by
operating expenses, and during the same period only R2,6 million out of  the
R229 million or 1,1%, collected was needed to  effect  housing  repairs.  If
one considers the number of homes enrolled  by  the  NHBRC,  this  means  in
effect that the total repairs that were required amounted to  less  than  R7
per house. The NHBRC's audited financial statements for 2003  indicate  that
nearly R4,5 million was spent in effecting repairs, or 2,5%  of  the  income
collected in that financial year.

The DA is duly cognisant of the fact that  the  NHBRC  had  nearly  160  000
houses under warranty last year, with a total market value of  R55  billion,
and that the warranty reserve and accumulated surplus built up in  the  fund
of R353 million equated to only 0,64% of this amount.  Nevertheless,  it  is
remarkable how little of  the  funds  collected  in  order  to  protect  the
consumer actually end up being expended on housing repairs, especially  when
compared to the  substantial  costs  of  keeping  the  NHBRC  operative.  In
addition, the flat rate of 1,3% charged on all houses provides  very  little
incentive for any builder to exceed the building standards required  by  the
manuals.

I would therefore like to propose  two  ideas,  which  could  contribute  to
better building and lower  costs,  without  undermining  the  concept  of  a
comprehensive consumer warranty scheme, which the NHBRC  provides.  Firstly,
the 1,3% levy should be replaced with a graduated  levy  in  which  builders
who have consistently delivered  a  quality  product  qualify  for  a  lower
percentage levy. This will incentivise better quality building standards  as
excellent builders will be able to submit  more  competitive  tenders,  with
the  associated  benefits  of  market  forces  dovetailing  with  Government
policy.

Secondly, isn't it time that an upper limit  is  fixed  to  the  levy  on  a
voluntary basis? It  is  generally  accepted  that  warranty  protection  is
required for the low-cost end of the market, but one finds it  difficult  to
understand why a consumer  purchasing,  for  example,  a  R2  million  house
should not have the option to decide whether he or she  requires  this  form
of insurance or not. Housing at this end of  the  market  is  almost  always
conducted by professionals,  such  as  architects  and  engineers,  who  are
already regulated by their own professional bodies  and  carry  indemnities.
One gains the impression that the 1,3% levy fixed at these levels is more  a
revenue-generating exercise than one motivated by any genuine need.  I  hope
the Minister will consider these proposals. I thank you.

Mr  M  A  MZIZI:  Sihlalo,  angizwakalise  nami  koNgqongqoshe  bakazwelonke
nabezifundazwe abakhona  lapha  phakathi  kwendawo  ukuthi  isandla  sedlula
ekhanda. [Chairperson, I  would  like  salute  the  national  Ministers  and
provincial MECs who are present here today.]

It is a great pleasure for me to participate in these debates. May I,  right
from the outset, begin with Housing. Whilst we support the budget,  it  must
be acknowledged that housing in all parts of the country is  experiencing  a
good deal  of  ups  and  downs  in  so  far  as  land  unavailability,  poor
structures and unemployment are concerned.

Regarding land unavailability, a developer in an  area  in  Tintwa  Village,
Tokoza township, put up structures or houses in such a way  that  one  could
not differentiate between whether they were houses or shacks.  They  are  so
small that if one put in a double bed there is no space left to move  around
the bed. They were built with very poor materials. I can  go  on  mentioning
problems encountered in this area.

Perhaps it is sufficient to say that we  were  told  that  an  investigation
would be instituted, though this investigation has not yet  seen  the  light
of day. I hope that the Minister will take up this matter and clear up  this
mess. There are many other incidents in other townships  on  the  East  Rand
worth mentioning, too many to detail in this short time. Lastly,  there  are
many residents being evicted from their own houses,  which  are  being  sold
without the knowledge of the owners.
With my limited time available, let me move to Transport. I  would  like  to
say, briefly, that it is puzzling to  see  that  huge  subsidies  are  being
pumped into buses, which are almost, in places, on the verge  of  extinction
as 60% of transport is in the form of taxis. The IFP would  like  to  see  a
shift in order that the correct  amounts  are  channelled  to  the  type  of
transport that is used most by commuters.

With regard to recapitalisation, this  issue  has  been  seen  as  a  threat
within the taxi industry, a threat in the sense that it will cater  for  the
wealthy people. In short it means:  "Abampofu  bohlala  bempofu  naphakade."
[The poor shall stay poor forever.]

Concerning Public Works, this is a department that bears the  brunt  of  all
complaints. All the departments put  the  blame  on  it.  This  is  probably
because it is where construction and building begin. Nonetheless,  Minister,
you cannot always be blamed. I have seen the strategic plans you have  drawn
up, and if you follow these through, you will see the light.

Sihlalo, kulesi sikhashana nje sami esincane esisasele, amaZayoni  ale  Ndlu
engakangishayeli izandla, ake  ngiphindele  emuva  laphaya  kwezokuthutha  -
ngoba  ngiyazi  uma  sesiphelile  isikhathi  bazoshaya  izandla.   [Uhleko.]
[Ubuwelewele.]

Kwezokuthutha, Ngqongqoshe, kunokwenzekayo okubonakalayo lapha  ikakhulukazi
kwi-black economic empowerment. Kukhona-ke izinkampani  engingeke  ngizibize
ngegama  lapha  esezafaka  izicelo  zathola  umsebenzi   we-black   economic
empowerment. Zibe sezisuka-ke sezibhala ezicabheni zezimoto zabathile  ukuze
bathuthe, kube sengathi bathuthukisa ikhono labampisholo kanti yize.

Laba bantu basayina izivumelwano njengengxenye ye-closed  corporation  kodwa
abazi lutho ukuthi kwenzekani futhi abathuthukiswa. Ekupheleni  kwesikhathi,
lo muntu unikezwa lesi sigadla angeke esasibenzisa ndawo bese  ezithola  nje
esobishini ngaso ngoba ngeke asibeke noma atekise ngaso elokishini.  Ngakho-
ke Ngqongqoshe bengithi ake  ulungenele  lolu  daba  ngoba  kumqoka  kakhulu
ukuthi kwaziwe ukuthi  i-black  economic  empowerment  ngempela  ithuthukisa
ikhono labantu abampisholo.

Ngiyamuzwa  udadewethu  laphaya   elokhu   ebelesele.   Sengathi   dadewethu
ungalalela ngoba-ke okuningi  awukwazi,  ukuzwa  ngenzwabethi.  Ngqongqoshe,
kumqoka kakhulu lokhu.  Ngingaphinda  mhlawumbe  ngisho  kuwe  ukuthi  izaba
sezenziwe. Sengike ngafika ezinkampanini ezinjenga lezo. Kutholakele  ukuthi
izinkampani,   njengoba   zenzile,   zibhalisa   abaqondisi   ngalama-closed
corporations.   Kube   sekuthiwa,   "Nina-ke   seniyingxenye   yalawa    ma-
corporations",  kushiwo  kubashayeli.   [Kwaphela   isikhathi.]   [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[In the little time I'm left with, while the Zions of this  House  have  not
yet applauded me, let me go back to Transport - because I know when my  time
is up, they will clap. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

As far as  transportation  issues  are  concerned,  Minister,  something  is
happening, more particularly with  regard  to  black  economic  empowerment.
There are companies - and I'm not going to mention any names  here  -  which
have applied and received contracts in terms of black economic  empowerment.
These companies print their letterheads on the doors  of  some  individuals'
vehicles so that these  individuals  can  transport  material  as  if  these
companies are developing the skills of blacks when they are not.

These people sign contracts as part of a close corporation,  but  they  have
no idea as to what is happening and they are not  being  developed.  At  the
end of the term, this person is given this vehicle  that  he  will  not  use
anywhere, but finds himself in trouble because he cannot keep it and use  it
as a taxi in the township. So, Minister, I would ask  you  to  intervene  in
this issue because it is important to know that black  economic  empowerment
is genuinely developing blacks' skills.

I can hear a sister there who is talking persistently. Sister,  I  wish  you
would listen, because there's a lot you don't know; what you have  heard  is
hearsay. Minister, this is very important. I would also like to say  to  you
again that the efforts that have been made have not  yet  reached  companies
like those. It has been discovered that, as companies have done,  registered
directors in these close corporations and drivers are  told  that  they  are
part of these close corporations.]

Mr H D YAWA (North West): Sihlalo,  aBaphathiswa  bethu,  Nkosazana  Sigcau,
Mphathiswa Sisulu nawe Bhunga  elikhulu,  ooSihlalo  beeKomiti,  ndiyabulisa
kule Ndlu. [Chairperson, our  hon  Ministers,  hon  Queen  Sigcau,  Minister
Sisulu, the caucus and the chairpersons of the Portfolio Committee, I  greet
you in this House.]

His Excellency the President of the Republic of South Africa, in  his  state
of the nation address, delivered  a  loud  and  clear  message  to  us  all,
particularly the  department  of  public  works  of  the  North  West.  Most
importantly, he said:


  I am certain that  you  will  discharge  your  responsibilities  in  this
  regard, sensitive to the important message communicated by our people . .
  .  to  all  the  hon  members  for  your  election  to   serve   as   the
  representatives of our people for the next years.

In response, we as the North West wish to report  as  follows.  The  capital
development  projects  and  major  renovations,  which  can  be   used   for
learnerships, have been identified throughout the province. To this end,  we
are working in partnership  with  the  Independent  Development  Trust;  the
Department  of  Labour;  and  the  Construction   Education   and   Training
Authority. This will enable us not only to  train  unemployed  youth,  women
and disabled persons in the main, but we  will,  through  the  learnerships,
complete projects within our bigger  infrastructure  development  programmes
for the medium-term expenditure financial period.

On 2 April this year, we launched an Expanded Public Works  Programme  under
the brand name Simelela. This, hon members, is a Setswana word  which  means
to roll up sleeves and engage in real work, not talk on the  touchline.  For
us, this is a very important programme which will enable us to  create  jobs
and alleviate poverty within the shortest possible time, better  the  living
standards and quality of life of  the  poorest  of  our  people,  and  build
capacity of communities and SMMEs through ongoing job training.

We will accomplish these strategic goals through the  following  objectives:
to create jobs and alleviate poverty within the shortest possible  time;  to
better the living standards and quality of the lives of the poorest  segment
of the North West province through employment opportunities;  and  to  build
capacity of communities and SMMEs through the ongoing training programme.

The strategic objectives are: to alleviate poverty and create jobs;  provide
skills training to workers; and to advise, monitor and evaluate  reports  on
economic  and  social  impact  of  the  projects  implemented.   All   these
objectives will be fulfilled by the  people  of  the  North  West,  for  job
reservation has never  been  in  the  vocabulary  of  the  ANC  -  from  its
inception.

The approach  proposed  advocates  a  greater  level  of  co-ordination  and
ensures that poverty alleviation and  Public  Works  initiatives  complement
the Government's  mainstream  programme  through  labour-intensive  methods,
wherever  possible  and  practical.  The  South   African   Government   has
identified unemployment as one of the key  challenges  facing  our  country.
Many programmes exist to address this problem, and they  have  been  drafted
and developed after major summits in  various  fields,  eg  the  Growth  and
Development Summit, the World Summit on Sustainable Development and  various
conferences.  All  these  well-documented  strategies  need   time   to   be
implemented.

Some immediate relief with regard to unemployment is needed, and  the  North
West government has set a target to halve unemployment from the current  43%
to 22% by 2014, in accordance with national targets. It  is  our  intention,
and indeed our duty, to co-ordinate the creation of 22 000 jobs per year  in
the North West province as leaders and co-ordinators of the Expanded  Public
Works Programmes.  As a result, we are reviewing  our  tender  documents  to
ensure that all our projects are in line  with  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme and yield the expected results.

In conclusion, speaking for the majority of the people of the North  West  -
including those who have not voted for the ANC, let me promise  this  august
House that we shall always be available to account  for  our  responsibility
as the department of public works in the North West. I thank you.  Kgomo  le
manamane a yona! [Thank you.]] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I take this opportunity to  call  upon  hon
Kghosi Tshivhase to address the House. I  also  welcome  you  back  in  this
House, home is always home!

Kghosi K TSHIVHASE (Limpopo): Thank you very much,  Chairperson.  Indeed,  I
was here from 1994. Then I was 29 years old, but now I have grey hair.

Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  MECs,  hon  permanent  and   special
delegates of provinces, distinguished guests, comrades  and  compatriots,  I
honour you. Allow me to pass on the revolutionary  greetings  from  the  hon
MEC for transport in Limpopo, Comrade Stan  Motimele,  who  mandated  me  to
address this august House on his behalf, as  he  could  not  come  here  for
reasons beyond his control. He wished to be with you  here  today.  However,
rest assured this convergence enjoys both his  unwavering  support  and  all
his blessings.

Transport has become a catalyst  for  sustainable  economic  development  in
Limpopo, now more than ever before. The 2010 soccer bid  has  compelled  the
province to revisit its transport strategy for the next five to  ten  years,
in preparation for a million people who will visit the area for  the  above-
mentioned occasion. This is also informed by the fact  that  we  remain  the
best tourist destination in the country. For that reason, we would  like  to
raise the following grey areas, which need attention in as  far  as  massive
funding is concerned.
We are in the process of creating 14 000 jobs for the next  five  years  and
establishing  the  transport  advisory  board,  which  is  intertwined  with
transport clusters. The implementation of  taxi  recapitalisation  will  run
parallel with renewal of bus  contracts  and  the  introduction  of  subsidy
systems in all districts, hence the "Limpopo in motion" concept.

We also face the mammoth task of  consolidating  international  airports  as
well as marketing airports. Rail and freight transport will be  consolidated
through establishing a coach centre  in  Polokwane.  The  Dilokong  Corridor
concept will have a positive impact on black  economic  empowerment  in  the
province.  For  efficient  road  traffic  and  safety,  we  will  need  more
equipment and an increased number of peace officers.

The establishment of traffic control centres and  refurbishment  of  vehicle
testing centres have to be prioritised. The Limpopo Traffic College must  be
marketed beyond South Africa, and eventually  serve  the  entire  continent.
Road safety programmes will encapsulate scholar transport  in  the  form  of
animal-drawn carts, bicycle projects,  motorcycles  and  tractors.  "Animal-
drawn carts" refers to donkey carts, in this instance.

The state of both bus and taxi terminuses in the province will  have  to  be
upgraded as a matter of urgency, with the aim of improving public  transport
infrastructure. One area which  still  needs  attention  is  human  resource
development.

All these programmes have been synchronised, and a thorough action  plan  is
embodied in our "100 days in office" document. The  province  has  completed
the transport strategy, which is called ``Limpopo in motion''. The  strategy
addresses the thrust that is contained in  the  provincial  White  Paper  on
transport. The province, together with members of the transport sector,  has
pledged to create 14 000 direct jobs and 45 000 indirect jobs  in  the  next
five years.

Mass public transport will be a priority, and all interim contracts will  be
converted into tender contracts  in  the  next  five  years.  The  transport
sector is preparing  to  introduce  an  integrated  transport  system  at  a
presidential nodal point in Sekhukhune. The  province  will,  as  from  this
year, start with the upgrading programme of  all  provincial  airports.  The
main target  in  this  regard  is  Polokwane  International  Airport.  Human
resources management is a serious concern  in  this  area.  Limpopo  traffic
college has extended its  assistance  to  other  neighbouring  countries.  A
complete strategic plan of the department will be available to  all  members
in due course.

The Limpopo department of transport has joined hands with the entire  nation
in creating jobs and fighting poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev E  ADOLPH:  Hon  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  honour  the  national
Ministers, the MECs, guests and special delegates. It's indeed  a  privilege
for me to congratulate the newly-appointed Minister, Dr Lindiwe  Sisulu,  on
her new portfolio. Madam, I would like to challenge you: This  is  indeed  a
daunting task that is  on  your  shoulders  now,  which  is  to  assist  the
department to become an institution of  excellent  service  delivery.  I  am
also very mindful that you will have to rely on the assistance of all  other
departments to implement what was stated in the  President's  state  of  the
nation address.

The ID wants to commend the ANC-led Government for the major successes  they
have had within the three different departments in  the  past  10  years  of
democracy. We are mindful that they have achieved a lot. But, that does  not
mean that we don't need to rectify where we have made mistakes.

The huge backlog in housing is a major concern,  and  will  remain  a  major
one. Our concern and major point of dispute is the poor quality housing  for
our poorest of the poor - the people. The Minister alluded to  this  in  her
speech when she said we should deliver quality houses  to  our  people,  and
not just homes.

I want to mention to this House that I had  an  opportunity,  prior  to  the
elections, to visit some construction sites. I observed  some  poor  quality
materials that were being used to build houses in the North  West  province.
It was appalling to us that you could even  scratch  the  bricks  with  your
finger, because the material was of such poor  quality.  Those  houses  were
not suitable for human habitation. Even trees - believe it  or  not  -  grew
out of the poor foundation through  the  house.  This  can  be  verified  in
townships such as Huhudi and Danville in Mafikeng, which is closer to us.

I want to challenge  all  members,  including  the  national  Ministers,  to
address the poor quality of housing in South Africa.  I  want  to  challenge
you to go and live for at least three days over the weekend in one of  those
toilet matchboxes that we call RDP houses which were built for our people  -
in  order  to  get  acquainted  with  the  severe  circumstances  and  harsh
conditions that our people have to live in. [Interjections.]

Despite that, we wish to reach out a hand as ID. We will assist the  ANC-led
Government in performing the contract that is an obligation to  the  people.
The ID are concerned about maladministration, and we are so  glad  that  the
soon-to-be established special  investigating  directorate  will  deal  with
maladministration. I hope the national Minister will  bring  us  a  forensic
report  on  this  issue  regarding  Huhudi  township.   Please   familiarise
yourself, Minister, and we would like to have a  response  from  the  public
prosecutor. In the final analysis, I think  we  need  to  rigorously  debate
roll-overs and underexpenditure. It is a shame that every year we have roll-
overs. This House needs to debate that rigorously.

The last issue I want to mention is that  of  redline  zones,  which  are  a
remnant of the former apartheid structure. We pay  the  same  amount  for  a
brick in order to build a house. But, due to the fact that they are  in  the
so-called coloured or black townships, our houses are labelled as "built  in
redline zone". We need to involve banks to disclose the criteria on  how  to
label a house "redlined" because people break into houses in towns  as  well
as in townships. I think this will have financial spin-offs for all  of  us.
We also need to encourage banks ... [Time expired.]

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Hon Chair, I also wish to  join  the  House  in
extending a word of congratulations to you and  the  hon  members  who  were
given the task of running this institution.

In the Eastern Cape there are a number of challenges  that  confront  public
transport, and our approach is to respond according to Government  policies.
Large parts of rural communities' areas are inadequately  served  by  public
transport services and transport infrastructure  facilities.  In  accordance
with  the  National  Land  Transport  Transitional  Act  of  2000,  the  MEC
responsible for transport should guide and  direct  transport  planning  and
implementation  in  the  province.  Plans,  such  as  the  rural   transport
development plan, have been prepared to  enhance  land  use  and  transport-
integrated development, and to bridge interaction between  rural  and  urban
areas in our province.

The department intends to vigorously implement transportation projects  that
will address job creation as part of the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme,
the Integrated Rural Development Programme, urban renewal and land  use,  as
well as HIV and Aids. Fragmented planning and management  of  the  transport
system, however, are some of  the  biggest  stumbling  blocks  in  achieving
effective service delivery in our province.

The local municipalities and the Department  of  Transport  have  identified
rail as a very important element for future support of  freight  and  public
transport in the  province.  As  a  mode  of  freight  transport,  rail  has
declined owing mainly to the deregulation of  freight  transport  since  the
late  eighties  and  an  unequal  playing  field  between  road  and   rail.
Currently, the rail infrastructure is underutilised and has  spare  capacity
that we need to access.

 This has resulted in the provincial network being  classified  by  Spoornet
as predominantly low-density and light-density lines,  with  only  the  Port
Elizabeth to Gauteng line being considered a core  line.  The  underutilised
rail infrastructure and excessive road  damage  caused  by  freight  in  the
province suggest that rail freight transport and passenger transport  should
be  promoted  in  such  a  manner  that  they  support   the   socioeconomic
development and growth of the Eastern Cape. The rail network of the  Eastern
Cape consists of approximately 3 360  route  kilometres  and  450  stations,
with these assets belonging mainly to Spoornet.

In our own move back to rail strategy, studies have been undertaken  with  a
view to revitalising operations in the existing rail systems  or  developing
its extensions. Firstly, the Kei Rail: East London-Umtata Rail Project,  one
of the provincial flagship projects, is  one  element.   Secondly,  a  Coega
Industrial Development Zone transport study has been  undertaken.  The  East
London to King William's Town rail study of 2000 for  commuter  service  has
also been undertaken. The Port Elizabeth to East London rail study  of  1996
for commuter service is another aspect. The Motherwell route  identification
and  station  location  study  of  2000  for  commuter  service  is  another
component of our broad strategy for the revitalisation  of  these  important
infrastructures of Government.

Several new proposals have been identified  within  the  Eastern  Cape,  but
they are still being scrutinised to ascertain the role they  could  play  in
reinforcing commuter rail as the backbone of the public transport system  in
our province. Other proposals and business plans  have  been  received  from
the private sector and individuals seeking approval for the use  of  railway
lines for ecotourism and other purposes. These constitute the  key  progress
we have made and which, I think, we can also utilise in future.

Currently, the department's main focus is  on  the  Kei  Rail  Project.  The
refurbishment process started in 1998 and  its  completion  is  expected  by
September this year. About R132 million has been spent since  the  start  of
this project, and R67 million went to the 773 labourers, who benefited  from
the implementation of this project.
The department  has  also  commissioned  four  contracts  to  refurbish  the
existing rail between aMabele and Umtata, as part of the Kei  Rail  Project.
Contracts for the upgrading of station buildings at certain  major  stations
along the line have been advertised and awarded,  thus  creating  additional
jobs in terms of a strategic approach to the  generation  of  infrastructure
in our province.

We believe, in the province, that going back to rail is the  only  route  we
have, and we strongly  believe,  with  the  interventions  of  the  national
Minister, that it is possible in this country to  revitalise  railway  lines
and provide job opportunities, as well as to make a  great  impact  on  both
economic empowerment and the reorganisation of our economy in this  country.
We also believe that Kei Rail, hon Minister Radebe, does have the  potential
to link KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape and, further,  to  integrate  our
economic strategies.

With these few words, I also want to join members in  endorsing  the  policy
statements that have been presented by both  Ministers  to  this  House.  We
really think, as a province, that rail is the  only  flagship  in  terms  of
which national Government can  make  concrete  interventions  in  generating
economic opportunities in the province.

I also wish to announce that on 18 June next week the  hon  Minister  Radebe
will be at a sod-turning ceremony, which  is  a  result  of  this  Kei  Rail
Project in the Transkei. The Transkei is a very important  region  which  we
need to attend to in  terms  of  addressing  poverty  and  revitalising  our
infrastructure. With those few words, thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr G SITHOLE (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Ministers and MECs,  I'm  not
sure whether Mr Mzizi should be going out now when I  have  a  few  minutes,
even though I have papers that I need to read here and that the ANC  says  I
must read. So Mr Mzizi should sit down. [Laughter.]
This is on housing, and I really do not wish to bring the Zulu conflicts  on
housing into this hon House and, of course,  the  heavenly  ideas  from  the
most Rev Adolph. However, we, as Africans, used  to  have  no  addresses  at
all. I don't want hon Minister Sisulu to be discouraged here.  We  now  have
addresses, and  not  only  addresses,  but  also  actual  shelters.  Comrade
President Mbeki says there is going to be an improvement in those  shelters.
It is not fair for people who have always had addresses and shelters to  say
we shouldn't have shelters. That is just one thing.

I would now like to mention what I've  prepared.  Please,  people,  just  be
patient with us.  We  will  get  palaces  too  in  the  future.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.] I have already said that. Being conscious  of  the  mandate
our communities gave all of us at home on 14 April, all parties  alike  have
agreed  that  in  the  cities,  and  especially  outside  the  cities  where
development is sorely missed, the Department of Public  Works  must  quickly
polish up its methods of operation and so develop and create  an  atmosphere
conducive to service excellence.

We will be successful if we hasten the department's  transformation  agenda,
by sharpening the mechanisms and processes of implementation. Back  at  home
we also had a royal  command  by  Imbube  -  ngiyazi-ke  abanye  abazukuyazi
iMbube [I know that some people wouldn't know what Imbube  is]  -  that  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, introduced by the national  and  provincial
governments, must not fail to address the  rural  stomachs  and  souls.  The
President of South Africa has  concurred  and  attached  timeframes  to  the
royal  command.  The  hon  Premier  Ndebele,  with  the  assistance  of  his
colleague the hon Mr Gwala, MEC,  has  been  given  presidential  notice  to
deliver or else. The President said: "Implement  our  programme  to  address
the challenges of the second economy." Clearly, therefore, we  are  directed
to  improve  our  delivery  capacity.  Our  services  must   earn   us   the
appreciation of our communities, which have long been  excluded  from  where
bread is baked. We must improve our budget  management,  so  that  there  is
efficiency where delivery is taking place or where it should be happening.

As the custodian of the state's  assets,  the  department  is  committed  to
maximising the value of the state's property portfolio. The  Government-Wide
Immovable Asset Management Bill will be finalised this year. There  will  be
expert advice at all levels of Government and public entities  on  immovable
assets. Job creation and poverty alleviation will  be  the  outcome  of  the
Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  that,  in  turn,  will  consolidate  our
provincial peace efforts and consolidate the curbing of crime.

There is no doubt that the transformation processes that  the  national  and
provincial governments are working on will yield  visible  construction  and
property industries for our  country.  The  mentioned  programmes  have  the
capacity to further strengthen  the  growing  economy  and  produce  skilled
workers that will participate fruitfully in the economy. Obviously, this  is
a direct investment in social and economic  infrastructure.  Human  resource
development, through the training of our unskilled  communities,  ensures  a
stronger, safer and more coherent tomorrow.

The department has an important task, which we all understand  and  need  to
support,  inside  and  outside  Government.  The  programmes  are  necessary
instruments in creating short-term  jobs  and  training.  The  KwaZulu-Natal
province has been extremely fortunate in securing the services, even if  for
a short time only, of the former  hon  Mike  Mabuyakhulu  who,  through  the
department's battle cry "Asisebenze", managed to arouse the rural and  urban
committees alike to wake up and  do  things  themselves  for  themselves.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G RAMATHEBANE (Free State):  Deputy  Chairperson,  Ministers,  MECs,  hon
delegates and special delegates of the NCOP,  I  would  like  to  thank  the
three Ministers for the encouraging policy statements they tabled before  us
today. Indeed, there is hope for a better life for all. As  the  Free  State
we also want to voice our  support  for  these  policy  statements  by  also
addressing a few areas in which we are going to be involved in the  province
in our attempt to make this a reality.

As part of our endeavour to provide decent and quality shelter in  terms  of
housing, the province will target  all  buffer  zones  in  promoting  social
inclusion through the eradication of spatial distortions. Dedicated  efforts
will be made to applying the various  pieces  of  legislation  necessitating
proper land-use planning, accelerating land release while  preventing  urban
sprawl in the process.

The quality of houses  needs  urgent  attention.  Inexperienced  contractors
have contributed to  the  building  of  houses  of  unacceptable  standards.
Quality homes, as opposed to just houses, will be  the  main  focus  of  the
province. We are not just paying lip service to this.

Regarding our engagement  with  the  communities  in  the  build-up  to  the
elections, a passionate plea was made regarding the corruption and fraud  in
housing delivery. We have instituted some  forensic  investigations  in  the
province in an  attempt  to  weed  out  this  acceptable  and  much-detested
practice among the  developers,  municipalities,  government  officials  and
community members that collude with  these  culprits.  Some  criminal  cases
have been opened with the police, and civil  action  in  some  instances  is
taking its course.

The other matter that is also cause for concern is underspending as  it  has
really been a major setback in housing delivery, despite our  acute  poverty
levels and the stark reality of a great  shortage  of  houses  for  ordinary
people who are expected to  brave  this  cold  winter  without  shelter.  In
addressing this problem, our province  has  made  a  conscious  decision  to
cancel all contracts, contractors, contracts  of  contractors  who  are  not
performing and to allocate these subsidies to those who do perform.

The introduction of the People's Housing Process ensured that  beneficiaries
were actively involved in the construction  of  their  homes,  thus  gaining
valuable skills that can be turned  into  valuable  economic  sustainability
tools.  In  implementing  these  efforts,  we  have  also   enlisted   Cuban
expertise.

The acceleration of rural  housing  delivery  in  Qwaqwa  in  the  Maluti-a-
Phofung municipality and Thaba 'Nchu  in  the  Mangaung  municipality  is  a
priority for this financial year. To this effect, 2 000  additional  housing
units will be built in these two areas. The department of  local  government
and housing is also working with the Department  of  Land  Affairs  and  the
respective municipalities towards upgrading land tenure for the  communities
in these areas.

At  a  minimum,  transport  must  function  as  a  guarantee   of   national
integration. Clearly, this calls for Government to take  the  position  that
views transport as an enabling industry.

It is against this background, in the spirit of a better life for all,  that
we deal with the challenges faced by both public and freight  transport.  At
the level of public transport, the following  need  to  be  looked  at.  The
first aspect is to densify the corridors and nodes to achieve  economies  of
scale, effectively turning around the current trend  towards  dispersal.  We
also  have  to  optimise  model  economics  and  the  service  mix   through
infrastructure investment to support the corridors by selecting the  optimal
mode based on the cost-service trade-off. We also have to firm the level  of
performance through negotiated bus tendering contracts.

As far as the roads infrastructure is concerned, the department  will  align
the provisioning and maintenance of our road network with the strategies  of
the Free State Development Plan as well as Vision 2014. In line  with  this,
we have allocated R298 million. The focus for  the  2004-05  financial  year
will  be  on  the  following.  We  will  improve  accessibility   to   rural
communities, specifically the Selosesha road in Thaba  'Nchu,  Meqheleng  in
Ficksburg, and the Oppermansgronde and Makwane roads in Qwaqwa,  which  will
be undertaken and completed in this financial year.

We will also identify the most appropriate strategic road  network  for  the
province,  which  will  support  road  safety,  tourism  and   socioeconomic
development with the minimum impact of the environment.  Towards  this  end,
the Maluti  Transfrontier  Project  that  will  integrate  the  Golden  Gate
Resort, the Mountain Resort and KwaZulu-Natal will  be  undertaken  together
with the national Department of Transport.

We will also investigate alternative mechanisms of service delivery  through
a road worker empowerment programme  and  give  preference  to  preventative
maintenance instead  of  routine  maintenance  so  as  to  ensure  effective
utilisation of scarce resources.

The following road construction  projects  will  be  initiated  during  this
financial  year.  They  are  the  Vaalpark  interchange  at  Sasolburg;  the
regravelling of roads in the Bethlehem area; the  repair  and  resealing  of
the Excelsior-Clocolan-Tweespruit road; and the repair and resealing of  the
first 10 kilometres of the Bloemfontein-Dealesville  road,  which  I  assure
this House will be completed in this financial year.

In acknowledging the challenges that we are faced with  and  the  importance
of public transport, we have assigned an  amount  of  R18  million  to  this
effect. Towards this end, the Free State Transport Bill  has  been  compiled
to replace the Free State Interim Transport Act of 1998. The envisaged  Bill
will address the problem of the duplication of laws and  ensure  that  there
is a single law applicable to buses, taxis and all  other  modes  of  public
transport. Maybe this is a direct response to the IFP's assertions.

Regarding Public Works, we are called upon  as  a  department  to  lead  job
creation  principally  through  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.  An
important element of the programme is the large-scale expansion in  the  use
of labour-intensive construction methods to build, upgrade and maintain  the
social and economic infrastructure and all other  underdeveloped  rural  and
urban areas of our province. An amount of R52 million has been allocated  to
this programme in this financial year that will,  among  other  things,  see
the creation of 10 000 jobs within the construction industry.

The Expanded Public Works Programme will be launched  at  the  beginning  of
September 2004, with special focus on the  urban  and  rural  nodes  already
identified in terms of our urban  renewal  and  Integrated  and  Sustainable
Rural Development Programme. We are pleased to announce that the  Department
of  Public  Works  -  Roads  and  Transport  -  has  already   engaged   the
Construction Education Training Authority, that is Ceta, and that an  amount
of R10 million has been allocated  for  road  construction  and  maintenance
during the first phase, and the  training  of  500  learners  will  commence
during October 2004.

A memorandum of agreement between the department and Ceta was  signed  on  9
June 2004, and negotiations with the Public  Service  Sector  Education  and
Training Authority and the transport education and  training  authority  are
in progress, which will culminate in the enhancement of our  scarce  skills.
With these words, the Free State also supports the policy statements of  the
three Ministers and we support them wholeheartedly. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs V TAMBO (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam  Chair,  hon  Ministers  and  members  at
large, let me take this opportunity to thank the  Minister  of  Housing  for
the healthy, progressive budget speech she presented in  this  House  today,
and to thank the team that prepared the budget.

We note the fact that the department is facing a huge backlog in almost  all
the provinces, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal, so the demand for  housing  is
growing at a higher pace than the backlog can be addressed.

The programme on housing is explicit, particularly with reference  to  rural
housing, hostel upgrading, human settlement redevelopment,  rental  housing,
housing for HIV/Aids victims and others. This means  that  we  all  need  to
thoroughly scrutinise all the core functions of the  Department  of  Housing
and the legislative mandate.

We appreciate the new approach adopted by the department which explains  the
shift from a private  developer-driven  approach  to  a  municipality-driven
approach, so as to allow municipalities  to  become  developers  in  housing
delivery, with the provision that cases in which a  municipality  lacks  the
necessary capacity, the Department of Housing will intervene and  facilitate
housing development.

There's also a need for a major drive to  capacitate  municipalities  to  be
able to be effective developers  of  housing.  I  must,  again,  salute  the
Minister of Housing for  increasing  the  housing  subsidies.  However,  the
establishment  grant  for  the  people's  housing  process  has  never  been
increased from the time it was introduced. It  has  remained  at  R570  even
though the costs  for  capacitating  communities  have  increased  over  the
years.
Since most of the projects in  KwaZulu-Natal  follow  the  People's  Housing
Process route, it would be appreciated if the establishment grant  could  be
increased  to  take  care  of  all  the  necessary  instruments  needed   to
capacitate beneficiaries to  be  able  to  participate  in  the  process  of
building their own houses themselves.

There are the challenges of quality  housing  delivery  and  speedy  housing
delivery  which  would  unblock  blocked  projects  in  order   to   provide
affordable shelter to the citizens of KwaZulu-Natal and housing for HIV  and
Aids victims. In 2003-04 as many houses  as  possible  have  been  approved,
which  is  aimed  at  facilitating  more  effective  and  efficient  housing
delivery in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The  theme  of  Asibambisane  has
been adopted, which is focused on addressing the housing delivery process.

In order to achieve our goals we have had to do  everything  by  the  rules,
including  capacity-building  and  team-building   exercises,   disciplinary
measures and rewards to guide the massive organisation to move forward.

The Government has prioritised rental housing, but the main problem is  that
the institutions that are meant to provide  and  administer  rental  housing
are greatly affected by the high level of defaulters.

There is a need for the national Housing  department  to  provide  provinces
with  adequate  funding  to  provide  detailed   housing   plans   in   each
municipality. These  housing  plans  will  ensure  that  there  are  clearly
defined  provincial  housing  plans.  The  contribution   of   R2   479   by
beneficiaries remains a challenge.

To conclude, we need to listen to the President of  the  country  -  Zizi  -
when he says that we are now  in  an  era  of  implementation,  rather  than
policy formulation. Therefore we all need to stand up, unite  and  work  for
all South Africans.  Asibambisane!  [Let's  work  together!]  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

[Mr T T TSIKWE (Northern Cpae): Chairperson, hon Minister Jeff  Radebe,  hon
Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, and hon Minister Stella Sigcau, allow me  to  thank
you for what you have done for the Northern Cape, because  half  a  loaf  is
better than nothing. It is my wish that in future when we  give  assistance,
we should do so according to the need and not according  to  the  population
in the province.

When we return to the ANC Manifesto, we  see  that  it  says  that  we  have
signed a contract with the people who listen to us and give us a  chance  to
do good work. That is why we are saying that for us to  have  tarred  roads,
which would save our  vehicles  in  the  Northern  Cape,  we  are  going  to
construct  a  43km  stretch  of  road  between  Kleinsee  and  Komaggas   in
Namaqualand. It will cost us R49 million and it will create 90 jobs. We  are
also going to construct a 21 km stretch of road in  the  Northern  Cape,  at
cost of R20,8 million, and this will create 65 jobs.]

Re ya go dira le tsela e e yang kwa Sutherland e e leng gore e  tla  ya  kwa
observatory ... [We are going to build a  road  through  Sutherland  to  the
observatory ... ] that will cost R8,9 million and create about  90  jobs;  a
road around Upington at R25,7 million, including  a  road  from  Keimoes  to
Upington in association with the BHP Billiton; there is a plan  to  continue
a road from Mamatwane "go ya" to Didibeng and to contribute R9 million to  a
bridge linking Vrededorp and Blouputs "yona  e  tla  kosa"  [and  this  will
cost] R28 million.

Due to lack of transport  in  rural  areas  and  due  to  large  numbers  of
learners walking more that three kilometres single trip between  school  and
home, a  bicycle  project,  known  as  Shova  Kalula  will  be  availed.  An
investigation into the usage of  heavy  transport  will  take  place  and  a
mechanism  is  needed  to  curb  deteriorating  roads.  Thus  we   need   to
reintroduce rail transport due  to  the  Koega  project  that  will  connect
people  from  the  Northern  Cape   through   to   De   Aar   and   Prieska.
[Interjections.]

Ke ya go fetsa ka bonako,  o  se  ka  wa  tshoga.  [Setshego.]  [I  will  be
finished very soon, do not worry. [Laughter.]]

Public Works is well placed for the creation of jobs and  therefore  has  to
use  its  existing  budget  to  maximise  job  creation.  There  will  be  a
multipurpose hall built in the  Frances  Baard  region  for  extracurricular
activities for the community of Floors, which will focus on the  youth.  The
construction of the new community hall in Calvinia  in  the  Namaqua  region
will also commence in September. A mass sports participation programme  will
be launched, and 30 people  and  volunteer  workers  will  be  employed  and
receive R1 200 per month. The Mayibuye Centre in Galeshewe will provide  one
thousand temporary jobs over the  period  of  construction.  In  Dibeng  and
Hopetown sports facilities will provide 100  people  with  jobs  during  the
twelve months of construction.

We are committed to changing our province  from  being  a  social  province,
which is a province of beggars where people are relying  on  handouts.  Most
of the primary products and mineral products of this country  are  from  the
Northern Cape. We lobby your support to ensure that those raw  materials  be
reproduced in our province to increase the creation  of  job  opportunities.
We cannot be apologetic to people playing truant when they are  supposed  to
attend their committees. We want to have a hands-on  approach  with  regards
to funds transferred to district municipalities so as to monitor  mechanisms
that will ensure that projects are completed in set  time  frames  and  that
tenders are not given to companies  that  have  incomplete  projects.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  today  I  wish  to
address the House on an important matter regarding  transport.  But  let  me
start  by  also  wishing  the  Minister  of  Transport  well  in  this   new
appointment in which he will undoubtedly face some  daunting  challenges.  I
am sure that all Ministers will be taking the state of  the  nation  address
delivered by the hon  President  on  21  May  as  their  directive  for  the
immediate future. I do not have to remind the Minister, I am sure, that  the
President placed great emphasis on the improvement of the  quality  of  life
of our people and the eradication of poverty. This, the President said  must
be achieved by, inter alia, encouraging the growth of the first economy  and
thereby increasing its possibility to create jobs.

Central to his address were also many issues related to  transport,  and  in
the context of this debate the two subjects are interrelated. Increased  job
creation must obviously  also  go  hand  in  hand  with  the  protection  of
existing jobs by ensuring  that  industries  presently  within  the  economy
remain viable and profitable and of course  have  sustainable  grip.  It  is
common  knowledge  that  the  deterioration  of  our   rail   networks   and
infrastructure has indirectly led to a massive growth in  the  road  freight
industry, which is a major employer to many thousands of  our  people  today
and, as such, must be recognised for its role in the systematic  eradication
of poverty.

It is also true that road freight  has  become  extremely  competitive,  and
only those  within  the  industry  that  are  well-managed  and  staffed  by
competent and well-trained employees can survive. Clearly,  therefore,  your
department has a duty to protect those  deployed  and  employed  within  the
industry while facilitating and encouraging growth through interaction  with
other departments. We also know that trade with our  neighbouring  countries
is growing by the day so cross-border road freight has become big  business.
The problem is that our South African freight operators are presently  being
disadvantaged to the benefit of their opposition  transporters  from  across
our boarders.

 This has come about due to the extremely heavy cross-border levies  imposed
on the freight by our neighbouring states,  while  their  own  carriers  are
neither levied when leaving their home countries nor levies by us when  they
enter South Africa. The  amounts  involved  and  the  formulas  applied  for
calculating such levies vary from one country  to  another.  Whilst  Lesotho
and Swaziland, for example, have moderate levies, the same  cannot  be  said
for our other neighbours. Other levies vary from  R1  000  per  single  trip
into Namibia to as much as R52 000 per annum  per  each  individual  freight
vehicle used to travel into Botswana, regardless  of  the  number  of  trips
undertaken in a given year.

The freight industries  in  our  neighbouring  countries  therefore  have  a
distinct advantage of at least R1 000 on each load carted into  and  between
the two countries over our own freighters.  This  unfair  advantage  to  our
neighbours results in  the  loss  of  cardidge  and  contracts  to  our  own
contractors for our own freighters which in  turn  must  undoubtedly  -  you
will agree I am sure - lead to the loss  in  revenue  and  ultimately  to  a
negative growth in job creation. My plea to you,  therefore,  hon  Minister,
is that cross-border levies for freighters  entering  our  country  must  at
least be matched to ensure a level playing field for  all  the  competitors.
And I urge you to interact with other departments and  parastatals  in  this
regard.

By such actions we would not be advantaging or  disadvantaging  anyone,  but
merely ensuring that the role-players have an equal chance  to  compete  for
business and in so doing the fittest will survive. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs  G  S  SINDANE  (Mpumalanga):  Mhlonishwa  Sihlalo   neliSekela   lendlu

Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, hon Ministers,  hon
members of local  governments,  hon  members  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, we bring you greetings from Mpumalanga province!]

The Department of Housing remains a critical role-player in the central  aim
of transforming the living conditions of our people,  especially  the  poor.
The Minister, in her Budget Vote today and her predecessors in  theirs,  are
providing us with the possibility to construct the  houses,  infrastructure,
create jobs and fight poverty. It is on this foundation  that  opportunities
for qualitative advances  to  be  scored  prevail.  These  advances  are  in
pursuance of the historic mission as  correctly  articulated  in  our  noble
document  the  Freedom  Charter:  "There  shall  be  houses  for  all",   as
rightfully echoed in the Minister's budget policy speech.

Our province is committed to deliver houses that restore pride  and  dignity
to our people. The motto of our housing delivery is ``bigger  and  better''.
In this regard, our department decided to take charge of the design  of  the
plans of the houses to be constructed.  Now  we  build  bigger  and  better-
looking houses. Our people are happy to call them houses.

It is our resolve that we continue to offer houses with a minimum of  40  m²
in size that are authentically enhanced and  of  good  quality.  It  is  our
endeavour to ensure that the sustainability of houses  is  established.  The
department is gradually  implementing  the  400  m²  minimum  standard  size
policy in urban areas and minimum 1 000 m² stand size in rural  areas.  This
is done to benefit the beneficiaries particularly when  their  families  and
their means grow. The beneficiaries are able to grow plants  and  vegetables
in their yards so as to sustain their livelihood and also to avoid the  slum
settlements. One of our priorities is to build  houses  right  where  people
are. This is one of the main responsibilities we have  towards  discouraging
migration of people from rural areas to urban areas, which  results  in  the
emergence of shack towns. We add value to living  and  make  people's  lives
better right where they live.

We are aware that we still have a backlog in housing  delivery.  It  is  our
plan that in the next five years we should speed up delivery.  Our  plan  is
in response to the President's call to speed up delivery  in  his  state  of
the nation address, and we will deliver to the people of Mpumalanga no  less
than 4 115 houses within one hundred days. We  also  hope  to  finalise  the
financing of  the  Emalahleni  presidential  job  summit  project  with  the
private sector. It is our belief that the  financial  institutions  have  an
important role to play in housing delivery. We are  planning  officially  to
open this project by next  month,  July  2004.  This  is  one  of  the  many
exciting projects we have witnessed developing  in  the  province.  We  will
showcase for all in the country how we deliver, with an  effort  to  dealing
with human settlement and the close racial divide in a  predominantly  rural
province.

It is our plan that in  the  coming  few  years  similar  projects  will  be
launched in the towns of our province. This is our rental stock  in  housing
provision. We are also looking  at  redevelopment  of  all  hostels  in  the
province to change them and ensure that we have a  suitable  settlement  for
families. These are all efforts of the ANC Government to  rid  ourselves  of
the vestiges of apartheid settlement patterns. We currently  have  two  such
redevelopments taking place at Umkhonto in the province.  The  project  will
be completed next year. The other identified hostels  are  at  Govan  Mbeki,
Emalahleni, Ermelo, Bethal and Barberton.

In the  process  of  redevelopment  we  ensure  that  job  creation,  skills
development and  skills  transfer,  especially  for  the  youth  and  women,
including disabled persons, are taking place. In line  with  our  commitment
to the people's contract, our department has created opportunities  for  797
emerging contractors to take part in  housing  delivery.  The  breakdown  is
that  28.6%  is  owned  by  youth,  26.2%  by  women,  6%  by  people   with
disabilities, and the remainder is for other categories.

In the same vein, we welcome the  Minister's  initiative  of  setting  up  a
special investigating unit in the department. We believe hat this unit  will
be of great help in rooting out corruption and  maladministration.  We  also
welcome the determination of  the  Minister  in  capacity  building  to  our
municipalities.

In the coming months, starting from the current month, we  will  be  handing
over houses to the beneficiaries all over the province. This will form  part
of our celebration. We have also embarked  on  a  survey  to  determine  the
exact number of the informal and mud houses in the province so that we  know
exactly what our backlog is and come up with an  appropriate  response  plan
before the end of July 2004. This is our contribution to the  policy  debate
on housing. Mpumalanga supports the policy of the department and hopes  that
more funds will be made available to the department and to the provinces  in
the next MTEF. And the end of our term we must be remembered as  people  who
surely delivered the  goods  for  a  better  life  for  all.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr P GOVENDER (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Ministers  -  both  national
and provincial - members of the House, our British  visitors,  if  they  are
still here, good day, I bring you warm greetings from  the  Kingdom  of  the
Zulu. I will be speaking on Vote 6 and that is Public Works. The  department
of works has a vision, and that is to remain leaders  in  the  provision  of
public property and facilities. To achieve this,  the  department  needs  to
embark on special programmes to address the  needs  that  exist  within  the
public  sector  and  the  community  at  large.  In  this  regard  I   refer
specifically to the issues surrounding gender equality,  youth  development,
youth empowerment, employment equity, HIV/Aids,  the  physically  challenged
and women's empowerment.

The department of  works  has  a  vital  role  to  play  on  various  issues
concerned   with   supporting   people   from   historically   disadvantaged
communities to enter into the mainstream of the economy.  Therefore,  it  is
imperative that when contracts are awarded, emerging  companies  from  these
communities are given  an  opportunity  to  establish  themselves  as  role-
players. This in  no  way  implies  that  the  quality  of  work  should  be
compromised in any way.

The department of works must continue to attract BEE companies. It is  often
found that established large  companies  are  awarded  contracts,  and  they
subcontract these contracts to smaller companies, thus retaining the  lion's
share of the profits. In this way  small  companies  are  not  empowered  to
become employers, but remain employees.

One of the threats that face the department of works, as it does  all  other
departments, is that of HIV/Aids. The devastating impact this  pandemic  has
on  our  country  cannot  be  ignored  by  any  department,  and   therefore
strategies should immediately be put in place to face this threat head-on.

Another area that needs urgent attention is the inability  to  attract  high
calibre and skilled staff. This leads to targets not being met, or  if  they
are met, the results are not per se the desired standards.  There  is  often
and imbalance in terms of skills that  are  available  as  compared  to  the
skills  that  are  required  to  deliver  services.  As  with   some   other
departments, the Department of Public Works is also faced with  the  problem
of losing skilled staff to foreign countries. In KwaZulu-Natal we  are  also
losing skilled professionals to other provinces, especially  Gauteng.  This,
on one hand, makes us proud in the sense that we produce  much  sought-after
professionals. But on the negative side, it  creates  a  vacuum  within  our
province, and this needs to be addressed urgently.  Nationally  we  need  to
ensure that our skilled professionals are given proper incentives,  so  that
they will remain within our borders.

It is often reported that thousands of jobs are  created  via  public  works
programmes. Whilst this is what the  country  requires,  the  question  that
needs to be answered is: Are these long-term programmes, or are they  short-
term initiatives that cannot be sustained?  If  they  cannot  be  sustained,
then one needs to ask just  how  sincere  we  are  about  job  creation  and
poverty alleviation.

Keeping in mind the high level  of  poverty  and  unemployment  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, it will be very encouraging if the citizens  of  our  province  could
feel the benefit of the Expanded Public Works Programme in a  tangible  way.
Therefore, I appeal to you, hon Minister, to look favourably  upon  KwaZulu-
Natal in this  regard,  because  I  know  that  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme has tremendous potential to benefit our province.

The high levels of unemployment amongst our youth should also be treated  as
a matter of concern for public works. The department of works has  to  focus
on programmes that will empower our youth  with  skills,  and  provide  them
with opportunities to gain experience in the  workplace.  If  it  does  not,
then it will be relegating our youth to  remain  unproductive  economically.
Our youth  also  needs  to  be  catered  for  with  regard  to  recreational
facilities, and the Department of  Public  Works  has  a  responsibility  to
provide  infrastructure  within  communities,  so  that  our  youth  can  be
gainfully occupied whilst developing essentials skills.

Facilities that cater for the  needs  of  those  in  our  province  who  are
physically challenged are sadly inadequate. It is often  found  that  public
buildings are not user friendly to those who are physically challenged.  The
department needs to address this issue as a matter of urgency.

Hon Minister, centres that cater for the needs of our  senior  citizens  and
facilities for women's empowerment need swift and urgent  attention.  It  is
sad to know that our senior citizens, who have contributed so  much  to  our
democracy, are now marginalised. They need to  be  shown  the  respect  that
they so richly deserve. Women in our province have just as much to offer  as
men have to offer, therefore they must be  provided  with  opportunities  to
empower themselves so that  they  can  take  their  rightful  place  in  our
society. They can do this only  if  the  necessary  infrastructure  is  made
available to them, and the Department of Public Works needs  to  place  this
item high on its list of priorities. I thank you.

Mrs H F MATLANYANE: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, the  mandate
that the ANC was given on 14 April  was  very  overwhelming.  In  accordance
with this mandate, we are going to ensure that, together  with  the  people,
we sign a contract to ensure that we  eradicate  poverty  and  create  jobs.
Indeed, we have come a long way since 1994  to  ensure  that  delivery  goes
even to the rural poor. This is South Africa and  Africa's  time  to  ensure
that we eradicate poverty.

Transport forms an integral part of a  developing  country  like  ours.  Our
economy relies largely  on  a  transport  system  that  is  reliable,  safe,
effective, efficient and affordable to the poor. Our transport  policy  must
always take into consideration the needs  of  the  poor,  the  elderly,  the
unemployed,  scholars  and  people  with   disabilities.   Access   to   job
opportunities, government services and tourism all rely on a good  transport
system that will not fail them.

Previous policies moved people away from economic activities,  that  ensured
that the previously disadvantaged had to pay more for transport in order  to
access services. High rates of accidents, both on road and  rail,  are  also
contributing factors.

Hon Minster, your department is charged with a challenge and  responsibility
to ensure that infrastructure is improved and movement, both  of  goods  and
people, are increased through subsidies.  A  five-year  road  infrastructure
strategy was approved to deal with, and prevent, the  deterioration  of  our
roads. In line with the resolutions of the gross  domestic  summit  of  June
2003,  the  department  embarked   on   integrated   labour-intensive   road
construction programmes, together with  Department  of  Public  Works.  This
ensured that local people, preferably women, were skilled  through  training
to work on rural roads. The department, together with  the  private  sector,
is involved in a special development initiative, using public resources,  in
project planning, scoping and co-ordination of skills to stimulate  economic
growth. The focus is on sustainable job creation and on skills transfer,  on
black economic empowerment and on infrastructure provision.

Construction of toll roads plays an important part in road  development  and
maintenance, but alternative roads must also be  constructed  for  the  poor
who cannot afford toll road fees. Bus transport, mostly in rural  and  urban
areas, is used for access  to  workplaces.  Selective  access  to  subsidies
denied people access to public transport. The poor and the  needy  were  the
most affected by targeted subsidies.

More than 69% of our passengers are transported by minibus taxis, mostly  in
urban and rural areas. The industry was previously not regulated;  resulting
in  disputes  and  violence  due  to  illegal  operations  and  the  use  of
unroadworthy vehicles, which led to road accidents.  The  industry,  through
Santago, and the Department of Transport strived to regulate  and  stabilise
the industry. A memorandum of understanding was signed for  the  replacement
of the unroadworthy fleet and the absorption of the taxis  into  the  formal
economy through a taxi recapitalisation programme.  This,  as  the  Minister
has indicated, must be treated with urgency.

We, as the ANC, commend the Minister for  undertaking  to  ensure  that  the
RTMC is to start functioning as soon as possible.  Pedestrians  are  causing
40% of fatalities on our roads. The department is  aiming  at  reducing  the
number  of  fatalities  through  an  awareness   campaign   by   encouraging
compliance with traffic laws and by encouraging  and  forging  a  harmonious
working  relationship  between  traffic  authorities  in  all   spheres   of
government.

Rail transport also plays an important role in  the  transport  industry  by
transporting goods and passengers.  Like  road  safety,  rail  safety  is  a
priority for all concerned, mostly in urban areas. The safety  and  security
strategy for the rail commuter system was developed by the stakeholders  for
improved co-ordination between rail security and the SAPS for  intervention.
Alarms and helicopter surveillance were introduced  by  the  department  and
the SA Rail Commuter Corporation and Metro Rail. We would  like  to  commend
the department for the reintroduction of the railway police.  We  hope  that
this will ensure that commuters are safe, and that the  department  and  the
provinces will not be taken to court by commuters  who  were  victimised  on
the trains.

As the ANC, we support your Budget Vote. I thank you.

Mr S KWELITA (Eastern Cape): Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, members of  the
House and ladies and gentlemen, let me  express  my  sincere  gratitude  for
this opportunity provided to  me  to  participate  in  this  debate.  Having
listened to previous speakers, I have decided to focus on three  areas.  The
first area is that of job creation  and  unemployment.  I  have  decided  to
focus on this area because I believe that  we  have  sufficient  facts  that
should assist us in making a decision. The first set of facts we  have  been
provided  with  by  Census  2001,  which  provided  the   following   facts,
especially about the Eastern Cape: The Eastern Cape has the highest rate  of
unemployment in the country, currently standing at 54,6%. The second set  of
facts was that 42,6% of the population, which is about 1,3 million,  between
the age of 20 and above, have no schooling or  have  received  only  primary
education.

The third one is that, although the population is growing at a rate of  10%,
the household is growing at a rate of 20%. It is these facts  that  made  us
reflect again on the second set of facts, which is: the economic  growth  of
the province over the  last  years  has  been  at  what  one  could  call  a
considerable rate. Again if one looks at employment figures as  provided  in
the Budget Review and if one looks at the economic growth  of  the  country,
one finds that there are positive figures in  all  those  areas.  But  these
positive  figures  have  not  responded   positively   to   the   issue   of
unemployment. It is on the basis of these that we feel that  the  Community-
Based  Public  Works  Programme,  especially  the  Expanded   Public   Works
Programme, presents a proper strategy for Government intervention.

We believe this because, regarding the communities  that  are  involved  and
affected in our province, we have made the  following  observations  through
research that  has  been  conducted  by  an  institution  in  KwaZulu-Natal:
Firstly, through  the  programme  they  have  managed  to  engage  in  other
economic activities, because they have savings  and  through  those  savings
they engage  in  other  economic  activities.  Secondly,  the  KwaZulu-Natal
example, which indicates an integrated approach, has also shown us that  you
can  use  the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme  to  engage   other
departments and create jobs that can be sustained.

It is through this analysis that we believe that the programme needs  to  be
supported by all of us because it will give us the results that we want,  in
order to deal with unemployment and poverty alleviation. The second  area  I
would like to  move  to  quickly  is  with  regard  to  emerging  contractor
support. It is our belief that the  programme  of  training  that  has  been
undertaken at national and provincial levels, indicates that you can reap  a
lot of benefit in  ensuring  that  these  emerging  contractors  don't  only
remain emerging contractors, but that they move to higher  levels.  As  part
of this process, the province has engaged IDC, and there is a joint  venture
where there is an amount of  R20  million  which  could  also  assist  these
emerging contractors financially.

The third important aspect in relation to  emerging  contractors,  which  we
believe we  have  undertaken  a  study  of  as  a  province,  looks  at  the
contribution which we have made in this sector in the past 10 years, how  we
have learnt from that  contribution  about  the  positive  areas  that  need
further reinforcement, and how we  can  learn  from  that  experience  about
areas where we need to do  things  better.  We  believe  that  through  that
exercise we will be able to present, before the end of this financial  year,
a detailed programme that could indicate to us clearly how we can  intervene
in the emerging contractor support programme.

The last area that I would like to touch on, which has been touched on  here
as well, is around providing accommodation for  user  departments.  We  have
learnt in our province that we have a budget of about R1,2 billion which  we
are implementing on behalf of the sister department,  but  our  capacity  to
implement that programme is  greatly  challenged.  As  a  result,  the  user
department has been forced on  a  number  of  occasions  to  rely  on  other
service providers. It is on the basis of that understanding that we  believe
that in this  financial  year,  one  of  the  areas  on  which  we  need  to
concentrate will be  where  we  are  increasing  our  own  capacity  as  the
department so as to service those user departments better.

Related to that as well is that, in the area of accommodation, we have  also
undertaken a study, the results of which  we  hope  to  be  tabling  to  the
provincial cabinet by the end of July. Currently that  study  has  indicated
to us the space requirements, because in the past most  of  the  departments
have been operating in  conditions  which  were  not  suitable  to  them  to
deliver properly on their mandates. But we believe that we also need  to  do
a second part of that study, which is to cost  that  study.  It  is  on  the
basis of that that we believe that by the end of July we  will  be  able  to
present  that  comprehensive  study  that  indicates  to  us  the  areas  of
intervention and how we can intervene also in that particular area.

In conclusion, Chairperson  and  hon  members,  we  want  to  confirm  as  a
province that the speeches  presented  here  by  the  three  Ministers  have
indeed confirmed that we are a nation at work, and therefore let us roll  up
our sleeves, and contribute to the task at  hand.  Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr M L  FRANSMAN  (Western  Cape):  Madam  Chairperson,  Ministers  and  all
protocol observers, it is with  great  honour  that  I  take  part  in  this
debate, just over a  week  after  hosting  the  national  Minister,  Comrade
Sisulu, and her provincial counterparts  in  Somerset  West,  at  our  first
MinMec briefing since the new Cabinet  announcement.  To  the  members,  the
Western Cape and most probably the nation, one can say that I have  listened
very attentively to our national Minister; I have looked at the way  she  is
focused, at the detail, and the deliberateness of what she is  doing.  Hence
one can say that the housing portfolio is in good hands in this country.

This budget debate, along with others, takes into  cognisance  many  of  the
issues that the people in various corners of the country  have  communicated
as their wishes. Some have  done  so  verbally  during  door-to-door  visits
ahead of the general elections that was won by an overwhelming  majority  to
the organisation, the people's movement.  I  represent  the  province  whose
people, at last, mandated the ANC to take charge  and  filter  the  benefits
enjoyed by  the  rest  of  the  provinces  whose  policies  were  guided  by
progressive minds. Here one can be reminded of what someone once  said,  and
that is that change is a process but that change is inevitable. We  promised
our leaders the Western Cape, and it was delivered. What lies ahead for  the
Western Cape government therefore talks to  the  challenge  to  deliver  and
those challenges were set out yesterday in the Housing address.

Ten years on, as a country, we have notched up several  milestones.  Amongst
those are that, for just over seven years  of  persistent  fighting  against
homelessness, we have  managed  to  build  over  1,6  million  houses.  Yes,
Minister, indeed that translated into  at  least  7  million  people  having
security of tenure, and other secondary spin-offs. Therefore I want  to  say
to the hon member from the ID, that it's not necessary if you, in  fact,  go
to the people who received those  houses.  They,  in  fact,  now  have  home
security. Is not a question of building matchbox houses.

We can say that overall the housing programme over the last 10 years  was  a
good programme. There would have been areas of quantity,  but  the  majority
was very good quality housing delivery. Otherwise  we  are  saying  that  we
have failed our people, and we definitely did not fail our  people,  because
South Africa has  been  internationally  recognised  as  a  leader  in  home
delivery. [Interjections.] The national housing budget of R4,8  billion  for
this financial year presents us with the  opportunity  to  optimally  deduce
benefits informed by a multipronged strategy aimed at   addressing  housing,
and putting it in the centre of socioeconomic upliftment.

Among issues to be further explored is a purposeful attempt to  have  large-
scale housing construction projects serving as the turnkey  in  those  areas
where  employment  opportunities  are  nonexistent.  In  many  small  areas,
housing budgets therefore become the turnkey for socioeconomic  imperatives.
Success in getting this right rests  on  our  ability  as  a  government  to
synchronise  our  budgeting,  planning,   fighting   corruption,   reviewing
policies and ensuring spending of allocated funds.

There will also be a deliberate attempt to have  the  marginalised  sections
of our society playing  a  leading  role  in  this  process.  The  women  in
construction, the youth, the religious sector, women in general,  the  rural
poor, the unemployed graduates, to count but a few, are among those  sectors
that require our active involvement. Comrade Minister, we  agree  with  your
six-pillar approach that talks to building homes. It  is  also  quite  clear
that it talks to repositioning of housing in the country.

Amongst  the  few  critical  interventions  that  the   Western   Cape   has
identified, and will have to deal with are:  the  underspending  issue,  the
fast-tracking strategy, the identification  of  bottlenecks,  and  analysing
the forensic audit that was done in the  Western  Cape  around  the  housing
portfolio. For that I have instructed my  own  department  in  the  province
that, over the next year, we will go into a special period  to  ensure  that
we address the backlogs. We also have  in  the  province  a  portfolio  that
talks to at least 320 000 household units as a backlog.

We talk about the migration pattern in the province, as well as  those  from
other provinces, from the rural poor of at least an  annual  growth  of  1%,
and then it becomes a strategic approach to manage it.  What  the  President
and the Minister have put on the table is therefore an  opportunity  for  us
to make an input. In the current MTEF cycle, the  amount  spent  on  housing
has  already  been  indicated  as  being  approximately  R14  billion.  Such
consistency will assist in planning and putting in place the  right  systems
and human resources.

However, given the challenges posed to us by you, I have no doubt  that  the
outer year of this MTEF cycle will see significant need  for  real  increase
in budget. We have also identified questions at the municipal level,  and  I
have put in  place  a  skills  audit  analysis  to  give  support  to  those
municipal areas. Minister, you have  challenged  us  to  eliminate  informal
houses in the next six years. A challenge I would like to make a  commitment
to is that it will receive our best efforts.
In the Western Cape we  have  approximately  170  informal  settlements  and
therefore appropriate measures are to  be  put  in  place.  On  22  June  an
intergovernmental meeting between the provincial, local and national  levels
will take place to, in fact, look at the first challenge that you  have  set
for this province, that of the informal settlements along the N2.  The  kind
of society we have is based on profound respect for  human  rights.  In  the
Western Cape, where admittedly the challenge of building the  nation  united
in diversity is still big, we have set ourselves the  task  of  making  sure
that the next five years  will  see  the  province  evolving  into  a  truly
harmonious nonracial society, indeed a home for all.

It is in this regard that one of the motivating benefits of  an  accelerated
housing delivery process is that we shall soon do away with  the  relics  of
separate development that sought to keep races  apart.  We  will  make  sure
that the poor are no longer only relegated to the  periphery  of  our  urban
settlements, but that they are integrated and accommodated over  the  buffer
strips that ensured that they remained  on  the  Cape  Flats  and  low-lying
unsuitable marshes. We will not tolerate a situation where huge  disparities
continue to exist between the rural poor and the  metro,  between  our  farm
owner and farmworker and between the different spheres in the metro.

On behalf of the Western Cape and the housing beneficiaries, I move for  the
adoption of the Vote in its present form, for it has all  the  hallmarks  of
the contract which we undertook to enter into with our people.  The  Western
Cape therefore accepts the Budget. We must all be prepared to  roll  up  our
sleeves and lend a hand in housing the nation. A great deal of  work  awaits
us. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, thank  you  very  much.  Before  I
call upon the Ministers to respond, I just  want  to  indicate  to  the  hon
Ministers the reason we decided, as a Council, to bring together  the  three
departments. Housing is a need for our people, and  without  roads,  housing
is  useless,  and  without  infrastructure  such  as  clinics,  schools  and
community centres, it does not help our society. We want to build a  society
that is  respected  by  all,  by  providing  all  you  can  as  these  three
departments. Hence we have invited the three of you today, to come and  make
a presentation to  this  House.  May  I  then  call  upon  the  Minister  of
Transport to give us his response.

The  MINISTER  OF  TRANSPORT:  Madam  Chair,  I  thank  everybody  who   has
participated in this important debate. I take your  point,  Chairperson.  We
are already working in clusters at a national level. So, I will  be  working
very closely with my colleagues to support the Minister of Public  Works  to
push this Public Works Programme. As you have said, when they build  houses,
we need to put an appropriate road system in place.

I will not be long. I will just address some of the  key  issues  that  have
been raised. I note the positive comments  that  the  acting  Chair  of  the
Select Committee on Public Works, hon Tau, has  made  on  the  Road  Traffic
Management Corporation. I want to emphasise that we  have  no  intention  in
transport of developing a proliferation of agencies that deal  with  similar
or related matters. The RTMC, therefore, will  be  responsible  for  a  wide
range of road matters, so that we can know where the buck really stops.

On safety, we endorse the view that road and  rail  safety  remain  critical
challenges for all South African people.  We  need  to  emphasise,  however,
that road users are ultimately responsible for safety on our  roads  through
compliance with various regulations and traffic rules, as  well  as  through
respect for other road users.

Our  Government  will  continue  to  be   responsible   for   safety-related
infrastructure issues, such as road signage,  design  and  law  enforcement.
Road safety, therefore, goes beyond the Arrive Alive campaign.  It  involves
investment in, and continued  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  as  well  as
effective  strategies  to  ensure  the  roadworthiness  of   all   vehicles,
particularly trucks, lorries, taxis and buses.

It is our very strong view that more efforts need to  be  put  in  place  on
mobile enforcement measures, such as weight  bridges,  roadside  courts  and
proper certification of vehicles prior to their getting on to our roads.

I will be raising with my colleague the Minister of Justice the  possibility
of improving the knowledge of road safety regulations  amongst  the  various
prosecuting authorities to encourage them to take  stronger  action  against
repeat offenders. We also need to identify who the  real  culprits  are  as,
for example, regarding the overloading of trucks, drivers  are  always  held
responsible. What about the  owners  and  companies  behind  these  drivers?
[Applause.]

On the issue of Youth Month, I would like to endorse what the  departed  MEC
for public works and transport said on June being Youth  Month.  We  believe
that, as a Government, we are going to continue our strategies  of  delivery
that should take on board youth empowerment and youth  development.  A  more
stringent application of targeted employment towards  youth  as  a  distinct
category must be pursued, without losing sight of women and the disabled.

I must inform the hon delegates that the Department  of  Transport  and  all
its agencies are already implementing the  DGS  agreements  with  regard  to
learnerships and training. The department  is  currently  transferring  R6,3
million to various tertiary institutions for  the  promotion  of  transport-
related courses and qualifications, and this amount will  increase  to  R7,1
million in the 2006-07 financial year.
Another example is the  Road  Agency  Fund's  training  through  contractual
obligations, where R41,3 million has been spent on training since 2000  and,
in this way, currently we are spending a further R9,8 million  on  the  same
programme.  These  are  some  of  the  measures  to  demonstrate  our   firm
commitment, as Government, to youth empowerment and development.

On the issue of the comments by MEC Mhlahlo  on  the  so-called  low-density
and  marginal  railway  lines,  I  want  to  indicate  that  railway  lines,
especially in the rural areas,  are  often  classified  as  low-density  and
marginal lines. From a commercial perspective, many of these lines would  be
classified as unprofitable, but  from  a  developmental  perspective,  these
lines are probably the life-blood of all  those  rural  communities  through
which these lines go.

The ANC Government  is,  therefore,  responsible  for  balancing  all  these
perspectives. On the  one  hand,  Spoornet  might  be  overburdened,  whilst
communities are not denied the access to  sustainable  livelihood  to  which
the  rail  network  could  provide  vital  access.  Some  cargo  is   better
transported by rail rather than  by  road,  for  example,  petroleum,  fuel,
liquids and timber, amongst others. It is with this balancing  act  in  mind
that our Government is firmly committed to revitalising rural rail  and,  in
some instances, to building new ones where these are required.

Public-private partnerships operating  within  clear  regulatory  frameworks
could be part  of  the  solution.  The  separation  of  infrastructure  from
operations  to  allow  greater  access  by  multiple  operators   is   being
considered.

On the issue  of  labour-intensive  technologies,  the  DA,  as  usual,  has
adapted a very crude and simplistic position on the use of  labour-intensive
methods. Certainly, we are not advocating a revision  to  apartheid's  rural
road construction methods where the white foreman, with a  tobacco  pipe  in
his mouth, sat dozing on the truck, while the black labourers did  the  hard
work. [Applause.] This is  about  community  empowerment  where  our  people
themselves take these things into their own hands.

I must also say that the debate that the DA is trying to introduce,  of  the
so-called two-tier labour market, was closed a long  time  ago.  The  Labour
Market Commission had clearly considered this  subject  and  concluded  that
the South African labour market is not inflexible.

Internationally,  the  application  of  specific  technology  to  facilitate
employment without unacceptable premiums and delays in  delivery  is  widely
acknowledged, particularly by the ILO, as MEC Mcebisi has  highlighted.  Let
me give one more example of these methods in  action,  the  construction  of
the Amadiba road in Pondoland where the only source of gravel for  the  road
surface in the  area  could  only  be  quarried  by  hand,  because  of  the
shallowness of the scene of the gravel.
If mechanical means were  utilised,  there  would  have  been  much  greater
environmental damage to the topsoil, with erosion arising as a  result.  So,
there are scientific reasons why we can  use  labour  instead  of  machines.
Therefore, the choice of this appropriate technology is  very  important  to
the successful implementation  of  the  labour-intensive  approach,  despite
what some of the DA dinosaurs would claim. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

On a lighter note, hon members, arising from the comment by the Minister  of
Housing about the population in  the  Northern  Cape,  as  the  Minister  of
Transport, I am willing to transport whoever she wants to bring to sort  out
this problem. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Madam Deputy Chair, I really  don't  know  why  the
Minister wants to use me to say the things that he actually  wants  to  say.
He's been dying to say this; he's been sending me notes about the very  same
thing. Now I am to put it across and made to bear the brunt of it.  But  I'm
quite willing to take on the challenge that the Minister has  given  us.  He
should arrange for the building of roads to where houses are needed so  that
we can have homes there. And I'm very glad that you constructed this  debate
in such a way that we actually benefit from the input from  both  Ministries
because, as I indicated in my speech, part of the problem is that we end  up
using the subsidy to provide the infrastructure  that  these  two  Ministers
should be providing. I wish we had a memorandum  of  understanding  that  we
could sign, to make sure that he is not transporting males to  the  Northern
Cape, but building roads to where we need them most.

I want to thank all members who have contributed positively to this  debate.
Most of this is incorporated into the speeches that have  been  put  forward
by the acting Chairperson,  the  MECs  and  various  chairpersons  from  the
provinces. Most of them have said everything that I wanted  to  say  -  even
more articulately.

I want to thank the hon Smith from the Northern Cape. Thank  you  very  much
for your encouragement, and it's very good to hear a voice  from  the  past.
The community of Mier that he was referring to is a community for  which  we
built emergency houses in the floods of 2000.  There  are  some  people  out
there who still remember that. We will be back to Mier to make sure that  we
can continue with the good work. We are aware of the backlogs that we  have.
Madam Chair, you will excuse me; in the two hours that I have  been  sitting
here, my cold has come back.

We are aware of the backlog  and  delays,  and  we  are  attending  to  this
matter. The MECs and I have had  the  occasion  to  meet,  and  I  was  very
heartened to find that the MECs are aware of the backlogs.  They  are  aware
of the reasons why we  have  backlogs  and  they  have  already  worked  out
strategies to ensure that these are overcome.

I wanted to respond to the special delegate from Gauteng. He's  so  full  of
enthusiasm and I  was  very  glad  to  hear  about  the  Gauteng  province's
determination that it has put  into  housing,  and  especially  the  support
centres that they have in Diepsloot and Kanana. I am available  to  be  part
of this excitement, together with the excitement that is  generated  by  the
lady from Mpumalanga. She spoke such beautiful SiSwati at the beginning  and
then she diverted into lousy  English.  I  had  hoped  to  hear  her  ukuthi
amatyotyombe ngeSiswati yini [tell me what ``amatyotyombe'' is  in  Siswati]
and all that. But anyway, she preferred English. And I wanted  to  say  that
I'm very available  to  share  in  the  excitement.  I  don't  mind  cutting
ribbons. You can do the work and I'll come and cut ribbons on your behalf.

I wanted to say, though, to the special delegate from Gauteng  that  perhaps
what you should do is to have a special session with  them  on  the  R2  479
savings contributions. There is a reason why we have put  this  contribution
in place and I have enumerated some of the reasons why  we  did  so.  But  I
think perhaps there must have been  something  wrong  in  the  way  that  we
packaged it. We are very willing to repackage it in such away that it is  no
longer misunderstood. There are various ways in which  the  people  that  he
has referred to are exempted from this. These people are the  indigent,  the
very elderly and the disabled. And somehow, if it has not  come  through  to
Gauteng, we are very willing to sit down and  explain  to  them.  Those  who
cannot afford the savings contribution of R2  479  can  instead  give  sweat
equity, we will accept  that  as  a  measure.  But  it's  a  very  important
component of making sure that the stakeholders and  beneficiaries  buy  into
the product, and we are not willing to give it up.  Instead,  we  will  make
sure that we can package it in such a way that all understands it.

The member Panday from  KwaZulu-Natal,  made  a  number  of  very  important
points that I want to deal with. The private sector is steadily getting  out
of the market. It is a pity, but we are dealing with the matter, and  it  is
for  this  reason  that  we  are  seeking  to  empower  the   emerging   BEE
contractors. However, the Housing Consumer Protection Measures Act  of  1998
established the National Home Builders Registration Council,  whose  mandate
it is to deal  with  bad  workmanship  and  structural  defects  in  housing
construction. Its warranty fund provides cover for roof  leaks  for  over  a
period of one year, and for structural  damage  for  over  five  years.  The
council further registers all home builders engaged  in  home  building.  It
further blacklists and deregisters those responsible for bad workmanship  to
the extent that their certificates are withdrawn,  and  they  cannot  access
bridging finance and loans. Without these  certificates  they  are  rendered
basically ineffective, so  the  deregistration  and  blacklisting  that  the
member was talking about has already been taken on board.

I completely agree with hon member Adams, he is actually a  very  articulate
man. He says that a house should be a home where our values  are  inculcated
as a society. I could not have put it better myself. All I can add  is  that
a house should be a  home  where  each  person's  dignity  is  restored  and
protected.

Mzizi, baba, ngingathanda ukuthi mina nawe sihlale  phansi  sikhulume  ukuze
sedlulise lezi zinto eziphakathi kwethu ngoba  ngiyabona  ukuthi  njalo  uma
sihlangene sobabili  siyezwana  kodwa  uma  sifika  lapha  ePhalamende  bese
siyehlukana ngezinto eziningi. [Uhleko.] [Mr Mzizi, I would  like  just  the
two of us to sit down and talk so that we can get  beyond  the  things  that
come between us. From time to time if we  meet  one  on  one,  we  agree  on
things, but when we get  here  to  Parliament  we  differ  on  many  things.
[Laughter.]]

He should be so lucky - not quite in that context.  We  actually  come  from
the same area and I think that we are able to see things in a  similar  way.
But some of the things that he pointed out about the  situation,  especially
in the area that he comes from and with regard to the hostels there, I'm  in
complete agreement with. But I'm very  glad  that  a  member  here  actually
instructed him to sit down so that he could have an  earful  from  him.  So,
that bit has been done on my part.

The ID member, you can be sure  that  the  housing  department  will  be  an
institute of excellence, and I'm glad that you are thinking along  the  same
lines that I am thinking. However, I wanted to say  that  it  might  not  be
important to members here to go and spend three days  under  the  conditions
that you described, because all members of the ANC are familiar  with  those
conditions. That is precisely why we fought so hard to take all  our  people
out of those conditions. [Applause.] Part of  our  extended  families  still
live under those conditions. However, I wouldn't mind making sure  that  you
are monitored under those conditions, so that you can  bring  most  of  your
constituency on board to see where we come from and why we don't want to  go
back there.

Madam Chairperson, thank you very much for your time, I have allowed  myself
to be bribed by Minister Sigcau not to take longer  than  I  should,  and  I
have agreed. Thank you very much for this opportunity. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Thank you, Madam Chair, and I must  thank  you
for the explanation why we had to assemble here at such short notice. I  was
a bit grumpy because it made me miss my doctor's  appointment.  But  I  will
find time for that.

I must say that the overall response to the debate was a positive one,  with
a lot of important lessons and maybe in some cases with instructions  coming
from the various members. And I want to assure the hon members that if  they
have missed out some of the adverts we have  had  for  the  Expanded  Public
Works Programme, or were not aware of them, and although we have been  to  a
number of provinces and municipalities, we will  nevertheless  make  another
round. We actually want to reach everyone.  I have agreed that next week  on
Thursday I'll even talk on the programme when we meet at  some  other  point
in time.

First of all, I want to explain two things. The  whole  issue  of  providing
for people who are disabled is something that is occupying our minds as  the
Department of Public Works. It is occupying our mind to such an extent  that
when you talk of new buildings, we want  people  to  give  consideration  to
making sure that we are user-friendly, and that we  put  up  buildings  that
are going to be user-friendly when used by the  disabled.  In  the  past  we
actually had a programme, in  which  we  targeted  some  of  the  Government
buildings to make sure that some of the entrances were  really  suitable  to
all people in South Africa.

I was amused when Lindiwe was talking about the cutting of  ribbons  because
someone who was trying to be facetious said in the papers that I  have  been
reduced to a Minister who cuts ribbons. And what the person missed was  that
you don't cut a ribbon if you have not delivered on the infrastructure.  So,
I think some people always need to be corrected from time to time.

With regard to the construction industry, I want to make a clarion  call  to
attract our youth back into the industry so that we can give  them  some  of
the stable jobs that exist in the construction  industry.  If  you  remember
from history, any blue-collar type of work was always  posed  or  entrenched
in our minds as given to the other side and that it was only those kids  who
were not brilliant who had to go to some of those schools. But what  we  did
not look at closely was the fact that on the other hand,  the  other  racial
group, which was ruling at the time, was actually  attending  the  technical
colleges.  It is only with this Government that an  emphasis  now  is  being
put  on  the  attendance  of  some  other  institutions  rather   than   the
straightforward universities. It is there that a  broad  base  of  different
types of skills is given to people.

The other issue I want to  emphasise  is  that  at  times  when  we  deliver
speeches, we should listen to what we are saying and  not  simply  stick  to
what we have prepared. And I'm referring now to the remarks that  were  made
by the hon Terreblanche of the DA. She was actually  alluding  to  the  fact
that the people we are going to be targeting in the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme are only the black people. That was what she was alluding to,  and
she was saying that we should pay attention to other racial groups.  But  in
my speech I specifically said the groups  that  we  are  targeting  are  the
unemployed, the unskilled, people not receiving grants, the rural and  urban
poor, people with disabilities and the youth - for about 70%  of  the  youth
are  unemployed  in  this  country.  That  was  straightforward.  That   was
specific. And I think that we should listen more, rather than  to  stick  to
the text when we come here.

Something, which I did not refer to in the  speech,  which  was  not  raised
either, was that we are trying to encourage some of our people not to  stick
to pure construction, but also participate on the supply  side.   A  lot  of
our people really suffered grievously, because they did not have  the  right
equipment even if they got the contracts. And in  a  number  of  cases,  our
people went under because those who have the equipment  were  charging  very
high prices, even for just an ordinary wheelbarrow, let alone a  Caterpillar
machine. We are saying that if people could begin to form consortia to  look
at the supply of equipment, then maybe the problem itself will be solved.

We are also saying that although  we  are  burdened  with  the  question  of
fronting, we are finding answers for it. At one time it was the  scourge  of
the industry. I also want to remind members, especially an  hon  member  who
was talking about a special empowerment for women. If there is one thing  we
have done as women Ministers, it is to make sure that we empower women.  And
fortunately, even our colleagues in  the  other  Ministries  are  doing  the
same,  because  there  is  a  lot  of  gender  sensitivity   right   through
Government. We have heard of women in mining. We  have  heard  of  women  in
agriculture, and we talk abundantly about women in construction. And  in  my
speech I actually referred even to the jobs that we have given to women.  So
we believe that unless all South  Africans  work  together  to  improve  our
country, there will always be gaps in our development.

Finally, I want to come to what was raised by one hon member,  about  issues
to do with HIV/Aids. Maybe we did not refer to this  and  the  member  might
not be aware of our policy. We have an HIV/Aids  policy,  which  deals  with
the training of workers on site, as well an awareness campaign.

Andithi niyazi nani emakhaya kungafika abantu abakhayo, ningekazi nto  ncam,
niya  kubona  abantu  abaphekayo  apho,  ukuze  kuthi  iinyanga   ezilithoba
ezilandelayo nibe senibona amalweyile  phandle.  [Uwelewele.]  Kwasekuqaleni
ke sabona ukuba kufanelekile sibaxelele  ukuba  kufanele  babe  nezi  nkqubo
zokwazisa abantu
nge-HIV/Aids  ngoba  asifuni  kwenzeke  izinto   ezininzi   esingazidingiyo.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[At construction sites, before anybody  knows  exactly  what  is  happening,
there would be people  cooking  and  nine  months  later  napkins  would  be
hanging on washing lines outside. [Interjections.] We  saw  from  the  first
instance that it is important that we introduce the HIV/Aids policy  because
we do not want foolish activities that would yield unwanted results.]

I also want to point out that the Expanded Public  Works  Programme  is  not
introducing  a  two-tier  labour  market.  It  is   actually   involving   a
combination of work experience and training. And if that is  the  case,  the
unemployed people are thus equipped to  find  longer-term  opportunities  in
the economy. I actually liked one of the participants from the  DA.  He  did
give the Minister of Housing some suggestions as to what  he  thought  could
be done, unlike the usual situation of being told that you  are  doing  this
wrong. You are never told what the  other  side  would  do  to  correct  the
situation.

And I think that in future we would ask  opposition  parties  to  come  with
answers at times and not only with criticism  all  the  time.  This  is  our
democratic South Africa, and we want to make sure  that  it  moves  to  very
high levels. Finally, I just want to educate those who choose not to know  -
and I don't think  anyone  doesn't  know.  At  the  Growth  and  Development
Summit, we made a decision as all the participants of Nedlac, which  include
Government, business, labour and civil society. There is a tendency to  say:
``This was a Government decision''. It is true; most  of  the  funding  will
come from Government, because it is going to come from  various  funds.  But
when it comes to the question as to what wages are we going to  give  people
for the programme, that came as a decision  of  the  collective,  where  the
salary will be task-based. And I would implore hon members not  to  try  and
look for a labour-related issue where there is  no  need  to  find  such  an
issue.

Join us, hon members. We will be going out there talking to people  on  what
we call ``construction week'', to tell them about a number of issues  to  do
with the construction industry. We will inform this House on  time  so  that
when we get to a province, we will find all the MPs there and we will  begin
to talk to people as the people from Parliament, and not as  the  individual
Minister, the individual MEC or the individual major. We shall only grow  if
we are united in effort.  Criticise  constructively  or  keep  your  silence
forever. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 13:25.
