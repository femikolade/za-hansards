                            WORLD BLOOD DONOR DAY

                                 (Statement)

The SPEAKER: The next item on the Order Paper is the statement by the hon
Minister of Health, on World Blood Donor Day. Hon members, before the
Minister of Health starts to speak, I wish to inform the House that, by
agreement, there will be no party responses to the statement.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, hon members, thank you very much.
Yesterday was a very special day for our country, South Africa. For the
first time, the world focused on this country as we were hosting the
international event to mark the World Blood Donor Day for the first time in
our country - actually on the continent itself, Africa.

This is the day when the whole world joined in celebrations to honour and
thank those people who donate their blood on a voluntary unpaid basis to
give the most precious gift of all, the gift of life. In South Africa, we
have taken an approach that no tissue, blood or blood products should be
commercialised. Therefore donors form the backbone of our blood transfusion
services and are the source of life for many people who may need blood.
That is why yesterday and today, as a country, we say thank you to all
donors for their unselfish dedication to fellow South Africans. They are
giving a precious gift to people who will probably never know them, but
whose lives will be saved by their donations.

Because of its dedicated donors, South Africa is  proud  of  its  record  in
providing safe blood to those in  need.  We  are  already  experiencing  the
benefits of having a single blood transfusion  service.  This  is  with  the
exception, of course, of the Western Cape, which  we  hope  will  ultimately
come on board and be part of this national asset.

The benefits of having a single national blood transfusion service include,
amongst others, adequate national preparedness in case of national
disasters, sustainability of blood supply, standardisation of quality
criteria, and better funding for research and sharing of national research
outcomes.

The focus of World Blood Donor Day this year is the youth. We need to
encourage the youth of our country, South Africa, to safeguard their health
by caring for a precious life-saver, their blood. School-leavers are
encouraged to enrol in Club 25, a special programme for donors between 18
and 25 years of age. The club helps to establish a donor culture and to
ensure safe blood for transfusion. We are looking for donors that lead
healthy lifestyles and are responsible in their sexual practices. We are
thus looking for low-risk donors who are free of potentially life-
threatening infections that can be transmitted to recipients of their
blood, including HIV, hepatitis viruses, syphilis and malaria.

The testing of donated blood for infections that can be transmitted by
blood is also very essential. But the safest donations come from the safest
donors. A well-organised blood donor programme with a self-exclusion option
based on voluntary blood donation can achieve a low prevalence of HIV among
blood donors, even where there is a high incidence of HIV infection in the
general population.

While we grapple with the challenge of a relatively high prevalence of HIV
in our country, it is, for me and us all, encouraging to note that there is
only 0,04% HIV prevalence among our regular blood donors. As a country, we
have made major efforts to ensure that donated blood is screened for a
variety of infections and to maximise the safety of our blood transfusion
services, especially in the context, as I have said, of course, of HIV and
Aids.

Every second, someone in the world needs blood. These millions of people
owe their lives to people they will never meet, people who donate their
blood freely, without any reward. Unfortunately, many others die every day
because they do not have access to safe blood when they actually need it.

Blood shortage has a particular impact on children with severe life-
threatening anaemia caused by malaria and malnutrition, victims of trauma
and women with complications of pregnancy. A significant number of deaths
can be avoided if everybody has access to a safe supply of this life-saving
resource - the gift of life. This can only be achieved through a
significant increase in the number of people who choose to donate blood
regularly so that blood is always available for patients whose treatment
depends on transfusion.

All blood donors are miracle workers. I want to urge you to encourage your
healthy friends, families and constituencies to become miracle workers as
well. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to lead healthy
lifestyles in order to protect ourselves and keep our blood safe. The
donation of blood is an act of generosity and love. Our Government is
committed to supporting a single blood transfusion service and the supply
of blood to everybody in need of this gift of life. I also donated a pint
of blood yesterday, and I urge members to please donate blood because we
need it. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

                     ELECTORAL COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members, dear friends, I
must thank you for allowing us to present this Bill to you at this stage in
your already busy programme for this current session of Parliament. We
appreciate the understanding we received from everybody, including most of
the political parties who sympathise with our urgent need to bring this
Bill before the House as a result of circumstances over which we had no
control.

The Bill itself is a one-paragraph text that seeks to amend the Electoral
Commission Act, Act 51 of 1996 so as to make provision for the President to
extend the term of office of a member of the commission for a specified
period under certain circumstances, and to provide for matters connected
therewith. This was as a result of the pending expiry of the current term
of certain commissioners within the IEC and the indication by the Chief
Justice that the panel that he convenes, that is responsible for the
appointment of new commissioners, will not have finalised its work by the
time the pending deadline arrives.

Section 7 of the principal Act that deals with the term of office of
members currently does not provide for an extension under circumstances
such as those we are faced with now. We therefore thought it necessary to
effect this amendment. We want to assure hon members that we have been
sensitive to the reality that what we are dealing with here is a Chapter 9
institution, and that is very central to our democracy. Every consideration
has been made to ensure that, as far as possible, the integrity and respect
of these institutions is maintained. We would not hastily bring this
amendment before you, were it not utterly necessary. I therefore present
the Electoral Commission Amendment Bill for consideration by this House. I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M SWART: Madam Speaker, the necessity for extending the tenure of
service of the commissioners of the Electoral Commission we understand. We
do not have a problem with its being extended. The suggestion is that it
should be extended until 30 September, and that is also reasonable.

Unfortunately, however, the situation is that if we accept the Bill or the
amendment as it is presented at the moment, it could be unconstitutional
because the President, or the majority party in Parliament, will be able in
future years to extend the tenure of service of commissioners for any
length of time.

Therefore we feel that the Bill should at the moment be phrased in such a
way that it only allows the extension for a specified period, and that it
will then be finished and that that would be the end of it. Unfortunately,
the DA cannot support the Bill as it stands. Thank you.

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, the ACDP appreciates that the amendment is
necessary since the term of office of the current members of the Electoral
Commission expires on 30 June 2004, and the nomination process and
consequent appointment of members cannot be finalised before that date.

Whilst we understand that the relevant members' term of office will only be
extended for a three-month period, the question arises, since the situation
was foreseeable, why steps were not taken timeously to ensure that the
commission would not be faced with this dilemma.
During discussions in the portfolio committee I suggested that the
amendment should place a limit on the specified period by which a member's
term of office can be extended by adding that that specified period should,
for example, not exceed one year. By leaving the specified period open-
ended, a member of the Electoral Commission could conceivably have his or
her term of office extended by a number of years and could thereafter be re-
appointed for a further term of office. According to the State Law Adviser
such further terms of office would include the term by which that member's
term was extended in accordance with this draft amendment.

That having been said, the ACDP is mindful that the President must act on
the recommendation of the National Assembly in extending a member's term of
office. The ACDP will, in view of the dilemma faced by the Electoral
Commission and in order to resolve this impasse, support this amendment. I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Y WANG: Madam Speaker, as we understand the urgency of the matter, the
ID would like to agree and support the amendment because it is necessary
for us to have a commissioner. We should not have a vacuum at this stage.
However, we should try and avoid this in future and we should put in the
necessary procedures to avoid this kind of oversight. This could have been
avoided, as we had a deadline that was set long before the date. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, firstly, I want to thank the members of the
portfolio committee for the smooth passage of this piece of legislation. I
think it was quite wonderful, while they were working under pressure, that
all parties were able to agree.

As far as the fears of the DA are concerned, I think there is no need for
them to be scared. We are not going to legislate based on what we want to
address now. This is a crisis that we need to address. There is no way that
we can put dates on the Electoral Commission Act, because that would
definitely be out of order. But I understand the fears, obviously. The
member who is new wants to prove to Gibson and everybody that he wants to
drive this thing.

Nevertheless, on Friday we will be passing the resolution of the House. The
resolution of the House is only valid for a period of three months. We do
not want to prolong this thing to a year. If we have it for a year, it will
definitely give us problems. We will only do it for a period of three
months.
At the same time there are parallel situations. The Constitutional Court
judge is busy with another process of nomination. I think you have seen the
advert in the newspaper. The committee is going to appoint new members of
the commission, so you don't have to be scared. This process serves only to
address this problem. We were supposed to have dealt with it during
election time, but there was obviously nobody here. I think we need to
understand that one.

It is surprising that the DA, now that the Minister is  no  longer  the  one
that they wanted, is starting to make a noise. There is no need  to  make  a
noise now. Support the current Minister and let's make sure that  on  Friday
we pass the resolution accordingly. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

 YOUNG PEOPLE CELEBRATING A DECADE OF FREEDOM AND SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES
                                OF DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members, please
allow me to invite the House to join me in wishing our mother, Martha
Mahlangu - Solomon Mahlangu's mother - a happy 81st birthday today.
[Applause.]

I further ask the House to join me in congratulating another leader of our
youth, Fikile Mbalula, who, in February this year, was elected president of
the International Union of Socialist Youth, the largest international youth
organisation, making him the first African president of this organisation
in its 100-year history. [Applause.]

Tomorrow our country and our people shall observe the 28th anniversary of
the 1976 Soweto uprising. As well as commemorating a savage massacre, we
shall focus on the challenges that face young people during this 28th
national Youth Day. It is thus fitting that this august House should hold
this debate on the important occasion on which we are duty-bound to salute
the founders of this memorable day and the millions of youth who kept its
legacy alive. Among them is that youth icon and fiery young lion, Peter
Mokaba, whose second death anniversary we commemorate this year, and whose
roaring chants continue to inspire our generation, commanding all youth to
the front lines of the struggle.
We thank Peter Mokaba and the youth of 1976 for teaching us what it meant
to be youth, a lesson that became invaluable during this past decade as we
grappled with our role as youth during the period of democratic
construction. Because of their extraordinary example, we have had little
difficulty reaching the correct conclusion: that to be youth means to be
activists for fundamental change; providing solutions to all the problems
our people face, free from the fear of what that struggle may entail or
demand. They taught us to always act within the understanding of what our
people see as their very interests, guided by the knowledge and conviction
that our interests as young people, whatever these may be, are similar to
the interests of our people for a better life.

This perspective has continued to influence today's generations of youth,
who have proven that youth apathy is a mere fabrication. And during the
previous general elections they flooded the polls to sign the people's
contract, and refused to be left out because they knew that this people's
contract was in their very best interests. Today, these youth are united
with their people in action to combat poverty, continuing to hold onto the
conviction that youth interests and aspirations are similar to those of our
people as a whole.
Accordingly, during the past 10 years, we have embarked on united youth
action to advance both our interests as well as those of our nation as a
whole. The National Youth Commission, the National Youth Policy, Umsobomvu
Youth Fund, the SA Youth Council and the National Youth Service programme
have all been achieved because of this collective youth action. The
acceptance across our nation today of the need both for youth development
and empowerment, as well as for youth mobilisation, is directly owed to the
united youth action of this past decade. United youth action proved
decisive during the past decade, given that when it began we were still
faced with the stark colonial and apartheid legacy, which had denied black
youth access to quality education, to training, to assets, and basic
income, as it nurtured them for a future of exploitation and oppression.

As a result, by the 80s the youth lacked the very basic means to thrive in
the social and economic system, as was corroborated by the surveys of both
the Community Agency for Social Inquiry, as well as Census 96. Census 96
had found the situation of the youth to be dire, especially in relation to
education levels, job opportunities as well as prospects for quality of
life, especially among the African, female and rural youth. This situation
threw them into the deprivation trap which made them, especially the female
youth, vulnerable and powerless regarding the decisions and choices
pertaining to the quality of their own lives.

The hallmark of the past decade was the attainment and consolidation of
freedom and democracy in our country, which both ushered in immense
political and social changes and unlocked many opportunities that had not
existed for us before to participate in the fields we had never been
exposed to or allowed to participate in, including sport, arts, education,
culture and the media. Today, one can watch home-grown drama on TV and
community arts in community theatres. We can shout for our township boys
playing in cup competitions for big European soccer teams. We can shout for
our neighbourhood girls who are taking on the world in sports, arts and
music; and we can dance to kwaito every weekend.

Freedom has created the opportunities for us to enhance and expand our
knowledge and skills, including through the National Students Financial Aid
Scheme - which has reached about 700 000 historically disadvantaged
tertiary students, and together with affirmative action, has provided
enormous opportunities for a wide spectrum of career choices and
opportunities, resulting in an increasing layer of professionals among the
black youth.

The provision of water, electricity and basic services to millions of
households freed millions of especially rural young women from the burden
of disease, stunted growth and danger as they walked miles on foot to
forests and dams, across dangerous plains, carrying heavy water containers
and loads of wood on their heads.

The creation of the National Youth Commission and Umsobomvu Youth Fund
raised the profile of youth needs, legitimised the youth-focused
development paradigm, and resulted in the integrated youth development
framework and the establishment of an equity fund to expedite skills and
enterprise development among the youth. Today, more than 88 159 young
people have been empowered in one or another Umsobomvu Youth Fund
programme.

Our Government has made it its conscious decision to reverse the legacy of
the past centuries, and has not left this to chance, fate or the logic of
the market forces alone. This is a matter that has been given priority for
the next five years. There are many Government departments that have taken
decisive steps with regard to youth development.

Gradually, the centuries of colonial and apartheid injustices are being
unravelled. But the problem of youth economic marginalisation persists, and
imposes the urgent need to integrate them into the mainstream productive
economy. Accordingly, the mass organisations of the youth must be
strengthened at all levels and we must raise their capacity and impart to
the youth the necessary skills for them to carry out their tasks as the
shock troops of the people's contract against poverty.

As we enter this decisive period ahead, we must aim for and achieve the
greatest possible mobilisation, organisation and united action among the
youth of our country. The difficult challenges posed by the Second Economy
constitute a real possibility that we can unite our youth in action into a
people's contract in pursuit of our common interests and destiny through
adhering to the dialectical principle of youth mobilisation for youth
development, and youth development for youth mobilisation. This will
require that we continue to support and strengthen the capacities of youth
development agencies, the National Youth Commission and the SA Youth
Council as well as the Umsobomvu Youth Fund.

At the core of the effort to raise the capacity of the youth is the
question of raising their skills levels. In this regard, we must continue
to prioritise the National Youth Service programme. And I am happy to say
that there is very concrete progress on this matter and the youth are going
to see concrete outcomes through co-operation between the National Youth
Commission and the Umsobomvu Youth Fund, which will make it possible to
advance speedily.

Working with Government, youth and student organisations must meet the
obligation to create the graduate register about which the President spoke
on 21 May. We must continue to work with the Government to ensure that the
Setas realise the targets set by the Growth and Development Summit for the
recruitment of 72 000 learners this year, 98% of whom must be below 35
years of age.

Various Government departments, including state-owned enterprises, must be
encouraged to meet their learnership and internship challenges and
obligations. The National Students Financial Aid Scheme needs to be
reviewed to eliminate the current problems that result in many black
students facing many serious problems, including financial exclusion,
inaccessibility of the scheme, as well as blacklisting.

We must also consider how we can, as a matter of urgency, utilise the
Expanded Public Works Programme to provide social alternatives to young
people such as those at Imizamo Yethu, who are without multifaceted sports
and community centres so that after school or during weekends they have no
alternative social activities, which makes them vulnerable to crime. At the
same time, we must explore the possibility of mobilising resources from the
Expanded Public Works Programme to recapitalise historically African
tertiary institutions in order to raise them to a level worthy of tertiary
learning, equal with their formerly white counterparts.

The challenge that we will face increasingly this year is to move beyond
rhetoric to practical and concrete action plans with regard to youth
economic empowerment through, amongst others, developing concrete plans to
raise the capacity of the youth to seize the opportunities that will be
presented by the Apex Fund, the National Empowerment Fund and other BEE
funds and programmes, as well as the empowerment charters and through
direct youth participation in the BEE Advisory Council.

Amongst other things, young people complain that they lack access to micro
credit in order to breathe life into their initiatives. Many even find it
difficult to access the Umsobomvu Youth Fund and complain that they lack
information about it, that they lack sufficient access to its services and
that they find it difficult to comply with its requirements - which they
often find stringent. Obviously, we must deal with this matter
comprehensively. These issues are as important to the youth of our country
as they are to the nation as a whole. We call on our nation to engage in
united action, together with young people, to ensure that we raise the
competencies and capacities of the youth so that they can be able to fulfil
their historical duty at the head of our processes of transformation.

The matters of youth development, which this 28th anniversary of the June
16 uprising is faced with, are matters that are critical to the
sustainability of our development. Our prayer today is that this august
House will continue to pay urgent and close attention to youth development
and empowerment, given its vital importance to the sustainable development
of our country, indeed, to inspire the youth. Thank you, Madam Speaker.
[Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, members of the executive, those that are here
- I just note that the Minister responsible for youth in the Presidency,
Minister Essop Pahad, is not here today - colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
it is a particular honour and privilege for me to participate in this
debate today.

You see, Madam Speaker, 10 years ago I was part of the broad movement of
youth who paralleled our senior negotiators to discuss the future role and
empowerment of our youth in what would become the new South Africa.

It was an exciting time, characterised by debates in bilaterals,
multilaterals and broad fora. It was a time when we all made our
contribution towards a negotiated settlement that we hoped would bring
about a real change in the quality of life and status of our youth. It was
certainly a breath of fresh air to confront our common challenges, instead
of confronting each other as we did in the 1980s and previous decades.

Some of the youth leaders of that era are here today, in this very House
and in the executive. It is that time of the political year, once again,
when we take stock of much of the progress that we have made since we last
celebrated the Youth Day. But, this year we also need to assess our
achievements and failures over the past 10 years of democracy and look
forward to the challenges that face us over the next decade.

I would, therefore, say that this institution, Parliament, has to its
benefit the collective memories, knowledge and experience of some of the
key role-players in the youth development sector that characterised the
early 1990s in particular.

Much of the debate of that era was defined by the seminal work done by Dr
Frederick van Zyl Slabbert on an institutional framework and strategy that
would facilitate youth development in the new South Africa. To a large
extent, the debate then also focused on what some referred to as the ``lost
generation''.

That era was concluded by a broad consensus that a mechanism needed to be
located in the highest chambers of decision-making to deal with the
challenges so well-documented by the works of Van Zyl Slabbert, people such
as Helen Zille, who convened and facilitated youth development fora in the
Western Cape, and organisations such as the Community Agency for Social
Inquiry. This led to the establishment of institutions such as the National
Youth Commission, the SA Youth Council and the Umsobomvu Youth Fund.

These works collectively establish a benchmark against which we, today, can
conduct a comparative analysis of the quality of life and the status of our
youth 10 years since our new nation's negotiators gave birth to our
democracy.

It is with this yardstick that I, today, wish to declare that although we
should celebrate, there is, to all intents and purposes, a mechanism to
facilitate youth development that is in fact located in the highest
decision-making chambers of our new nation, the form and modus operandi of
the National Youth Commission and its inter-related structures require some
streamlining.

Preceding the recent general election, many televised debates focused on
the youth vote and solicited comment from the youth representatives from
various organisations across the spectrum of civil society. Each of those
televised programmes left one with the distinct impression that the youth,
outside of the DA's youth movement, were disappointed, even angry, at the
lack of progress with Government's youth development strategy and
mechanisms. And I think the Deputy Minister also referred to the angst out
there as well.

Most participants on those and other platforms of debate clearly
communicated this, that notwithstanding the efforts of Government, they
felt as marginalised, disempowered and lost as previous generations of
youth in South Africa.

This, I dare say, can be one of the major reasons why I disagree with the
previous speaker that there has been a drop in votes for the governing
party. Although there has been an increase in votes for the DA, I would,
nevertheless, say that no one has gained from the stay-away youth vote. We
must all grasp and heed this important message from our nation's youth.

So where are the youthful voters, where have they gone? And it is clear
that they have, to some extent, disengaged from participation in our
political youth structures and in the processes of our young democracy in
general.

Many have joined religious, cultural and sports organisations to find new
forms of expression and empowerment. But many youth, black and white, have
also simply sought to escape the painful realities of their disempowerment
by staring at the world that confronts them through the bottom of a bottle.
Many, too, have started to experiment with very destructive substances such
as ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, crystal meth, better known as ``tik'' and blue
ice. Some have, as a direct or indirect consequence of their
disempowerment, resorted to crime, especially gangsterism, to survive or to
simply sustain their means of escape.

I believe substance abuse is reaching such pandemic proportions that the
pool of youth leaders who must surely take over from us is becoming ever
smaller. From anecdotal evidence alone and some knowledge of the work being
done by NGOs and community-based organisations, I believe that this matter
warrants a special investigation by this House.

I therefore call upon you, Madam Speaker, to convene a special or ad hoc
committee that would urgently conduct public hearings and receive input on
the extent, causes and effects of the abuse of all manner of substances by
our youth.
Lest we forget, our collective failure, and that of Government in
particular, to deal with the scourge of drug dealing will in all likelihood
give impetus to the resurgence of militant vigilantism like we have never
seen before. It is foreseeable that such community-driven action would be
even worse than that which we saw in the mid-1990s.

For the common destiny of our country, every effort that we make here and
in the next 10 years must be focused on the legacy that we want and need to
leave for the next generation. As we celebrate Youth Day tomorrow, I ask
everyone in this House and all our youth out there to enjoy the day by
having good, clean fun. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B W DHLAMINI: Madam Speaker and hon members, young people today are
growing up in the light of human rights culture and not in the shadow of
prejudice and discrimination. Great progress has been made over the past
decade in inculcating in our young people a spirit of tolerance, a
generosity of spirit and a willingness to comprehend otherness.

Young people have a fresh canvass on which to paint their futures in
colourful bold strokes. We have been fortunate in that we have been led by
a dazzling wealth of icons, women and men who have embodied the spirit of
freedom and democracy, such as Nelson Mandela, Helen Suzman, Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu.

We can boast of Mark Shuttleworth, Africa's first astronaut in space, and
before the age of 30. We are inspired by the rugby players, Francois
Pienaar and Breyton Paulse. At the cricket crease, there is Graeme Smith
and Makhaya Ntini. On the soccer field, we have Lucas Radebe and Benni
McCarthy, to name just a few. In the arts, though she has slipped off the
mortal coil, we would not stop dancing to the music of irrepressible Brenda
Fassie. And the writer, Mongane Wally Serote, will continue, I am sure, to
absorb us with the elegance and rhyme of his prose.

We also know that for many young people the first decade of democracy has
not reaped such a rich harvest. According to the Child Rights Organisation,
many people live in conditions where their rights are threatened. HIV and
Aids is without doubt the biggest threat to our freedom and democracy. The
disease mows down our youth by their thousands and each week and often
children are left to head their families. Many families cannot afford to
send their children to decent schools. Other young people are refugees
fleeing war-torn regions.

In this regard, Madam Speaker, allow me to make just two more points in the
few minutes I have. Firstly, our elderly statesmen and women had laid the
foundation for peace, but it is for today's young people to take forward
the process of nation-building and reconciliation. The task of national
unity is still a work in progress. In this regard, I am personally and
particularly concerned about the completion of the process of
reconciliation between the ANC and IFP.

The other point I would like to make is that the Constitution of our
country provides that everyone has a right to basic education. We have
still to define what we mean by "basic". I believe that the promise of
democracy and freedom means very little when our youth do not have access
to a decent education as it was spelled out by the hon Deputy Minister. It
is my fervent hope that we use the occasion of the first decade of
democracy to ensure that all young people are provided with an education.
It is after all, the best gift we can give to them.

The IFP urges the youth of South Africa to take advantage of life and
handsome opportunities provided by these opportunities of democracy, so
that they can truly realise their full potential and God-given rights. This
they should do as a tribute to those young brave women and men of 1976. The
youth of 1976 lit the liberation torch. It is up to this generation to
shine the light, and I thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, hon Kekana will speak briefly from the podium,
but another hon member will complete his speech, as there is some problem
with the Braille reading. [Applause.]

Mr C D KEKANA: Madam Speaker, I will be following in the footsteps of the
previous speaker who celebrated the Soweto student uprising. I'm just going
to highlight, like you have said, a few key points that appear in my
speech, and Oupa Monareng is going to do the actual presentation.

The first thing in the speech I want to highlight is my salute the
leadership of the student uprising, people like Tsietsi Mashinini, who was
our first president of the Soweto Student Representative Council (SSRC),
Dan Montsisi, Merfurson Merowe and the most famous, Hector Petersen, who
died on the day of the riots.

The speech thereafter gives the background to why there was that student
uprising. It is just a reminder, because I'm sure that most of you are
familiar with the details. It mentions that the uprising actually took
place as an anger articulated by black people and black students against
white domination. And it explains what is meant by white domination. It
means economic domination, because the financial institutions, the industry
and commerce were then almost exclusively dominated by whites.

It also means political domination. The then government denied blacks
franchise rights and the whole administration was actually either
controlled or managed exclusively by whites. This resulted in anger. This
was the anger that was articulated by the youth of 1976 when they rose. It
wasn't merely a matter of turning against Afrikaans, but all this
culminated to anger the youth to take a stand against white domination.

The speech goes further by saying that we celebrate that role played by the
youth that was positive, because it brought about the transformation of the
sociopolitical system in South Africa. However, the people complain about
the economic sector, because they feel that the economic structures are
still predominantly owned by whites. And the speech says that it hopes that
through our political system, because we as parents need to guide our
youth, we can bring about economic transformation by means of bringing
about black empowerment and job creation in this country. It is also
mentioned in the speech that it is hoped that that will happen without
another youth revolt to transform the economy.

The speech is about the analogy that existed between the formation of the
ANC in 1944, when Mandela and Tambo contributed to that formation of the
youth league; and it draws an analogy with the Soweto student riots,
because while the formation of the ANC Youth League revitalised the ANC in
terms of giving it militancy and fresh blood, that actually took the ANC to
higher political levels, for example the defiance campaigns in the fifties
and the formation of uMkhonto weSizwe, the military wing of the ANC in the
1960s. The same happened with the Soweto riots. It actually revitalised the
liberation struggle in South Africa, because a lot of activists that were
there during 1976 re-emerged and resurfaced in the ANC and its military
wing. Here we mention a few names, like Solomon Mahlangu, who was the first
MK cadre to die after coming back to the country to fight. He was a product
of 1976 and a hero. He went underground and resurfaced in the ANC. It is
said that the youth then revitalised the liberation struggle in the
seventies and the eighties with the young lions to the extent that we can
ultimately celebrate our liberation today.

I'm now going to give over to Oupa Monareng to take you through the speech.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr O E MONARENG: Madam Speaker, for purposes of the record, I will just
read the speech as it is: We celebrate and pay tribute to the youth of
South Africa as led by fearless fighters like Tsietsi Mashinini, Dan
Montsisi, Merfurson Merowe and a world-known hero, Hector Petersen. Tribute
is due to the youth of 16 June, year of fire and year of ash. The youth,
through burning, were expressing black anger against white domination, in
the form of political hegemony, economic exploitation, social segregation
and brute force.

Soweto, a town not appearing on most maps by then, was to find itself as
focus of international media. Its then population of 1,3 million served
half a million whites as labourers in their homes, shops and factories. The
youth's revolt ventilated in terms of black anger, which in fact was an
articulation of the basic truth about South Africa where capital and
finance were exclusively under white control. Industry and commerce were
almost entirely owned and managed by whites. Parliament and its
institutions were reserved for whites, and all major bodies of the state
were either exclusively managed or controlled by white personnel.

Ever since the period of the Soweto youth revolt, our own society has
undergone some of the most profound changes. The ushering in of the new
democracy in 1994, and the transformation of the state and its apparatus
are such changes in the political system. The future challenges of our
youth are in ways completely foreign to their predecessors. Yet it is the
responsibility of the adult society, that is us who govern and other
emerging establishments, to assist the youth in responding positively to
the challenges of the future. Youth faces an uncharted terrain, and adults
have to provide the trail maps.

In 1976 South Africa's youth took the centre stage and remained there
throughout the unrest and strife of the eighties. Many youths who took part
in the 1976 - uprising went underground due to state suppression, only to
resurface in the gallant organisation of the people, the ANC and its
military wing uMkhonto weSizwe, and Solomon Mahlangu is an example.

The youth uprising of 1976 and its offshoots into the 1980s have resulted
in a range of sociopolitical activities. The activities had at least two
major effects on the South African society: Positively it helped to
engineer sociopolitical transformation through contributing to the
liberation struggle, and yet negatively, it caused a lost generation which
is unruly, ill-disciplined and involved in crimes such as using and dealing
in drugs, car hi-jacking, juvenile delinquency and many other social
maladjustments.

Today we celebrate a decade of liberation and the youth can seize the
opportunities mentioned in the President's state of the nation address,
which has provided for various youth developmental avenues, like the
Learnership National Project and the Umsobomvu Youth Project. We once more
pay tribute to the youth that contributed positively to the sociopolitical
transformation, and we trust the economic transformation will take place in
terms of black empowerment, that is black ownership and job creation.
The SPEAKER: Happy birthday.

Mr L W GREYLING: Thank you. That means that I was only three years old when
the tragic events of the Soweto uprisings took place. I was obviously too
young at that stage to realise the significance of that event for our
country's history, but when I went to vote for the first time in the
elections of 1994 I was very aware of the role that those students had
played in bringing our country to democracy.

I was also aware that what they did was to galvanise the world's opinion as
to the horrendous nature of the apartheid state. What it also showed,
however, was that those students felt outraged over their freedom of
thought being oppressed. This is a vivid lesson for us in South Africa in
that we have to allow freedom of expression of the youth and we should
never prevent them from playing the important role of watchdogs of our new
democracy.

It is often said that the young people are our future, but we in the ID
also believe that they are our present. They are leaders in many important
spheres in our society. They are showing the ideals of racial integration
and reconciliation. They are bringing these ideals into being every day
and, in many respects, are in fact leading us in the way that this should
occur. Young people also possess an amazing optimism and thrive on critical
debate. These are values that we need to ensure are enshrined in this
House, or otherwise we run the risk of alienating the young people from our
political landscape.

It is also an unfortunate reality that many young people in our land are
not given the opportunity to truly be young. From a very young age they
have to confront issues such as poverty, unemployment, HIV/Aids and crime.
It is our duty as people in the House to ensure that young people are
protected from these scourges so that they can develop the optimism and the
creativity to bring forward the new society we all dream of.

As a young member of Parliament and of a young and growing political party,
the ID, I was ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Belated happy birthday.

Ms C B JOHNSON: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, whilst I was
preparing for the address, I asked myself whether Youth Day was something
to be celebrated by our youth in particular, or whether it was to be
celebrated by all of us as nation? The second question I asked myself -
this being the more personal question because I, too, like the hon Greyling
am 31 years old, and I do make full and frank disclosure to the House - was
whether I as a 31-year-old could even still be speaking on behalf of our
youth. This is because those of us who are today in our early and mid-
thirties grew up in a different world from that of the youth of today. The
best way, in fact the only way, for me to try to explain the importance of
celebrating Youth Day is to try to strike a comparison between my
generation, those of us in our early and mid-thirties, and the generation
who are now in high school and at university.

They, the youth of today - those in high school and at university at
present - will never have to use one entrance at the Post Office, while
their friends have to use another. They will never have to see their
international sporting teams having bags of flour hurled at them on a rugby
field, because they are not welcome to compete internationally. They will
never really have to know the difference between a Casspir, a ``Ratel'' and
a ``Buffel''. They will never have to ask their parents what exactly a
state of emergency is. And they will never have to live in a country that
is at war with itself.

So, whilst there may not be decades of difference in the years between us,
we - that is my generation - lived in a different world. The defining
difference is our democracy and the freedom that that democracy has brought
us, a democracy which brings with it all the opportunities and all the
promises of hope.

So while we celebrate tomorrow, let those of us who are old enough to
remember, never forget. Let those of us who are too young to remember,
build and strengthen that democracy that we were born into. Let all of us
as a nation celebrate Youth Day and celebrate what we have achieved, and
let us celebrate with pride and gratitude. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

[Legofi.] (Translation of Tswana speech follows.)

[Mrs M S MAINE: Mr Chairperson and hon member, there is no way in which we
can ever forget the past 28 years. June 16 will always be with us and our
following generations. For some it does not mean anything, but for us, as
parents, it is as though it happened yesterday.

Before and after that day, the ANC never left its youth behind. We learned
from the words of the late Comrade Oliver Tambo, who said, and I quote: ``A
nation that does not invest in its children is a lost nation''. Therefore,
all the investments that we make are aimed at building up our youth and
their future.

We have a responsibility as parents not to leave our children behind, but
to love them, to support them and to teach them. As parents we must not be
dictators who cannot tolerate contradiction. Let our children be our
friends. A parent who is feared by the children is a parent who is not
respected. Our children should respect us, not fear us.

We need to do this because the ANC, as the Government, sees to it that all
its departments provide for the training of our youth in their programmes
in order to ensure a better future for them. We, as parents, must see to it
that our children pull up their socks and, furthermore, that they do not
miss the opportunities when they are presented to them. The challenge
facing you, children, is enormous indeed and therefore we simply cannot
tolerate laziness. You must get up and roll up your sleeves, children. The
youth leadership is doing its best, but my worry is that they were not
aware of the magnitude of the problems facing the youth in this country.
Nobody gave them the statistics that correctly reflect the problems facing
the youth because, in the past, the focus was only on a small minority.
Most of our youth are not qualified and most of them lack experience. Most
of them are unemployed and live in abject poverty, and most of them have
been infected by the HIV/Aids virus.

The Government is doing its best to minimise the problems facing the youth.
It has even initiated programmes that target them. Our children are better
educated than us because they are taught about sex-related issues.
Therefore, they must ensure that they avoid unsafe sex. The Government is
working hard to ensure that there is ongoing education in this regard.
There is therefore no need to have young people who are still wearing the
blanket of ignorance. The increasing number of youth who are being infected
by this virus clearly indicates how careless they still are.

We therefore appeal to youth leaders and to those who are with us in
Government, to understand that their work and our work is to ensure that
the youth are better looked after than was the case in the past and to
ensure that they look after themselves. Drug abuse is something that is
troubling us greatly as parents and as Government. How is it possible, with
such a high rate of unemployment, with the current drought, with these
horrible deaths, that there is such a large number of youth who are
addicted to drugs? Is it because the drug dealers are paying high salaries
to our youth?

Our children must understand that we are looking forward with great
expectations to those who have achieved their dreams, to those who have
dreams and are following them and to those who are studying hard so that
they may teach others, to government departments that have programmes that
are aimed at training and encouraging the youth to build themselves up and
to improve the economy.

South Africa is one of the few countries that is working hard to see to it
that its youth are able to improve their lives and that they do not end up
living in poverty like their parents. They must work hard in order to grasp
the opportunities that are offered to them.

The problems facing the youth will not be resolved overnight. However, we
must see to it that our children ...

Work hard, oh children. We are with you. Mothers, let us rise up and teach
our daughters that we are not meant to just bear children and cook for the
men, as was the belief in the past. We are now the leaders. Walk tall, my
daughters, and refuse to have sex without condoms.

There is the torch, oh youth. The government has put it on top of the wall.
Grab it and run with it around Africa. Before you can do that, however, do
it first at home, which is South Africa. I have a short poem that I have
written for the youth. It goes like this:

Baswa ba Afrika
ba lo ntlheng ya Borwa,
iphomoleng dikgapa,
le tsholetse difatlhego.
Moporesidente Mbeki o a le laletsa,

Mr M S KHUMALO: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, as the 400th member of
the National Assembly and the seventh member of the ACDP, I sincerely thank
the almighty God, the review process of the election system and the growing
ACDP for the opportunity to serve in this House.

The youth of 1976 was tired of Bantu education and wanted transformation
and change in the areas of politics and education. The bravery they showed
in taking the risk meant imprisonment, torture, even death to some. Others
did find God in the midst of the 1976 situation and were given reassuring
hope. That reassuring hope sustained them in their determination.

The youth of 1976 wanted a better society and they did not envisage the
arrival of HIV/Aids and condoms. The youth of today are dying at an
unparalleled rate because of HIV/Aids and Government's response has been to
increase spending on condoms and to plough large amounts of money into
LoveLife programmes.

The infected and dying youth must be saved at all cost. On a positive note,
we were delighted to see the national Minister of Health joining the youth
recently in an abstinence walk organised by the Durban Christian Centre.

We as the ACDP propose that there should be an increase of internship
programmes in all departments of Government, because of youth unemployment
and students who have been blacklisted for unpaid university fees.

We propose an integrated workplan for national youth commissions. There
should be a way of including youth in matters of ethics and public and
community morality programmes. I thank you. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon member! We appreciate the fact that
you started working before you were sworn in.

Dr C P MULDER: Agb Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, een van die lede van die
Gautengse wetgewer ... [Hon Deputy Speaker, one of the members of the
Gauteng legislature ...]

An MEC from the Gauteng legislature, last week, basically asked and
appealed that all communities should participate in Youth Day celebrations
tomorrow. She only had to listen to the speeches of the hon Deputy Minister
Gigaba and Mr Kekana to know why all sectors of the community do not
necessarily participate the way they would like them to.

Ek het baie lanklaas `n toespraak in dié Huis gehoor waar daar soveel keer
gesê word: ``blacks and whites, blacks and whites; whites and blacks''. [It
has been a long time since I've heard a speech in this House in which there
were so many references to ``blacks and whites, blacks and whites; whites
and blacks''.]

What's happened to the rainbow nation? Only blacks and whites, whites and
blacks - all the time. [Interjections.]

The fact of the matter is that this Constitution makes provision for 11
official languages. Why? Because there are different communities in this
country, and the different communities also have youth as part of their
communities. It is time for the ANC to understand and realise that all the
youth do not belong to the ANC. All the youth do not support the ANC.
[Interjections.] All the youth are not members of the ANC Youth League;
they belong to different communities.

As long as we continue to have 16 June as a celebration of the 1976 events,
you will not succeed in taking Youth Day forward and making it something
that everybody would like to celebrate.

In your own Freedom Charter it specifically says: South Africa belongs to
all who live in it. But, when it comes to these kinds of events it is ANC,
ANC, ANC. One-sided all along, no wonder it is not a success.

The hon Gigaba referred to all these things; the youth should be the storm
troopers of the people's contract. The youth is not an organ of state, the
youth does not belong to the ANC, and they do not belong to the ANC Youth
League. [Interjections.]

The fact of the matter is that the youth ... One day, maybe one day, you
will start to realise that the future is important, and not only the past.
Look to the future, and then you will try to find a solution for South
Africa's problems. As long as you are only looking back, back, back you
will not have a success in this country. [Interjections.] It's time to turn
to the future, change your ways and become wise. Thank you. [Time expired.]

[Mr B E PULE: Hon Speaker, the greatest gift we are given as a nation is
our children. Therefore, we are faced with a great challenge of bringing
them up to be future adults and leaders. We were quite right as a nation
that a day of the year was chosen in their honour to show their importance.
 Hon Speaker, I would like our youth to realise that on June 16 1976
history was made by their elders, but not by them. Their elders were faced
by the challenge of that time of instructional language in school subjects.
Our youth have to face the challenge of today, which is the HIV/Aids
pandemic. We have to make our youth aware of how careful to use their
rights responsibly, otherwise they will all be wiped out, so that
eventually we do not have future nation. A scientist once said, and I
quote:

   It is quite easy to dodge your responsibilities, but not easy to dodge
   the consequences of dodging those responsibilities.

Let our children realise this. Another challenge is that they need to  build
themselves, and to accept farms where they can  practice  stock  farming  or
anything to farm with in order to reduce unemployment. A lot of land is  not
used. Therefore our youth need to preserve the  land  and  use  it  properly
because it is theirs.  The youth have to prove themselves now  as  they  are
our future leaders, because time and tide wait for no man.

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! Malibongwe! [Praise! Praise!] [Interjections.]

Ms N R MOKOTO: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, and the members in the
public gallery, I feel very privileged and honoured to address this House
on the eve of the most historic day in the lives of young people across the
length and breadth of our country.

For many young people this opportunity will have remained as nothing but a
dream that will never be realised. Indeed, we have to commend the ANC-led
Government for having prioritised placing their hopes on the young people
of this country.

Please allow me to take this House on a brief stroll down memory lane.
Tomorrow, twenty-eight years ago in South Africa our youth made a clarion
call to all South Africans to take a firm stand and commitment to fight
against the oppressive apartheid regime.

Young and vulnerable as they were, they decided that enough was enough with
the fascist nationalist regime. They swapped all they had - their lives and
a bright future - for a not-so-desirable mission to liberate their own
country from the colonialists. Many of those heroes and heroines will
continue to paint a colourful history in our liberation struggle.

In the same spirit of 1976, and the subsequent years, we continued our call
to all young South Africans to show high levels of patriotism and national
unity by being active in the reconstruction and development of our country
and our continent.

We must remember that the crucial role played by our youth in the struggle
for freedom and democracy shall never go unnoticed. I want to challenge the
historians that this national youth effort also deserves to be objectively
recorded in the history books of our country.

It is totally unacceptable and unreasonable that today the critical element
of our national struggle continues to be relegated to insignificant
references and by-the-way statements. Young people in South Africa are
close to 11 million, and this makes up more than a quarter of the total
population of this country. However, they remain the most marginalised
sector within our economy. They have continued to serve as secondary
players and consumers of the produce of our economy instead of being policy
and decision-makers in our economy. Of course, young people do have the
capacity to lead when given an opportunity.

On many occasions, because of the circumstances they face, young people
have been forced to take mature decisions at early stages of their lives.
Many of them had to abandon schooling to fend for their families, started
engaging in prostitution in an attempt to escape poverty, and entered the
unskilled labour market before their time.

This is the legacy that will continue to haunt them for many years to come,
because the concept of youth empowerment and development has been
restricted to aspects of arts and culture, sports, recreation and
education, if not located within the broader programme of national
development.

It has been indicated that the situation of the youth in this country is a
depiction of the abnormal society they are growing up in. Historically, our
economy was designed to deliberately marginalise youth from being active
role-players and beneficiaries to the outputs and inputs of our mainstream
economy, except for providing a pool of cheap and unskilled labour.

High levels of unemployment in this country are as a result of the problems
of the first and second economies, which still exist in South Africa. The
RDP recognises the status of the youth in this economy and further
highlights that there is a need to ameliorate this situation. On the other
side, the RDP states that the programmes on youth should not be seen as job
- creation measures, but as youth development and capacity - building.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Deputy Speaker, the PAC advocates free education for
our youth. Education is a weapon that no one should be without in the
modern world. It is the key to success. On this 20th anniversary of the
Soweto uprising, Youth Day, let us arm our youth with knowledge, so that
they can become skilled to make the riches of our country work for us. Our
youth is determined to seize the opportunity of democracy but their main
weapon for success in their endeavours is education.

I will base my presentation on what some of the youth are saying in 2004.
This must be taken seriously, because two days ago an SABC programme survey
showed that 59% of the youth said that they have not benefited from the ten
years of democracy. Maxwell Nqeno in Gauteng said that, in schools around
Soweto, learners are constantly locked out of schools for not having a
school uniform. The uniform issue affects all school children, especially
those who live in mikhukhus, or informal settlements. They are forced to
move house every year as a result of, amongst other things, forced removals
and fires. This means changing schools and changing uniforms. Xolane
Tsalong said that, in a country where half of the population lives under
the poverty line, it is anyone's guess where poor and working class people
will find the money for school fees, uniforms etc. Is this not the sad fact
that quality education is only for the rich?

David Lukhelo of the Vaal said that some young people drop out of school
and register with employment agencies that promise them the chance of
travelling around the world, but that they only end up being employed as
drug couriers and pushers. [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Malibongwe! Igama la Makhosikazi! Thank you, Madam Deputy
Speaker and colleagues. Today, when a little South African is born - black,
white, Indian or coloured - he or she is born free and with rights
protected and upheld by the national Constitution of the Republic of South
Africa. This is a very important document. It governs as the supreme law of
South Africa and contains the Bill of Rights that constitutes laws of human
rights, making us a democracy that guarantees equality and freedom.
Today our children are saved from the horrors of apartheid, but some
stories still highlight the hardships endured by the people. Our ten years
of democracy has erased these horrors from society and our able Government,
elected by the people for the people, has worked hard to correct the
injustices of the past, alleviate poverty and promote social development.
These efforts rotate around securing a better future for all, including our
youth.

The Minority Front supports the development and intense advancement of our
youth in terms of educating and equipping them with the right they have
earned from birth. It is sad to note that so many of our prisons are filled
with juvenile delinquents, which is a direct depiction of how many of our
young people are involved in crime. The MF calls for the inclusion of our
youth in programmes that would help them deviate from criminal activities.
As easily as they are enticed into crime, we need to entice them into
celebrating life, their freedom and potential.

HIV/Aids education and prevention is another great matter of concern and it
is our responsibility to ensure that our youth is on the right track and
that we mould them into the future leaders of this democracy. An
appreciation of our freedom and rights needs to be instilled in our youth
to ensure that South Africa never returns to apartheid. The MF has faith in
our youth, because they are the future leaders of South Africa. [Time
expired.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, as we celebrate the victory of
the youth of 1976, I just want to pause and pay tribute to a gallant
fighter, Dr Gomolemo Mokae, who is at present in hospital. He has played
his role as a doctor and also as an artist in the struggle for our people.
I want him to know that we are thinking of him here in Parliament and that
we wish him a speedy recovery. The importance of this occasion is that not
only do we remember those who sacrificed their lives for all of us, but we
also pay tribute to their selfless dedication to the noble goal of
liberating the people of our land.

As we celebrate our victory over evil and an oppressive system, we must
also take note of those amongst us who, if given a chance, would like us to
return to the past. All of us who love freedom have no choice but to
continue with our revolutionary task by making sure that what the youth of
1976 started is completed. Thus, in our determination to transform our
society, we should not leave the youth behind.
At the same time we should note that no person who is a by-product of a
colonial culture, whose moral conduct is moulded in a way of life that is
foreign to Africa, and who through selfish aspirations and inhuman
behaviour lives by all values alien to Africa, should be allowed to pursue
these goals on a continent that wants to get rid of colonial and other
forms of oppression. [Applause.] Azapo recognises that the youth is an
important component of our society and we are of the view that the youth
should be nurtured into future upholders of the values and norms of our
society. [Time expired.]

speech follows.)

[Mr M M SWATHE: Madam Deputy Speaker, and hon members of Parliament, we
would like to thank the Government for its efforts in uplifting the youth
of South Africa, although the youth are still not convinced that they will
enjoy freedom and its fruits.

Regarding the expectations of the rural youth, or the vision of the rural
youth, the rural youth are the ones who are most disadvantaged because for
them freedom, prosperity and development programmes are things that they
just hear about. These are mere dreams as far as they are concerned,
because they are concerned about the following. They are concerned about
unemployment which makes it difficult for young school leavers, who are
educated at great cost, to join the job market. This is a great concern for
our nation. This is also a very serious concern for the uneducated youth.
They then resort to alcohol, sex and drugs.

Poverty is another challenge facing our nation. It is difficult to sit back
and relax while poverty is rampant. The youth then get involved in criminal
activities in an attempt to improve their lives.

As for lack of development, the youth migrate to the urban areas where they
live in shacks. This is because they do not see any development in their
own areas.

Regarding basic services, the youth become disillusioned when they do not
access the services that were promised to them because they had hoped that
democracy would make a great difference in their lives.

As far as transport is concerned, the youth still have to walk long
distances to town, sometimes using donkeys and oxen. This is a clear
indication that the youth still have a long way to go to achieve their
freedom. It is too early to expect the youth to be excited by freedom and
its fruits. Freedom without food, aid and the equal treatment of all young
people, is nothing. We support every effort that gives the youth education,
self-confidence and equality. We propose that municipalities be authorised
to nominate young people from different political parties to drive
provincial youth programmes, because that will satisfy the youth and make
them more enthusiastic about democracy and let them feel that they are part
of the nation.

We would like to point out unequivocally that,  as  the  youth,  we  welcome
democracy and we appeal to the Government  to  continue  with  what  it  has
already started in connection with the youth, educating  them  and  training
them, because in the rural areas, where I come from, HIV/Aids is  decimating
the nation. During the past ten years of democracy, many young  people  have
died at Mokopane, my village, as well as in the  neighbouring  villages.  We
as  the  South  African  nation,  must  take  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic   very
seriously, monitoring it and teaching  our  youth  how  to  avoid  it.  This
clearly indicates that we still have a long  way  to  go  before  we  really
enjoy our democracy. Currently, not everybody is happy. Only  a  quarter  of
the people are happy. Thank you. [Time expired.]]

Ms T V TOBIAS: Thank you very much, hon Deputy Speaker. Hon member, you
really sound rural, you do not know what is happening around you.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.] Ms Johnson, I am 31 years of age, and
constitutionally a youth is a person between the ages of 14 and 35.
Therefore, if you are 31 you are still a young person. And besides, Comrade
Madiba is young at heart, hence he remains the honorary member of the ANC
Youth League.

Hon Deputy Speaker, all opposition members did not make comprehensive
proposals on what we must do to develop and empower the youth, and there is
no alternative to the ANC.

This debate takes place on the occasion of the celebration of the 60th
anniversary of the glorious ANC Youth League, with the actual celebrations
taking place later this year. It also takes place after the victory of the
ANC in the third democratic elections and subsequently the establishment of
the third Parliament - where we are now. It also takes place 28 years since
the 16 June 1976 student uprisings and the 49th celebration of the Freedom
Charter.

This debate, again, takes place after South Africa emerged victorious in
the 2010 Bid, and this performance indicator is a positive element for
South African youth, as there will be job creation and poverty alleviation.
The struggle for national liberation, under the leadership of the ANC, took
place over many decades in South Africa. Young people, led by the ANC,
started making their contribution as far back as 1949. The contribution
they made with the June 16 Soweto uprising is but one important
contribution.

The generation of Comrade Rolihlahla Mandela, Oliver Reginald Thambo and
Bertha Gxowa were the first youth detachment to radically and vigorously
engage the ANC to change its programme of action. These youth had a common
goal - that of defeating the apartheid system. It is the apartheid system
that imposed the Bantu education system on the black masses of South Africa
and, again, it was legislated in terms of the Bantu education system that
young people receive educational instruction in Afrikaans, and this led to
the loss of life of Comrade Hector Petersen and others.

The 1994 general elections ushered in a period of freedom, peace and
stability, and this led to the introduction of institutional mechanisms to
deal with youth power in society.

The first democratic Government put in place chapter 8 and chapter 9
institutions to address inequalities in this country and among those
institutions is the National Youth Commission, which was established to
monitor Government's implementation of youth development programmes. The
current generation and detachment of youth is advanced and sharp compared
to the 1976 generation, and our Government is putting them high on the
agenda. These youth have access to basic services provided by Government,
and this is also addressed in the National Youth Service Programme.

The SA Youth Council and National Youth Commission have not failed, Mr
Diko. What you are saying about the youth of South Africa is incorrect. The
Markinor survey has verified that young people are positive about the ANC-
led Government, hence they went out to vote. [Applause.]

The National Youth Commission has been established in all provinces and has
successfully implemented the above mandate, and continues to play and
oversight role with regard to the implementation of Government programmes.
The youth commission has successfully devised the youth policy framework,
which is a referral point for Government to implement youth development.
The youth commission has also forged relations with the Umsobomvu Fund to
ensure that the youth will participate in the economic development of the
country.

Please allow me to mention the following achievements of the youth
commission. The youth commission has registered 7 000 young people in the
National Youth Service Programme; it has also compiled a register of
graduates to link them with the Umsobomvu Fund so that they can start their
own businesses; the youth commission has also established a concept that
helps young people to obtain information regarding their needs; it has
adopted a national youth economic strategy to develop youth entrepreneurial
skills; at the same time it has implemented the distribution of the
Presidential Job Summit by establishing the Umsobomvu Fund - a fund that
has been given R1 billion to deal with these matters; and it has also
registered 64 000 learnerships with a target of 70 000 by 2004. This is a
great achievement.

The youth have obtained success, in addition to the achievements they
obtained in the first decade of freedom, including the above-mentioned.

The youth commission also has a rural strategy to address the needs of
rural women. Hence I said that the hon member is really rural; he does not
understand. We further call on the youth of South Africa to learn so that
they may be able to provide leadership to the world in all fields of study
and human endeavour.

As we said, we are celebrating a decade of freedom. The youth of this
country will be celebrating in Rustenburg under the theme of ``Youth
Celebrating a Decade of Freedom - Seizing the Opportunities of Democracy''.
The youth commission is on track and continues to play an oversight role by
ensuring that the Government puts issues of youth development high on the
agenda, and it will continue to forge relations with nongovernmental
organisations.

It is also during this month that Government will honour young heroes. And
as we heard yesterday, different orders have been conferred upon the people
who participated in bringing about change on the African continent, and
this announcement is really important to us.

But, we also face challenges in making sure that we continue to put youth
development high on the agenda. The major challenge facing our people is
that of coming of age with regard to economic participation. Hence we said
that the second economy would be able to address the challenges as the
first economy has created opportunities that they need to grab.

The second challenge is that of accessing skills through learnerships and
programmes created by Government. The third challenge is that of ensuring
that they acquire the relevant skills to also participate in the IT sector
and financial services as well.

The Government has a programme for dealing with diseases such as diabetes,
cancer, TB and HIV/Aids, and these opportunities should be utilised by
young people. It is not the first time that we hear about HIV/Aids. As the
President mentioned in our election manifesto, the Public Works Programme
needs to have a youth bias to ensure that there is an overhauling job -
creation programme for young people.

We should also acknowledge those departments that have put an extra effort
in making sure that there are youth development programmes, and those are
the Departments of Labour, Social Development and Home Affairs
respectively.

Finally, we should acknowledge that these historic celebrations coincide
with the birthday celebrations of our President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, and
of the late Comrade Che Guevara, a Cuban intellectual and revolutionary who
used to cut sugar cane on his porch on the tropical island. This is a cause
for celebration.

Finally, the ANC agenda is making sure that South African people live in
conditions of nonracialism, nonsexism and a democratic South Africa. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That concludes the business of this sitting. Members
are reminded that Extended Public Committees will start in 10 minutes'
time.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 10:48.
