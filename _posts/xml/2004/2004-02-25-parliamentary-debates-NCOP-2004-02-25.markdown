                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Ms C BOTHA: Chair, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of  the
House I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 18 November Ms C Botha announced in  this  Council  that  she
           would again be appealing to both the Minister of Foreign Affairs
           and the President  of  the  Republic  to  act  on  the  shameful
           retention of Mr Norman  Mashabane  as  Ambassador  to  Indonesia
           despite  having  been  found  guilty  on  22  counts  of  sexual
           harassment;


       (b)  Ms Botha has consistently done so during the past year;


       (c)  she  has  received  acknowledgement  of  her  letters  from  the
           Department of Foreign Affairs but no further response;


       (d)  she has received no acknowledgement from the Presidency;


       (e)  she has requested the Consul-General of  Indonesia  to  withdraw
           the invitation to Mr Mashabane to speak at a  gender  conference
           in Indonesia later this year; and
       (f)  the organisers of the conference say that they  cannot  withdraw
           the  invitation  without  such  intervention  or  Mr   Mashabane
           offering to withdraw;


  (2) once  again  calls  on  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  the
       Presidency to dispel the impression that sexual  harassment  will  be
       tolerated if it is committed by senior  officials  in  Government  by
       immediately suspending Ambassador Mashabane or openly  explaining  in
       public why they are not suspending him as  recommended  in  both  his
       disciplinary hearings.

  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its utmost shock  about  a  family  living  on  a  farm  in

       their parents have not been allowed by the previous owner of the farm
       to have any contact with other people;


  (2) expresses its shock at the cruelty of this employer which led to  the
       four siblings growing up without being able to socialise  with  other
       people, and unable to speak and walk like humans - they  jump  around
       like wild animals, are illiterate and appear to be mentally retarded;

       are too old for that;

       informed welfare officials about this  matter,  which  led  to  their
       being taken to a mental institution; and

       its MEC for speedily attending to this matter so that these children,
       who have spent over 20 years of  their  lives  in  poverty,  can  get
       help.]

(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, I would like to move an amendment that:

       Rights Commission.]

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion,  as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  secion  65  of  the

         CONGRATULATIONS TO GOVERNMENT ON IMPROVING SOCIAL SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Hon Chairperson, I rise to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges that since 1994 significant progress has  been  made  by
       the ANC in de-racialising social services and  extending  the  social
       safety net to all South Africans;


  (2) notes that, amongst others, the ANC-led Government has -


       (a)  equalised old age pensions and spread the  reach  of  the  child
           support grant among all eligible children;


       (b)  increased the expenditure on these social grants threefold  from
           R10 billion in 1994 to R34 billion in 2003; and


       (c)  increased the number of beneficiaries from just over  2  million
           to almost 7 million;


  (3) recognises that while the grants  on  their  own  are  inadequate  to
       address the huge challenges facing  poor  families  and  communities,
       these  grants  provide  welcome  relief  from  crushing  poverty   by
       injecting billions of rands into the budgets of poor households; and


  (4) commends and supports the efforts of Government  to  further  improve
       access  to  social  security  measures  by  reducing  corruption  and
       incorporating these  grants  into  a  comprehensive  social  security
       system.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    FALSE HIJACKING AND KIDNAPPING ALARMS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and disbelief the tendency by  some  individuals  to
       falsely report that they have been hijacked or  kidnapped  when  they
       are actually enjoying themselves somewhere else;


  (2) notes  that  one  man  falsely  reported  having  been  hijacked  and
       kidnapped when, in fact, he was busy gambling in a casino;


  (3) notes that  one  woman  also  reported  that  she  was  hijacked  and
       kidnapped  when  she  was  actually  cheating  on  her  husband   and
       canoodling with her concubine and  did  not  know  how  to  face  her
       husband;


  (4) notes with shock that the Department of Safety and  Security  had  to
       deploy 100 police officers, 50 police cars and one helicopter  to  go
       on a massive search and rescue operation in order to rescue her;


  (5) notes that the whole operation  cost  the  department  no  less  than
       R100 000,  this  in  the  light  of  the  scarce  resources  in  this
       department;


  (6) asserts  that  this  money  could  have  been  used  for  people  who
       desperately need help;


  (7) calls upon these callous individuals to desist  from  this  abhorrent
       behaviour, because this might  discourage  the  police  from  swiftly
       attending to people who genuinely need their help desperately;


  (8) calls upon the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Affairs  to
       show no mercy when these bad elements are identified.

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Hon  member,  I  just
want to draw your attention to the fact that the matter which  the  contents
of the motion addresses is before the courts and is  therefore  sub  judice.
So the motion will not be carried.

                  SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY BILL
                           SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BILL

(Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT:  Mr  Chairman  and  delegates  from  the
provinces, as the term of this Parliament begins to draw to a close,  it  is
vital that we reflect and ask ourselves what difference we have made to  the
lives of the poor and vulnerable people in our country.

When our people spoke in 1999 they gave us  a  mandate  to  build  a  caring
society  and  to  entrench  the  democratic  system  and  the  human  rights
contained in our Constitution and  our  laws.  This  mandate  gives  us  the
yardstick that should be used in considering the Social Assistance Bill  and
the South African Social Security Agency Bill.

I will use my opening remarks in this  debate  to  elaborate  upon  the  two
anchors which underpin these Bills. Firstly, the Bills serving  before  this
plenary session of the NCOP are designed to enable  us  to  continue  making
progress towards building a  caring  society.  Secondly,  the  Bills  are  a
product of our democratic system of governance and represent the next  stage
in our work to ensure the  progressive  realisation  of  the  constitutional
right of access to social assistance.

It should be noted that our Government presented a package  of  four  social
development  Bills  to  Parliament.  The  research,  drafting   and   public
participation process in terms of these four Bills have been under  way  for
longer than the past four years. It is our hope  that  the  Children's  Bill
and the Older Persons  Bill  will  be  considered  speedily  and  passed  by
Parliament - that is the next Parliament.

Our starting point in considering the Social Assistance Bill and  the  South
African Social Security Agency Bill, however, has to be the  question:  What
difference have  we  made  in  the  lives  of  our  people,  especially  the
vulnerable and  the  poor  in  this  country  since  1994?  The  answer,  as
reflected in the Government's 10-year review report, is that Government  has
made major achievements in the first decade of freedom and is very proud  of
its track record on this matter.

Pertinent to today's debate are measures that  the  Government  has  put  in
place to address both poverty and social exclusion in our society.  We  have
deracialised eligibility for, and extended access to,  social  grants.  This
is part and parcel of the ANC Government's commitment to creating a  people-
centred society, to the expansion of the frontiers of human  fulfilment  and
to the continual extension of the frontiers of freedom in this country.

To complement the enhanced income capabilities  we  have  created  for  poor
people, we have introduced special programmes  that  protect  older  people,
people with disabilities, children and vulnerable workers  in  the  domestic
and farming sectors.

As a result of our policy measures, the number  of  people  benefiting  from
social  assistance  has  increased  from  2,6 million  in   1994   to   over
7,7 million currently. Of the 2,6  million  people  benefiting  from  social
grants in 1994, over 1,6 million were older  people  and  only  60 000  were
children from the coloured, white and Indian communities. Today,  the  total
number of children in receipt of social grants in  all  communities  exceeds
4,4 million. As we speak, approximately  4,2 million  children  receive  the
child support grant, 190 000 the foster care grant  and  75  000  the  care-
dependency grant.

As indicated by these figures, compared to 1994 a total of 4,1 million  more
children now receive Government support in the form  of  the  child  support
grant alone. In percentage terms this represents a 6 000% increase  over  10
years.

In addition to this, Government has decided  to  extend  the  child  support
grant to include children up to 14  years  of  age.  By  the  year  2006  an
additional 2,2 million children will have  been  registered  for  the  child
support grant. This increased coverage has  been  incorporated  into  budget
allocations. Total Government expenditure on social  grants  increased  from
R10 billion in 1994 to R34,8 billion  in  2003.  In  addition  to  increased
coverage, the real value of the grants  continues  to  increase  at  a  rate
above that of inflation.

These are not mere statistics, but represent a commitment  to  strengthening
families and communities and creating a better life  for  children  overall.
As a result of our policy of redress and the redirection  of  resources,  we
have made significant progress in extending the social security net to  poor
children, vulnerable families, people with disabilities and  older  persons.
Government could not have achieved this working on its own.

Accordingly, I take this opportunity to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  to
traditional   leaders,   community-based   organisations,    nongovernmental
organisations,   faith-based   organisations,   the   business    community,
volunteers and all committed  South  Africans,  including  members  of  this
House, who have made it possible for Government to give concrete  expression
to the objective of building a caring society.

The undeniable South African reality of today is that  for  all  our  fellow
citizens life is better  in  2004  than  it  was  in  1999.  Similarly,  the
undeniable South African reality of 1999 was that life was  better  in  1999
than it was in 1994. It  is  clear  that  we  are  a  people  united  in  an
unstoppable advance towards a better South Africa and a better world.

The Bills before the  NCOP  also  speak  to  constitutional  imperatives.  A
fundamental purpose of the Constitution is to improve the  quality  of  life
of  all  citizens,   especially   vulnerable   people   in   South   Africa.
Socioeconomic rights, including the right of access to social security,  are
at the  heart  of  this  purpose.  The  Constitution  therefore  imposes  an
obligation  on  the  state  to  take  reasonable  measures  to  ensure   the
progressive realisation of the right of access  to  social  security  within
available  resources.   Concomitantly,   the   Constitution   also   enjoins
Government to ensure that services are provided to all in an  equitable  and
dignified manner.

The introduction of the Social Assistance Bill and the South African  Social
Security Agency Bill marks the culmination of the  Government's  efforts  of
moving South Africa from having a fragmented and incoherent social  security
system to having an integrated national system that improves the  protection
of the most vulnerable people in our  society.  The  fragmented  spheres  of
jurisdiction and institutional  arrangements  that  we  still  have  in  our
social assistance system have created  loopholes  for  fraudulent  practices
and parallel lines of accountability for performance management.

It is estimated that over R1,5 billion per annum may be pocketed  by  people
who fraudulently claim social security benefits. We  are  not  oblivious  to
the dubious schemes of those who want to enrich themselves illegally at  the
expense of the poor. We  are  taking  these  syndicates  to  court  to  face
justice. We take this opportunity to repeat  our  message:  "There  is  zero
tolerance for fraud and corruption in our social assistance system. The  net
of the law and  justice  is  closing  in  on  those  officials,  third-party
contractors and syndicates which are enriching themselves illegally  at  the
expense of poor people of this country."

Over the past few months, various measures and systems  have  been  deployed
to enable us to  identify  officials  in  the  Public  Service  who  may  be
fraudulently receiving benefits intended for poor people.  In  collaboration
with the Scorpions and the SA Police Service,  we  are  continuing  to  make
arrests. We are resolute in our commitment to fighting fraud and  corruption
and bringing these people to face justice.

Because  of  all  these  issues,  the  Social  Assistance  Bill  creates   a
nationally  co-ordinated  system   for   existing   grants.   It   addresses
fundamental   issues   relating   to   legislative   oversight,    political
accountability and administrative responsibility.  The  Bill  also  provides
for the statutory allocation of the sole responsibility for  the  management
and administration of social assistance grants to the agency.

In addition, the Social Assistance Bill creates uniform norms and  standards
that will apply countrywide. It provides for the publishing  of  regulations
on performance management and adherence to  the  Batho  Pele  principles  of
customer service. It also establishes  an  independent  inspectorate,  whose
function it will be to ensure the integrity of the social grant system.

In keeping with the best  practice  principle  of  separating  policy-making
from service delivery responsibility,  the  South  African  Social  Security
Agency  Bill  established  a  specialised  institution   tasked   with   the
management, administration and payment  of  social  assistance  grants.  The
Bill creates a uniform but flexible service  delivery  mechanism  to  ensure
that the Government pays the right grant amount to the right person  at  the
right time and in a dignified manner.

As part of the  process  of  creating  the  South  African  Social  Security
Agency, the Council  of  Social  Development  Ministers  from  national  and
provincial  spheres  of  government  has  committed  itself  to  the  speedy
restructuring of the departments of social  development.  The  restructuring
process  provides  for  the  enhancement  of  the  capacity  of   provincial
departments to expand the provision  of  social  welfare  services,  poverty
relief intervention and programmes that mitigate  the  socioeconomic  impact
of HIV/Aids.

These   initiatives   will   therefore   require   additional   skills   and
competencies. In this regard the Council  of  Social  Development  Ministers
has approved a strategy and grading scale that we  are  confident  will  not
only retain social workers in the country, but  also  encourage  more  young
people to join the profession.

As indicated in Government's 10-year  review  programme,  the  provision  of
social grants is the Government's most effective programme  to  address  the
income poverty of our people. The social grants  currently  administered  by
this department are targeted at pensioners,  poor  families  with  children,
war veterans, people  with  disabilities,  children  in  compromised  family
environments and people in need in general.

We are aware that despite our concerted efforts to extend the social  safety
net to the most vulnerable there are still challenges that  we  face.  These
challenges are being  dealt  with  as  part  of  our  ongoing  work  on  the
development of a comprehensive social security system for this country.

Our first 10 years of freedom  have  been  10  years  of  growing  unity  in
action, 10 years of peace and stability, 10  years  of  increasingly  making
the  resources  in  the  hands  of  the  state   available   for   uplifting
disadvantaged South Africans, and 10 years  of  expanding  opportunities  to
build a better life for all. We are making progress  in  building  a  caring
society because of the active citizenship and spirit of  responsibility  and
volunteerism amongst all of us.

I take this opportunity  to  thank  the  officials  from  the  national  and
provincial departments of social security and social development  for  their
hard work on  these  Bills.  I  also  acknowledge  and  applaud  the  active
citizenship  of  the  various  civil   society   organisations   that   made
submissions and participated in the public hearings on these Bills.

I also extend my sincere  appreciation  to  the  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Social Development and the Select Committee on Social  Services
for their various deliberations on and contribution to the  Bills.  We  know
that they worked under pressure. The MECs for social  development  in  their
provinces and my colleagues, Ministers Trevor Manuel and  Geraldine  Fraser-
Moleketi, also worked closely with  my  department  on  these  Bills  and  I
acknowledge their support.

The Social Assistance Bill and the  South  African  Social  Security  Agency
Bill fulfil the mandate given to us by our people to build a caring  society
and entrench the democratic system and the  human  rights  embodied  in  our
Constitution and our laws. We have been and will always remain true  to  the
people's contract. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  I  now  call  Ms
Jacobus, the chairperson of the Select Committee on Social Services.

Ms L JACOBUS: Thank you, Deputy  Chair.  Hon  Minister  and  MEC  of  social
development for the Western Cape - you are the only one that joined us  here
today; thank you -  members,  I  must  say  thank  you  once  more  for  the
opportunity to participate in this debate. The two Bills  before  us  today,
the Social Assistance Bill and the  South  African  Social  Security  Agency
Bill have been referred to as twin Bills. This means  that  we  should  read
these Bills one with the other. We have, therefore, as a  committee  decided
to have one debate on the two together, not because we are lazy but  because
they have to be read together.

Since both these Bills are section 76 Bills, provinces  were  encouraged  to
have public hearings, and I am glad to report that seven  out  of  the  nine
provinces subjected  these  Bills  to  public  hearings.  KwaZulu-Natal  and
Limpopo, unfortunately, were the only two who did not manage to  have  these
public hearings. Therefore, regarding  the  mandates  we  received,  we  can
confidently say they were informed by the stakeholders and people  of  these
respective provinces.

I will not go into the details, but rather just highlight the  main  thrusts
of both these Bills and what they  aim  to  achieve.  Regarding  the  Social
Assistance Bill, I refer to  section  27(1)(c)  of  our  Constitution  which
reads as follows, and I quote:


  Everyone has the right to have access to social security,  including,  if
  they are unable to support themselves and their  dependants,  appropriate
  social assistance.

Section 27(2) subsequently places a responsibility  on  the  state  to  take
reasonable legislative and other measures, within its  available  resources,
to achieve the progressive realisation of this right. I also  just  want  to
appeal to this side to stop their private meeting. [Interjections.]

Given these constitutional provisions, this Bill has come to see the  light.


The Bill provides for, amongst  other  things,  firstly,  the  rendering  of
social assistance to persons; secondly, the mechanisms for the rendering  of
such assistance; and, thirdly, the  establishment  of  an  inspectorate  for
social assistance. Chapter 2 of the Bill identifies the various grant  types
and who is eligible for which grant. However, the one  concern  we  had  was
that no provision was made for child-headed households. It  is,  however,  a
concern that we know the Minister shares with us. It is a  concern  that  we
continuously raised through our budget policy  debates  over  the  past  few
years. We hope and are confident that as  we  enter  our  second  decade  of
democracy, these vulnerable little  members  of  our  society  will  receive
priority attention.

In Chapter 3 the Bill also  sets  out  the  procedure  for  application  for
social assistance through the agency, which we will come to later,  as  well
as an appeal procedure if the applicant disagrees with the decision made  by
the agency. Clause 20 of the Bill, I think, is  of  particular  significance
to beneficiaries of social grants. It deals with the abuse of  these  grants
by either the beneficiary, the parent,  procurator  or  primary  care-giver.
This is a definite positive for helpless  beneficiaries  and  the  state  in
particular, against those who want to abuse limited resources for their  own
selfish needs and underhanded purposes. I would even go so  far  as  to  say
that abuse of any of the social grants  by  any  person  should  be  made  a
punishable offence.

With the level of poverty we are facing currently,  we  cannot  afford  that
any person receiving moneys meant for the alleviation of poverty  and  those
in genuine need spends it inappropriately or accesses it fraudulently.

Chapter 4 of the Bill deals with the establishment of the  inspectorate  for
social assistance. Of significant importance here are the functions  of  the
inspectorate, and I briefly want to refer to these. These functions  are  to
conduct investigations to ensure the maintenance of  the  integrity  of  the
social assistance frameworks and  systems;  to  execute  internal  financial
audits and audits on compliance; to investigate fraud, corruption and  other
forms of financial and service  mismanagement;  to  establish  a  complaints
mechanism; and, to do everything necessary to combat  the  abuse  of  social
assistance.

This inspectorate, which will be headed by the executive director,  will  be
completely  independent  but  accountable  to  the  Minister   through   its
executive director.

Regarding the South African Social Security Agency Bill,  the  establishment
of this agency is another milestone in our history. For those of us who  can
recall the last publication of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review,  one  of
the recommendations under the Social Services chapter was the  establishment
of an agency for the payment of social grants.  The  majority  of  the  nine
provinces  have  over  the  years  outsourced  this  function   to   private
companies. And, I don't think I have to remind the House  of  the  countless
problems that some  of  these  provinces  have  experienced  and  are  still
experiencing through this exercise.

Beneficiaries of social grants in many areas, especially our rural areas  of
the country, have to endure harsh and difficult conditions while waiting  to
receive their grants. This is largely because the tender agreements  between
provincial governments and companies responsible for rendering this  service
for payments vary dramatically.

There has been no uniform set of requirements or standards  to  which  these
companies have to adhere. In some instances, no shelter, water  or  ablution
facilities  are   available.   Without   these   basic   requirements,   the
beneficiaries' human  dignity  stands  to  be  greatly  diminished.  We  can
continue the whole afternoon and cite examples of  these  harsh  conditions,
or unsavoury conditions if you want to put it mildly.

The establishment  of  this  agency  is  a  direct  result  of  Government's
commitment to and prioritisation of improvement of service delivery  to  our
people. The agency will have  the  following  objectives:  firstly,  to  act
eventually as the sole agent that will ensure the  efficient  and  effective
management, administration and payment of social  assistance;  secondly,  to
serve as an agent for the prospective administration and payment  of  social
security; and, thirdly, to render services relating to such payments.

I also have to mention a few important functions that  the  agency  will  be
performing, that is the promotion and protection of  the  human  dignity  of
applicants for and beneficiaries  of  social  security;  honest,  impartial,
fair and equitable service delivery; and the establishment of mechanisms  to
regulate community participation and consultation.

As a committee, we are of the view that the  establishment  of  this  agency
will address many of  the  difficulties  and  challenges  we  are  currently
experiencing  around  the  payments  of  social  grants.  We  have  proposed
amendments from our provinces to both these Bills, and I am happy to  report
that the portfolio committee in the National Assembly welcomed and  accepted
all these amendments. There are, however, some concerns raised  by  Treasury
on both these Bills and these are captured  in  our  committee  reports  for
consideration by the Minister, and if he or she - I  am  saying  he  or  she
because we do not know who the Minister will be in  the  next  Parliament  -
deems it fit to table amendments in the next Parliament, he or  she  may  do
so.

In conclusion, I also want to thank the Minister and his department for  the
continuous support that they have rendered throughout the  five  years  that
we have been a committee in this House. And, I want to also appeal  to  them
to continue with that support and encouragement for the  next  committee  in
the new Parliament. I also want to say thank  you  to  the  members  of  the
committee for their diligent work in the various provinces. With  these  few
words, I want to table the report on the  Social  Assistance  Bill  and  the
South African Social Security Agency Bill with the amendments,  as  proposed
by the select committee, for adoption. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Before  I
proceed to call the next speaker, I would like to recognise the citizens  of
South Africa sitting in the gallery. They are pensioners from  Kuils  River,
Mitchells Plain, Langa and Philippi. [Applause.] I wish to say you are  most
welcome.

We appreciate your visiting the Council today to listen to  these  wonderful
debates. All  these  people  are  members  of  the  Council  and,  with  the
Minister, are looking after you. You are all at all times free to  visit  us
during our debates on the issues that concern  you,  and  you  are  free  to
raise them with the Council. It is our duty to respond and  attend  to  your
problems. You are most welcome. [Applause.]

I now call the hon M L Fransman, the MEC for  social  services  and  poverty
alleviation, Western Cape.

Mr M L FRANSMAN (Western Cape): Mr Chairperson, Minister,  hon  members,  in
the 10th year of our democracy one can reflect on the past 10 years and  one
can proudly say that the Government is on the side of  the  poor,  and  that
their track record over the past 10 years has signified a  fast-tracking  in
the delivery of very basic services to the people, which  include  increases
in grants and the issues the Minister has raised.

One is honoured to be given an opportunity  to  address  you  on  these  two
Bills, because these Bills are the culmination of  a  very  long  and  well-
considered process to ensure a better life for  the  poorest  and  the  most
vulnerable in our society. In fact, I want  to  say  that  these  Bills  are
about strengthening our safety net.

From the recommendations of the Chikane Commission in  1996  and  the  prior
recognition of the importance  of  social  security  for  the  RDP,  to  the
recognition of the truly impressive gains we have made in our  first  decade
of democracy  and  freedom,  there  has  been  an  inexorable  move  towards
ensuring uniform norms  and  standards  that  apply  nationally  for  social
security.

Just reflecting on the Western Cape scenario,  today  over  half  a  million
beneficiaries in the Western Cape are accessing our grants. In terms of  the
child support alone there are approximately 230 000 children,  and,  in  the
past 12 months alone,  we  have  been  able  to  register  at  least  43 000
children between seven and eight years old. That means  more  children  than
at any time before. We know in the Western Cape that we have only been  able
to do this through the decisive leadership of the national Ministry and  the
national department, and therefore we want to thank them.

However, we know that our people are not getting equal services  everywhere.
We also know that there is no uniformity in  poverty.  Poverty  has  greater
depths in rural areas, in provinces with fewer resources  and  in  districts
where the legacy of apartheid hangs more heavily over our people.

The poorest and most marginalised, wherever they are, have  an  equal  right
to the same services  and  efficiency  as  experienced  by  those  in  well-
resourced urban areas. These Bills will ensure that  our  people  will  have
access to equal services. The Social Assistance Bill and the  South  African
Social Security Agency Bill are therefore major  steps  in  the  progressive
realisation of the right to social security as set out in section 27 of  the
Constitution.

Minister, as you have correctly pointed out, the provision of social  grants
is the Government's  most  effective  programme  in  addressing  the  income
poverty of our people. Indeed, having consolidated the gains  of  our  first
decade of democracy, our attention must now turn to fighting poverty as  the
highest priority in the second decade.

The President has challeged  us  and,  through  the  Millennium  Development
Goals,  we  undertake  to  halve  poverty  by  2014.  These  Bills  will  be
instrumental in achieving  these  goals,  because  they  will  be  the  most
effective mechanism in ensuring the proper  distribution  of  resources  for
the implementation of social security.

As things now stand, provinces pay grants out of the equitable share and  it
is left to the treasury of each  province  to  budget  for  social  security
expenditure. More often than not this results in social  security  squeezing
out other social development programmes. In some instances, as has  happened
in my own province, money is reallocated in  the  middle  of  the  financial
year, resulting in unacceptable  impacts  on  other  areas  of  work.  These
impacts  are  felt  in  youth  programmes,  moral   regeneration,   poverty,
HIV/Aids, early childhood development, substance abuse, etc.

Once these Bills are implemented, the province will have  greater  stability
and sustainability in social development and poverty  programmes.  In  fact,
this gives us the opportunity to start  realigning  and  looking  at  social
development in the context of Vision 2014. There can be no doubt that it  is
desirable for social security to be administered uniformly,  on  a  national
level.

We must, however, make very sure that there is  an  orderly  transition.  In
this regard in the Western Cape - and I'm sure in the other provinces  -  we
will do,  collectively,  everything  in  our  power  to  assist  during  the
transition period. We expect that in the  transition  period  we  will  face
many a challenge owing to the nature of change.

The realignment of  budgets,  the  redeployment  of  staff,  developing  the
institutional structure of the agency, and ensuring adequate penetration  in
the remotest rural areas are but some of the obvious challenges.  No  doubt,
there  will  be  some  unintended  consequences   and   some   unanticipated
difficulties, but none of  that  can  detract  from  the  soundness  of  the
concept of a national, integrated and cohesive social security system.

Indeed, these Bills are the product of a long process that started in  1994,
which process has, time and again, demonstrated  the  need  for  a  national
agency  to  administer  grants  in  terms  of  uniform  national  norms  and
standards.

As always, probably owing to vested interests and privilege, there  will  be
criticism. As always, with more resources and more time, we  could  possibly
have done better, but we don't have the luxury to wait for  a  more  perfect
system. More debate and deliberation will prejudice the most vulnerable  and
poor. We have an obligation to act when we are in a position to do  so,  not
always when it is best to do so. We must, therefore, act now.

Finally, our President, in his state of the nation address,  expressed  most
eloquently the test we have to apply in evaluating any piece of  legislation
when he said:


  A decade ago, Nelson Mandela said:


     The acid test of the legitimacy of the  programmes  we  elaborate,  the
     government institutions we create and the legislation we adopt must  be
     whether ...


     ... they help to create a people-centred society, the expansion of  the
     frontiers of human fulfilment, and  the  continuous  extension  of  the
     frontiers of freedom.

The President continued, saying:


  As we progress to the celebration of our first decade of  liberation  and
  democracy, I trust that the national, provincial and  local  legislatures
  will give themselves the opportunity to answer the question whether  they
  have passed this acid test.

These Bills, I argue, pass that acid test with flying colours. When we  pass
these Bills we will indeed have more cause to celebrate,  because  we  would
have ensured a better life for the poorest and the most  vulnerable  in  our
communities.
In conclusion, I want to again thank both the NCOP for its support  and  the
Western Cape legislature in the context of the public hearings, and  I  also
want to thank the national department and the  national  Ministry.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Dankie, mnr die Voorsitter. Mnr die Voorsitter, dit is vir  my
'n groot voorreg om vandag namens die provinsie, my provinsie, deel te  neem
aan hierdie debat.

Die feit dat die voorsitter van die portefeuljekomitee van die  Vrystaat  my
gevra het om namens hom op te tree is  'n  sprekende  bewys  van  die  goeie
gesindheid en samewerking wat daar die afgelope byna vyf jaar onder die  ses
permanente afgevaardigdes en die portefeuljekomitee  van  die  Vrystaat  oor
partypolitieke grense heen  geheers  het.  Ons  het  deurentyd  as  'n  span
hartlik saam gewerk in belang van die Vrystaat.

Dit was ook die geval met hierdie twee konsepwette wat vandag voor  ons  is.
Ek wil graag erkenning gee aan die goeie  werk  wat  die  portefeuljekomitee
van die Vrystaat gedoen het. Hulle het drie "hearings" of verhore  gehou  in
drie distrikte van die Vrystaat en hulle het baie tyd spandeer  aan  hierdie
twee wette en het ook daarin geslaag om  19  sinvolle  amendemente  aan  die
gekose komitee voor te lê waarvan die  meeste  opgeneem  is  in  die  finale
dokument. Daarvoor spreek ek graag vandag my dank uit  teenoor  my  kollegas
en teenoor die lede van die portefeuljekomitee.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Thank you, Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman, I feel  very  privileged
to be able to participate in this debate today on behalf  of  the  province,
my province.

The fact that the chairperson of the portfolio committee of the  Free  State
asked me to act on his behalf is conclusive proof of the  good  feeling  and
co-operation that have prevailed over the past  five  years  among  the  six
permanent delegates and the portfolio committee of  the  Free  State  across
party-political borders. We worked together heartily as  a  team  the  whole
time in the interests of the Free State.

This was also the case with these two pieces of draft legislation before  us
today. I would like to give recognition  for  the  good  work  done  by  the
portfolio committee of the Free State. They held  three  hearings  in  three
districts of the Free State and they spent of a lot of  time  on  these  two
Acts and also succeeded  in  submitting  19  meaningful  amendments  to  the
select committee,  most  of  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  final
document. For that I would like to express my thanks today to my  colleagues
and to the members of the portfolio committee.]

We are dealing today with two very important pieces of legislation. The  two
Bills are companion Bills that must  be  seen  together.  The  provision  of
social assistance should be seen  as  a  service  for  the  most  vulnerable
people in our country and one of  the  most  important  poverty  alleviation
programmes of the Government.

Two of the objects of the Social Assistance Bill are, inter alia, to  ensure
that minimum norms  and  standards  are  set  for  the  delivery  of  social
assistance and to provide for  the  establishment  of  an  inspectorate  for
social security. The aim is to create  a  mechanism  for  investigation  and
objective assessment of the social assistance service delivery  institutions
and to endeavour to ensure the integrity and quality of service delivery  by
the agency.

South Africa simply cannot afford to lose some of  the  money  budgeted  for
poverty relief due to bad administration and corruption, as  was  spelt  out
by the hon Minister today. The establishment of an inspectorate  for  social
services is therefore very necessary.

The Bill further provides for the financing of  social  assistance  and  the
administration and payment of social grants. The Bill furthermore  sets  the
main  criteria  for  the  various  grant  types.  No  new  grant  types  are
introduced.

The South African Social Security Agency Bill, as I have already  mentioned,
must be read  with  the  Social  Assistance  Bill.  This  Bill  is  enabling
legislation for the establishment of  a  national  social  security  agency.
Effective provision  of  services  requires  uniform  norms  and  standards.
Currently, the processes used by the various provinces vary both within  and
between the provinces.

There is a lack of uniformity in the documents  used  and  in  the  customer
relations procedures. Consequently,  in  the  absence  of  national  uniform
administrative processes, access to social grants continues to  be  unequal.
The main objective of the agency is  to  ensure  the  effective  management,
administration and payment of grants in  the  country  through  the  optimum
utilisation of partnerships.

The portfolio committee of the  Free  State  is  of  the  opinion  that  the
establishment  of  such  an  agency  will  ensure  that  all  citizens  will
eventually have equal access to social security  and  that  it  will  ensure
that, through less duplication of expenditures, costs will be  reduced.  The
Free State supports both these Bills.

Aangesien hierdie my laaste optrede in hierdie agb Huis sal wees,  omdat  ek
nou uittree uit die politiek, gun my asseblief die  geleentheid  om  nog  'n
paar woorde te sê.

Ek is baie dankbaar dat ek lid kon wees van die Parlement van die  Republiek
van Suid-Afrika, in die ou sowel as in die nuwe bedeling; in 'n tydperk  toe
'n baie belangrike deel,  indien  nie  dié  belangrikste  gedeelte  van  die
geskiedenis van ons land geskryf is. Ek is dankbaar dat  ek  deel  kon  wees
van die nasiebouproses en 'n beskeie bydra kon maak aan  die  span  wat  die
bousstene van ons nasie in plek moes plaas; dat ek 'n medereisiger kon  wees
op die reis na vryheid en demokrasie in ons land.

Dit was voorwaar 'n opwindende tydperk in my lewe en een wat nou vir my  ten
einde loop en waarvoor ek die Almagtige Vader dank dat dit  vir  my  beskore
was om dit so lank te kon doen. Dit was vir  my  'n  aangename  ervaring  om
soveel wonderlike vriende te kon maak, nie net uit die geledere van  my  eie
party nie, maar ook uit die geledere van die regerende party  en  die  ander
partye.  Ek  wil  graag  my  hartlike  dank  aan  u  almal  oordra  vir  die
welwillendheid wat u teenoor my getoon het.

Baie van u was ook op een of ander stadium 'n pasiënt van my en ook  teenoor
u is ek dankbaar dat u my belangstelling in my beroep  lewendig  gehou  het.
Ek belowe die mans wat hier is vandag, ek sal nooit vir  iemand  vertel  vir
wie ek voorskrifte vir Viagra geskryf het nie. [Gelag.]

Ek het ook groot waardering vir die bekwame en onpartydige wyse waarmee  die
voorsittende  beamptes  en  voorsitters  van  komitees   die   sittings   en
vergaderings hanteer het.

Ek gaan u werklik almal baie mis. Baie dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Since this is the last time  that  I  shall  be  speaking  in  this  House,
because I am retiring from politics, please allow me the opportunity to  say
a few more words.

I am very grateful that I could be a member of Parliament  of  the  Republic
of South Africa, in the old as  well  as  the  new  dispensation;  during  a
period when an important part,  if  not  the  most  important  part  of  the
history of our country was written. I am grateful that I could  be  part  of
the nation-building processs and could make a  humble  contribution  to  the
team who had to put the building bricks of  our  nation  in  place;  that  I
could be a fellow traveller on the journey to freedom and democracy  in  our
country.

It was indeed an exciting period in my life and one which is ending  for  me
now and for which I thank Almighty God that I was  able  to  do  so  for  so
long. It was a pleasant  experience  to  be  able  to  make  such  wonderful
friends, not only from the ranks of my own party, but also  from  the  ranks
of the ruling party and the other  parties.  I  would  like  to  express  my
thanks to everyone for the goodwill you showed to me.
Many of you were also patients of mine some or other stage  and  I  am  also
grateful to you that you kept my interest in my profession alive. I  promise
the men who are here today that I will never tell anyone for  whom  I  wrote
prescriptions for Viagra. [Laughter.]

I also have great appreciation for the competent and impartial way in  which
the presiding  officers  and  chairpersons  of  committees  dealt  with  the
sittings and meetings.

I am truly going to miss all of you. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Thank you, Dr  Nel.  I
think we'll make  the  appropriate  speeches  next  week  when  we  bid  you
farewell. We are not making such speeches now,  but  I  think  members  will
share your view when they make their farewell speeches next week.

Ms E C GOUWS: Thank you, Deputy Chair.

Dr Nel het ons nou almal omtrent in trane, maar ek sal darem graag wil  weet
vir wie sommige voorskrifte gegee is! [Gelag.] [Dr Nel now  has  just  about
all of us in tears, but I would nevertheless like to know  to  whom  certain
prescriptions were given. [Laughter.]]

Hon Chairperson, the hon Minister of Social Development, Dr  Zola  Skweyiya,
is a Minister who cares. He has demonstrated this special  attitude  towards
the poor and children so many times. I laud him for this. I can recall  many
occasions when the elderly and pensioners were maltreated and at  the  wrong
end of receiving and the Minister acted speedily and  visited  those  places
to take cognisance of the incidents. I'm speaking of  remote  areas  in  the
Eastern  Cape  here,  and  it  shows  his  concern  for  the  poor  and  his
commitment.

Early in November last year, an article in  the  Sunday  newspaper  reported
this:  "Minister  steps  in  to  help  Aids  orphans".  The  Minister   gave
permission for five orphans to  receive  antiretroviral  treatment,  despite
the fact that the Government at that time had yet to  approve  the  plan  to
supply the drugs in public hospitals and clinics.  At  least  five  children
were given the opportunity which thousands were being denied, thanks to  the
Minister of Social Development.

In his reaction on this  swift  decision  he  said:  "Children  need  to  be
assisted as fast as possible to get whatever help is available". The  slogan
of this Government is, "Push back the frontiers of poverty", and the man  in
the trenches of this war is Minister Skweyiya.

I don't envy him his task. His assessment of the  work  is  the  right  one.
Please go ahead, Minister. When it comes to legislation, the Minister  needs
to step in and get things straight and legislation  on  standard.  Today  we
are debating Bills which  affect  poor  people,  elderly  people,  children,
people with disabilities and children needing foster care -  very  important
Bills.

We are gravely alarmed at  the  haste  with  which  these  Bills  are  being
handled. Serious issues are overlooked and rushed through  Parliament.  Why?
Have the coming elections something to do with this feverish haste?  Serious
issues are overlooked.  We  turn  out  flawed  legislation  because  we  are
pressurised.  When  the  Bill  reaches  us,  the  select  committee,  it  is
virtually at the end of the legislation chain. Now, at this late  stage,  we
still have to cope, not  only  with  technicalities,  but  also  with  other
serious issues.

The Alliance for Children's Entitlement to Social Security, Cosatu,  Nehawu,
the Catholics Bishops' Conference and the South African Council of  Churches
all implored Government to slow down  with  these  Bills.  They  all  wanted
Parliament to engage with the Taylor report in order first  to  formulate  a
comprehensive social security policy and  then  to  draft  legislation.  The
Taylor report, on which the Government has  expended  thousands,  is  simply
ignored.

The Social Assistance Bill fails to deal with the  problem  of  child-headed
households, refugees, street children and extending the age for children  to
receive child support grants. Then  we  also  have  this  big  problem  with
service delivery. There is no  guarantee  that  this  proposed  agency  will
improve service delivery to the beneficiaries.

It is time that  we  take  notice  of  the  Taylor  report.  Then  we  might
transform the present and protect  the  future  with  things  like  improved
transfer of payments that will assist  and  improve  delivery  to  the  most
vulnerable people in our society.  Because  these  Bills  are  being  rushed
through with alarming speed  while  bypassing  the  recommendations  of  the
Taylor report, my party cannot support them. I thank you.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  members,  the  KZN
province supports the Social Assistance Bill.  However,  the  South  African
Social Security Agency Bill is not supported.

The Social Assistance Bill and the  South  African  Social  Security  Agency
Bill are some of the most important pieces of  legislation  that  have  been
brought to this House for our consideration.  I  say  this  because  of  the
impact of these Bills on the lives of millions of our people at  grass-roots
level, especially the most vulnerable sectors  of  our  communities,  namely
children, women and older persons.

It is a fact that the majority of our people  still  live  under  very  poor
conditions and that, as the state, we have  a  responsibility  of  providing
our people with social security and social assistance  services,  so  as  to
improve the lives of these poorest of the poor in our communities.

My province acknowledges the fact that there have been  some  weaknesses  in
the administration and payment  of  social  assistance  grants,  which  have
resulted in some persons not receiving assistance timeously  assistance.  We
also acknowledge the reasoning behind the improvement  of  service  delivery
and the efforts being made to ensure that the rightful beneficiaries of  the
social assistance benefits get their assistance in time.

However, we  are  concerned  with  the  manner  in  which  it  is  envisaged
achieving this goal. The KZN province is of the opinion that the  powers  of
the provinces will somehow be reduced unnecessarily with  the  establishment
of the agency. We believe that the people on the ground work very well  with
people within their reach and therefore we cannot imagine  how  it  will  be
possible for an agency operating at a national level to effectively  enhance
service delivery at grass-roots level.

As I stated earlier, these Bills are very important pieces  of  legislation;
they are also very critical as  they  directly  affect  the  people  in  the
provinces with regard to the powers that  are  now  being  reversed  to  the
national Government. It is worrying,  though,  the  manner  in  which  these
Bills  were  rushed  to  the  provinces  for  their  consideration  and  the
timeframe given to them to make their decision.

The KwaZulu-Natal province is of the opinion that private enterprises  would
deliver better services than the state agency, as it is well known that  the
agency will  utilise  seconded  and  transferred  public  servants  who  are
already within the Public Service. These are the  very  personnel  who  have
been carrying out service delivery over the years  and  who  will  carry  on
with the alleged inefficiency in service  delivery,  unless  human  resource
problems within the Department of Social Development, in various  provinces,
are addressed rather than an agency being formed that  will  work  with  the
very same people who  have  human  resource  problems  that  have  not  been
properly addressed. This is our main concern.

I have  mentioned  our  concerns  as  a  province.  We  support  the  Social
Assistance Bill, but do  not  support  the  South  African  Social  Security
Agency Bill. I thank you.

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members,  when  we  came  into
power in 1994, this department inherited a social security system  that  had
been severely fragmented by the DA. We had a situation  in  which  not  only
were there 14 different systems divided along racial lines, but  there  were
enormous discrepancies among payments to beneficiaries. Whites got the  most
and others got progressively  less,  depending  on  what  racial  group  you
belonged to. That's why the DA today can't support this  Bill.  Since  then,
it  has  been  the  task  of  the  Department  of  Social   Development   to
progressively realise an equitable system of grant distribution with a  bias
towards those who are the most needy.

Every year, since 1994, there has been improvement in  the  social  security
system, but not always without hiccups. However, without fail, it  has  been
the ANC-led Government's goal to eradicate  the  inhumanity  experienced  by
the poorest of the poor and to restore the dignity of all our citizens.

We have always understood that our apartheid legacy meant  that  we  had  to
overcome enormous backlogs in service delivery and that  we  would  have  to
deliver a service  not  to  mere  hundreds  but  hundreds  of  thousands  of
beneficiaries who were ignored or underserviced by the past regime.  We  had
to face divergent imbalances that included discrimination in terms of  race,
gender and geographic and provincial lines. Our  focused  attention  on  the
big picture meant that we had to intensively interrogate the system that  we
inherited and work systematically to create a new system  that  would  cater
for all divergent needs of our people.

Sometimes,  in  our  attempts  to  bring  about  change  too   quickly,   we
inadvertently disadvantaged those very people  we  were  trying  to  assist.
Some may remember the fallout this department experienced when  it  required
all grant recipients to reregister so that they could be taken up in  a  new
system that required  bar-coded  IDs.  Even  now,  the  department  faces  a
constant struggle with the Department of Home Affairs in  making  sure  that
the potential grant recipients receive  their  IDs  timeously.  To  a  large
extent, the interdepartmental co-operation has  been  successful  but  there
remains ample room for improvement, especially regarding  the  provision  of
sustainable and reliable service in  remote  rural  areas.  ID  drives  will
continue regardless of whether it is election time or not.

We have also seen provinces struggle to  cope  financially  with  the  large
intakes of new grant recipients, capacity problems, cash-in-transit  heists,
corrupt officials defrauding the system and poor delivery by those who  have
signed service level agreements with provinces. What all this has  meant  is
that the Minister and the department have had to redouble their  efforts  to
bring about an equitable system of service delivery that will  apply  evenly
to all provinces, without exception.

We are confident, however,  that  the  establishment  of  a  unitary  social
security agency will go a  long  way  towards  addressing  the  problems  of
mismanagement, corruption and abuse within the current provision  of  social
grants.

One of  the  core  functions  of  the  agency  will  be  that  of  financial
accountability. Part of the implementation of this requirement  is  for  the
agency to have centralised reconciliation and management of the  payment  of
transfer of funds from a nationally maintained database of beneficiaries.

The Social Assistance Bill, besides providing a  succinct  policy  statement
on the provision of grants with strict adherence to the principle  of  Batho
Pele, also introduces some key innovations, not the least  of  which  is  to
prescribe  minimum  norms  and  standards  for  the   delivery   of   social
assistance. We are particularly pleased that this  Bill  will  establish  an
inspectorate for social assistance so that this department will be  able  to
detect corrupt practices before they have a chance to take hold.

Our  interactions  in  the  provinces  have  indicated  that  the  issue  of
procuratorship  was  a  grey  area  which  the  moneylenders  and  the  like
exploited by declaring themselves eligible to collect pensions on behalf  of
beneficiaries. The new provision within the Social Assistance Bill  contains
a stringent set of guidelines that must be adhered to before  an  individual
can be declared  a  bona  fide  procurator.  This  is  yet  another  way  to
eliminate fraudulent practices.

Both the Social Assistance  Bill  and  the  South  African  Social  Security
Agency Bill, we believe, will endeavour to  ensure  that  we  eliminate  the
need for long queues, which often result in some pensioners dying in  queues
before they receive their  grants.  We  will,  hopefully,  also  reduce  the
unnecessarily long waiting period for people who  have  applied  for  grants
but have not yet received their grant payments. Hopefully, in  this  way  we
will ensure that the principles of Batho Pele become the blueprint  for  the
delivery of social grants.

The ANC supports both of these Bills. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Mnr die Voorsitter, Ministers en lede van  die  Huis,  die  NNP
glo  dat   Suid-Afrika   'n   doeltreffende   en   effektiewe   maatskaplike
welsynstelsel nodig het aangesien maatskaplike dienste in 'n land  soos  ons
s'n met sy grootskaalse  armoede  en  gebrek  aan  geleenthede  die  enigste
lewensaar is vir  baie.  Suid-Afrikaners  wat  dit  egter  kan  bekostig  om
voorsiening te maak vir hulle eie welsyn behoort aangemoedig te word om  dit
wel te doen.

Middeletoetse behoort ook aangepas te word  aangesien  die  huidige  stelsel
individue beperk tot die bestaansminimum ongeag  hulle  eie  pogings  om  'n
inkomste te verdien en hulle eie omstandighede  te  verbeter.  Sodoende  het
dit eintlik 'n onnodige uitwerking; die  presiese  teenoorgestelde  van  wat
nodig is om selfversorging aan te moedig.

Die NNP is ook van  mening  dat  die  vlak  van  maatskaplike  toelaes  goed
deurdink moet word om te verseker dat dit die gewenste  uitwerking  het.  In
gevalle  waar  toelaes  toegestaan  word  aan   groepe   buiten   bejaardes,
gestremdes en die jeug moet 'n toelaagstelsel  individue  nie  ontmoedig  om
werk te  soek  nie,  moet  dit  beskou  word  as  'n  tydelike  maatreël  om
definitiewe doelwitte binne  bepaalde  tydperke  te  bereik,  moet  dit  tot
voordeel van die ontvanger se huishouding gebruik word en moet  dit  op  die
lange duur bydra tot die vermindering  van  langtermyn-afhanklikes  van  die
fiskus.

Die maatskaplike samehang van gesinne  en  gemeenskappe  behoort  altyd  die
belangrikste oorweging te wees in 'n beleid oor  maatskaplike  ontwikkeling.
Nie net moet die maatskaplike behoeftes van kinders  aangespreek  word  deur
byvoorbeeld toegang tot  kindersorgtoelaes  te  vereenvoudig  en  deur  meer
aandag aan straatkinders  te  gee  nie,  maar  die  spesiale  behoeftes  van
bejaardes en gestremdes behoort ook meer prioriteitaandag te geniet.

Ons glo dat hierdie wetgewing weer eens  'n  poging  is  om  Suid-Afrika  'n
beter plek te maak om in te lewe - ek dink dit is wat die  DA  nie  verstaan
nie! - deur eerlik te wees  wanneer  ons  vind  dat  die  prosesse  van  die
Regering nie werk nie en dan dapper genoeg te wees om die nodige te doen  om
dit te korrigeer en die prosesse te verbeter. Ons  wil  ons  dank  uitspreek
teenoor almal wat bygedra het tot hierdie wetgewing om  'n  beter  lewe  vir
almal in Suid-Afrika te skep; 'n beter plek en 'n beter lewe.

Die NNP steun albei hierde wetsontwerpe. Dankie. [Applous.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Mr Chairman, Ministers  and  members  of  the  House,  the  NNP
believes that South Africa needs an efficient and effective  social  welfare
system since welfare services in a country such  as  ours  with  its  large-
scale poverty and lack of opportunities are the only fountain  of  life  for
many. However, South Africans who  can  afford  to  provide  for  their  own
welfare should be encouraged to do so.

Means  tests  should  also  be  adapted  since  the  present  system  limits
individuals to the subsistence level regardless  of  their  own  efforts  to
earn their own income and  improve  their  own  circumstances.  As  such  it
actually has an unnecessary result; the exact opposite of what is  necessary
to encourage self-sufficiency.

The NNP is also of the opinion that the level of  social  grants  should  be
well considered to ensure that they have the desired effect. In cases  where
grants are allocated to groups apart from the aged,  the  disabled  and  the
youth, a system of grants should not  discourage  individuals  from  looking
for work, should be regarded as a temporary measure to reach specific  goals
within specific periods, should be used to the benefit of the  household  of
the recipient and should contribute in the long term  to  the  reduction  of
long-term dependants on the fiscus.

The social cohesion of families and communities should always  be  the  most
important consideration in a policy on social development. Not  only  should
the social needs of children  be  addressed  by,  for  example,  simplifying
access to  child  care  grants  and  by  giving  more  attention  to  street
children, but the special needs of the aged and  the  disabled  should  also
receive more priority attention.

We believe that this legislation is once  again  an  effort  to  make  South
Africa a better place to live in - I think this is  what  the  DA  does  not
understand! - by being honest  when  we  find  that  the  processes  of  the
Government do not work and then being courageous enough to do the  necessary
to correct it and to improve the processes. We want to  express  our  thanks
to everyone who contributed to this legislation to create a better life  for
everyone in South Africa; a better place and a better life.

The NNP supports both these Bills. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, as the  ANC,  we  have
always understood that this Government's task is to  ensure  that  the  most
vulnerable are given access to whatever the state can provide  in  order  to
relieve them of the burden of poverty and hardship.

We have seen, in the last 10 years, that there has been a  concerted  effort
to widen the safety net over those who  need  help  the  most.  The  primary
manner in which  we  ensure  that  sufficient  attention  is  given  to  the
alleviation of social ills and the  alleviation  of  poverty  is  by  paying
close attention to social spending.

Thus far, every new budget has brought  about  either  an  increase  in  the
actual number of people that  have  been  taken  up  in  the  system  or  an
increase in the grant amount allocated  to  the  individual  recipient,  and
sometimes both.

Last year we saw poverty-stricken children being taken up in the  system  in
that the age for the child support grant was increased incrementally  to  14
years, over a three-year period. These increases in  the  budget  on  social
spending have not been insignificant amounts. By anyone's calculation,  even
the DA's, an increase from R10 billion  to  R34,8  billion  is  an  enormous
increase.

This is exactly what the Department of Social Development did  between  1994
and 2003  and,  still,  the  department's  budget  continues  to  grow.  The
department's latest budget, thanks  to  the  Minister  of  Finance's  Budget
Speech  on  Wednesday,  18  February  2004,  has   substantially   increased
provincial social grants and welfare spending to  R48  billion,  to  further
support this Government in its endeavours to  roll  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

I am sure that  our  grandparents  and  those  receiving  disability  grants
welcome the increase to R740, but once the money has been  allocated  it  is
imperative that provinces implement  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of
these services.

This select committee has,  in  the  past  and  especially  after  oversight
visits have been undertaken, emphasised  that  the  social  security  system
needs an overhaul in order to ensure that our country's  beneficiaries  have
access to their grants in a dignified and humane manner.

We have even, in terms of our last oversight report in 2003  which  outlined
the difficulties that the Eastern  Cape  experienced,  reiterated  that  the
most vulnerable people, the grant recipients,  need  to  be  protected  from
unscrupulous officials,  loan  sharks  and  other  shysters  out  there  who
attempt to con our communities out of their money.

We are, indeed, horrified  at  some  of  the  atrocious  practices  that  we
witnessed happening at grass-roots level, in  which  our  grandparents  were
robbed of their IDs and their pension cards, and threatened by all kinds  of
people converging on the pension payout points on payout day.

The Social Assistance and South African Social Security  Agency  Bills  have
been formulated in such a way that  they  bring  relief  with  regard  to  a
number of problems that have been  experienced  in  provinces  in  order  to
bring about the efficient roll-out of grant applications and grant  payouts.


After assessing some of the concerns that all stakeholders have voiced  over
the years, these two  Bills  seek  to  provide  for  the  social  assistance
function to shift from the  provincial  sphere  of  government  to  national
Government.

The Social Assistance  Bill,  in  particular,  seeks  to  create  norms  and
standards in the provision of services which will apply to  every  nook  and
cranny of this country. So, if a person applies  for  social  assistance  in
the Western Cape and  another  applies  in  Mpumalanga,  they  will  receive
exactly the same service and treatment.

The South African Social Security Agency Bill, on the other hand,  seeks  to
bring about a national agency that is  tasked  with  the  responsibility  of
administering all the grants in an efficient and humane  manner.  This  will
obviate  the  prevailing  situation  in  which  the  payment  of  grants  is
performed by various subcontractors engaged  by  different  provinces.  This
has resulted in an uneven  standard  of  service  delivery  and,  therefore,
inconsistencies in the administration of payments between provinces.

To emphasise what the chairperson alluded to earlier,  we  remain  concerned
that the administration of services for those children  who  have  begun  to
take on the responsibilities of adulthood before they are ready to do so  is
still lagging behind.

We argued quite extensively that their plight becomes  a  national  priority
and we see that these two Bills attempt  to  remedy  the  situation.  It  is
particularly heart-warming to see that a great  deal  of  thought  has  come
from provinces which experienced the needs of these child-headed  households
personally, and have  argued  vociferously  that  the  age  factor  for  the
receipt of grants be closely monitored.

Some have declared that, in their experience, children as young as eight  to
12 years have assumed the responsibility of parenting younger  siblings  and
should, therefore, qualify for a social grant.  Nonetheless,  the  age  that
the committee finally settled on was accepted as a good start in  addressing
the needs of this fast-growing, vulnerable sector of our population.

The ANC supports both the Social Assistance and  the  South  African  Social
Security Agency Bills with provincial amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Thank you, Madam Chair. I  think,  first
of all, I would like to thank the House for the way in which  it  has  dealt
with these Bills which, as far as the Government is concerned,  will  become
the cornerstone, basically, of our social security and social assistance  to
the most vulnerable members of our society. I fully understand the  concerns
that have been raised, but I might not necessarily agree with them.

The realities are quite clear. These Bills have been at  the  forefront  and
have been discussed for the past four years. In fact, the  Children's  Bill,
which is not here and which the lady was complaining about, has been  around
for the past seven years. Civil society as a whole has been part and  parcel
of that.

In fact, the four Bills have come together  as  a  package.  I  think,  with
these Bills, we were of the impression - and we still  continue  to  believe
this - that some of the ills that exist, basically, in our  society  and  in
our social security system could have been and must have been resolved to  a
certain extent, although not completely. As  such,  they  become  the  basis
around which the whole social and  comprehensive  social  security  of  this
country could begin from.

As such, I do agree with and support what the majority  of  this  House  has
been saying about them. Theirs is a cry that is coming  from  the  heart  of
the poorest of the poor. Many people have been complaining for such  a  long
time about the way in which the pensions and grants have  been  administered
in almost all provinces.

When we answer these issues, Mrs Gouws, we should  not,  hon  Gouws,  forget
where we come from, because in the final analysis the  question  of  pension
and social security in our Constitution is a national function  and  it  has
been a national function throughout. It was only changed as a compromise  in
1994-95 by the  Government  of  National  Unity,  led  by  former  President
Mandela, to accommodate the cries and concerns of  the  IFP  -  the  Inkatha
Freedom Party - and, to a certain extent, the NP  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  in
the Western Cape.

In view of the fact that we were then all  in  one  Government,  we  thought
that "Okay, if they are crying we'll give them something, and we did as  the
ANC give this to them to administer. I hope you note that. You can  ask  his
excellency, the Minister of Home Affairs; he knows that exactly. Mr  Ngubane
knows that exactly. They were part and parcel of the Government at the  time
of which I was part and parcel.

For the DA not to support that, I am not suprised personally. They  have  no
sympathy whatsoever for the poor of this country. [Applause.] To  them  they
are just something to use - just to give something to the  poor  natives  of
South Africa. They just want the vote of the  native  and  then  misuse  the
native. [Applause.]

So, in reality, they  have  no  feelings  whatsoever  for  our  people,  the
poorest of the poor. Nothing whatsoever. You can see  that  exactly  in  the
attitude of their leader towards their own people as such.  [Interjections.]
The way he behaves when he gets to Soweto - look at him on TV. Look at  Tony
Leon and you will see how he behaves when he comes to our communities.

So whatever she might be saying, I know it was not written by her.  She  was
told to do that. [Interjections.] [Applause.] I know we can quote  you,  and
I can tell you where the orders came from. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, order! Order, members!

The MINISTER OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  But  what  worries  me  most  is  the
position that has been taken by your ally, the IFP  -  the  Inkatha  Freedom
Party. I ask myself, ``Why?'' I thought when we came to Government and  took
the IFP with us that we stood together in order to  champion  the  cause  of
the poor. I thought so, and I am wondering whether  the  IFP  has  lost  its
soul to the DA in this process.

I really find it very hard to believe that the IFP here  can  come  and  say
that it  does  not  support  a  measure  that  is  going  to  alleviate  the
conditions of the poor in this country. I find  it  hard  to  believe  that.
[Interjections.] Who thinks for the IFP now?  Because  it  cannot  be  those
people, those children I find walking around Pietermaritzburg,  in  Richmond
and in the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal, fatherless and uncared  for.  It
cannot be. Surely, it can't be them? Surely, the IFP cannot be  voicing  the
feelings of traditional leaders when it comes here and says it does not ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, there is a point of order.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT:  Surely?  I  find  it  unacceptable  and
really unprincipled of the IFP.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, could you take your seat?
The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: I will.

Mr M J BHENGU: Ngiyabonga  Mhlalingaphambili.  Ngithi  angisho  mama  ukuthi
isifundazwe  ethe  ayiwufuni  lo  Mthethosivivinywa.  Hhayi  ukuthi   i-IFP,
bekuhlangene onke amaqembu. [Thank you,  hon  Chairperson.  Let  me  explain
that it is the province that rejects the Bill  and  not  the  IFP.  All  the
parties took the decision together.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is that  a  point  of  order?  Do  you  think
that's a point of order?

Mr M J BHENGU: [Inaudible.]

The  MINISTER  OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  ...  [Inaudible.]   The   ANC   ...
[Inaudible] ... in the province does support this fully, and the IFP  cannot
come and say it does not support ... I can even tell  you  why  the  IFP  is
refusing the agency. Do you want me to tell you? [Interjections.] I  can.  I
can. But, in the final analysis, I am saying that  I  am  surprised  at  the
position being taken by the IFP on this.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  Minister,  there  is  another  point  of
order.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Thank you, Chairperson. I am the  one  who  delivered  the
speech, and the speech I delivered on behalf of the KwaZulu-Natal  province,
which is in coalition with ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, could you take your  seat?  Could
you take your seat, hon member?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: ... [Inaudible.] He says that it's IFP, IFP, IFP.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mrs Vilakazi, that is not a point of order.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I delivered the speech here. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Mrs  Vilakazi!  [Interjections.]  Members,
order! [Interjections.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I'm speaking to the Chairperson, not you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: MmaVilakazi, take your seat. That  is  not  a
point of order. [Interjections.] Mrs  Vilakazi,  if  you  want  to  go  out,
please go out.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I am not going to go out. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Continue, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: In reality, I want  to  say  that  there
are thousands of people in KwaZulu-Natal who cannot  access  grants  at  the
present moment. The ANC, from 8 January, spent about  three  whole  days  on
this and the majority of  the  people  were  complaining,  basically,  about
their inability to access the grants that they were entitled to.

As a government and as  a  national  department  we  have  to  use  the  few
resources we have in order to reach out to those people, simply because  the
budget sits in Ulundi and the ordinary people cannot access it.  With  these
Bills that will not happen again. We will  be  able  to  say  to  uMaKhumalo
laphaya eRichmond [MaKhumalo in Richmond] - who said  that  she  is  68  and
can't get it, simply because akazwani nozibanibani [she  doesn't  get  along
with so and so] - "This is your constitutional right  and  nobody  can  stop
you from exercising your right." These Bills are meant to do that.

In the final analysis, I think this is a move we should have made ages  ago.
Basically, as I said, we bent the rules to accommodate the  IFP  in  1994-95
in order for them to be part and parcel of the government then.

I can say here that there are other reasons I can mention as to why the  IFP
is reluctant to support this Bill. The reasons given  here  really  hold  no
water whatsoever. I think the efficiency of the whole system will  basically
be enhanced through this agency. The national  Government  will  rightly  be
able to do what it ought to do to resolve the problems  of  the  poorest  of
the poor.

So I am very grateful to this House, basically, for the manner in  which  it
has handled these Bills. The process is about nothing but ensuring that  the
issue of grants and their distribution alleviate the poverty that exists  in
our country and gives power to the national Government to intervene as  much
as possible, without being forced to  stroke  the  egos  of  individuals  or
provinces. That is exactly what we want. I think that with this we  will  be
able to do that.

We hope that when we come back, if we do come back, we will be able to  pass
the two other Bills that are meant, Mrs Gouws, to look into the question  of
child-headed families. I'm sure you don't know about them, nor do  you  feel
for them. [Interjections.]  But  there  are  children  out  there  who  live
without mothers and fathers. With these Bills we are going to pass, we  mean
to assist them - and accelerate our ability to assist -  so  that  they  can
lead normal lives like any other South African. That we are going to  do  in
April, as quickly as possible. Thank you, Madam. [Applause.]

Debates concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the question  in  respect  of
the first Order ...

Ms L JACOBUS: Thank you, Chairperson. I did write you a note earlier  on.  I
just want clarity on this matter in  that  the  Bills  that  appear  on  our
monitors are not the Bills as we amended them. My assumption  is  that  when
we debate a Bill, we debate the Bill as it  is  amended,  and  that  is  the
version that should appear before us. I have scrolled through  both  of  the
Bills and they do not include the amendments. So  I  just  want  clarity  on
that. Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members and hon Jacobus, the  explanation
from the Table is that this is a section 76  Bill  and,  in  terms  of  that
section, the Bill has already been amended.  That  is  why  the  number  has
changed to Bill 51D. So it has incorporated the amendments. We are  actually
voting on Bill 51D, that is the amended version.

I shall now put the question in respect of the first Order of the Day -  the
South African Social Security Agency Bill. The question is that the Bill  be
agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes.  Are  all  delegation
heads present? Yes.  In  accordance  with  Rule  71,  I  shall  first  allow
provinces the opportunity to make their declarations of  vote,  if  they  so
wish.

Declaration of vote:

Ms B THOMSON: Thank you, Chair. I  happen  to  be  the  leader  of  the  KZN
delegation, but ... ngifuna ukukubeka nje kule  Ndlu  kucace  ukuthi,  yebo,
igunya esilinikwe yisifundazwe  elokuthi  singavumelani  ne-Social  Security
Agency Bill, kodwa kufanele kucace ukuthi  thina  njenge  ANC,  siyavumelana
noMthethosivivinywa. Kodwa-ke phela ngoba  sihlanganiswa  igunya  esilinikwe
yisifundazwe - ngisho ukuthi kuhle  kucace  futhi  kwazeke  ukuthi  ngempela
obani laba  abangafuni  ukuthi  siqhubeke  nokwenza  izimpilo  zabantu  zibe
ngcono. [I would like to express very clearly  that  our  mandate  from  the
province is that we do not support the South African Social Security  Agency
Bill, but I also want to say eloquently that  we  as  the  ANC  support  the
Bill. But, since we are bound by the mandate of the province I  want  it  to
be clear who these people are who oppose our  efforts  to  create  a  better
life for the people.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Thomson, I just want to remind  you  that
this is a section 76 Bill and therefore voting  is  done  in  terms  of  the
province, not in terms of the party. Even if  the  ANC  agrees  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, you are bound by the decision of the  province.  If  you  could  just
remember that. Thank you.

We shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in  favour  of,  or  against,  or  abstain  from
voting. Eastern Cape?

yabantu bakowethu. Enkosi. [Hon Chairperson, the Eastern Cape supports  both
Bills because they are going to improve  the  lives  of  our  people.  Thank
you.]

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
     AFFAIRS - EXCLUSION OF LAND FROM AUGRABIES WATERFALL NATIONAL PARK

Mnr M A SULLIMAN: Agb Voorsitter, die  Riemvasmaak-gemeenskap  het  'n  ryk,
maar hartseer geskiedenis. Die inwoners het  bestaan  uit  verskeie  etniese
groepe waaronder Xhosas, Namas en die sogenaamde  kleurlinge  wat  vreedsaam
saamgewoon het onder die leiding van die Nama-hoofman  ...  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A SULLIMAN: Hon Chairperson, the Riemvasmaak  community  has  a  rich,
but sad history. The residents consisted of  various  ethnic  groups,  among
which Xhosas, Namas and the so-called coloured people,  who  lived  together
in harmony under the leadership of the Nama chief ...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Sulliman, can you  just  hold  on.
Can we allow the audience in the gallery to leave quietly, please?

Mnr M A SULLIMAN: Dankie, Voorsitter.

Die Riemvasmaak-gemeenskap  het  'n  ryk,  maar  hartseer  geskiedenis.  Die
inwoners het bestaan uit verskeie etniese groepe waaronder Xhosas, Namas  en
die sogenaamde kleurlinge wat vreedsaam saamgewoon  het  onder  leiding  van
die  Nama-hoofman  en  verteenwoordigers  van   die   verskillende   groepe.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Gedurende 1973-74 is die destydse inwoners ingevolge die vorige regering  se
apartheidsbeleid verskuif na Namibië en die Oos-Kaap.  Die  SA  Weermag  het
Riemvasmaak vanaf  1973  tot  met  die  oorgang  na  die  nuwe  demokratiese
regering in 1994 as 'n opleidingsterrein gebruik.  SA  Nasionale  Parke  het
ook 'n deel van  die  gebied,  bekend  as  Melkbosrand,  by  die  Augrabies-
waterval  Nasionale  Park  ingelyf.  Hierdie  4 000  ha  is   aangewend   as
teelgebied vir die Namibiese swartrenoster.

Gedurende 1993 het pogings begin om die Riemvasmakers terug te kry op  hulle
grond. In Februarie 1994 is besluit om die volle 74 000  ha  grond  aan  die
Riemvasmakers terug te gee. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mnr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you, Chairperson.

The Riemvasmaak community  has  a  rich,  but  sad  history.  The  residents
consisted of various ethnic groups, among which Xhosas, Namas  and  the  so-
called coloured people, who lived together in harmony under  the  leadership
of  the  Nama   chief   and   representatives   of   the   various   groups.
[Interjections.]

During 1973-74 the residents at the time  were  moved  to  Namibia  and  the
Eastern Cape in terms of the previous government's apartheid policy. The  SA
Defence Force used Riemvasmaak as a  training  area  from  1973  up  to  the
transition to the new democratic Government in 1994. SA National Parks  also
incorporated a part of the area, known as Melkbosrand,  unto  the  Augrabies
Waterfall National Park. This 4 000 ha was used as a breeding area  for  the
Namibian black rhinoceros.

During 1993 efforts were embarked on to  bring  the  people  of  Riemvasmaak
back to their land. In February 1994 it was decided to give the full  74 000
ha back to the people of Riemvasmaak.]

Chair, people are making a terrible noise here in the benches.

Die Riemvasmaak-projek was een van die eerste grondherstelprojekte en is  as
'n presidensiële loodsprojek geregistreer. Dit het as sodanig  'n  baie  hoë
politieke profiel gehad. Teen die einde van 1994 en deur die loop  van  1995
het die meeste Riemvasmakers na hulle grond teruggekeer.

Sowat twee derdes van die Riemvasmakers is Namas wat  by  die  sendingstasie
woon, terwyl die Xhosas meesal  by  die  nedersetting  in  die  Vredesvallei
langs die Oranjerivier woon. In 2002 kry die mense van Riemvasmaak kaart  en
transport vir hulle woonerwe -  waarlik  'n  mylpaal  nadat  hulle  so  lank
grondloos was. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Riemvasmaak project was one of the first land reform projects  and  was
registered as a presidential pilot project. As  such  it  had  a  very  high
political profile. By the end of 1994 and during 1995 most of the people  of
Riemvasmaak had returned to their land.

Approximately two thirds of the people of Riemvasmaak are  Namas  living  at
the mission station, while the Xhosas are mostly living  at  the  settlement
in Vredesvallei on the Orange River. In 2002  the  people  from  Riemvasmaak
got tenure to their plots - truly a milestone after they had  been  landless
for so long.]

The board of SA National Parks decided at its meeting in September  1998  to
recommend that the remainder of farm 498 Melkbosrand be  excluded  from  the
Augrabies Waterfall National Park so that ownership of the community can  be
restored unconditionally, whereafter they can consider  the  future  options
of the land. It should also be  taken  into  account  that  Riemvasmaak  had
already built chalets for tourists and had established some 4x4 trails,  and
new farming and mining initiatives had been undertaken to provide  jobs  for
the community.

It should also be noted that there is already a grape producing  project  in
the area for poverty relief,  and  currently  roads  are  being  constructed
whilst the electricity and water supply  is  being  upgraded.  Allow  me  to
quote from our charter:


  We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world
  to know: that South Africa belongs to all  who  live  in  it,  black  and
  white, and that no government can justly claim  authority  unless  it  is
  based on the will of all the people; that our people have been robbed  of
  their birthright to land, liberty and  peace  by  a  form  of  government
  founded on injustice and inequality ... the land shall  be  shared  among
  those who work it!

In conclusion, I would like to recommend in terms of  section  2(3)  of  the
National Parks Act,  Act  57  of  1976,  that  the  remainder  of  farm  498
Melkbosrand, in extent 4137 ha, be excluded  from  the  Augrabies  Waterfall
National Park by resolution of Parliament. I  so  move.  Thank  you,  Chair.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The  question
is that the report be adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain  whether  delegation
heads are present in the Chamber to pass their provinces'  votes.  They  are
all present. In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first  allow  provinces  an
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  We  shall
now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do  so  in  alphabetical

Constitution.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE ON IMPROVEMENT OF
   QUALITY OF LIFE AND STATUS OF WOMEN - UNIFEM REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT
                 EXPERTS' ASSESSMENT ON WOMEN, WAR AND PEACE

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, the issue  of  women's  participation  in  peace
processes has been neglected for far too long. Through our silence  many  of
us have indirectly contributed to  the  continued  suffering  of  women  and
children  caught  in  the  middle  of  vicious  interstate  and   intrastate
conflicts.

Our own continent, Africa, has seen 14 conflicts since the adoption  of  the
Beijing Platform For Action in 1995. According to the  United  Nations  High
Commissioner for Refugees, the number of displaced persons in  Africa  as  a
result of these conflicts is approximately 8 million, of which  70%  to  80%
are women and children.

These women and children have  suffered  the  most  flagrant  violations  of
their persons and bodies. According to a 2002 UNIFEM report  on  women,  war
and peace,  94%  of  displaced  households  surveyed  in  Sierra  Leone  had
experienced sexual assault including rape, torture and sexual slavery.

It also acknowledges widespread sexual violence in the  ongoing  hostilities
in Algeria,  Myanmar,  Southern  Sudan  and  Uganda.  Some  of  the  horrors
described in the report include wombs punctured with guns, women  raped  and
tortured in front of their husbands and children, rifles forced  into  their
vaginas, pregnant women beaten to induce miscarriages, fetuses  ripped  from
wombs, and women kidnapped, blindfolded and beaten on their way to  work  or
school.

However, the extreme violence that women suffer  during  conflict  does  not
arise solely out of the conditions of war. It is  directly  related  to  the
violence that exists in women's lives during peacetime.

Throughout the world, women experience violence because they are  women  and
often because they do not have the same rights or autonomy  that  men  have.
They  are  subjected  to  gender-based   persecution,   discrimination   and
oppression, including sexual violence and slavery.

Without political rights or authority, they often have  few  resources.  The
horrors  inflicted  on  women  in  conflict  situations  has  prompted   the
international community to once again assess its response to this issue.

The report of the expert group on peace agreements as a means  of  promoting
gender  equality  and  ensuring  participation  -  a  framework  for   model
provisions - is part of this process  of  evaluating  our  response  to  the
suffering experienced by women in conflict resolution.

It follows on the October 2000 resolution  adopted  by  the  United  Nations
Security Council which provides a political framework to strengthen  women's
participation in peace, in negotiations and  in  reconstructing  their  war-
torn societies.

Why is it so important for women  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the  peace
process? The most  obvious  reason  is  that  women  suffer  the  impact  of
conflict disproportionately. If they are excluded from  the  peace  process,
the provision of amnesty or impunity in peace agreements  may  lead  to  the
exclusion of crimes against  women,  such  as  rape,  from  future  criminal
prosecution and punishment.

Furthermore, the limited range of issues covered in  peace  agreements,  and
which are  based  primarily  on  male  experiences  of  conflict  and  their
expectations for conflict resolution,  could  result  in  the  exclusion  of
women's physical, legal, political and  economic  security  concerns,  which
will  be  a  setback  for  the  promotion  of  gender  equality  during  the
reconstruction period.

However, there is  another  important  reason  why  women  are  the  key  to
conflict resolution. Women's groups and networks at grass-roots  level  have
provided many strategies for effective conflict prevention and  have  worked
tirelessly and courageously in preserving  social  order  in  the  midst  of
chaos.

The women of Somalia played a critical role in brokering peace in  Mogadishu
in 1998. When the city was besieged by opposing militia  groups,  the  women
negotiated a ceasefire to allow men, women and children to  go  about  their
daily lives. In a similar display of iron will in 2002,  the  women  of  the
DRC barricaded their menfolk inside the Inter-Congolese dialogue  venue  and
demanded that they not leave the venue  until  they  had  signed  the  peace
agreement.

While we have to  be  frank  and  admit  that  progress  has  been  slow  in
engendering peace processes, there are  positive  signs  that  international
organisations and national  governments  are  taking  the  participation  of
women in peace processes seriously.

This report from the expert group is, in itself, an important  milestone  in
that it promotes awareness of the need for women to  be  involved  in  peace
processes and creates a sense of urgency to address this issue.

There  are  also  some  good  examples  of  instances  in   which   national
governments have included women in  peace  processes.  In  Burundi,  women's
participation in the peace process increased dramatically during the  Arusha
negotiations which began in 1999. Burundian women presented  recommendations
for peace and reconciliation to former President Nelson Mandela who took  up
a mediation role in the conflict.

Nineteen of these recommendations were included in the final  peace  accord,
giving recognition to the centrality of  women's  rights  and  opportunities
for democracy, governance and reconstruction.

Another excellent example of the engendering of the  peace  process  can  be
found in Sri Lanka where one of the most significant developments  has  been
the  establishment  of  a  subcommittee  on  gender  to  secure  the  active
participation  of  women  and  to  incorporate  women's  concerns  into  all
structures, mechanisms and activities of the peace process.

From a South African perspective, we fully endorse the right of women to  be
included  in  peace  processes.  Our  own  transition  to  democracy   bears
testimony  to  the  crucial  role  women  played  during  the  struggle  for
liberation and in the negotiation process.

As a member of the African Union we have also adopted the  Protocol  to  the
African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights  on  the  Rights  of  Women  in
Africa. This development is indicative of the African Union's commitment  to
the advancement of gender equality and the  recognition  of  the  role  that
women play in conflict resolution.

We must applaud the adoption of the protocol and other  achievements  gained
by women's groups in placing women's issues  squarely  on  the  African  and
international peace and security agendas.

It is imperative that we continue  to  support  national  and  international
efforts to promote greater participation of  women  in  the  peace  process.
There can be no sustainable peace without their  participation.  Women  need
peace and peace needs women. We cannot deny the crucial  role  of  women  in
bringing about sustainable peace. We therefore support  the  recommendations
that have been made by the expert group and call  upon  the  United  Nations
and national governments to translate  them  into  practical  realities  for
women. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The  question

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

           CONSIDERATION OF THIRD REPORT OF JOINT BUDGET COMMITTEE

Ms B THOMSON: Thank you, Chairperson. The third report of the committee,  as
you may remember, was published in the ATC on Wednesday, 26  November  2003.
The report deals with national department expenditure trends extending  over
the period July to September 2003. In addition, the expenditure patterns  of
the nine provinces for the same period, that is the second  quarter  of  the
financial year ending March 2004, are elaborated on.

With reference to the national departments, the Joint Budget  Committee  has
discovered  that  the  Department  of  Education  gradually  decreased   its
expenditure in the second quarter. Its average expenditure  level,  however,
will remain high because it continued to disburse subsidies to  institutions
of higher learning until November 2003.
It should be noted that the Departments of  Social  Development  and  Public
Enterprises had fluctuating expenditure levels during  this  quarter.  These
two departments recorded high expenditure levels during the first  month  of
the quarter in July, drastically lower expenditure  levels  in  August,  and
then increased expenditure levels again in September.

The Department of Social Development, however, explained  to  the  committee
that in the first quarter the trend of spending is higher in certain  months
and will be evident when the department  disburses  funds  for  its  special
allocations. The  expenditure  of  the  Department  of  Public  Enterprises,
however, is more prominent. It spent almost a quarter of its  budget  within
one month, that is September 2003. This has led to  a  drastic  increase  in
the overall spending of the department, which was almost 65% of  its  budget
at the end of the second quarter.

The  department  has,  however,  explained  how  the  apparent  overspending
occurred. It is as a result of the creation of  two  trusts  to  manage  and
direct the acquisition of shares.  These  shares  are  owned  by  previously
disadvantaged people. The shares were acquired at the time  of  the  listing
of Telkom early this year. The lifespan of  these  trusts  is  three  years.
These trusts have been budgeted for in  the  department's  MTEF  budget.  In
August 2003 the National Treasury  approved  the  departmental  transfer  of
R8,342 million in terms of the amount required  to  fund  the  trusts.  This
amount was paid in September  2003.  It  explains  the  seemingly  excessive
spending by the Department of Public Enterprises.

Just  as  in  the  first  quarter,  the  Departments  of  Education,  Public
Enterprises and Defence and Parliament continue to be  the  major  spenders.
On the other hand, the Departments of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Communications
continue to be the lower spenders, just as in the  first  quarter.  The  two
departments have spent less than 30% of their budgets. Both the  Departments
of Foreign Affairs and of Communications were also the  lowest  spenders  in
the first quarter. The Departments of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Communications
had spent less than 3% of their budgets at the end of that quarter.

The Department of  Communications  has  constantly  underspent  during  both
quarters. The Department of Foreign  Affairs  has  explained  that  the  low
expenditure is caused by the fact that most of its expenditure  takes  place
abroad. Very often there is a time lapse of two to three months between  the
time of the expenditure abroad and financial reporting of  that  expenditure
made here at home.

With regard to provincial spending, the average for provincial spending  was
less than 22% in the first quarter. This average spending is now  less  than
26% in the second quarter. Provinces had spent an overall average of 47%  of
their annual budgets by the end of the second  quarter.  The  Western  Cape,
Limpopo and the North West are the only  three  provinces  that  spent  less
than 25% of  their  budgets  in  the  current  quarterly  review.  There  is
therefore only marginal underspending by provinces.

Provinces continue to underspend on their capital budgets,  but  spend  well
within their current budgets. The exception is the Eastern Cape,  which  has
spent a sizeable portion of its capital budget. The  North  West,  the  Free
State and Gauteng continue to be the low spenders of their capital  budgets.
Each of these provinces spent less than 30% of their capital budgets. It  is
encouraging to report that the overall expenditure  of  both  the  provinces
and the  national  departments  is  satisfactory,  especially  in  terms  of
current expenditure.

Both the national and provincial spheres of government, however,  underspent
on their capital budgets. The Joint Budget Committee  promises  to  continue
its investigation, or oversight role,  and  will  report  to  members  on  a
quarterly basis. Members will be kept informed of further developments  that
may arise from the third report.

With these few comments, I wish you all the best in  the  election  process.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Thomson, I am sure that the  report  does
not contain what you are  doing  with  regard  to  it.  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  report  be
adopted. As this is dealt with in terms of section 65, we shall now  proceed
to voting. In accordance with Rule 71, I  shall  first  allow  provinces  an
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  We  shall
now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do  so  in  alphabetical

in favour of or against, or abstain. Eastern Cape?
