FRIDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 2004
                                    ____

                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The House met at 09:02.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers and meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

                               QUORUM REQUIRED

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before I proceed with the business  of  the
House, I wish to alert you to the fact  that  a  quorum  will  be  needed  -
unless Whips are arranging for their members to return on Monday, would  you
kindly ensure that. I am going to call for a quorum  that  all  members  are
here. The Appropriation Bill is much too important to  just  decide  without
the presence of members in the House.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

          (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee thereon)

There was no debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:

  That the Report be adopted.

The SPEAKER: The Report will be adopted  when  there  is  a  quorum  in  the
House.

Decision of Question postponed.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, after a decade of ANC Government,  I  and  many
others who will  come  after  me  to  this  podium,  come  in  the  absolute
confidence that the management of the South African economy has  never  ever
been in better hands in the history of this country, than it is now  in  the
hands of the ANC. [Applause.] The soundness of our economic  indicators  are
proud testimony - and I say a proud testimony- to  this  fact:  Historically
low interest rates, low  inflation,  low  budget  deficits,  ever  and  ever
decreasing public debts, steady economic growth.

Given the  shambles  of  our  economy  that  we  inherited  years  ago,  our
achievements, to quote one commentator in the  Business Day yesterday,  have
left hardnosed bankers, financiers and asset managers  in  the  US,  Europe,
Asia and Latin America, rubbing their skeptical eyes in  disbelief.  Indeed,
through the sound management of this economy, we have achieved miracles.

These achievements did not come easily. As we all know and as we  were  told
repeatedly how decisions had to be made, much as we would  have  wanted,  we
could not spend freely, to redress the historical imbalances and  injustices
of the past. The huge weight of  apartheid  debt,  the  devastation  of  the
economy lay like a heavy albatross around our necks. Much as  we  wanted  to
move to a brighter future, we could not escape the reality of the  past  and
of an international globalising environment.

Much as we wanted to move and provide health  facilities,  jobs,  education,
water and sanitation, electricity to our people, we were constrained by  the
harsh realities in which we came to Government. We live in  a  society  now,
where more people than ever before have access to health, education,  water,
sanitation, electricity and telephones. This bears  testimony  to  the  fact
that we are indeed enjoying the first fruits of democracy bestowed  upon  us
by the peace and the very careful management of our economy.

We live in a society so rich in its history and  diversity,  its  people  so
resilient and energetic, where public discourse is so vigorous  and  robust.
We have a civil society that is alive, well and active; a society  in  which
so many South Africans  are  freely  developing  their  new  identities  and
proudly so. This bears  testimony  to  the  fact  that,  ours  indeed  is  a
wonderfully vibrant and flourishing democracy.

I have become a talk show junky. When I am driving in my car I  love  tuning
in and listening to what ordinary South Africans are saying.  I  love  going
to the imbizos and hearing what  South  Africans  are  saying.  What  really
strikes me, in our society, is just how implacably  people  feel  that  they
have the right to express their opinions, and my,  the  range  of  opinions,
thoughts and attitudes that pertain in our  society  is  a  wonder.  We  are
growing in ways that we never ever thought we would, even within  the  first
ten years of democracy. It is one thing to say: meet the basic needs of  the
people. It is another thing to say: listen to what people  are  saying.  Let
people's voices be heard. And my, the voices of  South  Africans  are  heard
every day - so loudly and clearly.

I love the fact the we can no longer look at a person and  find  that,  from
the way that person dresses or appears before us, we can deduce  what  their
politics are. We have South Africans who,  ten  years  ago,  we  would  have
thought would never be committed to a new South  Africa.  We  see  them  now
coming to the fore, strong, willing, putting their shoulders  to  the  wheel
and growing this country. It is indeed a marvel.

And the basis of this new flourishing democracy has  been  achieved  by  the
strong economic fundamentals on which this  democracy  is  based.  Democracy
cannot flourish when the economy is declining  and  is  on  the  rocks.  The
economy which we have  created  is  one  which  is  not  only  progressively
providing better and better services to all of  our  people  -  better  work
opportunities - but it is also providing the bedrock for good democracy.

But, as the Minister reminded us, this is not the end of the road.  We  have
come a long way and set a course to a new South Africa.  We  have  set  that
course. But we have a long way to go. Many  people  are  still  without  the
basic services, the economic growth which is still not  yet  what  we  would
want it to be. The high unemployment rate still says to us that  we  have  a
long way to go. It is for this reason that I would  like  to  focus  on  two
aspects of this Budget, which clearly define the way in which  we  would  be
going in the next ten years.

One, is a rollout on the infrastructural programme. There has  been  a  call
for this Government to provide a comprehensive social security  net.  And  I
am sure that this Government is very sensitive, as I am, to  such  a  cause.
The levels of poverty mean that it would be wonderful if  we  could  improve
the social security net. But simply giving a once-off welfare  grant,  helps
the person who receives it, but does not build a basis for  that  person  to
improve his or her condition. It is simply  an  elastoplast  that  helps  to
cover a particular wound.

By investing in infrastructure, making sure that  local  municipalities  are
going  to  build  water  and  sanitation  works,  pavements,  roads,  energy
networks, and by using as many people as possible in that  local  community,
via labour intensive methods, it means that we  are  able  to  provide  work
opportunities to  people,  at  the  same  time  as  improving  their  living
conditions. And that, surely, is a  step  better  than  simply  providing  a
welfare grant. It is saying: Let us, in one measure,  kill  two  birds  with
one stone. Let  us  put  money  in  your  pocket  and  improve  your  living
conditions. That is why we are placing  such  an  emphasis  on  an  Expanded
Public Works Programme.

As we have said continuously, Government cannot create jobs, but it can  use
mechanisms at its disposal to improve conditions of the  economy  and  those
under which ordinary people live. So, with regard  to  the  Expanded  Public
Works Programme, as one goes through the Division of Revenue Bill, it  is  a
comprehensive programme aimed at the provincial  and  municipal  governments
in particular and their capacity to roll out  on  that  programme.  We  have
seen significant improvements in that regard. We look forward  to  the  fact
that we will be seeing major improvements in  the  communities  and  to  the
economy.

But the infrastructure  programme  also  stands  on  building  the  economic
infrastructure  needed  to  expand  this  programme.  And   for   that   the
parastatals are going to be critical to the rollout of new ports,  railways,
all the economic and IT structures that we need for this economy to grow.

This is the path that we  are  choosing.  We  are  not  choosing  a  clearly
popular path of just saying, throw money to the people and  that  will  then
encourage economic growth. We are going beyond that. We are  saying,  engage
the people and put  money  in  their  pockets.  But  engage  the  people  in
building this country and in that way they will get skills and grow.

In the same way, we  are  concentrating  on  human  resources.  One  of  the
biggest steps has been human resources and lack of skills necessary to  grow
the economy. In the next ten years,  the  concentration  on  human  resource
development will be unrelenting.

I know that there are those amongst us who feel that we have failed  in  our
task of providing job opportunities, that we didn't  privatise  fast  enough
and that our labour markets are inflexible.  Those  matters  simply  do  not
address the issues  which  we  are  facing  at  the  moment.  Labour  market
infexibility is a myth. The IMF has already  said  that  we  stand  19th  in
labour flexibility out of 133 countries. No one  can  tell  us  that  labour
inflexibility is central to our economy not being able to grow.  [Applause.]
Let us not forget that we are committed to creating a just society.  Let  us
not forget that there are people  who  leave  major  corporations  with  R38
million payouts.

We expect workers to work at salaries of R1 000, R2 000 and R3 000, that  we
as parliamentarians can't live on as pensioners. But we say  to  them:  Live
on that, and make sure that we can fire  you  far  quicker.  It  is  grossly
inhuman and  insensitive  to  our  people  to  believe  that  labour  market
inflexibility is what is causing our economy not to grow. I would  say  that
it is the opposite. Decent wages and  a  decent,  safe  working  environment
will cause our economy to grow.

Secondly, to say we haven't privatised fast enough.  My  goodness!  When  we
are now assembling the forces of our parastatals to roll out in a  big  way,
to develop the economy of our country, how can  we  say  that  privatisation
has been the answer? How can we say, when we  look  at  British  Rail,  that
privatisation is the answer? We have to harness all  the  forces  of  public
utilities at our disposal to grow this economy.

There are those who will always look at half a glass of water and  say  that
it is half empty. There are those of us who will  say  this  half  glass  of
water in South Africa is  half  full.  We  are  filling  this  country  with
democracy. We are bestowing growth on this  country  and  in  the  next  ten
years, we will make sure that we meet our contract with our  people,  as  we
have done in the last ten years. And  I  am  proud  to  say  that.  The  ANC
supports this Appropriation Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker,  hon  Minister,  colleagues,  famous  American
magnate John D Rockerfeller once said: ``If you want to succeed, you  should
strike out on new paths, rather than  travel  the  worn  paths  of  accepted
success.''

In the 2004-05 Budget, Minister Manuel, you opted to strike  out  on  a  new
path, a path of mild  fiscal  expansion  -  mild  fiscal  expansion  because
despite a deficit projection of 3,1% in 2004-05, you gave the market a  very
clear  signal  that  you  would  not  jeopardise  South  Africa's   hard-won
reputation for sound fiscal policies by projecting a  lower  budget  deficit
for 2005-06, of 2,8%.

This brave step will ensure that the  kudos  earned  for  fiscal  discipline
will not be lost. Having done this on the  eve  of  an  election,  when  the
temptation  for  profligate  public  spending  will  always  be   upon   any
government of any political persuasion is indeed  commendable  and  must  be
lauded.
In his online newsletter, ANC Today, the President writes as follows, and  I
quote:


  The Budget is not merely an annual  record  of  revenue  and  expenditure
  figures  decided  by  the  Government,  it   represents   the   financial
  interventions by the democratic state to give effect to the dialectically
  interconnected processes of  revolution  and  reform.  In  reality,  each
  annual Budget is a programme and instrument of reform.

Unfortunately for the President and indeed  for  the  Minister  of  Finance,
factors that have hampered  South  Africa's  economic  prospects  have  more
often smacked of revolutionary rhetoric to appease political  partners  than
substantive reform. Unfortunately for the President and for the Minister  of
Finance, too many successive annual Budgets have  failed  to  be  convincing
instruments of reform, culminating in the unemployment  and  poverty  crisis
facing South Africa today.

In your Budget  Speech,  Minister,  you  stated  that  the  Budget  must  be
measured in  its  impact  on  the  lived  experience  of  people,  families,
organisations and businesses. It is in this respect that the lack of  vision
lodged at the heart of this Budget is most worrying. This is the  reason  it
has been criticised for failing  to  be  bold  when  South  Africa  deserves
higher rates of growth to create jobs.

Your own speech concedes this point, and I quote: ``But  we  recognise  that
the pace of economic growth has  to  be  accelerated.''  But  where  is  the
visionary detail in this speech of how these higher levels  of  growth  will
be achieved? What are the modalities and courageous policy  moves  that  you
undertake and will undertake for higher growth? In short, where is the  game
plan for higher economic growth, Minister Manuel, for it is  definitely  not
contained in this Budget. You stated that ... [Interjections.] Mr  Pahad,  I
would rather answer the  questions  on  Iraq  if  I  were  you,  instead  of
interjecting. [Applause.]
You say that, and I quote: ``We can celebrate the  many  ways  in  which  we
have pushed back the tide of poverty.'' This statement is  made  but  cannot
be defended when the FFC's submissions  on  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill
clearly show an increase in poverty levels,  directly  attributable  to  the
unemployment crisis, and  indeed  highlight  increased  pressure  on  social
grant take-up rates, not only by virtue of the new  roll-out  of  the  child
support grant, but by virtue of unemployment and  poverty.  Surely  this  is
not the type of impact budgets should  be  applauded  for:  growing  welfare
spending and low jobless growth.

Madam Speaker, there is an ominous sense of  complacency  and  arrogance  in
the ANC-led Government. This complacency was reflected  in  the  President's
statement during the opening of Parliament, that there was no need  for  new
policy initiatives, and  that  only  implementation  was  lacking;  a  clear
mischaracterisation   pertaining   to   challenges   facing   our   society.
[Interjections.] Minister, you were already instructed  once  this  week  to
withdraw a statement. I think you should refrain from interjecting.

This complacency was again present when the Budget failed to deliver a  bold
vision for growth and job creation. Minister, this  Budget  delivers  words,
not deeds, on job creation, despite the Expanded Public Works Programme.  It
delivers too little,  too  late,  in  the  fight  against  crime.  While  it
delivers big money  on  combating  HIV/Aids,  it  cannot  deliver  political
commitment, which continues to be the missing key ingredient,  with  53  000
patients for the roll-out targeted for March already set to be missed  as  a
target.

On poverty alleviation and social security, this  Budget  fails  to  deliver
any BIG, and yes, this means Basic Income Grant, idea or a clear  vision  of
affordable social security in  the  midst  of  an  aggravated  incidence  of
poverty owing to a 31,2% unemployment rate.

This  Budget  fails  to  address  unemployment  and  youth  unemployment  in
particular. The  announcement  of  a  R3,2  billion  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme, over the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  period  will  only
create  low-skills-level  jobs  that  are  not  sustainable,  even  if  they
continue in terms of operation and maintenance of infrastructure.

This will not dent unemployment queues or crushes, such as  the  recent  one
in Durban, nor will  it  alleviate  poverty.  This  is  the  single  biggest
failure of this Budget: that growth rates of 2,9%, 3,6% and 4,1% are  simply
not high enough to counter poverty and arrest the jobs crisis. South  Africa
deserves bold ideas, bold growth and a bold consensus vision to address  the
31,2% unemployment rate and the levelling off of any jobs growth in 2003.

The DA believes that South Africa deserves an  alternative  vision  for  our
society expressed in different  spending  and  revenue  raising  priorities.
That is the reason we  produced  a  comprehensive  alternative  budget  that
focused on  higher  savings  and  investments  for  growth  and  jobs  as  a
priority, spending on HIV/Aids, the fight against crime and  addressing  the
skills deficit in our society as critical priority areas;  and  may  I  add,
addressing the skills crisis in our society in a  more  efficient  way  than
the SETA system is currently doing.

We are pleased to see that there are at  least  three  areas  in  which  the
Minister has agreed with our alternative proposals:  the  prioritisation  of
investment and savings, and the exemptions  from  tax  on  interest;  making
broad-based empowerment the focus and feasible through  targeted  employment
equity  participation,  with  a  favourable  tax  dispensation   to   match;
broadening home ownership through the abolition of stamp duties, which  will
contribute to enhancing and growing the pool  of  home  ownership  in  South
Africa.

This Budget is not a boring bean-counting exercise. It is  fundamentally  an
expression of Government's macroeconomic policies. [Interjections.]  And  to
those in the back who interject and say that  I  do  not  care  about  South
Africa, this is my home  as  much  as  it  is  yours,  and  I  care.  It  is
fundamentally an expression of Government's macroeconomic policies.

In assessing the Budget the DA, therefore, looks beyond the  Budget  figures
as such, and looks  at  the  cornerstones  of  the  economic  policies  that
underpin it.

It was interesting to know  that  the  chair  of  the  committee  was  quite
offensive on labour market reform and on privatisation. While the  chair  of
the committee  is  correct  to  raise  concerns  about  energy  failures  in
California and  in  the  United  States  recently,  as  well  as  about  the
experience of railtrack in the United Kingdom,  this,  unfortunately,  is  a
fact that has to be taken into consideration only when you are dealing  with
an  integrated  network,  which  is  the  case  with  both   railtrack   and
electricity growth. So the debate is slightly different  from  what  it  has
been characterised.

The cracks in the macroeconomic edifice of Government  policy  are  starting
to show: paltry levels of savings and investment, with only R2,6 billion  in
foreign direct investments flowing in in the first three quarters  of  2003;
delays in privatisation that  not  only  impact  negatively  on  the  public
sector borrowing requirement, but also make us  uncompetitive  in  terms  of
our costs for telephony services, transport and energy; deregulation in  the
labour and output markets in the public and private  sectors;  uncompetitive
corporate tax rates and increased utilisation of foreign  exchange  controls
as a policy tool to facilitate  inward  investment  in  Africa,  instead  of
committing to a clear timetable for dismantling  in  a  gradual  phase;  the
impact of quiet diplomacy on Zimbabwe's rapidly  deteriorating  economy  and
the contagion, in fact,  this  has  if  one's  first  and  foremost  trading
partner in the region is facing economic collapse and a 100% inflation  rate
- 1 000%, in fact, way over a 100%  inflation  rate;  the  ineffective  SETA
training which is not producing the  skills  the  economy  needs,  where  it
produces skills at all.

While the South African economy is subject to the  vagaries  in  the  global
economy that hamper  progress  to  a  higher  growth  path,  especially  the
volatility of the rand, and the overall  levels  of  volatility  in  foreign
exchange  markets  noted  recently  by  the  G-7  Finance  Ministers  in   a
declaration, the DA fundamentally believes that there  are  economic  policy
levers under the control of the  ANC-led  Government  that  are  simply  not
being utilised owing to ideological considerations.

This Budget has vividly provided  examples  of  the  consequences  of  these
actions, for example the public sector  borrowing  requirement  shooting  up
from R7 billion to R34 billion, with R7 billion of this contributed  by  the
absence of the proceeds of privatisation. Minister, as I  indicated  to  you
in the committee meeting, the targets for privatisation are not  being  laid
down by the opposition, they were  laid  down  by  the  Minister  of  Public
Enterprises himself and he has failed for two years in a row  to  reach  his
own target. You can no longer be silent on this matter when you look at  the
consequences this has for the public sector borrowing requirement.

While we can play smoke and mirrors  with  the  ideological  debate  on  the
shifting line between the public  and  private  provision  in  nearly  every
aspect of public sector service provision, the figures are simply  startling
and they are  starting  to  speak  for  themselves.  Whether  it  is  in  SA
Airways's  R7  billion  hedging  loss  liability,  which  is  a   contingent
liability,  or  whether  it  is  in  the  minimal  capital   investment   by
parastatals, the writing is simply on the wall on this matter.

The then DP and its current successor the DA, have expressed many  of  these
concerns  in  the  policy  debate  around  the  growth  and  employment  and
redistribution strategy in the past 10 years of our  democracy,  since  1996
indeed - eight years. They have become even more  lamentable  failures  when
one considers the many opportunities for bold action  that  were  missed  by
this Government in many areas  of  liberalisation.  It  is  clear  that  job
creation is the defining feature of debate on South  Africa's  macroeconomic
policies and economic future.

In recent embarrassingly transparent attempts at propaganda on jobs  on  the
eve of our election,  the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,  Alec  Erwin,
confessed that Government does not claim  to  be  solving  the  unemployment
problem, despite the verbage in this Budget about  halving  unemployment  by
2014. A large part of the so-called job creation touted  by  Minister  Erwin
is not job creation at all. It does not  reflect  a  change  in  the  actual
numbers of the unemployed, but rather in  the  way  in  which  a  number  of
people employed were counted.

The two million jobs claim is therefore false. Any job gains took  place  in
the informal economy and in subsistence activities. This is  indicative  not
of growing prosperity, but of growing desperation as  retrenchments  in  the
formal sector and the absence of any new jobs forced many into the  survival
economy.

Mr Minister, you  plead  that  the  unemployment  challenge  should  not  be
politicised, but the  problem  with  this  argument  is  that  it  basically
excludes a debate on the fundamentals of economic  policy,  aside  from  the
fiscal plaudits which you already received.

To ensure  there  will  be  job-creating  growth,  the  DA  would  implement
policies that would catapult us onto a higher  growth  path,  including  the
following: One, encouraging businesses and households to  employ  labour  by
providing tax incentives to hire workers; two, dramatically  increasing  the
levels of domestic and foreign investment  by  cutting  taxes,  streamlining
labour regulations and phasing out exchange  controls;  three,  fostering  a
real knowledge economy with real  skills  development  where  education  and
training are prized initiatives on offer - not only high quality  provision,
but also skills provision that produces what the market and economy  require
for an expansion in the services and IT sectors, and indeed in  the  sectors
that currently drive our economic growth.

Whilst this Budget is  boring  at  best,  it  has  clearly  shown  that  the
consequences  of  short-sighted  policy  making  or   ideologically   driven
positions, both lead nowhere. Government's handwringing  -  the  President's
blanket declaration that we no longer need new policies -  as  well  as  the
rather, with respect, Minister, lacklustre  Budget,  will  not  address  the
eight million unemployment crisis that we currently face.  Bold,  not  timid
action, is required to combat unemployment and eradicate poverty, and  place
us on a higher growth path.

I would like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  pay  special  tribute  to  my
colleagues Ken Andrew and Nigel Bruce, who will be speaking in  this  debate
and who are retiring from active politics. I would also like,  Minister,  to
compliment you on the task that you have undertaken in  the  past  years  of
this democracy, and indeed the fundamental role you played  in  establishing
our credentials in the international markets, particularly in terms  of  our
reputation for maintaining  fiscal  discipline.  I  think  it  is  no  small
tribute to you that that has continued to be one of the  factors  that  have
featured very prominently in our increased and enhanced trade  ratings,  and
I think a tribute is due to you on that score, particularly personally.
I would also like to compliment your team  in  the  National  Treasury,  who
have worked ceaselessly and very hard over the past years, and those in  the
agencies linked to the National Treasury, in revenue  services  and  in  the
other agencies, Statistics South Africa and the Reserve Bank. I think  these
agencies have, indeed, played quite a fundamental  role  in  our  democracy,
and I  think  those  who  have  worked  hard  in  this  regard  deserve  the
compliments that are due.

To my colleagues in the finance committee who I have served  with,  I  would
like to compliment all of you for your unstinting  dedication,  all  set  to
your own skills improvement. All of us have been  involved  in  studying  in
various ways in the past few years, and I would like to  compliment  all  of
you for carrying both that load and your parliamentary workload.  It  is  no
small feat. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Thank you, Madam Speaker and hon members. I think Ms  Taljaard,
you should have confined your speech to your last portion. You  did  put  it
very well. Today South Africa is a democratic country with a  democratically
elected Government which represents the will  of  all  its  people.  It  has
amongst the best constitutions in  the  world,  ensuring  human  rights  and
dignity to all, irrespective of race, gender,  religion  and  language.  All
are equal before the law,  the  rights  of  women  are  recognised  and  are
increasingly finding expression in real life and the  same  applies  to  the
rights of persons with disabilities.

Today South Africa has a growing economy, managed  with  skill  by  the  ANC
Government. We have links with almost all countries  across  the  globe  and
there are  no  apartheid  restrictions  on  professions.  The  right  to  do
business or the right to education and skills is also  guaranteed.  This  is
an extract from the  ANC's  very  modest  manifesto  which  we  launched  in
January 2004 in Pietermaritzburg.

This year we celebrate our 10 years of democracy and an ideal that  the  ANC
has struggled for since its birth  in  1912.  Throughout  its  92  years  of
existence, the ANC has not changed its objective of  liberating  the  people
from all kinds of oppression: True liberation, political liberation,  social
and economic liberation.

Today we can proudly say that we have gone a  long  way  in  realising  this
objective. On the economic front a number of successes have  been  recorded,
contrary to what the hon Ms Taljaard sees when she looks  at  a  half  empty
glass instead of a half full glass.  One  of  the  successes  is  a  healthy
balance of payments that has been  growing  consistently  in  the  past  few
years. Net capital inflows amounted to  R33,4  billion  in  2002  alone  and
R35,5 billion in the first three quarters of 2003. The taxpayers  have  been
relieved of the burden of the  net  open  forward  position  and  today  the
Reserve Bank is sitting with a negative net open forward position.
Apartheid was not only inhumane and cruel but it was  also  a  very  selfish
form of government. The perpetrators of this  crime  were  deliberately  and
systematically excluding the majority of the  people  from  sharing  in  the
country's resources. The formation of this organisation, the  ANC,  was  the
only appropriate response to  this  dehumanising  and  uncaring  order.  The
insulting conditions under which our people were made to work  and  live  as
subhumans were called employment at that time. The discriminatory  laws  and
regulations that governed this were referred to as  the  rule  of  law.  The
homeland system and the Group Areas Act were the acceptable system of  self-
determination along ethnic and racial lines. Job reservation  was  a  sacred
labour policy that would ensure white  supremacy  eternally.  That  was  the
life pre-democracy that we still hear people yearn for today in  this  House
as we heard the previous speaker calling for it.

The ANC has always been consistent that South  Africa  belongs  to  all  who
live in it, both black and  white,  that  the  people  shall  share  in  the
country's wealth, that the land shall be shared among those who work it  and
that all shall enjoy equal basic human rights. No one believed  us  when  we
said this in 1955, but here we  are  today,  a  democratic  country  with  a
Government based on the will of all the people.

In order for this democracy to thrive, it needs to be supported by a  strong
economic policy that recognises the developmental nature of  our  democratic
state. When the ANC inherited an economy on the verge  of  collapse  with  a
negative  growth,  declining  employment,  double-digit  inflation,  a  huge
budget deficit and a huge debt we needed a master plan to save  the  nation.
Tough policy choices had to be made, even  when  it  affected  relationships
within our own ranks. A master plan had  to  be  found  because  we  had  an
economic disaster on our hands.

Indeed we have travelled this far and  the  country  was  saved.  Of  course
there have been trade-offs. I offer an assessment of some  of  these  trade-
offs. Whilst it reports on a number of our successes, it also  identifies  a
number of challenges  that  still  confront  us.  These  challenges  can  be
summarised as  follows  and  I  will  mention  but  a  few:  Governance  and
administration where we need to improve service delivery, and  the  capacity
of local and provincial government on financial management also need  to  be
improved. We need  to  improve  accountability  too  and  contact  with  the
general public at all levels. We need to develop and maintain a  partnership
with civil society and provide leadership  to  these  partners  through  the
rearticulation of the encompassing framework for South Africa's  development
in the next decade and beyond.

Regarding our social challenges,  we  need  a  more  efficient  delivery  of
social services to rural beneficiaries and  the  elimination  of  corruption
and the incorporation of these beneficiaries into a system of  comprehensive
social security. We need the  acceleration  of  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programmes. We need to address  HIV/Aids  and  other  emerging  diseases  by
reducing the incidence of infection among high  risk  groups,  treatment  of
those infected and increasing access to home-based care. We  also  have  the
challlenge of matching skills to the requirements  of  the  economy,  unlike
the hon Taljaard who just said we need economic growth as  against  economic
development. Because you can have economic growth at the expense  of  people
who do not have the skills to fit into our economy.

Our  economic   challenges   include   the   implementation   of   key   GDS
recommendations to identify sectors for urgent investment  and  learnerships
and employing at least 5% of the investible capital from relevant  funds  in
productive activity. We need to  continue  with  our  prudent  macroeconomic
policies leading to a more stable currency and  lower  real  interest  rates
and improve the public sector's investment performance.

The ANC's reponse to all these challenges is a clear  programme  as  it  has
been captured in our manifesto. Our manifesto calls for a people's  contract
to create work and fight poverty. The  ANC  has  always  been  a  mass-based
organisation that believes in the potential of  all  individuals  to  change
their material conditions and hence this mass mobilisation  again.  The  ANC
Government has created an environment conducive to the  realisation  of  the
objective  of  job  creation  and  increased  investment,  broadbased  Black
Economic Empowerment and skills development.

Government can create an environment to promote higher rates  of  investment
and it can also create some employment in the  Public  Service  and  in  the
Public Works programmes and it can also encourage labour  intensive  methods
in parts of the economy. But long-term employment depends mainly  on  higher
rates of private investment. It also depends on  strategies  for  growth  in
key economic sectors. It depends on skills  development  and  leadership  in
both the public and private sectors to provide work experience.

Our manifesto is a clear blueprint of how  the  challenges  confronting  us,
particularly economic  challenges,  are  going  to  be  addressed.  The  ANC
Government has identified the following programmes: A programme to grow  the
economy which will ensure that low interest  and  inflation  rates  and  low
Government debts and increased social spending aimed at poverty  alleviation
is  accelerated,  as  well  as  building  infrastructure  and  creating  job
opportunities.

We need to invest R100 billion in the Extended Public Works  Programmes  for
infrastructure development whilst addressing the  skills  shortage  problem.
We spend R15 billion to facilitate  broadbased  economic  empowerment,  take
more young people through learnerships so they  can  gain  skills  and  work
experience and intervene to ensure proper functioning of skills  development
authorities; encourage labour intensive methods in sectors  of  the  economy
which lend themselves to this  form  of  operation,  including  through  the
government procurement system. We also have to  conduct  research  into  the
full impact of casualisation of labour and outsourcing and  devise  ways  of
dealing with their negative impact on workers and the economy as a whole.

We need also to sustain livelihood by creating a million  job  opportunities
through the Extended Public Works  Programme,  completing  land  restitution
programmes and speeding  up  land  reform  with  30%  of  agricultural  land
redistributed by 2014, combined with comprehensive  assistance  to  emergent
farmers.

These are but a few practical steps that this ANC Government is  engaged  in
to ensure a better life for all, through a people's contract to create  work
and fight poverty. Under the ANC  Government,  a  better  life  for  all  is
certain and our people will not be fooled by those  that  want  to  take  us
back to the past as they claim that it was better. I thank you.

Dr G G WOODS: Madam  Speaker,  to  combat  our  vast  problems  of  poverty,
unemployment, sickness  and  criminal  activity,  high  levels  of  economic
growth is the only solution we know of. And here it has been estimated  that
at least 15 consecutive years of an 8% growth would be required to bring  us
up to the lower end of the living  standards  of  the  developed  countries.
Such is the scale of our economic deficit and as we understand  it  such  an
improvement would then happen through a resultant and significant  reduction
in our unemployment levels and through the generation of a  tax  base  large
enough to support a welfare system which raises the quality of life  of  the
poorest 60% of our citizens.

So the question we all ponder is: How do we achieve that necessary  economic
growth? And let me begin by  saying  on  this  occasion  that  the  Budget's
ability  regarding  economic  growth  is   greatly   exaggerated   by   many
commentators. For one, the expansionary qualities one finds  in  the  Budget
through its tax relief and productive expenditure sides are far too  limited
in their very nature to strongly influence and  drive  growth.  Neither  can
the other incidental Budget initiatives, such as  the  various  supply  side
initiatives or infrastructure developments, be  what  really  initiates  and
drives growth.

In fact national budgets over the past 10 years have  at  one  time  or  the
other incorporated various notional growth initiatives and in  that  respect
we can see that these have not achieved what  was  hoped  for.  The  current
Budget for its part persists with a selective incorporation  of  speculative
type growth initiatives. This  approach  is  even  more  noticeable  in  the
election manifestos of various political parties.

Relevant literature will indicate these to be at least 40 of  these  popular
policy-type initiatives, a number of which have been part of growth  success
in countries around the world and how we can improve investment  incentives,
savings promotions, privatisation programmes, deregulation,  small  business
diversification, etc. But the tendency of many of these policy scenarios  on
offer in South Africa suggests a select few of these policy  initiatives  to
be the obvious answer to high economic growth with  no  explanation  of  the
behavioral relationships of these policies - why certain  policies  are  not
considered and why there is no  overall  context  in  which  these  policies
should be applied, thus making it all seem rather arbitrary or random.

The proposition I am therefore arriving at is that no one seems to  work  to
a sufficiently comprehensive policy picture covering the fuller  extents  of
the real economy, its internal and external  relationships  and  interactive
dynamics. And here of course I must direct myself to the Government  as  the
institution given the  responsibility  to  realise  the  country's  economic
growth potential. Further, I am in  the  main  referring  to  the  range  of
policy areas which pertain to  the  microeconomy  where  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry has attempted many of those 40  policy  areas  on  offer,
some more than once over the past 10 years.

And it is when we try to factor all these DTI and budget policy  initiatives
into  a  well-tested  and  reputable  econometric  growth  model  that   our
suspicions are  confirmed.  We  see  that  there  is  no  comprehensive,  no
coherent and no co-ordinated growth development plan  in  this  country.  We
also see overlaps, gaps, strange sequencing and counter  activity  from  the
range of policies attempted. And this is borne out when paging  through  the
DTI's annual reports and other policy documents over the  past  seven  years
and noting how many enthusiastically announced  initiatives  there  have  in
fact been and at the same time noting how modest DTI's successes  have  been
across these policies.  And  I  am  far  from  alone  in  pointing  out  the
ambivalent nature of many of DTI's policy programmes. We need to  understand
why this is if we are to have a chance  of  raising  growth  levels  to  the
desired extent.

Now at the time Gear was released we saw that, as a plan,  in  fact  it  did
incorporate a wide range of integrated growth policy intentions,  which  had
emerged from the five large econometric exercises undertaken  at  the  time.
But as it turned out, the  implementation  of  Gear  was  a  very  tentative
affair with a number of its policy recommendations either being  ignored  or
delayed indefinitely. This, together with  the  fact  that  Gear  was  never
subjected to revision as relevant economic circumstances changed,  saw  Gear
failing to achieve its growth targets. And within a  year  it  was  apparent
that Government had reverted back to a more ad hoc approach across areas  of
industrial, trade and incentives policy.

My argument is therefore that Government is not relating and  working  to  a
sufficiently big and inclusive enough understanding of  our  economy  as  it
exists  in  the  globalised  setting  and  as  such  has  not  developed   a
sufficiently comprehensive and  integrated  policy  master  plan,  which  is
necessary to achieve the high growth we  talk  about.  Of  course  DTI  will
point out that it does plan policy through models but what we  can  show  is
hard evidence that these models or the way they  are  used  are  inadequate.
They will also say, as they say every  year,  that  growth  is  coming  next
year, but with the most recent assessments showing that we are  slipping  in
the international competitive  and  entrepreneurial  rankings  this  remains
unlikely. We can now also see that the 2002 upward blip  in  South  Africa's
economic growth curve was more a consequence of  a  temporary  and  peculiar
crash in the value of the  rand  which,  now  in  its  recovery  phase,  has
brought our growth back to 2% as Statistics SA has  informed  us  just  this
week.

The credit we hear taken for the growth, albeit low growth,  over  the  past
decade, which has somewhat hiccupped along,  should  be  treated  with  some
caution. Because I think there is  much  to  suggest  that  the  opportunity
after 1994  to  free  the  South  African  economy  from  its  international
isolation and other  strictures  was  also  an  opportunity  to  mobilise  a
powerful, pent up entrepreneurial  potential  which  existed  and  had  been
waiting to express itself.  And  which,  given  a  more  appropriate  policy
environment,  could  have  produced  considerably  higher  growth  than  has
actually been achieved.

Returning to my  main  line  of  argument,  I  need  to  incorporate  a  few
irrefutable economic realities. The first being about the markets  and  that
economic growth is only  really  possible  through  an  increased  share  of
markets. And the second is about the  nature  of  incremental  increases  in
supply and demand or demand and supply and how they feed on each  other  and
which is the necessary basis of any  sustainable  economic  growth  path  en
route to building up that market share I referred to.  It  is  around  these
two basic tenets that ongoing considerable research should be  conducted  as
a  matter  of  course  to  identify  and   prioritise   promising   sectoral
arrangements which in  turn  should  be  tested  against  the  comprehensive
growth model I have referred to.

It is more than apparent that our research into  markets  and  the  relevant
industries and what  is  happening  internationally  is  inadequate.  Having
achieved this degree of coherence, greater direction  for  fixed  investment
incentives,  infrastructure  programmes,  skills  training  and  supply-side
measures could also be  gained,  all  of  which  help  to  eliminate  policy
contradictions  and  weaknesses  which   often   characterise   Government's
seemingly less co-ordinated and current multipronged approach.
The more realistic and more representative big picture approach to  economic
growth will also help to inform a  better  balance  between  many  areas  of
policy. For example, between those policies which on the  one  hand  promote
economic activity and those which on the other hand  divert  entrepreneurial
energies towards very important corrective type policies so that  Government
could, for the first time establish how much affirmative  action,  how  much
BEE, how much preferential  procurement,  how  much  of  particular  labour-
related policies we need, how much detracts too much  from  economic  growth
and do what we presently have to detract at all. The Government  could  then
for the first time contemplate such policy balances  in  a  more  considered
and realistic way and in a way which would be more favourable for growth.

The contention that DTI and therefore Government as a whole  could  be  more
effective in the pursuit of economic  growth  through  more  comprehensively
considered and  planned  policies  should  not  suggest  that  DTI  has  not
achieved certain important industrial restructuring,  established  strategic
agencies, negotiated promising trade agreements and done a number  of  other
things which in time could well prove helpful to growth. Also in respect  of
DTI, I remind you that  this  department  has  amongst  the  most  difficult
objectives to achieve and by my suggesting that they are  not  being  astute
and comprehensive and methodical enough in  working  towards  the  realistic
growth plans, I am not suggesting that this is easy to achieve.

In fact, the easier side of economic policy and management  is  by  far  the
macro side where the  proven  established  policy  parameters  are  not  too
different to those required to run a commercial organisation  like  managing
debt, spending, cash flow and collecting moneys  that  are  due.  Of  course
this  all  requires  exceptional  discipline  and  a  particular   financial
astuteness as our Minister of Finance has shown  over  his  successful  term
and as other ministers of finance in many other countries have  been  unable
to show.

The microeconomic policies are however far more complex, far  more  variable
and difficult to implement and enforce. And this is all the more reason  for
the expansive policy development approach we are advocating.  Last  year  in
the President's state of the nation debate my  leader,  Minister  Buthelezi,
posed the question which many others wrestle with as well. And the  question
asks why, given the great job that Minister Manuel is doing  and  given  the
strong  fundamentals  he  has  secured,  does  growth  remain  so  low   and
unemployment and poverty remain so high? The central  purpose  of  my  input
into this debate today has been to offer an explanation as to why.

Sound macroeconomic policy through both the fiscal and  monetary  sides  and
the stability and certainty of the macroeconomic environment it produces  is
an essential precondition to high economic growth, but in itself  would  not
produce that growth. It is  the  appropriately  established  arrangement  of
microeconomic policies which would  stimulate  the  actual  economic  growth
engine which in turn will  capitalise  on  and  interface  with  the  strong
macroeconomic situation. And it is here  that  the  Budget  through  greater
certainty, through a clearer plan and the thinking that follows and  through
better strategic planning of target markets and growth paths could  be  used
more purposefully to promote that master growth plan and achieve the  growth
that South Africa so desperately requires.

Madam Speaker, I would like to end, as  the  hon  member  Taljaard  did,  by
expressing thanks to a number of people, starting with my colleagues on  the
finance committee and particularly the chairperson  Barbara  Hogan,  and  to
just say two or three goodbyes. And while there are a lot of people  to  say
goodbye to who we will miss, I think there are a few  people  in  particular
who I worked with very closely who will be missed.  One  is  of  course  Ken
Andrew, who I worked with in a  number  of  committees  over  the  past  ten
years. What a pleasure it has been to work with  him.  And  then  there  are
Comrades Laloo Chiba and Billy Nair, who I learnt a lot from and who I  have
the greatest respect for. I'm going to feel saddened when I  come  back,  as
it appears I might, and  not  see  them  in  the  corridors  of  Parliament.
[Applause.]

Mr B W KANNEMEYER: Madam Speaker, Comrade Deputy President and hon  members,
in the state of the nation address, the President said that  the  Budget  is
one of the principal instruments in the hands of  the  democratic  state  to
bring about the changes we need to make to achieve our revolutionary  goals.
For  us,  the  Budget  is  not  merely  an  annual  record  of  revenue  and
expenditure figures decided by Government to address  whatever  issue  might
seem important during a particular year.

As we speak in  Parliament  today,  there  is  general  agreement  that  our
country's economy has never been better managed. Even  the  DA  agrees  with
this. Consistent growth, even  though  at  lower  than  optimal  rates,  has
resulted in a more competitive economy with increased volume and  diversity.
Workers' rights are protected. Vulnerable workers such as  domestic  workers
and farmworkers have been given greater protection.  Funds  have  also  been
made available for people to own businesses as one aspect of black  economic
empowerment.

At the heart of some of our challenges  are  two  linked  concerns  that  we
address in our election manifesto. The first is  to  create  work  and  roll
back poverty. To achieve this, we need  a  stronger  partnership  among  all
South  Africans  and  a  people's  contract  for  a  better  South   Africa.
Therefore, in the election manifesto, as stated in the state of  the  nation
address and in the debate  by  the  Minister  of  Finance,  we  then  commit
ourselves to practical measures to ensure we  have  a  growing  economy  and
sustainable livelihoods.

These practical measures  include  the  process  to  ensure  lower  interest
rates, lower inflation rates as well as low Government  debt  so  that  more
resources are spent on attacking poverty, building  economic  infrastructure
and creating work opportunities. We further commit, as one of the  practical
measures, to the  completion  of  the  land  redistribution  programme,  the
speeding up of land reform, with 30% of agricultural land  redistributed  by
2014 combined with comprehensive assistance to  emerging  farmers.  We  also
commit ourselves to ensure the involvement of communities in local  economic
development initiatives and others.

The ANC commits itself, and  it  can  boldly  do  so,  to  these  programmes
because discrimination and abuse are still taking place.  Women  still  find
themselves, in very  large  numbers,  among  the  poorest  sections  in  our
society. Too many young people are still unemployed  and  millions  of  them
come from poor households.

Unfortunately, it is this reality  that  ignites  the  inherently  sick  and
opportunistic tendencies in  opposition  parties  such  as  the  ``Desperate
Alliance''. As the ANC, we speak with confidence because  we  have  been  at
the head of this national effort to change our country for  the  better.  We
know that together, with our people, we can do more and even better.

As an example of the ANC's commitment to implement these policies,  we  have
seen that under an ANC/New NP government in the Western  Cape,  more  people
from historically  disadvantaged  areas  have  benefited  from  procurement.
Before the year December 2001 under the DA  control  in  the  Western  Cape,
there was a policy that prevented  the  majority  of  black  companies  from
tendering for contracts worth more than R2 million.  We  have  changed  this
policy and the results are obvious, especially since the province has set  a
40% target for historically disadvantaged individuals.
During the period 1 January to 31 December 2001, under  DA  control  in  the
Western Cape, the total contract value  that  was  awarded  to  historically
disadvantaged companies and individuals totalled R222  million  or  26%.  At
the end of 31 March 2003, for that same period,  the  total  contract  value
amounted to R345 million or 48% of total procurement  in  the  Western  Cape
province. We are not just talking about policies and how  we  should  change
things, we are actually doing it.

Allow me to inform this House and the people of our country, but  especially
the unemployed youth from the Southern Cape towns of  George  and  Langeberg
municipal areas about the double  standards  of  the  DA.  The  DA  misleads
voters by telling them one  thing  and  then  doing  exactly  the  opposite.
Flowing from the presidential imbizo in the  Western  Cape  some  time  last
year, we started a process in the Southern Cape  and  George,  working  with
the local municipalities on a project designed to enhance the skills  levels
and thus the employability of unemployed matriculants in the Southern Cape.

The idea was a very simple one. One of the South  African  Police  Service's
criteria for a potential employee is for them to have  a  driver's  licence.
Most of  the  youth  from  disadvantaged  communities  have  never  had  the
opportunity to obtain a driver's licence. They were only exposed to  driving
in vehicles, in most instances,  when  using  public  transport.  That  very
criterion, therefore, dictates against numbers of black people getting  into
the police force.

We have started talking about this and it has already been  addressed  at  a
very high level in our organisation and  the  Cabinet.  We  went  ahead  and
contacted  local  communities  and  local  municipalities.  Of   the   seven
municipalities in the Southern Cape / Klein  Karoo  area,  there  are  three
municipalities that are controlled by the DA.  Five  municipalities  in  the
Southern Cape, under ANC/New NP control, contributed very little amounts  of
R20 000 or R30 000. That facilitated  the  process  where  180  matriculated
youth could be enrolled into  a  programme  to  assist  them  to  get  their
driver's licences.

I approached the George municipality controlled by the DA and  I  personally
spoke to the Mayor, a Mr Marius Swart. I asked him to ignore  our  political
differences and see what we can do for the youth of that  area.  Sadly,  the
response of both the  George  and  the  Langeberg  municipality,  where  the
leader of the DA in the  Western  Cape  is  the  mayor,  was  to  refuse  to
participate. They refused to participate and give the youth of  their  towns
an opportunity. [Interjections.]

I am wondering if this party is serious when  they  call  on  the  youth  to
support them but when an opportunity presents itself, the  government  where
the DA is in control in two municipalities decide  that  the  youth  is  not
important to them.
In preparing for this debate, I must  confess  that  I  did  something  that
could potentially be very harmful to my own education and sanity. I  visited
the DA's website. In doing so, I was struck by the bankruptcy of  ideas  and
policies on the part of  this  supposed  official  opposition.  I  read  the
economic policies of the DA. In their economic policies  on  black  economic
empowerment, the sum total of the DA's policies, as it is  posted  on  their
website, is four sentences. Not four  paragraphs  or  four  pages  but  four
sentences on black economic empowerment.

These are the people who claim that they are trying to be a nonracial  party
yet they have four sentences on black economic empowerment.  A  footnote  on
that same  page  says  that  a  full  policy  on  the  DA's  black  economic
empowerment is in another document. I then searched everywhere but there  is
no such document. Such a document is nowhere  on  their  website.  They  can
search it for themselves. They are trying to fool the people by saying  that
they  are  committed  to  black  economic  empowerment.  There  is  nothing.
[Laughter.]

Allow me to speak further on black economic empowerment by illustrating  how
the DA is once again telling the people of this country something  and  then
doing something else. This party is desperate for a few votes and  will  not
allow the truth to stand in  their  way  when  they  visit  poverty-stricken
areas, in their protective clothing like excited children going on  a  field
expedition. They are never there in our communities. When they do  go  there
they get all excited. They are never there where our people are suffering.

The DA's spokesperson on Trade and  Industry  the  hon  Lowe  said,  ``South
Africa deserves genuine and effective broad-based economic empowerment  that
focuses on job creation, skills development and training.'' In his reply  to
a statement made by the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,  the  hon  Lowe
continued by saying that ``The DA supports black economic empowerment  as  a
means of growing our economy and  ensuring  that  all  South  Africans  have
access to employment and entrepreneurial opportunities.''

On 14 February 2004 the hon Tony  Leon,  on  the  question  as  to  what  he
expected from his party's public representatives, said that  they  will  not
only represent the DA, but will represent all the people  of  South  Africa.
Everything that is done should be done on behalf of the people  who  elected
them. This is what he said. The Black Economic  Empowerment  Bill  was  then
placed before this House. In this Bill's memorandum, the objectives of  that
Bill state that South Africa's economy cannot operate to its full  potential
because the majority of South Africans earn very low incomes and  are  still
excluded from ownership and fixed assets. This is to the  detriment  of  all
South Africans and  it  is  therefore  necessary  that  steps  be  taken  to
increase the effective participation in the economy by the majority  of  all
South Africans.
Every public representative of the  DA  voted  against  this  Bill  in  this
Parliament. They voted against what  they  themselves  had  proclaimed  when
they went to our people and made speeches  from  platforms.  Yet  when  they
come to  Parliament  where  people  cannot  see  them  and  they  press  the
``against'' buttons, they think they fool the people of  our  country.  They
think they can  get  away  with  this.  Unfortunately,  our  people  may  be
unemployed or illiterate but they are  not  stupid.  No  one  can  fool  our
people by standing on public platforms and telling them something  and  then
turning around and doing the opposite. [Applause.]

I am calling on the people of our country, in supporting  the  Appropriation
Bill, not to be fooled by the two-faced DA and to  vote  for  a  party  that
made change possible and is a caring party. Vote ANC. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Deputy Speaker, we agree with  the  Minister  that  the
targeted, rather than the basic income grant, will deliver better  long-term
results for South Africa.  The  New  NP  is,  however,  convinced  that  the
approach  to  social  security  measures  should  shift   from   social   to
empowerment grants. We support the  continued  roll  out  of  child  support
grants even up to the age of 18 years and as soon as the country can  afford
it.

The problem, however, is that thousands of families have now grown  to  rely
on social grants as their only source of income. The aged and the young  are
now caring for thousands of families all over South Africa. The role of  the
breadwinner in the family is being seriously eroded to the detriment of  the
social order of our country. The New  NP  believes  that  people  should  be
empowered to be self-sufficient and the dignity of the  breadwinner  has  to
be restored. Social grants  should  only  form  part  of  a  safety  net  to
alleviate extreme poverty. Job creation and  skills  enhancement  programmes
must enable breadwinners to care for their own families.
We therefore support the Extended Public Works Programme as a  means  to  an
end, to  provide  temporary  job  opportunities  to,  at  least,  a  million
unemployed people. It is a sound  start  but  the  problem  looms  when  the
programme draws to a close. Who will employ these people who stand  to  lose
their temporary jobs? The HSRC found that 50%  of  all  matriculants  cannot
find work.  It  urges  Government  to  devise  permanent  solutions  to  the
unemployment problem through job creating initiatives.

For this reason, the New NP suggested that  an  employment  fund,  aimed  at
assisting emerging entrepreneurs to specifically employ  unemployed  people,
be considered urgently. Details can  be  found  in  the  New  NP's  election
manifesto. The aim of the  plan  is  full  employment.  Everybody  in  South
Africa must work.

On the other hand, the DA, the South  African  Communist  Party  and  Cosatu
support the idea of a basic income grant.  What  strange  bed  fellows.  The
latter two parties support the idea because  they  believe  that  the  state
should take  responsibility  for  the  welfare  of  everybody.  The  DA,  in
contrast, represents the racist, ugly face of capitalism. [Interjections.]

Die DA staan hierdie basiese toelaag voor omdat hy 'n  rookskerm  nodig  het
waaragter hy sy fundamentele filosofie van rassistiese  rykmansbevoorregting
kan verberg. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die toelagie  is  bloot  'n  stukkie  handige
skynheilige ``tokenism'' waarmee die hardvogtige, siellose  gewete  van  die
party gesalf moet word. Die DA staan vir die beskerming van 'n  bevoorregte,
snoesige witmansbestaan. Mense van kleur en mense in  nood  moet  self  sien
kom  klaar;  hulle  ontvang  mos  'n  toelagie  as  'n  aalmoesie  van   die
rykmanstafel!

Die masker van rassisme en gierigheid van die DA word gelukkig nou stuk  vir
stuk afgepluk. In Pinetown bedank die ganse takbestuur van die DA omdat  die
DA nie in die welsyn van arm mense belangstel nie.  Sondae  word  saamtrekke
kammakastig in die townships gehou, maar die doel is net  om  swartmense  as
stemvee te werf. Tony Leon gee nie om nie!

Die verkiesingsveldtog van die DA in die Wes-Kaap berus suiwer op  rassisme.
Theuns Botha praat kiesers bang met 'n swart premier. Die  boodskap  is  dat
alle swartes noodwendig 'n gemors maak  van  alles  wat  hulle  aanpak.  Wat
anders beteken die boodskap? Suid-Afrika kan rassisme nie langer  duld  nie.
[Applous.] Die politiek moet nou daarvan gesuiwer word as dit  ons  erns  is
om ons demokrasie te laat slaag.

Die DA is gevaarlik vir Suid-Afrika. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle  gierigheid  en
neerbuigende  onverdraagsaamheid  teenoor  mense  van  kleur  en  mense  wat
swaarkry sal nog 'n klasse- en rassestryd ontketen wat  die  einde  van  die
demokrasie in hierdie land kan beteken.  Hierdie  onkruid  in  ons  politiek
moet op 14 April 2004 met wortel en tak uitgeroei word. Die DA is 'n  ongure
oorblyfsel uit  ons  koloniale  verlede  waarsonder  Suid-Afrika  gerus  kan
klaarkom. [Applous.]

Die  tyd  vir  versoening   het   aangebreek.   Die   pad   na   deelnemende
veelpartyregering in hierdie land van ons moet nou oopgebreek word. Ek  dank
u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The DA supports this  basic  grant  because  it  needs  a  smoke-screen  to
disguise its  fundamental  philosophy  of  racist  favouring  of  the  rich.
[Interjections.]  This  small  grant  is   just   an   example   of   useful
sanctimonious tokenism with which the callous, soulless  conscience  of  the
party must be salved. The DA stands for protecting the privileged  and  cosy
existence of the white man. People of colour and people in need are left  to
their own devices; after all, they do get a small grant as an alm  from  the
rich man's table!

Fortunately, the DA's mask of racism and greed is being pulled off piece  by
piece. In Pinetown the  whole  branch  executive  of  the  DA  has  resigned
because the DA has no interest in the welfare of the poor people. There  are
supposedly gatherings in the townships on Sundays, but the purpose  is  only
to enlist support from black people as voting cattle.  Tony  Leon  does  not
care!

The election campaign of the DA in the  Western  Cape  is  purely  based  on
racism. Theuns Botha scares voters with a  black  premier.  The  message  is
that all black people inevitably make a mess of whatever they take  on.  Can
this message mean  anything  else?  South  Africa  can  no  longer  tolerate
racism. [Applause.] Politics must now be purged of  it  if  we  are  serious
about making a success of our democracy.

The DA is a  danger  to  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]  Their  greed  and
condescending intolerance towards  people  of  colour  and  people  who  are
battling will unleash another class and race struggle that can mean  an  end
to democracy in this country. This weed in our politics must  be  completely
eradicated on 14 April 2004.  The  DA  is  an  unsavoury  remnant  from  our
colonial past which South Africa can gladly do without. [Applause.]

The time has come for reconciliation. The road to  participatory  multiparty
government in this country of ours should  now  be  cleared.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Njing   L    M    MBADI:    Sekela-Somlomo,    Sekela-Mongameli    namalungu
ahloniphekileyo, bantakwethu xa  seyilele  ngecala,  ifile,  ayibi  sabethwa
kokwethu. Bayekeni, sebefile.

Malung' ale Ndlu abekekileyo, besikho apha kule Ndlu  ngomhla  we-  18  kule
imiyo,  xa  injoli  yezemali  ibitshila  kule  nkundla  isithi:  ``Wagwetywa
ndlala''.  Ibisithi  ikati  isusiwe  eziko  kumzi  nomzi,  ingakhethi  phela
emasini.  Nani  apho  emakhaya  nizivele  oka  Masala  esithi   ``Le   njoli
mayikhawuleze,   ithume   oonozakuzaku   bayo   babe   izithebe,    amaxhego
namaxhegokazi angade omiwe yingwiqi.''

Siphakamela ukungqina ukuba ibingengawo amampunge lawo.  Jonga  ke,  zibekwa
nje, injoli ijongene nekat' eziko  kwizibonelelo  zabantwana,  ibacuntsulela
ishumi  ngenyanga.  Khumbulani  ke  mawethu  ukuba  ukususela  ku-2003   esi
sibonelelo uRhulumente usinabisele kubantwana  abaminyaka  ilithoba,  latsho
inani labantwana abaxhaswa sesi  sibonelelo  laya  kutsho  kwizigidi  ezine.
Kulo  nyaka  esi  sibonelelo  siza  kunatyiselwa  kubantwana   abangaphantsi
kweshum' elinanye ukuze  kunyaka  ozayo  sinabele  kwabangaphantsi  kweshum'
elinesine.

Siyabeva oonokrawuzana besenza  intlekisa  ngentlungu  yentswelo  yabantwana
abazalwa ngabantu  abahluphekileyo.  Bambi  bathi  lo  Rhulumente  ukhuthaz'
inzala kumantombazana. URhulumente omkhatheleleyo  umntu  ujonge  intlupheko
yomntwana, hayi ekanina. URhulumente uphelise isigwebo  sentambo,  angathini
ke ngoko ukukhuthaza  imbulala-bantwana  abangazizelanga  kweli  lizwe.  Ewe
kambe, buninzi  bona  ubuqhophololo  nobutshijolo  obenziwa  ngabantu  kwesi
sibonelelo. Amagosa kaRhulumente  nento  kaNqakula  makabusiphule  nengcambu
obu bukrelemnqa.

Isibonelelo sabadala, inkam-nkam, kwanesabakhubazekileyo, sinyuswe  ngama-40
eerandi, ukuya kuma 700 eerandi ngenyanga. Bambi bathi le  mali  incinci  xa
kuthelekiswa  nentswela  misebenzi  phaya  emaphandleni.  Bafuna  ke   ngoko
inyuswe ibe  li-1000  leerandi.  Kaloku  khumbulani  mawethu  ukuba  kugaywa
iivoti  ngoku.  Nilibala  msinya.  Izolo  oku  bekukho   ucalucalulo   kwezi
zibonelelo. Abamhlophe befumana  ngaphezulu,  abamnyama  becuntsulelwa  nje,
nako  oko  kusenziwa  emva  kweenyanga  ezimbini.  Ngoku,  oko  kwangena  lo
Rhulumente wesininzi, ezi zibonelelo ziyalingana kumntu wonke, yaye  ziphuma
nyanga zonke. [Kwaqhwatywa.] Ucuntsu akafani noshici.  Kuya  kulunga  ngenye
imini. Asimanga ndawo nye.
Eluthethelela  olu  Hlahlolwabiwo-mali,  okaManuel  uthi  inani   labafumana
izibonelelo linyukile kule minyaka  ilishumi  idlulileyo,  lisuka  kwizigidi
ezibini  nangaphezulu  ukuya  kwizigidi  ezisixhenxe   nangaphezulu.   Kambe
nangona kunjalo, idabi lokulwa intlupheko liyaqhuba.

Eyokuba ubomi emaphandleni babungcono kunangoku bubuvuvu obungena  sihlahla.
Ndizelwe, ndakhulela, yaye ndisahlala khona nangoku.  Buyandazi,  ndiyabazi.
Ndilapha, ndilaphel'  intlalo  nempilo  yabantu  basemaphandleni.  Iintlungu
neentlupheko  ndabelana  ngazo  nabo.   Ngubani   owayesazi   ukuba   abantu
bangahlukana nokukha amanzi kude, okanye babelane nezilwanyana  emithonjeni,
emilanjeni nasemadamini? Amanzi kule  mihla  acocekile,  aphuma  ezimpompini
oku kwasedolophini. Imizi emininzi inawo  nasezindlwini.  Bakwasebenzisa  la
manzi nakwizindlu zangesese.

Ewe siyavuma, olu phuhliso alukafikeleli kuzo zonk'  iindawo,  kodwa  siyaya
kuzo. Bekufudulwa kusiyiwa endle,  kodwa  kule  mihla  phantse  yonke  imizi
inezindlu zangesese. Qhuba isithuthi  phakathi  ezilalini  ebusuku,  dolophu
yakwabani.    Phantse    yonke    imizi    inezibane    zogesi,     kuphekwa
ngogesi.[Kwaqhwetywa.] Izithunzela noothikoloshe abanandlela  yakuhamba  ...
[Kwahlwkwa.]  ...  kanti  kwanamagqwirha  nabenzi  bobubi  boyika   ukusolwa
kuthiwe: ``Uyabonwa.'' [Kwahlekwa.]

Iilali ziyekile ukubhalwa ziindledlana zeebhokhwe eziya  emadlelweni.  Kukho
imigaqo ehamba kuyo iimoto. Ewe abanye  abantu  baneemoto  eziquqa  ziquqile
ukuthutha abantu zibas' edolophini. Izileyi  zayekwa  ekuthwaleni  izidumbu.
Kuphucukiwe, akusadliwa ngendeb'  endala.  Mphulaphuli,  akunakho  ke  ngoko
ukumfamekisa  umntu  wasemaphandleni  uthi  ubomi   bebungcono   ngaphambili
kunangoku. Uyaxoka!

Ukubonelelwa  kwabantwana  ngokutya,  phantsi  kwePrimary  School  Nutrition
Programme,  kwenze  abantwana  badlamka,  basegazini,  bazithanda  nezikolo.
Besiphi  esi  sibonelelo  ngaphambili?  Zinguqu   ezi   ezize   noRhulumente
wesininzi, okhokelwa nguKhongolose (ANC). Siyazingca ngalo Rhulumente  obeka
umntu phambili. Sinjalo isikhukukazi ukuwakhathelela amantshontsho aso.

Esi sibonelelo, okwa ngoku, siphantsi kolawulo leSebe  lezeMpilo.  Ukususela
ku Apreli walo umiyo siya kuba phantsi kolawulo luka Mdengeentonga, into ka-
Asmal - ayikho ngoku  apha  eNdlwini  -  iSebe  lezeMfundo  ukutsho.  Kucace
mhlophe okwekat' emhlophe ehlungwini ukuba esi sibonelelo songeza  ukondliwa
kwabona    bantwana    bahlelekileyo    kumabanga    aphantsi    ezikolweni.
Intsebenziswano   phakathi   koRhulumente   nabantu   basemaphandleni    iya
lunqumamisa uxhinelo-zidolophini ngelokuya  kufuna  umsebenzi.  Kaloku,  nto
zakuthi,  la  matyotyombe  asezidolophini  adalwa  ngabantu   abaze   kufuna
imisebenzi begxothwa yindlala emakhaya. Uphuhliso  lwasemakhaya  lulo  oluya
kudala uzinzo kweli lizwe. Ubutyebi beli lizwe makwabelwane ngabo.

Masiy' ebantwini, sibaxelele ngokwenziweyo ngempumelelo  nokuseza  kwenziwa.
Masingababethi  ngemf'  iphindiwe.  Masinyaniseke  ukuze  basithembe.   Maz'
enethole! [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Deputy Speaker, Deputy President and hon members,  at  home
we inflict no further assault on our fellow people  if  they  are  down  and
out. Leave them alone. They are already devoid of effectiveness.

Hon members of this House, we were here in this House on  18  February  2004
when the Minister of Finance, whilst extremely bold, proclaimed the  end  of
poverty. He was saying that the plague of poverty had been taken  away  from
each household without any discrimination. You, too, at home heard  the  son
of Masala saying that this butler must make haste and send his delegates  to
dispense the trays before the  grandmothers  and  grandfathers  choke  as  a
result of swallowing saliva.

We stand up to confirm that that was not just idle talk.  Look,  the  butler
immediately dealt with poverty in that he provided the small sum  of  R10  a
month for the child support grant. Remember, fellow  people,  that  as  from
the year 2003 Government has extended the child  support  grant  to  include
children who are nine years  old,  thereby  bringing  the  total  number  of
children supported by this grant to four million. This year  provision  will
be made for this grant to include children who are under 11  years  old  and
in the following year it will be extended to children under the age of 14.

We hear the people making a mockery of the pain of  being  needy,  which  is
experienced  by  children  born  to  poor  people.  Others  say  that   this
Government encourages girls to give birth. A  government  that  cares  about
people concerns itself with the hardship the child experiences, and not  the
mother. The Government did away with the death sentence; how can it  promote
the killing of children who did not  come  into  this  world  of  their  own
accord? Yes, of course, there is  a  lot  of  corruption  and  roguery  that
people engage in with regard to this grant.  Government  officials  and  the
son of Nqakula must root out this scoundrelism.

The old age grant, ie pension, and the  grant  for  the  disabled  has  been
raised by R40 to R700 per month. Some say this is a  meagre  amount  if  one
takes into account the unemployment rate in the rural areas.  They  want  it
increased to R1 000. Fellow people, remember that votes are being  canvassed
for now. You are quick to forget. There was discrimination in  these  grants
just yesterday. White people were getting more. Blacks were given  a  little
bit, and that, too, happened once  in  two  months.  Since  this  democratic
Government took over, these grants are now equal for everyone, and they  are
given out every month. [Applause.] Half a  loaf  of  bread  is  better  than
none. Things will come right one day. We are not standing still.

In his argument for this Budget, the son of Manuel said that the  number  of
grant beneficiaries has increased  in  the  last  10  years  from  over  two
million to over seven million. But, despite that, the  war  against  poverty
goes on.

To say that life in the rural areas was better then  than  now,  is  rubbish
which has no substance. I was born there, I grew up there  and  I  am  still
living there. Life in the rural areas knows me, and I know  it.  I  am  here
for the sake of the way people in rural areas  live  and  for  the  sake  of
their health. I share with them their pain  and  hardships.  Who  knew  that
people could be free from fetching water from  afar,  or  from  sharing  the
water with animals at fountains, rivers and dams? These days  the  water  is
clean and it comes out of taps, like in the  cities.  Most  households  have
it. They also use this water in the toilets.

We are agreed that this development has not yet reached all the  areas,  but
we are going to them.  People  used  to  go  out  in  the  open  to  relieve
themselves, but these days almost  all  households  have  toilets.  Drive  a
vehicle at night in the villages - what a city! Almost all  households  have
electric lights,  and  cooking  is  by  means  of  electricity.  [Applause.]
Zombies and tokoloshes cannot wander ... [Laughter.] ... on the other  hand,
the witches and those who do bad things  are  afraid  of  being  blamed  and
being yelled at, to say that they are being seen. [Laughter.]

The villages are no longer marked with small paths caused by goats going  to
the fields. There are roads on which vehicles travel. Yes, some people  have
cars that frequently ferry people to the town. The use of sledges to  convey
the dead has been stopped.  There's  improvement;  primitive  lifestyles  no
longer exist. Thus, listener, you cannot mislead the  person  of  the  rural
areas and say that life was better before than now. You are telling lies!

The  feeding  provided  to  children  under  the  Primary  School  Nutrition
Programme has vitalised the children, has caused them to be in  good  health
and has made them like going to school. Where  was  this  provision  before?
These are the changes brought about by the democratic Government  under  the
ANC leadership. We are proud of this  Government,  which  places  the  human
being first. So is a hen in caring for its children.

At the moment this grant is under the control of the Department  of  Health.
From April this year it is going to be under the  control  of  Mdengeentonga
(The Minister of Education), the son of Asmal - he is not in the  House  now
- ie  the  Department  of  Education.  It  is  abundantly  clear  that  this
provision augments the  feeding  of  the  indigent  children  in  the  lower
standards at schools. The co-operation between the Government and people  in
the rural areas puts a stop to the rush to the cities to look for jobs.  The
shacks in the cities, my fellow men, have indeed been caused by  people  who
have come to seek employment, being driven away from home by poverty. It  is
rural development that will bring stability to  this  country.  Let's  share
the wealth of this country.

Let's go to the people and tell them about what has been done  successfully,
as well as what will be done. Let's not cheat them. Let's be honest so  that
they trust us. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr L M GREEN: Deputy Speaker, hon Deputy President  Ministers  and  members,
the ACDP is pleased that there is a lot of emphasis on  social  spending  in
this Budget. Yet how we spend this Budget must be given much thought.  I  do
not know how many tips the hon Minister has received  in  Tips  for  Trevor,
but I am sure that the taxpaying public would like to see that  spending  in
fact  is  targeted  at  reducing  poverty  more  dramatically,  which  would
translate into employment growth and increased skills development.

According  to  the  latest  information  released  by  Statistics  SA,   our
country's GDP showed growth of only 1,9% last year. The Minister of  Finance
estimates that the economy will escalate to 2,9% this year depending on  the
growth in the global economy, but I want to  ask  the  hon  Minister  today:
Tell us why we cannot achieve the economic growth of the Asian Tigers?  Tell
us today why we cannot achieve a growth of 6%,  7%  or  even  8%?  The  huge
spending at R19,6 billion on Public Works projects to halve  the  employment
rate of 40% by 2014 is  commendable  and  it  is  an  effort  to  get  South
Africans back to work to earn their keep and to maintain their dignity.

In as much as we need progressive policies to dismantle the inequalities  of
the past, we must also remember that our economy is connected to the  global
market and therefore it is imperative that we must employ circumspection  in
enticing foreign investment yet keep a vigilant  eye  on  our  own  internal
concerns - the fine balance  of  knowing  how  to  adapt  to  global  levels
without having to die for what we perceive  is  paramount  in  our  national
interest.

It would have been a great boost to expatriates to hear  the  Minister  call
upon them to return to South Africa  and  use  their  skills  to  assist  in
raising the economic growth strategy  of  this  country.  Somewhere  in  his
speech the hon Minister could have alluded to a repatriation  tax  incentive
that will encourage our people and especially our young people to come  back
home and build this country. Of course, we have many immigrants  from  other
parts of the world and Africa who are doing their fair share to  build  this
economy, but there is something special about our own people, our own  South
African people that we dare not lose permanently to  other  countries.  This
is the opportune time to welcome them back to help us, for the next  decade,
with the creation of job opportunities.

The Government's plan to create one million jobs  is  commendable,  but  the
Government alone cannot stop unemployment. It remains the responsibility  of
the South African public at  large  through  their  entrepreneurial  skills,
their  finances  and  their  resources  to  develop  their  own  jobs.   Our
Government, I think,  is  also  spending  too  much  time  on  international
concerns instead of just looking at our own problems. Zimbabwe,  Haiti,  the
Middle East and other foreign problems  are  fine  to  deal  with,  but  our
country needs strong-felt leadership at this moment. It  is  estimated  that
we have between five to six million registered taxpayers that contribute  to
sustaining our economy and sociopolitical needs and we think that  this  tax
base needs to be broadened.

In conclusion, we would like to commend the  Minister  of  Finance  and  his
entire staff for a job well done. We trust  hon  Minister  Manuel  that  the
trees you gave us on Budget day will be fully grown in the next  decade  and
that we would find comfort  in  their  shade.  With  these  words  the  ACDP
supports the Appropriation Bill. I thank you.

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy President and hon members, in  a
certain sense the story of our struggle is a story of problems  arising  and
problems being overcome. A profound statement  indeed  made  by  that  great
leader of our people, Walter Sisulu. These words  continue  to  inspire  all
South Africans to face their challenges with determination and confidence.

In 1994  we  inherited  an  economy  that  was  globally  uncompetitive  and
virtually on the verge of collapse. It was an economy  that  no  longer  had
the capacity to create jobs. Our people led by their organisation, the  ANC,
turned the situation around and built one of the most  sophisticated  modern
economies on the African continent.  We  are  truly  witnesses  of  problems
being  overcome.  It  has  one  of  the  most  advanced  financial  services
industries and  a  manufacturing  industry,  which  is  now  internationally
competitive. It is our national asset. We  need  to  use  its  resources  to
address our developmental challenges. This is the part of our economy  which
is highly skills intensive.

There is also a second part of our economy, which you may call  an  informal
sector that is characterised by a low skills base, poverty, joblessness  and
uncertain income. Unfortunately, by the design  of  apartheid  policy-makers
the second economy is defined by race. The vast  majority  of  black  people
are trapped in the  second  economy.  The  second  economy  comprises  spaza
shops, taverns, stokvels, the taxi industry and it has a dynamic  link  with
the first, established or advanced economy.  Vast  amounts  of  money  leave
these impoverished  communities  daily  and  are  injected  into  the  first
economy. Very little reinvestment into these communities  takes  place.  Our
people do not enjoy the benefits of the first economy, even when it  thrives
or grows, because they  do  not  have  the  skills  required  in  the  first
economy. There is very little that trickles down to the  unskilled  and  the
unemployed masses.

Conservative economists would want us to believe that high  economic  growth
on its own would solve joblessness. It is not necessary  to  stand  on  this
podium and reject these theories.  The  harsh  reality  on  the  ground  has
already done so, hence the ANC believes  in  a  strong  developmental  state
that would intervene to correct this anomaly.  The  ANC  outlines  a  proper
development path in its manifesto. The ANC believes that the answer lies  in
huge investment in education and training that  would  ensure  that  workers
and the unemployed are empowered with skills to  participate  in  the  first
economy. The ANC aims to create one million job  opportunities  through  the
Expanded Public Works Programme.  The  involvement  of  the  communities  in
building infrastructure will assist  in  providing  work  opportunities.  We
believe  that  this  is  a  correct  development  path.  It  is   incorrect,
therefore,  to  hold  the  view  that  South  African  labour  laws  are  an
impediment to job creation.

The proponents of these quick-fix solutions, the DA,  argue  that  employers
should  be  empowered  to  hire  and  fire  as  they  wish   and   suddenly,
miraculously more than one  million  jobs  will  be  created.  What  muddled
economic thinking. It is populist  thinking.  What  is  the  view  of  other
international development agencies on this matter? The World  Bank  and  the
International  Finance  Corporation  released  a  publication  called  Doing
Business in 2004. They  give  different  countries  scores  after  assessing
their labour laws. The ranking  looks  at  the  flexibility  of  hiring  and
firing and conditions of employment among others.  A  higher  score  implies
that the country in question has more rigid or inflexible labour  laws.  The
scores range from zero to  hundred.  South  Africa  was  given  a  score  or
ranking of 36. The question  is  whether  South  Africa  has  an  inflexible
labour market as alleged by the DA.

Let us analyse the scores or  ranking  of  other  developing  countries  and
compare them to the South African score of 36. Brazil has a score of 78 -  a
score much higher than South Africa,  which  implies  it  has  rigid  labour
laws. Chile has a score of 50; China has a  score  of  47;  Botswana  has  a
score of 35; Argentina scored 66; Mexico scored 77 and  Morocco  scored  51.
Let us turn to the Asian Tigers and let us  not  forget  the  South  African
ranking of 36. Taiwan has a score of 57; Japan has a score of  37;  Malaysia
scored 25 and Thailand scored 61. Let us also turn to  developed  countries.
The South African ranking is still 36 and  let  us  not  forget  that  fact.
Israel has a score of 38; Ireland scored  49;  Germany  scored  51;  Finland
scored 55; Portugal scored 79 and France scored 50.

It is clear that the DA, which claims that South  African  labour  laws  are
rigid, cannot sustain its argument. The  argument  has  no  basis  and  only
serves as an election slogan. It is a fact that jobs will not be created  by
taking away the rights of other workers. This  will  only  serve  to  deepen
poverty in our communities.  These  are  just  lies  from  desperate  people
looking for free votes from our people. Our people cannot be  fooled.  Their
conscience and the truth will guide them.

Ka Sesotho bare, e re ge boesa le tswalele mesoro, motho wa  maaka  o  etla,
leokobu letla le ahlame. [In North Sotho they say that you  always  have  to
be ready, as you might be taken for a ride.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, hon  Ministers  and
hon members, the Budget, as the Minister of Finance pointed out,  should  be
an  expression  of  the  Government's  priorities  and  its  commitment   to
addressing the needs and aspirations of the nation.  Indeed  the  Minister's
Budget  speech  does  seem  to  reflect  an  acknowledgement  of  the  major
challenges facing South Africa,  namely  unemployment,  crime,  HIV/Aids  as
well as education and skills development.

The Minister even succeeded in delivering a speech which does not  refer  to
Gear at all, instead we were reminded of the admirable  objectives  set  out
in the Reconstruction and Development  Programme.  The  truth,  however,  is
that the RDP was mothballed and replaced with Gear. The truth is  that  Gear
was a policy put in place where a million jobs were destroyed.

While Gear was not mentioned in the Minister's speech, it  continues  to  be
the primary force behind this Appropriation  Bill.  This  makes  sense  when
read in conjunction with the state of the nation address when the  President
assured us that there would  be  no  significant  policy  changes.  We  were
promised more of  the  same  and  if  one  reads  the  fine  print  of  this
Appropriation Bill, that is what we have won.

Given the challenges that we face of widespread  unemployment  and  poverty,
unnacceptable levels of crime, a rampant  HIV/Aids  pandemic  and  a  severe
shortage of skills, it is necessary to ask whether more of the same is  good
enough. Our argument remains that Government must do more,  especially  when
it comes  to  these  challenges.  Major  policy  shifts  are  required,  but
unfortunately this is not evident in the Appropriation Bill.

On the expenditure side  of  the  Budget  the  UDM  welcomes  the  increased
commitment to HIV/Aids, although the continued delays in  the  actual  roll-
out seem to reduce this additional funding to  an  immaterial  promise.  The
increased focus on infrastructure  development  and  job  creation  is  also
welcome, but seems inadequate, given  the  huge  infrastructure  maintenance
backlog, which runs into tens of billions of rands. For three years now  the
UDM has called for  more  government  investment  and  intervention  in  the
economy to protect and  promote  South  African  jobs  and  businesses.  The
central pillar of that call has been infrastructure development.

The increases for police costs and prisons are similarly welcome,  but  also
seem too little and projected delivery is promised too far into the  future.
Increases  for  education  are  welcome,  but  too  small,  given  the  huge
challenges. Only two days ago we were reminded of the extent of  the  crisis
when the HSRC reported that more than half of all school leavers every  year
join the ranks of the unemployed. A  third  of  all  unemployed  people  are
younger than 24. This is a socioeconomic  tragedy  that  condems  an  entire
generation to poverty. We had hoped for far more  significant  increases  in
the old age and children's grants. Overall, amounts of  R740  and  R710  are
just too little in the face of widespread poverty  and  unemployment.  Until
such time as the unemployment crisis  is  adequately  addressed,  Government
has a moral responsibility to provide a safety net for the 20  million  poor
people in this country. South Africans want change  now,  not  in  10  years
time.

On the revenue side, Government is immediately  taking  more  tax  while  it
promises delivery some time in the future. The UDM,  however,  supports  the
Bill. I thank you.

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Speaker,  Deputy
President and hon members, I am very happy because I come from a party  that
does not just talk, nor does it listen only, but  it  does  something.  When
hon Madikiza stood here and said, ``South Africa wants change now";  I  say,
``South Africa has got change.'' [Interjections.] It had it  from  1994.  It
continued to have it and  it  will  continue  as  such.  When  you  say  the
interventions made in the restructuring of  the  economy  through  Gear  had
never borne results, I would actually wonder  which  country  you  live  in.
Because it is through those interventions when we restructured our  economy,
that we are able today to enjoy the fruits of what we  have  done.  That  is
why we are able to spend more on social delivery  as  well  as  giving  some
more input into economic growth through what we have done. And  for  that  I
say indeed the policies are correct. What we  need  to  deal  with  are  the
blockages.

On 11 February two senior citizens of our country, by name Mr  Dan  Ndzabela
and Mr Ebrahim Moorat, took possession of new houses in  District  Six  here
in Cape Town, marking a return to the land of their birth. In their  company
was Comrade Madiba, Comrade Trevor Manuel, Comrade Ebrahim Rasool  and  many
others. In their participation they were affirming that indeed, as the  ANC-
led Government, as the movement of its people, we are not  only  there  when
they are happy, but we are also there when they are in pain.  These  stories
and many others in our country have been a symbol of our commitment  as  the
ANC-led Government to build a  nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic  South
Africa. When people of Botshabelo  and  Middelburg  in  Mpumalanga  received
their land, one of the old women there actually started her  speech  with  a
song. She said,

Koloi ya lefase ga e dume e ya tsamaya. [The land car does not  rumble,  but
it is going.]

Indeed all of us in this House can attest to that, ...

... Koloi ya lefase ga e dume e ya tsamaya, ga se sekorokoro. [... the  land
car does not rumble, but it is going, it is not an unroadworthy car.]

Madam Deputy Speaker, what we have done in  the  delivery,  particularly  of
land in this country and many other things,  echoes  what  the  majority  of
South Africans who gathered in Kliptown in 1955 said about the ideal of  the
country they longed for, even then. A South Africa that belongs to  all  who
live in it - black and white. A South Africa that will share  its  country's
resources equitably amongst its citizens. A South Africa  that  will  assure
that those who work the land will  benefit  by  its  ownership  beyond  just
being workers. A South Africa whose people will share in its  wealth.  This,
I believe, is  what  we  have  started  doing  in  this  ten  years  of  our
democratic rule.

Through legislation that was passed in this House, we have created a  better
land dispensation that takes  into  consideration  the  centrality  of  land
ownership and  use  for  any  country's  social  and  economic  development.
Through  Government's  pragmatic  interventions  and  financial   resources,
through the Budget, as we can see today, we  have  also  ensured  that  this
land dispensation is done in a manner that recognises the interest  of  all.
This is different to what the previous  apartheid  policies  did  when  they
forcibly removed people from their land.  Indeed,  we  are  a  society  that
cares, because for us South Africa belongs to all who live in it.  And  this
is contrary to what Phillip du Toit says in his book The Land Scandal,  that
the way we have undertaken our land reform leaves much to be desired.  I  am
sure, members in this House and many other South Africans  can  attest  that
we have done better and we will continue to do better. [Interjections.]

Today, as we discuss the elements of this country's Budget for  2004-05  and
beyond, we can clearly see how the policies  and  ideals  we  have  for  our
country's development are firmly supported by financial resources that  will
make it possible for us to fight poverty and change the lives of our  people
for the better, thereby ensuring  that  the  ideal  of  a  prosperous  South
Africa is realised.

I am reminded of what Ronald Reagan once said. He said,  ``We  declared  war
on poverty, and poverty won.'' However, we  can  proudly  say  that  poverty
will not win. We will continue to make the lives of our people  better  than
ever before. [Applause.]

One of the examples that gives us confidence that indeed we will be able  to
have a prosperous South Africa, is the evaluation of  our  performance  over
the past ten years as the Government, this Parliament  and  as  the  various
executives and legislatures in our country. In 1994, as we  ushered  in  our
democratic dispensation, we had to reconstruct a  new  society  by  ensuring
that we set up the various institutions that support it. At  the  same  time
we had to create confidence in the future by making sure  that  the  economy
is well managed, while on  the  other  hand  we  initiated  the  process  of
restructuring and positioning our economy so that it can be competitive  and
inclusive. At the same time we had to undertake  programmes  that  meet  the
basic needs of our people without discriminating against the needs of  those
who have always been privileged.
When the hon Deputy President responded to the questions yesterday, he  said
that we not only liberated those who were oppressed, but we  also  liberated
our oppressors.

Somlomo, uma sibheka ukuthi  senzeni  mayelana  nezomhlaba,  ukwabiwa  kanye
nokuthukukiswa kwawo, singasho ngokungazenyezi ukuthi abantu  abaningi  bale
ngabadi bayaziqhenya  namhlanje.  Bazibona  bengomninimuzi  ngoba  namhlanje
sebeyazi ukuthi banawo umhlaba ongowabo. (Translation of  isiZulu  paragraph
follows.)

[Madam Speaker, if we look at what we have done with  regard  to  land,  its
redistribution and development, we can say without doubt  that  many  people
of this country are proud today. They see themselves as home owners  because
today they know that they have land that belongs to them.]

Ngitsi-ke mine  kubo  bonkhe  labantfu  baseNingizimu  Afrika  bayati  kutsi
ngubani lowente loku lengikhuluma  ngako.  Akusibo  bantfu  labasatsi  tsine
sitawukwenta,  tsine   sitsi   sentile,   kungako   nje   sikhuluma   kodvwa
singatichenyi. Siyi African National  Congress  sitawuchubeka  sitawuchubeka
sente  kakhulu  kunakucala.  Ngitsembe  -ke  kutsi  labo  labasele   ngemuva
batawugibela lenkalishi lehambako  ngobe  yetfu  incola  ayisiso  sikorokoro
kodvwa iya embili. (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[I am saying that all South African citizens know who did the  things  I  am
talking about. We are not people who say, ``we will do'', we say  that  ``we
have done it'', that is why we do not talk proudly. As  the  ANC,  we  shall
continue doing good deeds, even more than before. I hope that those who  are
left behind will join us along the way because once we start we do not  look
back.]

If you look clearly  at  our  land  reform  policies  and  programmes,  they
address three fundamental issues. Through land restitution we  have  created
a rights-based dispensation which restored the rights people lost  regarding
land. Secondly, our land  redistribution  programme  deals  with  issues  of
redress. This programme deals with the legacy of exclusion  of  many  people
from the economic mainstream. Through this programme we have given an  asset
base that individuals and  communities  can  use  for  economic  and  social
development and thereby bringing back meaning to what it  is  to  be  people
again. Through this programme we have built new black farmers  who  can  now
contribute towards food security for the nation as  well  as  ensuring  that
they can make their contribution to the local economy  in  their  districts,
their provinces and the country as a whole.

Farmers  like  Mr  Khombisa  in  Mpumalanga,  who  was  one  of  our   first
beneficiaries of the LRAD programme,  have  changed  the  character  of  the
economic players in Mpumalanga.

Utsi    uma    akhuluma     babe     Khombisa,atsi"namuhla     ngingakhuluma
ngekuticheny,ngitsi nami ngingulomunye lowakha  imisebenti''.  Uma  sitsi-ke
tsine siyi ANC sakha imisebenti, sisho  kutsi  sivula  ematfuba  kute  kutsi
bonkhe bantfu bakwati kusebenta. Ngiyetsemba kutsi sonkhe siyawati  umehluko
emkhatsini wekwakha imisebenti kanye  nekucashwa.  (Translation  of  Siswati
paragraphs follows.)

[When Mr Khombisa speaks, he says, ``today I speak with pride, because I  am
one of those people who creates jobs''. When we say that we are the ANC,  we
create jobs. We mean that we open opportunities so that everybody can  work.
I hope that we all know  the  difference  between  job  creation  and  being
employed.]

When the ANC says we want to build a contract with our people  in  order  to
create work, we are differentiating between work and job  creation,  because
if you create jobs you expect to be employed and become a worker.  But  when
you create work, you create  opportunities.  Then  you  participate  in  the
development of new opportunities so that many more people can be employed  -
a  difference  from  those  who  are  destructing  us  on  this   objective.
[Applause.]

The farmworkers of Grabouw who came together through our  support  in  terms
of the share equity scheme,  are  today  selling  their  wines  locally  and
internationally under the label of  Thandi,  thereby  making  us  proud  and
confident of what we have done. Who can say we have not delivered?  Who  can
say South Africa has not changed? Those farmworkers and  those  farmers  who
have worked with this Government in order to create a better  life  for  all
say, ``yes things have changed''.

Our tenure reform has and will continue to be  about  recognising  diversity
in our society and giving legal recognition to  all  forms  of  tenure.  The
Communal Land Rights Bill which this House has passed is the first  step  in
ensuring  that  we  create  a  system  that  opens  up   possibilities   for
development  while  retaining  the  security  of  tenure   for   our   rural
communities. On the other hand tenure reform has been about codification  of
social norms in a manner that allows for the  social  integration  of  these
traditional societies in our communities.

The Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative, which  we  created  in  KwaZulu-
Natal as a response to dealing with issues of  rural  poverty,  is  but  one
example where, through tenure reform, we have  made  a  difference.  Through
the  Ingonyama  Trust  Board  where  we  created  opportunities  for   lease
agreements for that land that was required for development we can say  today
that  the  people  of  Ingwavuma  along  the  Lubombo  Spatial   Development
Initiative have work and their lives have improved. The  Maleluke  claim  in
Limpopo created opportunities for participation  for  those  communities  in
ecotourism, thereby allowing them to become part and parcel of the  economic
activities of the Kruger National Park.  The  settlement  of  the  Zebediela
claim which not only gave back the land as an asset  to  these  communities,
but also created economic livelihood through partnership  with  the  private
sector, is but one such example.

Hon  Minister  Manuel,  I  hope  that  indeed  with   these   public-private
partnerships that we have seen, the commitments  of  our  private  financial
institutions in the financial charter will go some way in responding to  the
challenges of rural financial needs as well as agricultural  development  in
this area. I trust that under your leadership we will be able to  see  these
ideals realised.

Clearly for  our  development  to  succeed,  there  is  a  need  to  improve
integration within Government and among the various spheres  of  Government.
Looking at the Budget today, one can see these elements of integration.  New
allocations have been made to support land reform beneficiaries as  well  as
improving the capacity of  our  provincial  Departments  of  Agriculture  in
responding  to  the  growing  needs  of  this  sector.   The   Comprehensive
Agricultural Support Programme, commonly known as  Casp,  which  focuses  on
the need for support through  information,  a  technical  advisory  service,
market information and market development, finance and on-farm and  off-farm
infrastructure is just another way of ensuring that indeed we  can  work  in
an integrated way.

As we look at what we have done and what we  will  continue  to  do,  it  is
important not to lose sight  of  the  need  for  continuous  monitoring  and
evaluation so that we can continue to improve our  capacity  to  respond  to
our challenge. Because we are a government that cares and want  to  build  a
caring society, we have set aside resources to  address  the  challenges  of
our vulnerable people. We have  also  done  so  when  we  responded  to  the
drought challenges that our farmers are facing. We did this because  we  are
a government that cares.

 We said in 1955 that South Africa belongs to all who live  in  it  -  black
and white. Through  this  work  we  will  continue  to  build  a  nonracial,
nonsexist and democratic  South  African  society  that  can  share  in  our
country's wealth. I am sure a number of people who are looking at  who  they
need to give another mandate to govern, will no  doubt  vote  for  the  ANC,
because indeed we have done what we promised. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Adjunkspeaker, die agb Minister van  Finansies  dien
jaarliks sy begroting in, en baie mense in die  land  sê  dit  is  'n  goeie
begroting. Ek wil vir  die  agb  Minister  sê  dit  help  veel  hy  dien  'n
begroting in, maar as ons  gaan  kyk  na  die  korrupsie  wat  in  ons  land
plaasvind, onder die beheer van die ANC, sien ons dit help niks dat  ons  só
'n begroting het nie, want die geld word nietemin wanbestee.

Ek wil vandag na drie voorbeelde  van  korrupsie  verwys.  Eerstens,  op  25
Februarie verlede jaar het ek in hierdie  Huis  vir  die  agb  Minister  van
Behuising 'n vraag oor korrupsie, wat verband hou met  behuising  by  Huhudi
in die Vryburgse munisipaliteit, gevra.  Die  agb  Minister  het  my  op  25
Februarie 2003 geantwoord en gesê hulle  is  bewus  daarvan,  hulle  het  'n
ondersoek   gedoen   en   die   saak   sou   verder   deur   die   Nasionale
Vervolgingsowerheid ondersoek word. Dit is 'n jaar later  en  die  Nasionale
Vervolgingsowerheid is steeds besig om dié saak te ondersoek; net mooi  niks
word daaromtrent gedoen nie. Miljoene rande is ter sprake, maar ons bly  net
ondersoeke loods.

Die tweede saak waarna ek wil verwys gaan so ver terug dat ek  'n  vraag  op
18 Mei 2001 - u hoor reg, in 2001 - in hierdie Raadsaal gevra het.  Dit  het
gegaan oor 'n persoon wat na senior burgers  gegaan  en  hul  beleggingsgeld
gevat het. Hy het R72 miljoen van ons oumensies se  geld  gevat  -  dit  het
verdwyn. Die persoon het rondgeloop en gesê dat  niks  met  hom  sou  gebeur
nie, want hy was lid van die ANC. Ek het vir  die  agb  Minister  die  vraag
gevra en die antwoord was: ja,  daar  is  'n  klagte  gelê  by  Brooklyn  se
polisiekantoor, 'n ondersoek is gedoen en Arthur  Anderson-rekenmeesters  is
aangestel. Daar is twee kriminele klagte wat deur die  kommersiële  tak  van
die SA Polisiediens ondersoek word. Dit is drie jaar later en die  oumensies
se geld is steeds weg - R72 miljoen - en die persoon loop  nog  steeds  rond
en sê: ``ek is lid van die ANC; niks sal met my  gebeur  nie''.  Dít  is  'n
bewys  van  die  korrupsie  wat  aangaan  en  die  ANC-regering   wat   niks
daaromtrent doen nie.

Die derde geval behels korrupsie in die  Gautengse  onderwysdepartement.  Ek
het 'n brief aan die agb Minister van Onderwys geskryf.  Sestien  motors  is
by dié departement gesteel, en daar is bewyse van nepotisme. Ek het  'n  dik
lêer aan die agb Minister gegee. En  wat  skryf  die  agb  Minister  vir  my
terug? Hy sê dat hy geen jurisdiksie oor die onderwysdepartement in  Gauteng
het  nie.  As  hy  geen  jurisdiksie  oor   korrupsie   in   die   Gautengse
onderwysdepartement het nie, watter jurisdiksie het hy?  Hoekom  is  hy  dan
die Minister van nasionale Onderwys?

As 'n mens na hierdie dinge kyk, en let op die  wyse  waarop  die  Ministers
dié sake hanteer, dan is niemand verbaas dat misdaad in Suid-Afrika  floreer
nie.  In  'n  onlangse  ondersoek  is  getoon  dat  van  die  totale  aantal
misdadigers wat gevang word, slegs 9% suksesvol  vervolg  en  gestraf  word.
Dít beteken dat 'n misdadiger wat  'n  misdaad  pleeg  'n  91%-kans  het  om
daarmee weg te kom. Daarom  sê  die  VF  Plus:  ``Sê  nee  vir  die  ANC  se
regstellende aksie wat onbillik is. Sê nee vir korrupsie waar Ministers  net
hul  skouers  optrek.  Sê  nee  vir  misdaad.''  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Deputy Speaker, the hon Minister of  Finance  tables
his budget every year, and many people in this country  say  that  it  is  a
good budget. I want to tell the hon Minister that it is a  good  thing  that
he tables a budget, but when we take a look at the corruption  taking  place
in our country, under ANC control, we see that it is of no use to have  such
a budget, because the money is misappropriated anyway.

Today I want to refer to  three  examples  of  corruption.  Firstly,  on  25
February of last year, in this House, I asked the hon Minister of Housing  a
question on corruption in relation to  housing  at  Huhudi  in  the  Vryburg
municipality. The hon Minister answered me on  25  February  2003  and  said
that they were aware of this, that they had investigated  it  and  that  the
matter would be further investigated by the National Prosecuting  Authority.
It is  a  year  later  and  the  National  Prosecuting  Authority  is  still
investigating the  matter;  absolutely  nothing  is  being  done  about  it.
Millions  of  rands  are  at  stake,  but  we   just   keep   on   launching
investigations.

 The second case I wish to refer to dates so far back that I put a  question
on 18 May 2001 - you  heard  correctly,  in  2001  -  in  this  Chamber.  It
involved a person who approached senior citizens and took  their  investment
money. He took R72  million  from  our  senior  citizens  -  the  money  has
disappeared. This person went around saying that  nothing  would  happen  to
him, because he was a member of the ANC. I  put  the  question  to  the  hon
Minister and the answer was, yes, charges had  been  laid  at  the  Brooklyn
police station, an investigation  had  been  launched  and  Arthur  Anderson
chartered accountants had been appointed. Two criminal  charges  were  being
investigated by the commercial branch of the SA Police Service. It is  three
years later and the senior citizens' money is still missing - R72 million  -
and this person is still going around saying: ``I am a member  of  the  ANC;
nothing will happen to me.'' This is proof of the corruption that  is  going
on and the ANC Government that is doing nothing about it.

The third case involves corruption in the Gauteng  education  department.  I
sent a letter to the hon Minister of Education. Sixteen motor vehicles  have
been stolen from this department and there is proof of nepotism. I handed  a
thick file to the hon Minister. And what did the hon Minister  write  to  me
in response? He said that he has no jurisdiction over the Gauteng  education
department. If he  has  no  jurisdiction  over  corruption  in  the  Gauteng
education department, what jurisdiction does he have? Why  is  he  then  the
Minister of national Education?

When one looks at these things, and notes the way the Ministers are  dealing
with these issues, then nobody is surprised that  crime  is  flourishing  in
South Africa. In a recent investigation it was found that out of  the  total
number of criminals who are apprehended only 9% are successfully  prosecuted
and punished. This means that a criminal who  commits  a  crime  has  a  91%
chance of getting away with it. That is why the FF Plus says:  ``Say  no  to
the ANC's affirmative action which is unreasonable.  Say  no  to  corruption
where Ministers merely shrug their shoulders. Say no to crime.'']

I want to say that the ANC is so soft on corruption that ANC now stands  for
the ``agency for national corruption''. I thank you.

Mr B NAIR: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister of Finance, all the  Ministers
and members of Parliament, it gives me great pleasure - this being  my  last
day in Parliament - to actually get this opportunity to address  the  House.
I was prompted quite late, while I was  seated  here,  that  I  was  due  to
speak. So, I will take the opportunity also to say  au  revoir  to  all  the
members later.

Now, the impression that has been created consistently  by  members  of  the
opposition - particularly the DA, and not only in this House,  but  publicly
- is that the country's economy is in chaos. Emphasis  has  been  placed  on
unemployment and the figure of one million has been thrown about. Some  have
even exaggerated further and said  that  approximately  two  million  people
have become unemployed.

But little did they apply their minds to what gave rise to  this.  You  must
remember that quite a number of supporters of the  DA,  in  particular,  and
probably other parties, are major  financiers.  Already  in  1992  and  1993
quite a number of them began to take their capital out of the country.  Some
of them  went  for  tax  havens.  Many  of  them  also  filched  the  scarce
resources, accumulated by the hard work of  the  working  class.  They  took
this out of the country  in  massive  amounts.  These  were  lodged  in  tax
havens, and so forth. The end result of this has been  that  capital  became
scarce within the country and other countries,  for  instance  China,  where
labour is cheap, attracted capital.

You find that the DA and others say we must  deregulate  and  privatise.  By
deregulation is meant that we must actually do away with minimum  wages  and
other  labour  protective  measures  so  that  labour  would  become  cheap,
equivalent to that of China and other countries. That will be the  incentive
for investment. That is what is actually meant by it. They must come off  it
and tell us the truth.

 The thing is, capital has  actually  been  accumulated  with  an  input  by
labour, as well as the capitalist  class,  but  the  accumulated  amount  is
completely in the custody of the capitalist class. Labour has  no  say  over
it. So, these moneys continually shift.

Notwithstanding  all  the  problems,  the  Treasury,  this  Government,  and
particularly the Minister,  have  been  lauded  by  everyone  concerned  for
having done a pretty good job over the last  seven  years  since  Mr  Manuel
became the Minister of Finance. Collectively, along with the  other  members
of the executive, they have taken responsibility for delivering a number  of
things - not with any of the limitations that we have had - that  is  water,
electricity, food, housing, clinics, hospitalisation, health,  welfare,  and
so forth.

Now, these have been mentioned over and over again. This  was  largely  done
through a properly managed economy. No one, except our opposition, can  deny
that much has been done. They have in fact alleged and  insisted  that  life
was better in 1994, or before that, than at present.  I  join  the  Minister
who said: ``Go and ask the people  whether  their  lives  before  1994  were
better or whether it is better now.''

This is crucial. Responsible members of Parliament - and  especially  senior
members of Parliament, leaders they are supposed to  be  -  actually  incite
the people to a disgraceful degree when they suggest that  life  was  better
then, therefore you have to harp back to the good old days of apartheid  and
division, separate development, and so forth. That is what it amounts to.
Let me take the opportunity - I think I have a few seconds, a  few  minutes,
hopefully - to say it has been  a  pleasure  serving  in  Parliament.  I  am
retiring and I will not be returning  to  Parliament  after  the  elections.
And, on behalf of my colleagues, Laloo Chiba, Reggie  September  and  others
who will also be retiring, I also want to say thank you for  giving  us  the
opportunity  of  interacting  with  the  various  political  parties  within
Parliament and contributing the little that we could in  the  last  days  of
our lives here in Parliament. As it is, I have  already  aged,  I  am  74  -
going on for 75 - and I do not think I will be able to see 100. [Laughter.]

So, therefore, it has been a great opportunity. We can only  hope  that  our
small  contributions  have  helped  Parliament.   We   served   on   various
committees: public accounts, finance, the budget committee,  and  so  forth,
and we hope that the  little  we  have  done  will  be  appreciated  by  the
members. [Applause.] We thank you all. Au revoir, we wish you all  the  very
best in the future. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy President and colleagues,  let
us thank the last speaker, Mr Nair. We only hope we  will  also  reach  that
age.

This year's Budget, like those in the past three years, is directed  towards
growth. And, it was not surprising that the Minister aptly chose  plants  as
his model for growth.

That the greater chunk of the Budget is set aside for provincial  and  local
government authorities is proof that Government has come to terms  with  the
delegated authority which points to a federalist outlook.  We  in  the  UCDP
have always stood for this - to give power to the people. It is  unfortunate
that some Ministries are at pains to take away even the few powers given  to
provinces by the Constitution.

The Minister is to be commended for having succeeded  in  cutting  down  the
indebtedness to 3,1%, and thus being in a position  to  reduce  taxes  by  a
whopping R4 billion. We could not have asked for more and  concur  therefore
with the Minister that there are better days ahead. It is up  to  the  other
two levels of government to use the money profitably for the nation.

A real balancing act was performed in the Budget. Each cluster has  seen  an
increase in their allocation. While the  Budget  is  meant  to  improve  the
quality of life of the citizens, it cannot be denied that it  is  also  used
to direct people  which  way  to  cross.  We  accept  that  Treasury  cannot
prescribe to departments how to use money allocated  to  them.  But  in  the
same breath, we hope that the department, with the  support  of  Parliament,
will  ensure  that  the  directives,  as  set  out  in  the  Public  Finance
Management Act, are followed to the letter, otherwise  the  good  work  that
Treasury is doing will go up in smoke.

For us, a good Budget should address  the  needs  of  the  poor.  It  should
ensure that the have-nots are catered  for.  It  is  great  news  that  land
restitution has been catered for so that the landless and those  whose  land
was usurped could finally have  peace  of  mind  by  tilling  the  land  and
producing food for themselves. This is a step  in  the  direction  of  self-
reliance, a maxim which we believe in.

In the five years of the current Parliament, the President has in two state-
of-the-nation  addresses  stated  that   the   Government   is   tiring   of
underperforming and perhaps nonperforming employees. This is  an  indictment
on the calibre of public servants in Government. Our  advice  is  that  they
should serve the public, and not meddle with politics.  They  should  derive
pleasure in serving the nation.

The increased allocation for putting up a fight against HIV/Aids  should  be
directed at that. We hope that the relevant  department  will  indicate  how
they will use the money but  appreciate  that  Treasury  has  made  a  clean
breast on this matter by providing the funds.

Finally, on a lighter note: the issue of a third term  in  office  has  been
bandied around in some circles in recent times and there is  no  doubt  that
Minister  Manuel  has  successfully  paved  his  way  for  consideration  to
appointment to Cabinet for the third term in the economic  cluster  for  the
good work he keeps doing. Thank you, Mr Minister.

The UCDP supports the Appropriation Bill.

[Bishop L J TOLO: Hon Speaker, before I can proceed with my speech, I  would
like to tell this House and the whole  of  Southern  Africa  about  the  ANC
organisation. The Deputy President, the  hon  Mr  J  G  Zuma,  when  he  was
responding to questions on Wednesday, pointed out that if you take a  bottle
and point it in the direction of the wind, you will hear how much  noise  it
makes. As an hon leader,  he  was  pointing  out  that  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition, the hon Tony Leon, is talkative; it means he is like  a  bottle.
The Deputy President drew a correct conclusion there.

The Afrikaners in Christiana, in the North West,  showed  South  Africa  and
the whole world that there are politicians who talk too much and do  little,
and that the ANC do something after talking. This can be  attested  to  when
we listen to the radio. It reminds me of an old woman who once said:]

Ons gaan vir die ANC stem. Ek weet hy gaan ons help, want ons  sien  hy  gee
huise aan die mense. [Applous.] [We will vote for the ANC. I know  that  the
ANC will  help  us  because  we  see  them  giving  houses  to  the  people.

Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[The hon Tony Leon just talks and does nothing. I am from the  rural  areas.
With regard to the development and creation of jobs in the  rural  areas,  I
would like to point out that before 1994 we used to go and look for jobs  in
Gauteng and other distant areas. But since the ANC-led Government came  into
power, those areas are  electrified,  and  you  have  to  listen  carefully,
because someone who lives in the rural areas tells you.

I remember when Mrs Thoko Didiza said that creating jobs  and  creating  job
opportunities are two different things. What the ANC has done is  to  enable
other people in the rural areas to work with steel,  making  window  frames,
gates and fences, and they have  hired  about  ten  or  more  people,  while
others sell the products. That is what job creation  opportunities  are  all
about.

The rural people knew that when they had to go  to  Checkers,  they  had  to
travel for about 160 to 200 kilometres. After the  ANC  brought  electricity
to rural areas, shops like Checkers, Spar and the plazas are  now  available
in rural areas. Our people are now able to get jobs nearby.

In the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 7 it is said that a man and a woman  should
always be together, and they only live apart if they agree on  that.  I  say
this because when we have job opportunities in rural  areas,  the  men  will
always be with their families, as well the women. In the past we used to  go
to Gauteng, and in the long run we would have girlfriends and no  longer  go
back home. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Now the ANC has created job opportunities in the rural  areas,  and  so  now
the rural areas are like the urban areas. In other areas the  Department  of
Social Development helps women by buying them  machines  to  bake  bread.  I
tell you, we now have hot bread in the rural areas; we no  longer  eat  cold
bread. All these are job opportunities created by the ANC.

In the 1980s rural areas had  a  disease  called  ``Koshiakor'',  which  was
found among children who did not have enough to eat. The children  developed
skin problems. We no longer have this disease because the  ANC  has  created
job opportunities in the rural areas and because now people bake  bread  and
have vegetable gardens,  while  some  cook  for  children  at  schools.  Our
children now have nice-looking tummies.

I do not understand why hon Tony Leon says people are losing  jobs.  And  he
lives in Sandton, a very expensive suburb. Let me indicate to  you  that  we
now have banks in the rural areas - Standard Bank, First National  Bank  and
ABSA. We also have furniture shops as our Government has given the  go-ahead
for rural development. We have post offices and different  businesses.  This
means that our people get jobs nearby, and they sleep at home.  The  traffic
jam on our roads caused by people going to look for jobs in big towns is  no
longer there.

Our people need to understand that in 1912 the ANC indicated that  it  would
fight for people to get freedom. In 1994 people got freedom. This  indicates
the commitment that the ANC has shown. Now we say that  on  14  April  2004,
all the people, both black and white, when they go  to  vote,  should  apply
their minds well and vote for the ANC.

The word ``swartgevaar'' [black peril]  that  was  used  by  the  Democratic
Alliance divides the South African people. Here  in  South  Africa  we  were
against each other, the blacks and whites differed.  But  the  ANC  made  it
possible to have reconciliation, to  forgive  each  other  and  to  live  in
peace. This means that when people go to vote on 14 April 2004 they have  to
make sure that they vote for the ANC.

Hon Mike Ellis can testify that we  are  poor  because  of  their  political
party. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T GODI: Chairperson, comrades and hon members, the PAC would  like  first
and foremost to congratulate the Minister on his  Budget  speech,  presented
towards  the  end  of  the  second  democratic  National  Assembly  and  the
completion of a decade of democratic rule. It was, therefore,  logical  that
the Budget was presented with a glance backwards at the road traversed.

The PAC agrees with  you,  Comrade,  that  the  South  Africa  of  today  is
completely different from that of 10 years ago.  Fundamental  transformation
has taken place on a number of fronts, key to which is  the  democratisation
of the state at all levels and the creation of institutions and systems  for
accountability and monitoring which have given the wretched of the  earth  a
platform and a voice.

The PAC is  happy  and  proud  of  these  achievements.  The  transformation
programme is the agenda of the democratic and progressive forces that  waged
a protracted and bitter liberation struggle for political democracy,  social
dignity and economic justice for the  African  people  in  general  and  the
working class in particular. From its inception the PAC  was  fired  by  the
vision of a society that is democratic,  informed,  nonracial  in  character
and socialistic in context. [Interjections.]

The PAC is in agreement with you, Comrade  Minister,  bearing  in  mind  the
above, that in your words, ``we still have far to walk''  and  that  ``there
is more to be done''. The call of the PAC is that since we  still  have  far
to walk, let's  hasten  our  pace.  Let  there  be  renewed  and  sufficient
political will and progressive policies  to  tackle  head-on  the  stumbling
blocks to economic equity. The heart-rendering poverty amongst the  majority
of our people is the biggest barrier to the expansion of  the  frontiers  of
human fulfilment.

In a country like ours characterised by acute disparities  and  deprivation,
for the majority it is only correct that  the  Budget  must  have  a  strong
preponderance towards social spending. We applaud the increased spending  on
education, health, housing, basically on all departments. However,  we  need
to point out that despite all these, education is  still  neither  free  nor
compulsory. School fees remain an instrument of exclusion.  We  welcome  the
increased spending on health, particularly the fight against HIV/Aids.

We are happy with the allocations that  increase  capacity  in  the  justice
department to deal with crimes against women and children in particular.  We
also welcome the allocation for  our  Pan-African  duties  in  the  DRC  and
Burundi. The PAC fully supports  the  deployment  of  our  troops  in  these
African states.

In respect of Zimbabwe we are happy and  support  the  Government's  correct
and consistent position. We, however, say  Government  should,  as  much  as
possible, do more to assist the government of Zimbabwe.

It is the considered view of the PAC that a considerably  higher  allocation
should  have  been  made  for  land  reforms.  The  correct   intention   of
substantive and faster agrarian reform will be  handicapped  by  a  lack  of
funds. Whilst we support the progressive expansion of  social  security,  it
is the considered view of the PAC that  the  unemployed  and  the  destitute
deserve to be an integral part of our social security programme.

The  Public  Works  programme  for  infrastructural  development  cannot  be
considered to be a serious and sustainable poverty alleviation strategy.  It
is too short term and the bulk of the resources go into the pockets  of  the
individuals who have been given the tenders. Comrade Minister,  the  PAC  is
dead set against  the  privatisation  of  social  services  like  water  and
electricity. In an environment  of  mass  poverty  it  raises  questions  of
affordability and accessibility.  The  frontiers  of  human  fulfilment  are
restricted and not expanded.

We are not yet where we want to be. There is still much to be done. The  PAC
guarantees itself as a ready and principled partner  in  the  transformation
programme. I thank you.

Dr E E JASSAT: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, this  is  also
my swan song. As I leave this Parliament today,  never  to  return  to  this
august Chamber, I would like to thank the presiding officers, my  colleagues
in the ANC, and members of  all  other  parties,  for  the  comradeship  and
friendship  over  the  past  10  years.  My  gratitude  also  goes  to   the
parliamentary staff and  the  nursing  sisters,  who  have  always  been  so
courteous and helpful during my stay here. Special thanks to  those  members
of Parliament who indeed gave me the honour to treat them medically.

The Budget reflects the substantial deprioritisation that has been  achieved
since  1994.  We  have  increased  our  spending  on  social  services   and
infrastructural development which is targeted at the needs of the poor.  The
Government is to  be  congratulated  for  laying  a  secure  foundation  for
sustainable social development. Not only have we drawn from a wide  spectrum
of development policies and practice, but we have shown  our  commitment  to
the people of this country by investing in them.  Our  key  priorities  have
been people driven. We are upgrading  schools,  hospitals  and  clinics.  We
have built homes, thus giving millions of people a roof over their heads.

In the last 10 years, we have worked hard to ensure effective  and  balanced
spending on Public Services. We  have  moved  closer  towards  a  much  more
efficient  tax  system.  We  have  introduced  a   Medium-Term   Expenditure
Framework process, which is a significant  improvement  on  the  incremental
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! This is the hon  member's  last
speech. I think you should do him justice by  listening  to  it,  especially
members in the governing benches - he is your colleague. Thank you.

Dr E E JASSAT: Deputy Chair, we have introduced  a  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework process which is a significant improvement on the  incremental  ad
hoc approach to budgeting of the past.  Improved  planning  that  starts  at
national level and improved policy co-ordination will eventually  provide  a
much needed link between inputs, outputs  and  outcomes.  We  have  included
local government in the vertical split - as required by the  Constitution  -
to enhance local governments' ability to  upgrade  municipal  infrastructure
and  to  provide  electricity,  sanitation  and  refuse-removal  services  -
services which have been sadly lacking in many  parts  of  our  country  for
many years.

We have made tangible changes to the lives of our people. Let me use  health
to  illustrate  my  point.  We  have  unravelled  the  past  by  laying  the
foundation for an effective and efficient health  service.  Today,  pregnant
women, young children and the elderly have access to  free  health  services
in our country. We have increased the supply of doctors  to  areas  of  need
and we have introduced incentives  such  as  the  scarce-skill  remuneration
package for health professionals.

This year we are increasing the hospitalisation grant to R912 million.  This
is for the upgrading and revitalisation of  27  hospitals.  To  improve  the
management and the quality of care in our  hospitals,  a  R142  million  has
been allocated. We have built 701 new clinics and upgraded existing ones.

Nevirapine is available at 150 sites for pregnant women  and  their  newborn
babies. This makes the programme the largest in the world. We  are  reducing
backlogs of assistive devices, such as wheelchairs and hearing aids, and  we
are spending over 13 million for this purpose this year. We  have  increased
immunisation coverage across the country to 74%. No  death  due  to  measles
has  occurred  since  1999,  and  we  have  eradicated  polio  and   tetanus
completely.

New  information  systems   are   being   implemented.   Provincial   health
information budgets have gone from nil to over R10 million per  year.  Major
new legislation has been introduced to deal with issues affecting  both  the
public and the private health sectors. These  include  the  Medical  Schemes
Act which outlaws discrimination against the sick and the elderly.  We  have
taken strong measures to ensure that people living  with  HIV/Aids  are  not
discriminated against, and more importantly, are not prevented from  joining
a medical scheme. In  addition,  we  have  broadened  the  definition  of  a
dependent to make it more consistent with South African families.

We are putting a stop to the domination of  commercial  interest  which  has
begun to take precedence over the needs of the public at large. Progress  is
being made  to  improve  the  supply  and  the  availability  of  affordable
medicines, and we have  introduced  the  Tobacco  Products  Control  Act  to
discourage people, especially the young,  from  starting  to  smoke  and  to
protect the rights of nonsmokers.

With regard to HIV/Aids, we can anticipate rising  demands  for  health  and
social services over the next few years. But the impact can be mitigated  by
managing a process that can redirect the path of the  epidemic  and  make  a
difference to the lives of people affected and  infected  by  HIV/Aids.  The
test of  the  national  response  does  not  lie,  therefore,  in  the  many
disparate activities  undertaken,  knowing  the  organisationally  efficient
approach, but rather in the process of engagement with  people  living  with
HIV/Aids and with the broader society.

I  want  to  congratulate  the  Department  of  Health  on   the   excellent
implementation programme, on the management, care and  treatment  of  people
with HIV/Aids. For 2004, R300 million has been set aside. This  is  a  major
commitment and a major undertaking that all of us must support.

Before I conclude, I want  to  direct  a  few  comments  to  the  opposition
parties. They have  sustained  their  attack  on  reform,  and  particularly
health care reform in this country, and in doing so,  they  have  constantly
contradicted the interests of their own voters.

Everything we do and every day that  passes  is  one  during  which  we  are
transforming and trying to  extricate  our  country  from  our  chaotic  and
ruinous past. Today we are introducing better systems, improving  management
structures and financing ... [Time expired.] Thank you. [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of the women!]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chairperson, Minister, hon  members,  the  MF  notes
the intense work required in devising a suitable,  productive  and  workable
Budget for South Africa,  and  notes  the  many  calamities  and  challenges
facing this country.

Over the past few years,  the  MF  has  been  pleased  with  the  strategies
devised by the hon Minister and his team in  addressing  the  challenges  of
the South African economy. In view of the Appropriation Bill  the  MF  notes
the fine work done by the department. The  challenge  of  poverty  in  South
Africa is immense, and the MF agrees  that  an  earnest  activation  on  job
creation would help us sufficiently in fighting poverty.

 We are proud to note the 2 million jobs created  in  the  past  decade.  We
join the earnest determination and intention to further create as many  jobs
as possible in the next five years through the use  the  promising  Expanded
Public Works Programme. It is sincerely hoped that the R20 billion  invested
in the project will be utilised effectively in attaining promising results.

Another major challenge  South  Africa  faces  is  the  harsh  realities  of
HIV/Aids. The MF has, in its own capacity, embarked  on  HIV/Aids  awareness
efforts amongst our people as have many other governmental, NGOs  and  other
projects.

Crime and safety in our country is  another  factor  that  the  MF  is  very
concerned about, and it is pleasing to note that the department has  made  a
substantial effort in  addressing  the  problem  by  providing  more  police
personnel, equipment, finance and police stations.

A  substantial  allowance  for  education  has  also  been  made  with   the
allocation of R700 million. National and  provincial  levels  are  receiving
attention  too.  The  Government's  intention  to  spend  R318  billion   on
delivering services to the people and which  will  be  divided  between  the
different spheres of Government appears promising. It is  hoped  that  these
funds shall be utilised effectively in doing so.

Regarding the increase to municipalities, it is hoped that it will  lead  to
improved standards of living and conditions throughout South Africa. The  MF
is pleased with the age adjustment made in child support  grants  from  nine
years in 2003 to 11 years in 2004, and the promise of  extending  it  to  14
years in 2005 and hoping to reach 18 years.  However,  we  are  not  pleased
with the increase of only R10 in the child grants, making it R170. How  does
one provide for a child with R170? The MF knows the difficulty in  providing
for our children. They are our responsibility and we hope to see  a  minimum
of R500 per child at least.

Another concern is our pensioners who were granted a  sad  R40  increase.  I
ask: What does this increase do for an adult who is  aged  and  most  likely
hampered by a number of illnesses? The MF calls and appeals for  a  rise  in
the old age and disability grants from R740 to  a  minimum  of  R1  000  per
month. Our people cannot survive on what we are giving them.

In view of the structure of the Bill, the  division  of  roles  between  the
various departments  appears  intact.  The  MF  takes  this  opportunity  to
compliment our hon Minister of Finance and his department on the fine  work.
We hope that your strategy will attain  promising  results.  The  MF  thanks
you, hon Minister, for your success. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Deputy Chairperson, hon members,  the  President  said  in  a
statement on 8 January:


  As we advance towards the next elections and the celebration of our first
  decade of liberation, we must work harder to draw more and  more  of  our
  people into the Letsema and Vukuzenzele campaigns. We must strengthen the
  people's contract to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access
  to jobs and a better life for all.

Only the ANC-led Government can do that. Prior to 1994,  the  South  African
economy was underperforming because of the low income earned  and  generated
by the majority of its people. Economic growth was called to a halt but  the
ANC-led Government was able to cut expenditure  and  reduced  the  debt  and
budget deficit. After 1994 both the debt and deficit are now under  control,
and the debt service costs  have  been  declining  in  real  terms.  Overall
economic stability has been achieved because the economy was deracialised.

Now Government  can  start  to  release  more  resources  to  stimulate  the
economy. This is possible because we have the quality of leadership  in  the
ANC. Our leadership has a history of  sacrifice.  They  can  take  unpopular
decisions if need be.  They  have  the  ability  to  remove  the  chains  of
oppression and redress the imbalances of the past to provide a  better  life
for all.

South Africa has experienced a persistent  structural  unemployment  problem
and with it household poverty and vulnerability. The ANC  seeks  to  provide
more, better and sustainable jobs - in short, decent jobs for all.  The  ANC
has created a range of immediate interventions in  order  to  achieve  that.
More than 2 million net new jobs had been created between 1996 and 2003.
Indeed, the South African economy is well-managed by a  caring  and  people-
centred ANC-led Government based on the will of the people. We have, in  the
first 10 years of democracy,  lived  up  to  the  ideal  stipulated  in  the
Freedom Charter that South Africa belongs to all who live in it. We are  the
ANC today, yesterday and tomorrow; unlike the changing DA, who  dress  in  a
sheepskin when campaigning and a wolf-skin  when  they  are  voting  in  the
Chamber.

Liyasho-ke neBhayibheli lithi,  bazokuza  kini  bembathise  okwezimvu  kanti
ngaphakathi bayizimpisi. [Even the Bible says  they  will  come  to  you  as
wolves in sheep's clothing.]

The ANC-led Government has made miraculous progress in the first  10  years.
In our effort to roll back the frontiers of poverty, we  have  created  work
by removing many of the inherent aspects of the  system  of  apartheid  that
had  systematically  and  purposefully  restricted  the  majority  of  South
Africans from meaningful participation in the economy because  they  had  no
asset base.

This is in line with the Government's vision 2014. This vision  is  targeted
towards an adaptive economy characterised by growth  and  employment  equity
built on the full potential  of  all  persons,  communities  and  geographic
areas.

In the past year's state of the nation  address,  our  President  emphasised
this call when he said:


  As we approach the first decade  of  our  new  democracy,  the  need  for
  economic transformation that brings about effective and significant black
  economic empowerment becomes more pressing.

Today  more  black  people  are   becoming   professionals,   managers   and
technicians. The black economic empowerment  theme  has  been  a  consistent
theme in the ANC policy from the time of the Freedom  Charter.  Two  of  the
main demands of the  Charter  were  that  the  people  shall  share  in  the
country's wealth and the land shall be shared among those who work on it.

We believe, as the ANC, that economies that increase participation of  their
people in production  through  equity,  ownership,  skills  development  and
public-private ownership are more likely  to  become  competitive  and  this
will lead to economic growth.

Black economic empowerment is  a  broadbased  inclusive  process  associated
with governance and part of Government's growth strategy. In  addition,  BEE
Act 53 of 2003 focuses  on  issues  of  ownership,  skills  development  and
serves as the lever for implementing Government's  BEE  initiatives.  Hence,
the introduction of the Broadbased Economic Empowerment Act  last  year  was
only one of the five policy instruments of the  black  economic  empowerment
strategy.

In addition, the strategy document had the proposed code  of  good  practice
which includes definitions, references on the advisory council  including  a
draft constitution to help expedite growth and empowerment  in  the  economy
through the continuing process of recruiting  black  people  into  executive
decision-making positions in companies.

We believe that black economic empowerment will work if the  private  sector
forms partnerships with every organ of state in the implementation of  black
economic empowerment in their companies.

In all this, the ANC leads. In order to achieve this, we need to  embark  on
skills development in an aggressive way, and the  DA  is  opposed  to  this.

Mnr C AUCAMP:  Agb  Voorsitter,  agb  Minister,  'n  begroting  kan  nie  in
isolasie beskou en beoordeel word nie. Dit is  nie  'n  losstaande  dokument
nie,  maar  die  neerslag  van  'n  dieperliggende  ekonomiese  en   fiskale
filosofie. Dieselfde geld vir die Begroting van minister Manuel.

Dit  moet  gelees  word  teen  die  agtergrond  van   president   Mbeki   se
openingsrede waartydens hy die belangrike onderskeid gemaak het  tussen  die
sogenaamde eerste ekonomie en die tweede ekonomie;  'n  baie  meer  sinvolle
onderskeid as die tweenasie-onderskeid. Die  kernstelling  in  dié  verband,
waarop hy ook tydens die TV-onderhoud ná  die  openingsrede  uitgebrei  het,
is:  ``You  can't  develop  the  second  economy  by   hurting   the   first
economy.''(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, a budget cannot be  viewed  and
judged in isolation. It is not an isolated document, but the  embodiment  of
a fundamental economic and  fiscal  philosophy.  The  same  applies  to  the
Budget of Minister Manuel.

It must be read against the background of President Mbeki's opening  address
during which he made the important distinction between the  so-called  first
economy and the second economy; a far more meaningful distinction  than  the
two nations distinction. The crucial statement in this regard, on  which  he
also elaborated during the television interview after the  opening  address,
is: ``You can't develop die second economy by hurting the first economy.'']

With that philosophy the NA can identify itself.

Ons glo dat die Minister met sy Begroting in 'n  redelike  mate  in  hierdie
doel geslaag  het.  Die  kernvereiste  vir  'n  begroting  wat  aan  hierdie
doelstelling beantwoord, is dat 'n  balans  tussen  drie  sake  gevind  moet
word,   naamlik   besteding   aan   infrastruktuur   en    kapitaalprojekte,
maatskaplike besteding en belastingverligting oor 'n breë spektrum.

Die Minister het 'n goeie balans tussen genoemde drie vereistes gevind.  Ons
moet  egter  sê  die  balanseerbalk  waarop  hy  sy  balanseertoertjie  moet
uitvoer, is besig om smaller te word. Dit blyk uit die  feit  dat  vir  2003
R300 miljard ingevorder is teenoor die verwagte R304 miljard.

Die NA is positief oor die  volgende  aspekte  van  die  Begroting  wat  die
eerste  ekonomie  kan  stimuleer:  die  verhoging  van   die   belastingvrye
inkomsteperk na R32 000 per jaar, en vir persone bó 65 na R50 000 per  jaar;
die  verhoogde  toekennings  vir  kapitaalprojekte;   die   afskaffing   van
seëlregte op eiendomstransaksies en die verhoogde intreevlak  op  hereregte,
en die nietoestaan van 'n basiese inkomstetoelae aan alle  persone,  wat  'n
sosialistiese praktyk sou wees wat geen positiewe uitwerking  op  groei  sou
hê nie. Met betrekking tot die tweede ekonomie is daar talle maatreëls:  die
verhoging van ouderdomspensioene en  kindertoelae,  verhoogde  vigsbesteding
en verhoogde onderwys- en ander maatskaplike besteding.

Die NA is negatief oor die volgende aspekte van die Begroting wat  groei  in
die eerste ekonomie kan strem: eerstens die feit dat die belastingvrye  perk
op aftreefondse nie verhoog is nie, maar slegs R120 000  bly,  welke  bedrag
oor die afgelope 15 jaar konstant  bly  en  deur  inflasie  geërodeer  word.
Verder is daar die gebrek aan 'n belastingkorting op grond van uitgawes  wat
deur die publiek aangegaan word om  hulle  te  beveilig  as  gevolg  waarvan
miljarde rande spandeer  word  aan  'n  saak  waarvoor  die  Regering  reeds
belastings het. Die gebrek aan belastingaansporings om groei,  belegging  en
besparing te stimuleer, en die buitensporige  bedrag  van  R1,1 miljard  wat
opsy  gesit  word  vir  militêre  operasies  buite  ons  grense  is  verdere
knelpunte. Suid-Afrika dra 'n té groot las in dié verband.

Die NA wil waarsku teen die volgende: munisipaliteite  beskik  nog  nie  oor
die kundigheid en die bevoegdheid om die groter verantwoordelikheid  waarmee
hulle beklee  word,  veral  ten  opsigte  van  kapitaalontwikkeling  en  die
daarstelling van infrastruktuur, effektief na  te  kom  nie.  Tweedens,  die
Begroting is soos die sakeplan van 'n firma; die toets van  die  som  lê  in
die uitvoering daarvan en dit is waar miljarde rande  oneffektief  aangewend
word of selfs nie eens bestee word nie.

Derdens kan die addisionele befondsing van opkomende boere toenemend  in  'n
bodemlose put beland indien die keuringsproses nie  drasties  opgeknap  word
nie en die beleid om onekonomiese stukkies  grond  aan  soveel  as  moontlik
mense  toe  te  ken  nie  drasties  hersien  word  en  deeglike  planne  vir
indiensopleiding nie daargestel word nie.

In die geheel is dit 'n begroting wat kort voor  die  verkiesing  soveel  as
moontlik mense gelukkig wil hou en dalk ook daarin  geslaag  het.  Die  ware
lakmoestoets lê in die uitvoering daarvan.  Ten  slotte  moet  die  Minister
krediet gegee word vir 'n inspirerende begrotingsrede wat veel  meer  is  as
'n relaas van kille ekonomiese feite en gewis ook bydra tot die  proses  van
versoening in Suid-Afrika. Die  NA  steun  die  Begroting.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We believe that the Minister achieved this  goal  to  a  reasonable  extent
with his Budget. The most important requirement for a budget which  achieves
this goal is that a balance must be  found  between  three  matters,  namely
expenditure on infrastructure and capital projects, social  expenditure  and
tax relief over a broad spectrum.

The Minister has found a good balance between the said  three  requirements.
We have to say, however, that the balancing beam on which he has to  perform
his balancing act is becoming narrower. This is apparent from the fact  that
R300 billion was collected for 2003 as against the estimated R304 billion.

The NA is positive about the following  aspects  of  the  Budget  which  can
stimulate the first economy: the increase in the tax-free  income  limit  to
R32 000 per annum, and for persons older than 65 to R50 000 per  annum;  the
increased allocations for capital projects; the abolition of stamp  duty  on
property transactions and the increased entry level on  transfer  duty,  and
the non-allocation of a basic income grant to all persons, which would be  a
socialistic practice that would have no  positive  effect  on  growth.  With
regard to the second economy there are many measures: the increase  in  old-
age  pensions  and  children's  grants,  increased  Aids   expenditure   and
increased education and other social expenditure.

The NA is negative about the  following  aspects  of  the  Budget  that  can
hamper growth in the first economy: firstly,  the  fact  that  the  tax-free
limit on retirement funds was not raised, but remains only R120  000,  which
amount has remained constant and has been eroded by inflation over the  past
15 years. Furthermore there is the lack of a tax  rebate  on  the  basis  of
expenditure incurred by the public to safeguard themselves, as a  result  of
which billions of rands are spent on  a  matter  for  which  the  Government
already  has  taxes.  The  lack  of  tax  incentives  to  stimulate  growth,
investment and savings, and the exorbitant amount of R1,1 billion set  aside
for military operations outside  our  borders  are  further  problem  areas.
South Africa is bearing too heavy a burden in this regard.

The NA wants to warn  against  the  following:  municipalities  do  not  yet
possess the expertise and the competing  effectively  to  meet  the  greater
responsibility  entrusted  to  them,  especially  in  respect   of   capital
development and the building of  infrastructure.  Secondly,  the  Budget  is
like the business plan of a firm;  the  proof  of  the  pudding  is  in  the
eating, and that is where billions of rands are  utilised  ineffectively  or
not even spent at all.
Thirdly, the additional funding of emergent farmers could  increasingly  end
up in  a  bottomless  pit  if  the  selection  process  is  not  drastically
tightened up and the policy to allocate uneconomic  pieces  of  land  to  as
many people as possible is not drastically revised and  thorough  plans  for
in-service training are not introduced.

On the whole it is a budget that wants to keep as many  people  as  possible
happy just before the election and has possibly also succeeded in doing  so.
However, the proof of the pudding  is  in  the  eating.  In  conclusion  the
Minister must be given credit for an inspiring Budget speech  which  is  far
more than  the  enumeration  of  cold  economic  facts  and  certainly  also
contributes to the  process  of  reconciliation  in  South  Africa.  The  NA
supports the Budget.]

paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Chairperson, hon members, the ANC  is  celebrating  10
years since it gained independence. It is 10 years  since  we  emerged  from
oppression and from struggling with poverty and hunger. What  I  am  talking
about is an independence where, for the first time, all  citizens  of  South
Africa are able to own houses, have access to clean water,  electricity  and
many other basic human rights services. I am speaking  of  a  freedom  where
the ANC-led Government gives support to children in the form of  grants.  In
that independence women are free to obtain and purchase land and  houses  of
their own.

 Deputy Chairperson, I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  invite  my
colleagues on the other side to join us  in  celebrating  our  10  years  of
independence. Unfortunately, they thought that they were oppressing us  when
they were, actually, oppressing themselves in the process.]

They were almost bypassed by opportunities to see  our  ordinary  people  in
South  Africa  taking  part  in  Parliament,  participating  in   law-making
processes through consultation,  izimbizo,  people's  forums  and  giving  a
mandate to the government of their choice and to  the  government  of  their
hopes. Lastly, Chairperson, they almost denied themselves an opportunity  to
see me, an ANC rural woman, addressing them from this podium  on  behalf  of
the ANC. [Applause.]

Deputy Chairperson, the ANC is saying we should have ``a  people's  contract
to create work and fight  poverty''.  The  question  is:  How?  We  are  not
singing praise songs here like Mam' uNkabinde and  the  DA  saying  that  we
have lost jobs and, in the meantime, they have got nothing  in  their  plans
that shows how are they going to remedy the situation of job creation.

As the ANC we are saying this could be achieved through the Expanded  Public
Works Programmes. The ANC expects to  create  one  million  jobs  that  will
target women and children. We have also been able to take the first step  to
ensure that the economically marginalised both in urban and rural areas  are
empowered to join the economic mainstream.
The ANC commenced the continuing effort of Government to improve the  skills
base of the youth and women through the Department of  Labour.  Through  the
partnership between Seta, the Umsobomvu Youth Fund, and the  public  sector,
51% of resources are targeted for women and 4% for the disabled.

The Mpumalanga treasury will commence with a graduate development  programme
as from April 2004; 15 unemployed graduate youth will be trained in  several
areas of financial management in an attempt to make them employable.

Furthermore, Deputy Chairperson, through the efforts of the ANC,  there  are
MPs who are first-year students in the economics faculty.  The  second-years
will be graduating with their advanced diploma  in  economics  on  17  March
2004. [Applause.]

Through perseverance, the snail has reached  the  mark.  The  ten  years  of
freedom mark the end of the beginning. The  ANC  policies  have  transformed
our people into a  better  society.  Women  are  engaged  in  projects  that
benefit them economically, socially, politically and with a positive  impact
on their families. Women  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  in  the  Indwedwe  area,  were
mining kaoline. They have turned that project into  an  economically  viable
project and with the support of the Department of Minerals  and  Energy,  it
has changed and touched the lives of their families.

Women at Osizweni who were mining coal and clay have  developed  it  into  a
viable economic project with the support of the Department of  Minerals  and
Energy. This project has resulted in creating  sustainable  jobs.  We  thank
Corobrick for forging a partnership with the women and making the project  a
success.

Today, women in Orlando East in Gauteng are able to sell  their  fruits  and
vegetables through their vendors and allocate time  to  their  studies.  The
Abet course  in  Orlando  library  has  empowered  women  by  teaching  them
reading, writing and numeracy skills. It also helps  them  to  overcome  the
phobia of using technology as they confidently switch on the  computers  and
go through the lessons without any fear.

At Middelburg in Mpumalanga, there is a women's  project  called  ``Creating
something out of nothing''. Mrs Sarah Skhosana started this women's  project
by recycling tins, bottles and plastics. With the plastic bags they  managed
to produce door mats, table  mats,  shoes  and  hats  in  ANC  colours.  The
project  attracted  many  tourists  through  the  Department  of   Finance's
gambling and tourism, and they managed to grow and are now  exporting  their
beadwork products.

Furthermore, through learnerships  and  skills  development  programmes,  Ma
Sarah is able to use a computer that they  won  in  the  women's  awards  to
manage the programme. She is exposed to exporting regulations. Through  that
project, 100 women are employed.

In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I would like  to  wish  Baby  Thabo  Mkoena  a
speedily recovery. He was admitted to Ermelo Hospital in  January  2004  due
to illness. He was then put into an extremely hot bath by an enrolled  nurse
saying that she was bathing him. The baby is now in pain. The ANC wishes  to
express  their  deepest  sympathy  to  the  Mkoena  family.  Umntfwana  wami
ngewakho; wakho ngewami. [My child is your child; your child is  my  child.]
I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M S BOOI: Deputy Chair, my colleagues in the House and the  Minister,  we
would like to thank the Minister for the contribution he has made  in  being
able to put R1,9 billion aside for  the  police  and  being  quite  specific
about what it is supposed to do with that money. This allows for  recruiting
additional personnel,  modernising  and  expanding  the  vehicle  fleet  and
upgrading the support  system.  The  police  are  very  thankful  for  that,
Minister, because it does help us to be able to go forward.

Before I go into the speech itself, there is one important thing I  want  to
talk about which is the killing of the police, because it is the police  who
do the work and it is the police who defend democracy.  One  of  the  things
that happens is when they fight with criminals,  they  get  killed.  As  the
ANC, we would like to say that we are with them during difficult  times.  We
stand with them and we work with them throughout  the  process.  As  we  are
going to celebrate ten years of democracy, we will never forget them.  Their
families must always know that  we  value  the  contribution  they  make  in
society and we definitely feel that  they  have  to  be  defended.  We  will
always be fighting with them to combat what the criminals are doing.

Minister, as we continue going forward - you said that you do  not  want  to
make it an electioneering platform - there are difficulties,  because  crime
has become an issue that many parties are relating to. That is why  Patricia
de Lille could not be here today. She is  trying  to  get  members  for  her
party and she is not here to come and explain what her view is.

It is important for us to  be  able  to  reflect  on  this,  because  it  is
impacting on our programme as we go ahead, on what work  and  what  type  of
policing we are talking about and bringing on more and more because  as  you
put on these expenditures, as the economy is improving, it  is  quite  clear
that the police have to continue being seen to  do  the  sterling  job  that
they always do. We say it is paying a lot of dividends; in a way,  they  are
helping themselves.

In the Western Cape, that is what the hon Tony Leon was not able  to  relate
to yesterday when he went to Mitchell's Plain and he has not  been  able  to
understand what the performance of the police was. I know that  the  MEC  of
the province has tried to make some information available to him so that  he
can make him understand how many people are involved in bringing crime  down
and what it means to us as a  province  and  the  involvement  of  different
institutions, not only the Minister himself  making  a  statement  that  the
crime rate has gone down. Even the media, the editors agree. I just want  to
read from one of the newspapers, namely Beeld:

As  daar  een   saak   is   waaroor   alle   Suid-Afrikaners,   ongeag   die
bevolkingsgroep,  waartoe  hulle  behoort,  baie  sterk  voel,  is  dit  die
ontoelaatbare hoë vlak van misdaad. Dit is iets  wat  ryk  en  arm,  wit  en
swart, Guatenger, Wes- en Oos-Kapenaar tref.

In die laaste jare is die nasionale en provinsiale regerings  kwaai  hieroor
gekapittel. Daar is gesê  -  en  nie  altyd  ongeregverdig  nie  -  dat  die
Regering nie die erns van die saak besef nie; dat die leiers  nie  voldoende
voeling met die  gewone  mense  op  voetsoolvlak  het  nie,  asook  dat  die
politieke wil ontbreek om misdaad behoorlik vas te vat. Uiteindelik het  een
provinsie wel bewys wat wel gedoen kan word. Die syfers wat in die  Wes-Kaap
oor die daling van misdaad bekend gemaak is, is 'n les vir die  Oos-Kaap  en
alle ander provinsies waar mense soggens koes-koes  hulle  huis  oppad  werk
toe verlaat. Volgens die syfers het misdaad in die Wes-Kaap oor die  feestyd
met 18% gedaal. Die daling was  te  danke  aan  'n  ekstra  poging  wat  die
polisie, wie se beamptes in baie gevalle naweke en vakansies  opgeoffer  het
om hulle medeburgers te beveilig.

Op een vlak, moet 'n mens die mans en vroue in blou  hiervoor  eer.  Ofskoon
die SAPD sekerlik nie bo kritiek verhewe is nie, bly dit 'n  feit  dat  baie
van sy lede gereeld hulle lewe waag om die res van die  bevolking  gerus  te
laat slaap. Op 'n ander vlak, wys dit wat gedoen kan word as  die  politieke
wil  maar  daar  is.  Te  dikwels  ontbreek  dit  daaraan.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If there is one matter that  all  South  Africans,  irrespective  of  which
population group they belong  to,  feel  very  strongly  about,  it  is  the
unacceptably high levels of crime. This is something which affects rich  and
poor, white and black, residents of Gauteng, the Western and Eastern Cape.

During the last few years the national and provincial governments have  been
severely rebuked about this. It has been  said  -  and  not  always  without
justification - that the Government does not realise the seriousness of  the
situation; that  the  leaders  have  lost  touch  with  ordinary  people  at
grassroots level, and that there is a lack of political will to  clamp  down
on crime. In the end one province has showed what can be done.  The  figures
that have been published in the Western Cape regarding  the  drop  in  crime
are a lesson to the Eastern Cape and all other provinces where  people  have
to duck quickly out of their homes in the morning in order to  go  to  work.
According to these figures crime decreased by 18% in the Western  Cape  over
the festive season. This drop was thanks to the extra  effort  made  by  the
police, whose officers in many instances sacrificed  weekends  and  holidays
to safeguard their fellow citizens.

At one level, one should pay tribute to the men and women in blue for  this.
Although the SAPS is certainly not above criticism, it still remains a  fact
that many of its members regularly put their lives on the line so  that  the
rest of the populace can sleep easily. At another level, it shows  what  can
be done if the political will is there. Too often it is lacking.]

This is what one of the newspapers is saying about what is  happening  about
crime in the province. Now, as the hon Leon went to ... [Interjections.]

Ek praat. Baie, baie dankie, meneer. [I am talking.  Thank  you  very  much,
sir.]

Tony Leon was going around yesterday campaigning in Mitchell's Plain and  is
continuing to make it difficult for us to penetrate into Boys' Town. One  of
the things you have to know about what is happening in Boys'  Town  is  that
it is not an issue that started yesterday. It is an  issue  that  Tony  Leon
and the hon Helen Zille have  been  working  on  for  some  time.  Now,  the
documentation we have - I regret that the hon leader of  the  opposition  is
not here ... [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: He is here!

Mr M S BOOI: Okay.

On 16 September 2001, Helen Zille sent a particular  statement  to  the  hon
Tony Leon. They have returned and distributed this document to their  senior
colleagues for the following reasons: One,  to  serve  as  the  basis  of  a
submission to the Independent  Complaints  Directorate  to  investigate  the
conduct of the Langa police and to assist  Minister  Hennie  Bester  in  his
oversight over the police; to serve as the basis  of  a  media  strategy  to
expose the ANC's agenda of driving the DA out of Langa; to  provide  a  case
study that will assist in informing the developing national  and  provincial
strategy to extend DA support into new areas; in particular, to  ensure  the
DA devotes the necessary resources to supporting our members who  are  under
concerted and sustained attacks; to help shift  the  debate  within  the  DA
towards a focus on the difficulties we have  in  taking  the  fight  to  the
African National  Congress,  a  struggle  that  will  become  commensurately
greater if we want to succeed in  our  objective.  That  is  the  reason  we
continue finding that it is impacting on  the  way  we  want  to  come  into
Khayelitsha.

Now, with what the  DA  is  saying  and  what  the  hon  member  was  saying
yesterday, which the members have tried to bring to his  attention,  he  has
not been able to understand and not been able to reflect correctly  on  what
is happening in the province itself.

All the cases that Helen Zille has been able to report to  the  police  have
been investigated but the motives of the cases have not been  genuine.  They
have been cases to try  to  help  the  DA  to  make  inroads  into  our  own
constituencies. That was why, yesterday, the police  were  saying  that  the
hon Tony Leon comes to our constituencies and looks for votes,  but  at  the
end of the day, he is not able to reflect on the genuine  contributions  the
police are making within our constituencies. He is  not  able  to  give  any
respect to the work that the police are doing, given that type  of  analysis
and given the fact that, even yesterday, the police were  saying  that  this
hon member does not understand what is happening within the service itself.

 He generalises most of the time as he makes his attack  on  Government.  He
does not have the details. He lacks the ability to put facts and figures  to
the issues that he raises. The one issue that he  raised  yesterday  was  to
use Ted Leggett in his analysis. He definitely knows that Ted  Leggett  does
a lot of good work and a lot of analysis, but he has not been  able  to  say
that what that reporter, Ted Leggett, has done about the Western Cape  as  a
province is a little bit old. He has not really  been  informed  about  what
has recently been happening.

Before I leave here, there is something I need you to note and to take  very
seriously. As I  was  saying  about  Boys'  Town,  the  hon  leader  of  the
opposition with his constituency have been making it difficult for us to  be
able to campaign and canvass in that particular constituency.

Under Hennie Bester it has always been  difficult,  because  there  was  the
Pagad issue which, when the DA was in power in the  province  with  the  New
National Party, they were unable  to  resolve.  Today  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr N  S  BRUCE:  Chairperson,  I  thought  that  the  hon  Bruce  Kannemeyer
supported the poor. [Interjections.] Instead he supports the white  boys  in
empowerment. Next year he will want to join the FF  Plus.  But  I  must  say
that I am flattered that the hon Billy Nair should have a  high  opinion  of
my financial acumen. He should really listen to what I have to say.

The famous actress Tallulah Bankhead once  remarked,  looking  down  at  her
bosom: ``There is less in this than meets  the  eye.''  [Laughter.]  I  hope
that is not the case with  the  two  important  targets  in  the  Budget  on
economic growth and unemployment reduction, for the Minister has  constantly
had difficulty getting up his GDP to the targets of Gear, despite  the  grip
he has had on the former Director-General of Finance and which he might  not
have on the new Director-General.

This is the third conservative Budget in which disposable incomes have  been
increased through personal tax cuts and social infrastructure  spending.  It
will boost demand without  any  measured  attempt  to  increase  supply.  As
demand outstrips supply under the watchful eye of  an  inert  central  bank,
renewed inflationary pressures are inevitable.

Presently they are being contained  by  a  rising  rand  inflated  like  the
Australian dollar by a commodity rally, but also inflated by  a  speculative
demand for high-yielding rand securities, stimulated by interest rates  that
have been too high for too long. Its manifestation is  a  turnover  in  rand
securities.  It  is  several  times  higher  than  that  of  investments  in
comparable currencies. It is a bubble that will burst.

When it does, investors will look with  dismay  at  the  medium-term  budget
policy that commits Government to keeping taxes at 25% of GDP when they  are
instead at 28%, raising the burden on those capable  of  increasing  supply.
They know that the average annual growth of GDP has  fallen  from  6,28%  in
the 1960s to just about 2% now, while per capita growth rates are down  from
2,44% to - 0,73% at the close of the century, and manufacturing value  added
is down from 9,8% to 1%.

Since 1994 our capital markets  have  moved  offshore.  More  South  African
shares are bought and sold in London and  New  York  than  in  Johannesburg.
This reflects stalled privatisation and broken exchange control promises.

What Roy Campbell said of our novelists applies  to  those  who  wrote  this
Budget:


  You praise the firm restraint with which they write -
  I am with you there, of course:
  They use the snaffle and the curb all right,
  But where is the bloody horse?

[Laughter.] The Budget does appear to acknowledge  that  there  are  factors
outside of its direct purvey that also influence growth, social  and  labour
laws that raise the prices of the factors of production are among them,  nor
should the alchemy of the Cabinet  be  overlooked.  To  argue  that  BEE  is
without economic risk, is as candid as saying  that  beetroot  will  prevent
Aids.

We missed the last upturn in world economic activity and we should  be  very
wary of doing so again. To prolong our economic travail by  setting  targets
that are not met is the most cruel and  insensitive  thing  that  Government
can do to the poor and the unemployed. Both will happen unless  there  is  a
willing coalition between Government, labour and  business  at  the  highest
levels in which each acknowledges  without  rancour  or  prevarication  that
each has to make sacrifices to achieve the growth rates that  are  vital  to
our peace and prosperity, and which none can on its own deliver.
While compromise may be the key to economic growth, it is not the  stuff  of
democratic opposition. The  clash  of  ideas  is  what  makes  Parliament  a
parliamentary democracy. I do not  think  that  democracy  can  survive  the
constant substitution of party vainglory for intelligent  debate.  The  good
news is that this  is  the  last  time  that  you  have  to  listen  to  me.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] The bad news is that you will instead  have  to
listen to many more liberals than you ever thought  possible,  although  how
many will be an elaborate drag I am not sure.

I  thank  the  President  for  the  hours  he  has  afforded  me  of   quiet
contemplation, if not undisturbed slumber; the  Speaker  and  the  presiding
officers for their courtesy, if indifferently vouchsafed; the  comrades  for
their noisy accommodation and my soon to be erstwhile colleagues  for  their
forbearance. Farewell. [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!] [Applause.]
Ms N S  MTSWENI:  Deputy  Chairperson,  Ministers  and  hon  members,  South
Africa's destiny is closely tied to the Southern African region  and  Africa
as a whole. Promoting peace, stability and security  in  Africa,  especially
Southern Africa, is crucial  in  promoting  South  Africa's  foreign  policy
goals, but also for the wellbeing of South Africa itself. This is why  South
Africa has been actively engaged in a variety of processes in attempting  to
realise this goal.

Building  a  peaceful  continent  offers  us  a  possibility   of   building
democratic institutions that are sensitive to  the  needs  of  the  poverty-
stricken masses of Africa. Peace will allow us  the  opportunity  to  create
conditions for economic growth and prosperity. Peace will allow us to  build
a government that will be sensitive to the people and  their  human  rights.
Peace will allow us to offer the chance to build a better life  for  all  in
the continent.

The ANC Government, convinced  that  our  umbilical  cord  is  tied  to  the
continent, has budgeted an amount of R1,1 billion over the  MTEF  period  to
contribute to a struggle for peace, democracy and economic prosperity.

In 1996 the Leader of the Official Opposition declared:


  I am African. An African by birth, but also an African by choice.

Yes, hon Leon, an African by choice. I am an African woman, not  by  choice,
but by the creation of God - hence my commitment to  the  African  continent
is also not by choice.

It is that choice that makes the ANC different from hon Leon  and  his  herd
of sheep. We will not decide the presidency of another  independent  African
country as articulated by the DA's manifesto. During the apartheid  violence
we advocated peace. Those who had difficulties with peace then are  exposing
themselves that they have not accepted that they lost the  war  in  Zimbabwe
and Angola in the 1980s.

An African by choice makes changes at all times when  their  choice  is  not
appropriate. Peace also dictates that we  address  poverty.  Nepad  aims  to
increase the economic growth rate for the next 15 years, to  reduce  poverty
by half, to encourage debt cancellation, to further reduce conflict  and  to
provide greater access to the world markets. Nepad  is  the  cornerstone  of
the AU, and is the real plan to fight poverty and underdevelopment.

We must particularly commit ourselves to practically assist with the  social
normalisation  and  economic  reconstruction  of  Zimbabwe,  the  DRC,   and
Swaziland.  It  is  also  important  that  we  improve  co-operation   among
countries of the south, especially with respect to  economic  relations  and
sociopolitical programmes, and  actively  support  programmes  which  ensure
peace and equitable global relations. It is also important that  we  promote
a  collective  multilateral  approach  to  global  changes  and  ensure  the
democratisation of the UN, the IMF, the WB, and the global institutions.  We
must make sure that development and  environmental  goals  of  humanity  are
followed through.

We have worked, and we must continue to work, towards  the  success  of  the
African Renaissance, and we must do whatever we can for the renewal  of  the
continent. We must ensure that the system  of  international  governance  is
improved, so that the foundation  of  the  peaceful  and  free  world,  with
prosperity, equality, and friendship are among all people.

The protocol relating  to  the  establishment  of  the  peace  and  security
council is a critical intervention by African leaders to enhance  intrastate
security and reduce the possibilities of people like the hon Leon,  who  has
ambitions of invading other African countries where the inhabitants  do  not
have the privilege of deciding when to be an African  and  when  it  is  not
appropriate.

South  Africa  has  contributed  to  the  Great  Lakes  peace  process   and
reconciliation. We did that because we  were  motivated  by  the  desire  to
contribute our share of responsibility to  peace-building.  Those  who  have
choices when they become Africans tell us when they are not, that  if  voted
for they will tell Africans how they must behave.

It is the masses of our people who on 14  April  2004  will  walk  to  their
voting stations to vote for peace, prosperity and  rule  of  law,  and  they
will in doing this sign a contract that together we will fight  poverty  and
underdevelopment.

A vote for the ANC is a vote for human rights and peace in South Africa  and
the continent. A people's contract continues to fight not only for the  poor
in South Africa, but in Africa and the continent as a whole.

Mr Tony Leon, together we will create a  better  Africa.  Together  we  will
create a better life for all in Africa. Together  we  will  defeat  poverty.
Together we will create peace and prosperity. Forward to the ANC victory  on
14 April, forward! [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: Forward! [Applause.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Chairperson, hon members, South Africans inside  and  outside
this Chamber, it's not easy to stand here today, at the  end  of  the  first
decade of democracy and at the  threshold  of  the  beginning  of  the  next
decade. For others it is very easy because what they have  to  do  and  what
they always do is to stand on the rooftops and cry foul all  the  time,  and
dish out criticism left, right and centre. For us in the ANC it is a  moment
for us to ponder seriously where we come from, what  we  have  achieved  and
what we can still improve on. We do not have the luxury  of  creating  havoc
and mass hysteria for any reason because many decades ago we  took  it  upon
ourselves to  build  a  free,  democratic,  nonracial  and  nonsexist  South
Africa.

I have entitled my speech, ``Quest for truth''.  I  have  entitled  it  thus
because there is very little truth being told from  a  lot  of  quarters  in
South Africa today. We need to go back to basics and check  whether  we  are
truly taking society to where we should be taking it. Honesty and truth  are
very necessary ingredients for building a new  nation  and  for  building  a
winning nation.

I want to speak to South Africans today about the problems of  HIV/Aids  and
corruption. Towards the end of my speech I will  also  speak  about  poverty
and the Budget - the very Budget we are debating here.

Last year I lost a sister to HIV/Aids. She  was  not  employed  and  was  29
years old. We didn't share the same surname, so very few  people  knew  that
she was my sister because she was  my  mother's  daughter  from  her  second
marriage. She lived in Schweizer-Reinecke and  later  in  Wolmaranstad,  and
when she died she was in Mafikeng. So she spent the whole  of  her  life  in
the North West province.

After discovering that she was  HIV-positive,  she  received  antiretroviral
drugs from a public clinic. She was on the  drugs  for  nine  months,  after
which, without our knowledge, she stopped taking the drugs. By the time  she
resumed taking her antiretrovirals, her body had developed  resistance.  She
died of TB and meningitis.

I have another sister who is HIV-positive. She is a social  worker  employed
by the Department of Correctional Services. I am telling  you  this  because
she has also disclosed her status like my  deceased  sister  did.  When  she
discovered that she was HIV-positive she was devastated and  she  wanted  to
resign from her work. The department and her colleagues encouraged  her  and
ensured that she received support. Today she is  taking  her  antiretroviral
drugs and her CD count has grown a lot. She has gained weight  and  is  back
at work.

With these two scenarios, I would like to show you that there are people  in
South Africa, especially on my right hand side, who come  from  the  DA  and
who are actually dancing on the misery and the pain of our people. They  are
using the problem of HIV/Aids as an electioneering tool. Actually,  they  do
not live amongst the poor people. They do not live among  the  sick  people.
They do not care a bit. They make the  loudest  noise,  claiming  that  they
care when they actually don't. [Applause.]

We, in the ANC, have vowed to build a caring society. We make calls  to  our
people everyday. We ask them to roll up their sleeves because  there  is  no
known cure for Aids and there is no vaccine  for  Aids.  So  it  helps  very
little to shout every day and say that  the  Government  is  doing  nothing,
when actually the Government has done a lot.

Comrade President Thabo Mbeki is on record, and no government of  the  world
has disputed what he said, as having challenged governments of the world  to
state that they have a programme on HIV/Aids that  is  comparable  to  South
Africa's. No government has done so. [Applause.]

We were in the streets of the Western Cape, last week, canvassing. We met  a
poor woman in Memani Street in Crossroads. It was  almost  lunch  time,  and
she was mixing fresh milk and water to feed her kids and  grandchildren.  As
we entered, the only thing you  could  smell  was  overcooked  porridge.  We
spoke to her and asked her whether anybody in the household  had  registered
with the Department of Home Affairs and was receiving grants. She said  that
the old man received an old age pension and she welcomed the news that  this
would increase.

I also asked her whether she herself had applied as she  was  also  eligible
for the pension grant. She said they were happy with the old  man's  pension
and that they didn't want to be greedy and apply for another one. No  amount
of persuasion  could  convince  her  to  apply  for  child  grants  for  her
grandchildren. She was eternally  grateful  for  the  little  that  she  was
getting. In fact, in her own words, on HIV/Aids, she had this to  say  -  my
Xhosa is not good but I will try to quote her verbatim:


  UTony Leon uthi uza kuyithini i-Aids?  Uthi  uMbeki  makayithini  i-Aids?
  UBush yena uza kuyithini i-Aids? Abantu  abadala  nabantwana  mabaguquke.
  [What is Tony Leon going to do about Aids?  What  does  he  propose  that
  Mbeki should do about Aids? And what should Bush  do  about  Aids?  Adult
  people and youth must change their lifestyle.]


  Let them change their ways. Let them change their lifestyle. That is  the
  only salvation for humanity.

[Applause.] Our people understand the seriousness of the challenge of  Aids.
The ANC is the last organisation on earth that stood up when  apartheid  was
declared a heinous crime against humanity. For that reason the ANC  took  up
arms against apartheid. Today HIV/Aids is threatening humanity. The  ANC  is
the last organisation to be lax or not to care when it comes to HIV/Aids.

I want to tell you something  that  I  was  not  sure  I  should  tell  this
audience today. As early as 1991, whilst  we  were  negotiating  the  sunset
clauses and better things for the public servants of the  apartheid  regime,
we were going around the country, together with  Comrade  Rapu  Molekane,  a
then member of Sayco, which later became the youth league,  talking  to  old
and young people alike, selling them the negotiations and also telling  them
that Aids would succeed where apartheid had failed if we do not  respond  to
it. We were saying that apartheid had  failed  to  wipe  us  out,  but  Aids
would. So anybody who suggests that the ANC does not care where HIV/Aids  is
concerned is telling a blatant lie, and our people know that. [Applause.]

As I conclude the HIV/Aids issue, Nombuliso Hlwele, of Khayelistha  in  Cape
Town, once had a CD count of one. She is on antiretrovirals now,  and  these
were supplied by neither the DA, nor the private  sector,  but  by  our  own
clinics. She is now a full-fledged artist. She has drawn the face  of  Thabo
Mbeki and not that of Tony Leon, asking people to go  and  vote.  What  does
that mean to you?

So  you  can  claim  to  be  representing  the  people,  but  you  are   not
representing Nombuliso Hlwele, who has survived because of  assistance  from
this Government.

Moving to corruption. Corruption is also a  threat  to  the  realisation  of
national development. Therefore there is no way the ANC can be lax  or  turn
a blind eye to corruption because corruption  threatens  the  attainment  of
what we stand for. We have gone to great  lengths  putting  institutions  in
place to deal with and expose corruption, but those that shout  at  the  top
of their voices, those who want to create mayhem and are prophets  of  doom,
in the country and  internationally,  are  ridiculing  our  people  and  our
Government, and each and every step that we take.

 However, we are not bothered because the people of South  Africa  that  are
poor, and amongst whom we live on a daily basis, not those that are  visited
by others only during election time, know for sure that the ANC said a  long
time ago that with its might  and  everything  at  its  disposal,  it  would
ensure a free  and  a  safe  democratic  South  Africa.  Therefore,  because
corruption is a cancer that eats into what we are trying to build,  the  ANC
will never tolerate it. President Mbeki has called for a zero tolerance  for
corruption. We have measures that I can say are unprecedented  in  terms  of
exposing corruption.

We are making a call to our people that they must not be idle.  They  should
roll up their sleeves and prevent HIV/Aids by changing their lifestyle,  and
also showing some care as we are trying to  build  a  caring  society.  They
should help those that have been affected by or infected with Aids and  make
sure that the comprehensive strategy for the treatment and care of  HIV/Aids
patients works.

They should make their own contribution and tell us what is it that  we  can
do to improve the situation, because  the  Government  has  put  aside  R2,1
billion for HIV/Aids alone. It has also increased social spending, which  is
also going to affect the programmes related to HIV/Aids.

Our people know by now that when the  DA  says  west,  they  must  go  east.
History has taught them that when they say north, they  must  go  south.  So
they continue to shout and shout and shout. The more they  shout,  the  more
they make the ANC successful and the more they  encourage  the  majority  of
our people to join the ANC. [Applause.]

Mr Tony Leon, I have an eight-year old son and a twelve-year  old  daughter.
They have asked me many times why Mr Tony Leon is so rude. I  have  said  to
them that I'm also wondering why he is so rude. I have  not  told  them  yet
that he is not only rude, but that he also never tells  the  truth.  I  have
not  told  them  that  because  I'm  trying  to  protect  the  integrity  of
Parliament. [Interjections.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, is it parliamentary for the hon member to  make
the comment she has made about the Leader of the Opposition?

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Ms  Mentor,  could  you  withdraw  the
remark, please?

Ms M P MENTOR: I withdraw it, Chairperson. I thought  it  was  important  to
indicate to the House what my children think. But I apologise. [Applause.]

You see, we have a responsibility to build. We should be careful  about  the
manner in which we conduct ourselves  because  our  children  are  watching.
What kind of legacy and heritage do we want to leave them ...

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson,  that  was  not  an  unconditional  withdrawal.
[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, on a point of  order:  We
would, in fact, appeal to you that the record has to be studied  closely  so
that an informed ruling could be made on  this  very  same  subject.  So  we
don't agree, in the first instance, with the first  ruling,  but  also  with
the follow-up point of order made by the hon member. Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Chief Whip, we will look at  the  record,
if it can be produced timeously, otherwise  we  will  have  to  revisit  the
ruling. Please continue, hon member.

Ms M P MENTOR: In Atlantis we saw abject poverty where the DA had ruled.  We
were touched by the many young girls who had  been  raped  and  are  not  at
school. Hon Tony Leon may deny  it  because  he  has  once  denied  this  on
record, that he had links with Paratus,  which  was  a  mouthpiece  for  the
former SADF. You  see,  the  apartheid  regime  depended  on  corruption  to
survive. They had to do it. [Interjections.] If you can  stretch  your  mind
you will remember the gangsters, the Mexicans, all over  Galeshewe.  In  the
townships they would make sure that they set up gangsters. They  would  make
sure that even in the prison cells and police station  holding  cells  women
were raped by the police and the SADF as a  way  of  extracting  information
from them, and Tony Leon had links with them.

Today you are actually saying our Government  is  corrupt  because  you  are
actually longing for the corruption under which you were thriving. You  see,
they also spread this lie, just to give you an example, that when they  say,
east, we must always go west. They told a lie ...  I'm  sorry,  I  beg  your
pardon, Chairperson. [Laughter.] There was an untruth ...

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, on a point of order ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: What is your point of order?

Ms R TALJAARD: I do believe that the Rules require ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!
Ms  R  TALJAARD:  Chairperson,  we   are   apparently   dealing   with   the
Appropriation Bill debate and the Rules require that when we deal  with  the
Appropriation  Bill  debate,  we   indeed   deal   with   the   Budget   ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  member,  your  time  has  also  expired.
[Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Hon Chairperson, with  regard  to  the
point of order raised by the hon member, just for her  benefit  as  well  as
that of this House, there is no such Rule. Thank you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, getting to the  point  of  order
taken earlier, I had ruled that it was unparliamentary for  the  hon  member
to say that another hon member does not speak the truth. In the interest  of
rounding off business today and not to  prolong  an  outstanding  ruling,  I
think my ruling was correct, and the  member  has  withdrawn,  and  I  think
we'll leave it at that.
Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Mr Chairperson. I want to congratulate the  Minister
of Finance ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Mr J DURAND: ... on once again presenting a Budget which  can  compete  with
the best in the world. The Minister always manages to perform well  even  if
the circumstances are not favourable.

The New  NP  agrees  with  the  Minister  that  economic  growth  should  be
accelerated in order to create jobs and fight  poverty,  and  believes  that
this Budget will go a long way in doing just that.

While listening to the hon Taljaard finding fault  once  again  with  almost
everything in the Budget, I could not help but feel very grateful  that  she
is only the shadow Minister of Finance, as she likes to  refer  to  herself,
and not the real Minister of Finance. Luckily, she will never  be  the  real
Minister of Finance. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, the reason I am grateful that the  DA  will  never  be  in  any
position to be in charge of South Africa's money is because we  have  first-
hand experience of how they are unable to handle large sums  of  money.  The
best example is the City of Cape Town. Here the DA  showed  that  they  have
absolutely no idea how a budget works, and how to manage money.

In die tyd toe die  DA  aan  die  bewind  was  in  die  Stad  Kaapstad,  was
oorbesteding, wanbetaling en die uitsetting van arme weerlose mense aan  die
orde van die dag. Die DA-regering het die stadsraad se  finansies  letterlik
in die afgrond in bestuur. Só erg was dit verlede jaar toe die Nuwe  NP-ANC-
regering oorneem, dat 'n  spesiale  taakspan  aangestel  moes  word  om  die
gemors te beredder. Die voorsitter van die komitee is  die  Nuwe  NP-adjunk-
burgemeester, Pierre Uys, en die raadslid belas  met  finansies  is  nog  'n
Nuwe NP-lid, Mev Maatje Malan. Binne 'n paar maande het hulle  dit  reggekry
om die Stad Kaapstad se geldsake tot só 'n mate reg te ruk dat dit  vir  die
eerste keer in jare nie meer in die rooi is nie.

In drie maande het die kontant en beleggings van die stadsraad met  meer  as
300% verbeter. Kontantinkomste is  met  R11  miljoen  meer  as  die  begrote
bedrag in  Desember  opgestoot  ...  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[During  the  time  the  DA  was  in  power  in  the  City  of  Cape   Town,
overspending, default payments and the eviction of  poor  vulnerable  people
were the order of the day. The DA government literally managed the  finances
of the City Council into the ground. It was so bad last year  when  the  New
NP-ANC Government took over that a special task team had to be appointed  to
put the mess in order. The Chairman of the Committee is the  New  NP  Deputy
Mayor, Pierre Uys, and the councillor charged with finances is  another  New
MP member, Mrs Maatje Malan. Within a few months they managed to  straighten
out the financial affairs of the City of Cape Town to such  an  extent  that
for the first time in years it is no longer in the red.

Within three months the cash and investments of the  City  Council  improved
by more than 300%. Cash revenue has been increased by R11 million more  than
the budgeted amount in December ...]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: On a point of order!

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Durand.  Please  take  your  seat.
Yes, hon member.

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  is  ons  besig  met  Kaapstad  se
begroting of hierdie Begroting? [Tussenwerpsels.] Kan ons  vir  daardie  agb
lid  vra  om  hierdie  Begroting  te  bespreek?  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)
[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mr Chairman, are we dealing with Cape  Town's  budget  or
this Budget? [Interjections.] Can we ask that hon  member  to  discuss  this
Budget?]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! That is not a point  of  order.
Please continue, hon member.

Mnr J DURAND: Dankie,  Voorsitter.  Dit  gaan  oor  die  vermoë  om  met  'n
begroting te werk. Dit is 'n voorbeeld van mense wat met geld kan werk.  Die
ANC en die Nuwe NP bewys dit, en daarom verkies die Nuwe NP om saam met  die
ANC-regering te werk sodat ons ons eie kundigheid tot voordeel van al  Suid-
Afrika se mense kan aanwend. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Chairman. What is at issue is the ability  to  work
with a budget. This is an example of people who can  work  with  money.  The
ANC and the New NP prove this, and that is why the New NP  prefers  to  work
with the ANC Government so that we  can  apply  our  own  expertise  to  the
benefit of all of South Africa's people.]

Furthermore, we all know by now about the  DA's  election  baby  called  the
basic income grant. With this plan the DA effectively takes bread  from  the
mouths of poor people and gives it to the rich. Let me explain.  The  income
grant is supposed to go to everybody in  South  Africa,  probably  including
the hon Leon, the Cabinet, and all the members of the DA as well.

They want to fund it by adding 1% to VAT, which in the end  will  mean  that
the poorest of the poor will have to pay more for food.  And  the  suggested
R110 will have no effect on  dealing  with  poverty,  while  the  rich,  who
obviously do not need the R110 and will not go hungry as a result of  higher
food prices, will benefit all the way. Now I ask you, how in the  world  can
one deal with poverty with such an insane plan?

Dit maak my net weer eens dankbaar dat die DA nooit meer aan die bewind  sal
kom nie. Die DA se radio-advertensie sê hulle gaan meer  sogenaamde  kundige
mense in die staatsdiens aanstel. 'n Mens kan net wonder  of  dit  nie  weer
eens 'n regse reaksie op regstellende  aksie  is  nie,  soos  die  gewraakte
mediokrasie oftewel 'n regering  deur  deskundiges  wat  in  verskeie  lande
verwerp is. Ons dink maar aan die DA se flater met die kundiges in  Kaapstad
... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This once again makes me grateful that the DA will never govern again.  The
DA's radio advertisement states that they will be appointing more  so-called
experts in the Public Service. One can only wonder if  this  will  not  once
again be a right-wing reaction to affirmative action, like the  unsuccessful
mediocracy or a government by experts who  have  been  rejected  in  various
countries. We only have to think of the DA's gaffe with the experts in  Cape
Town ...]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, your time has expired.

Mr J DURAND: Ek dank u. [Applous.] Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms L L MABE: Hon Chairperson and the House at large, in  the  book  you  are
the Boss it is stated that one always knows the truth. Every time  you  want
to innovate, you threaten someone  who  does  not  want  change  to  happen.
Expect some resistance to your ideas, and prepare for it  in  advance.  This
quotation is relevant to the ANC, and I would like to illustrate why  I  say
so.

What the ANC did, and  will  continue  doing  in  the  next  decade  of  our
democracy, is to implement the people's mandate as outlined in  the  Freedom
Charter, the `Ready to Govern' document and the RDP  document,  as  well  as
the Constitution of South Africa.

The goal is to create a  nonracial,  nonsexist,  democratic  and  prosperous
South Africa. The RDP document clearly states that Government will meet  the
basic needs of society.  And  it  is  not  by  chance.  Therefore,  we  will
continue to deliver services to our people, and will continue doing  so  for
the next decade and the decade after that. To  achieve  all  this,  the  ANC
consults and  involves  communities  in  decision-making  through  meetings,
imbizos and ward meetings. And let me inform  you  that  these  imbizos  and
ward meetings are attended in large numbers,  because  people  want  to  say
whatever they want to tell their Government. This is  democracy  in  action.
[Applause.]

I want to indicate that some people have forgotten where we come  from,  and
I want to tell our people of South  Africa:  you  must  vote  for  the  ANC,
because if you don't vote for the ANC and vote for the DA you will  go  back
to apartheid, because the DA is totally against progress  and  this  country
is on its path. [Interjections.] But I also  want  to  indicate  that  South
Africa must know that we, as the ANC, have delivered houses,  clean  running
water, health care, electricity, communications to people in  the  townships
as well as the rural areas. And it is not by chance, it is what the RDP  has
told us.

Gone are the days when the townships could be  identified  from  afar  by  a
thick cloud of smoke in the mornings and in the afternoons. Today,  we  have
electricity in townships and rural areas.

A re se lebaleng gore bontsi jwa batho bo sale  bo  ikwadisetsa  go  nna  le
matlo ka bo1970-71. E bile a re se lebaleng gore gompieno ke ANC e e  nayang
matlo go batho ba ba saleng ba leta go simolola ka  bo1970.  DA,  e  fano  e
itseng go bua botoka, e kgatlhanong le gore ANC e neye  batlhoki  matlo.  Ke
rata gape gore ke re ... (Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Let us not forget that many  people  have  been  on  the  waiting  list  to
receive houses since 1970-71. Let us also not forget that today  it  is  the
ANC that allocates houses to people who have waited since the  early  1970s.
The DA, which now wants to be seen to care, is against the move by  the  ANC
to allocate houses to the poor. I would also like to say that ...]

... the RDP continues to inform us that we must develop human resources.  As
the people's congress we utilise the private sector  and  civil  society  to
assist us to develop human resources.

Kgetse ya tsie e kgonwa ka go tshwaraganelwa. [A  job  becomes  easier  when
many people give their assistance.]

In 1994 the ANC took over a government and an economy that  had  a  pathetic
skills deficit with a huge unskilled and unemployable labour market.  It  is
not my fault that we have this huge skills shortage, and  a  low  number  of
black matriculants who  pass  maths  and  science.  The  problem  cannot  be
addressed overnight, even by prophets of  doom  who  claim  to  have  better
solutions to the problems of this country.

Consequently, the ANC calls on  all  South  Africans  to  participate  in  a
people's contract to create work  and  fight  poverty,  as  their  patriotic
contribution to speed up service delivery and grow the economy for a  better
life for all.

Lere la rona la RDP la re re age le go godisa ikonomi ya naga e e neng e  le
gaufi le go sugagana pele ga 1994. Ka jalo ...  [Our  RDP  programme  states
that we should build and grow our country's economy, which was on the  brink
of collapse before 1994. Therefore ...]

... the Government had to turn around the  macroeconomic  and  microeconomic
policies, and introduce institutional reforms  in  financial  management  at
all levels of government.

A re se lebaleng gore Puso e, e amogetse boswa jwa sekoloto se se bokete  go
tswa mo pusong ya tlhaolele le dinagamagae tse bangwe ba lona fa ba neng  ba
di goga kwa pele. A re se lebaleng gore ke Puso e, e e fetotseng  selebo  sa
setshwantsho se ke ratang fore ke le bontshe sona. (Translation of  Setswana
paragraph follows.)

[Let us not forget that this Government inherited  a  heavy  debt  from  the
apartheid government and the homelands, which some of you led.  Let  us  not
forget it is this Government that changed the shape of the  picture  that  I
am trying to show you.]

Tax infrastructure and management which were in a terrible  state,  are  now
on firm ground to collect sufficient revenue  for  Government  to  speed  up
service deliver. For the first time in our history we have  reliable  census
statistics that include all South Africans, who  also  appear  on  a  common
voters' roll and have the right to choose the government  of  their  choice.
Furthermore, Government was compelled to democratise the state  and  society
that were divided in various forms, as directed by the RDP document.

I also want to indicate that 10 years  ago  we  had  highly  repressive  and
hostile police and defence forces that were big enemies of  our  people,  as
well as of the liberation forces. Integration and transformation to  form  a
democratic state machinery continues, and the ANC has ensured that,  amongst
these, women  and  youth  form  part  of  democratic  structures  that  were
dominated by white minority needs.

Development programmes  like  the  Public  Works  programme,  infrastructure
development,  extension  of  telecommunications,  building   of   additional
classrooms, health care  centres,  police  stations  and  the  provision  of
electricity to rural areas are some of the things that  the  ANC  has  done.
But I want to give this illustration that in 1984 my parents in  Mabeskraal,
Rustenburg,  had  to  pay  R900  to  access  electricity  from  the   former
Bophuthatswana government. How much was R900 at that time?  The  ANC,  right
now, gives people easy access to electricity - 20 years  later.  [Applause.]
I also want to say that our traditional leaders have long been  waiting  for
this Parliament to finalise the  Bill  on  traditional  leadership,  because
they want the ANC to deliver services to people in  their  areas  -  because
they cannot afford to do so without the ANC Government.

I want, members, to give you this picture of the  ANC,  which  I  relate  to
``setlhare sa motswere'', a mahogany tree. A  mahogany  tree  can  withstand
strong winds. It can withstand all hostile weather conditions, but  it  will
stand firm, grow tall and strong. And that  is  the  ANC.  [Applause.]  From
1955 the ANC was prepared to ensure that all South Africans  have  a  better
life ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Ms L L MABE: Today the ANC is still prepared to make sure that  you  have  a
better life. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairman, my late father advised us,  if  you  don't  have
anything good to say about a person rather  remain  silent.  Little  did  he
realise that one of his children would  become  a  politician.  However,  in
this, my last speech to Parliament, I shall adhere to his advice.

The documentation submitted with  this  Budget,  which  includes  measurable
objectives for each programme of  each  Vote  together  with  the  multiyear
medium-term budget  policy  statement,  put  Parliament  in  a  position  to
consider the issues  properly,  and  to  scrutinise  and  oversee  executive
action as required by the Constitution. The quality and quantity  of  budget
information supplied ...
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  there  is  a  point  of
order. Please take your seat. What is your point of order, hon member?

Mr D J SITHOLE: Chairperson, being a young man  in  this  House  I  find  it
quite difficult to understand - and I need your help - if it is  appropriate
that members come to this House wearing clothes that are used for  sleeping?
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  That  is  not  a  point  of  order.  Please
continue, hon Andrew.

Mr K M ANDREW:  Thank  you,  Chair.  The  quality  and  quantity  of  budget
information  supplied  is  of  the  highest  order.  It  conforms  with  and
sometimes exceeds international best practice. One of the most exciting  and
encouraging aspects of our Parliament, after 1994, was the determination  to
strive to be as good as, or better than, the best in the world, rather  than
finding excuses for accepting mediocrity. My plea  today  is  that  we  keep
alive that bold spirit to  be  amongst  the  best  in  the  world  in  every
respect.

My second request is that we recognise and respect  the  importance  of  the
institution of Parliament so that it can play the critical role set out  for
it in our Constitution. Parliament is more important than any individual  or
political party. In this regard I would plead that further consideration  be
given to incorporating  a  proper  constituency  element  in  our  electoral
system. Without it, I believe that Parliament  will  not  achieve  its  full
potential,  and  the  people  of  South  Africa  will  become   increasingly
alienated from their representatives in Parliament.

I have been fortunate to have been a member of Parliament for 23 years,  and
to have contributed in a small way to the many positive  changes  that  have
taken place. I thank the people, the parties and the voters who  have  given
me this opportunity, and especially my wife and family for the  support  and
encouragement they have given me over the  years,  and  for  the  sacrifices
they have made on my  behalf.  I  would  also  specifically  like  to  thank
colleagues from all parties with whom I have had cordial relations.  Amongst
the longest standing ones are hon Colin Eglin, on whose behalf  I  canvassed
at the age of 18 as a member of the Progressive Party in 1961 and  hon  Tony
Leon,  leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance,  who  has  been   consistently
supportive, the hon Errol Moorcroft,  a  gentle  giant  with  talents  often
hidden by his modesty, and from other parties, the hon Laloo Chiba, the  hon
Barbara Hogan, and the hon Gavin Woods, to mention a few with  whom  I  have
worked on a number of committees in a friendly  and  productive  way.  Thank
you to all of you, and to the very many that I have not mentioned.

Finally, let me  say,  South  Africa  is  a  great  country  with  boundless
potential. Let us all ensure that its potential is realised to the  full.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Chairperson, everyone in this House could  see  that  the
hon Andrew became increasingly uncomfortable.  We  wish  you  well  in  your
retirement,  Ken,  and  we  hope  that  you  will  make  a   more   positive
contribution than the DA subjected you to over the  past  couple  of  years.
[Interjections.]

President's Mbeki's vision  for  improved  economic,  social  and  political
progress in South Africa, and then  the  African  Renaissance,  continue  to
rally us as a nation and continue to rally our continent.

Vandag  is  die  Minister   van   Finansies   die   lieflingkind   van   die
aandelebeurse. Hy word gerespekteer  deur  multinationale  instellings  soos
die IMF en die Wêreldbank. Die internasionale graderingsagentskappe  vertrou
hom en hulle vertrou die ANC-regering. Anders as  die  opposisie-doemprofete
in Suid-Afrika, slaan daardie agentskappe nie soos 'n  skulpie  toe  wanneer
die ANC-regering en die ANC-leierskap ondernemings gee,  wetgewing  deurvoer
en internasionale inisiatiewe neem nie, veral  nie  op  ons  kontinent  nie.
Trouens, hulle staan nader om hulp te verleen, en soos die meerderheid Suid-
Afrikaners word hulle gerusgestel, want hulle weet dié land en  sy  ekonomie
is en was nog nooit so goed bestuur soos tans die geval is nie.

Ek wil vir die Minister sê dit is lekker om in 'n koerant soos Beeld te  kan
lees:


  Trevor Manuel stel nasie gerus. Oorsese ekonome soek vergeefs  begroting-
  slaggate.

Dit is lekker om te lees dat ons Regering internasionaal bespreek  word,  en
hulle kan niks anders sê nie as:


  Die Begroting was voorspelbaar. Hy is gebou op 'n stewige  fondament  van
  gesonde fiskale dissipline en bestuur wat Manuel en sy span die  afgelope
  agt jaar gelê het.

Minister, ons wens u geluk daarmee.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Today the Minister of Finance is the darling  of  stock  exchanges.  He  is
respected by multinational institutions such as the IMF and the World  Bank.
International rating agencies trust him and they trust the  ANC  Government.
Unlike the opposition's prophets of doom in South Africa, those agencies  do
not clam up when the ANC Government and ANC  leadership  give  undertakings,
pass legislation and take the initiative internationally,  specifically  not
on our continent. In fact, they come closer to  lend  assistance,  and  like
the majority of South Africans their minds are set  at  ease,  because  they
know that this country and its economy have never been as  well  managed  as
at present.

I want to say to the Minister that it is good to read in  a  newspaper  such
as Beeld:


  Trevor Manuel stel nasie gerus. Oorsese ekonome soek vergeefs  begroting-
  slaggate.

It is good to read that our Government  is  discussed  internationally,  and
that they cannot say anything other than:


  Die Begroting was voorspelbaar. Hy is gebou op 'n stewige  fondament  van
  gesonde fiskale dissipline en bestuur wat Manuel en sy span die  afgelope
  agt jaar gelê het.

Minister, we congratulate you on this. [Applause.]]

The Budget review is our vehicle, as the  ANC,  to  translate  our  policies
into reality. That reality is a people's contract to create  a  better  life
for all and to push back the frontiers of poverty. This - the commitment  of
the ANC to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty  -  is  understood  by  the
majority of people in this country. And this is why I  predict  that  on  14
April they will cast their votes to be winners. The majority of people  will
enter into the contract with the ANC,  and  they  will  vote  for  the  ANC.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

We  are  a  resourceful  nation  -  hard-working  -  and  our  diversity  is
increasingly a strength and an asset. Notwithstanding the past,  the  future
affords us all an equal chance. We, as South Africans and  Africans,  should
all become part of the mainstream to reach the goal of nation-building  -  a
diverse, but a united nation.

In die filosofiese sin is ons almal as Afrikane mekaar se bloedfamilie.  Die
Afrikaners wat in die apartheidsera die bus bestuur het, moet  wegbreek  uit
hul verlede en deel word van die uitdagings van Afrika en  Suid-Afrika.  Ons
moet deel word van nasiebou en versoening en as Afrikane  ons  deel  in  dié
land bydra, sowel as opeis.
Ek vra dit, want die mense wat  in  die  vorige  bedeling  verdruk  is,  kon
maklik op groot skaal op hul destydse verdrukkers wraak  geneem  het.  Hulle
het nie, hoewel die meeste van hulle nog oneindig slegter daaraan toe is  as
die mense wat voorheen bevoordeel is,  en  stel  hulle  vir  die  wêreld  'n
voorbeeld met die versoenende houding wat daagliks ingeneem word.

Wanneer ek verkiesingsplakkate en uitsprake van die opposisie  sien  en  dit
rassevrese  manipuleer,  kiesers  se  emosies  opjaag  en  ``swart  gevaar''
skreeu, word een belangrike  aspek  van  die  2004-verkiesing  uitgelig,  en
daardie aspek is hoe vêr of hoe na moet die  Afrikaners  van  die  Regering,
die ANC en die swartes in die algemeen  staan,  en  hoe  toegeeflik  of  hoe
ontoegeeflik en onversetlik moet hulle wees oor die sake wat  hulle  ná  aan
die hart lê?

Dít is mos die sentrale tema van 'n groot koor  in  hierdie  opposisiebanke.
Nou, ek besef vandag, gegewe ons land  se  geskiedenis  van  konfrontasie  -
ongeag foute wat deur die ANC-regering gemaak is, want ons is  net  mense  -
is een ding seker, president Mbeki en sy voorganger,  ons  geliefde  Madiba,
is opreg met nasiebou en versoening, en hulle is ook opreg met die  rol  van
die Afrikaner.

Hiervan getuig Die Burger op 23 Februarie 2004 in sy hoofberig - en laat  ek
sê dit is 'n hoofberig en  'n  standpunt  waarvoor  daar  waardering  is  en
waarvoor daar baie respek is. Ek haal aan:


  Met  sy  toespraak  Vrydag  tydens   die   plegtigheid   waarop   hy   'n
  eredoktersgraad van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch  ontvang  het,  het
  Mbeki uit die hart gepraat.

Later in dieselfde berig:


  Hy erken ook die rol wat Stellenbosch speel as die bakermat van die taal,
  maar daardie leiersrol bring ook die verantwoordelikheid om toe  te  sien
  dat die taal en sy sprekers deel van  die  hoofstroom  word  om  'n  nie-
  rassige gemeenskap in Suid-Afrika te bou.

Ons stem heelhartig daarmee saam.

Ek wil net graag vir president Mbeki sê, meneer, deur u  eerste  termyn,  en
op die vooraand van u tweede termyn, het  u  elke  Afrikaanse  hart  geraak.
Baie van ons mense daar buite kan huis toe kom. Dit is net die  DA,  die  VF
Plus en 'n paar ander wat by eergister vasgesteek het.

Die DA is in 'n politieke woestyn; hulle verstaan  nie  president  Mbeki  se
internasionale leierskapsrol nie, nóg  minder  verstaan  hulle  nasiebou  en
versoening. Die DA is 'n opposisie wat die verlede ontken, en ook  nie  deel
is of wil wees van Afrika nie. Trouens, vanwaar ek sit, kyk ek só  na  hulle
en met 'n uitsondering hier en daar, lyk hulle slegter en erger  as  die  ou
KP's van die Volksraad van daardie dae. [Applous.]

Dit is mos die agb Tony Leon wat sê: wat sleg is vir  Suid-Afrika,  is  goed
vir die DA. Sy vertrekpunt is negatief en 'n mens kan sy lojaliteit  teenoor
Suid-Afrika en die mense van hierdie land ernstig bevraagteken. Kom  ons  sê
vir mekaar sommer padlangs:  die  goeters  in  die  bos  spook  by  die  DA.
Trouens, dit gee hulle ernstige nagmerries.

'n Ander dorslandtrekker in hierdie verkiesing is nie nou  in  die  Raadsaal
nie - die VF Plus. Die VF Plus en hul leier  stel  my  effens  teleur,  want
vandat hulle die KP ingesluk het definieer hulle etniese identiteit as  ras-
eksklusief. Ras-eksklusiwiteit beteken noodwendig rassisme. Dít is die  dood
in die pot. Jou Afrikanerskap sit in jou hart, in jou verstand - nie in  die
kleur van jou vel nie.
Suid-Afrika se demografie is onherroeplik 'n roereier. 'n Volkstaat  in  die
Noord-Kaap - nogal met die belaglikheid van  sy  eie  geldstelsel  -  is  'n
droom. Ek wil vra, maak eerder vrede met jou verlede, al is dit hoe  pynlik,
en aanvaar die werklikheid. As  jy  dít  doen,  sal  jy  tuis  voel  in  jou
vaderland, Suid-Afrika. Die tyd is verby dat die volk uit  een  mond  praat.
Daardie strewe na een identiteit, een stem, is die ander gogga  in  die  bos
wat aangespreek moet word. Laat staan daardie gekheid; kom terug op die  pad
waar u was, leier van die VF,  dit  was  'n  positiewer  pad,  maar  ná  die
feesmaal aan die KP lyk dit vir my daar is 'n sooibrand wat jou die  woestyn
laat intrek.

Ek vra Afrikaners om nie onrealistiese  beloftes  deur  opposisieleiers  ten
prooi te val nie. Hierdie beloftes manipuleer eintlik net mense  se  diepste
rassevrese en  dra  niks  tot  versoening  by  nie.  Die  DA  en  die  ander
Afrikanerpartye wat dan vry en dan baklei, is  die  een  mislukking  na  die
ander. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle sukkel nou nog  met  die  sooibrand  van  hul
verlede, hoor net daar!

Trouens, hul onbeholpenheid om versoening en nasiebou  in  hierdie  land  te
bevorder, sou komies  gewees  het  as  dit  nie  so  tragies  was  nie.  Die
rasbeheptheid van die verlede is 'n duur les wat party mense -  so  lyk  dit
vir my - net nie wil leer nie. Die geleentheid vir 'n ruimte  van  politieke
gees doen hom nou op 14 April voor. Die  Afrikaner  moet  hom  nou  loswoel,
losdink en loswikkel van 'n hartseer geskiedenis. Hulle  moet  nie  inwaarts
negeer nie; hulle moet van die goggas, die goeters in die bos ontslae  raak.
Hulle moet die hoofstroom betree en saam bouers van 'n beter  toekoms  word.
Veertien April is die tyd om huis toe  te  kom  en  deel  te  word  van  die
hoofstroom.

Ons rig hierdie versoek, want die eksklusief, wit  oorheersde  debat  om  'n
sterk opposisie tot stand te bring, is maar net nóg 'n  hersenskim  soos  so
baie  ander  onhaalbare  ideale   wat   in   hierdie   land   nagejaag   is.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Hierdie debat van 'n sterk  opposisie  in  die  sogenaamde
belangegroep-opposisie gaan net weer lei tot  'n  volgende  rondte  van  wit
Afrikaner-ontnugtering. Die Afrikaner is deel van Afrika en hulle  moet  nie
weer op 'n etniese grondslag  in  een  hoek  gejaag  word  nie;  hulle  moet
daarteen opstaan. [Applous.]

Op die vooraand van die tweede termyn van  president  Mbeki  is  ons  opnuut
geïnspireer deur die versoenende rol wat hy  speel.  Daar  is  'n  groeiende
getal Afrikaners daar buite wat deel sal wees van  die  hoofstroom  van  die
politiek, want hulle wil. Hulle sal president  Mbeki  se  hand  vat  om  die
ongelykhede van die  verlede  uit  te  wis.  Hulle  wil  werk  vir  blywende
voorspoed en namate ons boodskap wortel en vrugte dra, sal hulle, anders  as
Kanna, huis toe kom om hier te kom presteer. [Applous.]

Ek vra, ter afsluiting, van alle Suid-Afrikaners, en veral  die  Afrikaners,
om my voorbeeld te volg op 14 April, naamlik om die President van  dié  land
se hand te vat, 'n bouer te wees en ANC te stem, want dié land  is  ook  jou
land.  Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[In the philosophical sense we as Africans are all related  to  one  another
by blood. The Afrikaners who drove the bus during  the  apartheid  era  must
break away from their past and become part of the challenges of  Africa  and
South Africa. We must become  part  of  nation-building  and  reconciliation
and, as Africans, play our part as well as claim our share in this country.

I am asking this, because the people who were oppressed under  the  previous
dispensation could easily have taken revenge on their former  oppressors  on
a massive scale. They did not  do  so,  although  most  of  them  are  still
infinitely worse off than the people who were previously  disadvantaged  and
they are setting an example to the world with  the  reconciliatory  attitude
they adopt daily.

When I see election posters and statements by the opposition, and that  they
manipulate racial fear, incite the emotions  of  the  electorate  and  shout
``swart gevaar'', one important aspect of the 2004 election is singled  out,
and that aspect is how far from or close to the Government, the ANC and  the
black people should the Afrikaners stand in general, and  how  accommodating
or unaccommodating and inflexible should  they  be  concerning  the  matters
that are dear to them.

Surely this is the central theme  of  a  large  choir  in  these  opposition
benches. Now, I realise today, given our country's history of  confrontation
- irrespective of the mistakes that have been made by  the  ANC  Government,
because we are just people - one thing is certain, President Mbeki  and  his
predecessor, our beloved  Madiba,  are  sincere  about  nation-building  and
reconciliation, and they are also sincere about the role of the Afrikaner.

Die Burger testified to this on 23 February 2004 in its editorial - and  let
me say it is an editorial and a standpoint for which there  is  appreciation
and great respect. I quote as follows:
  Met  sy  toespraak  Vrydag  tydens   die   plegtigheid   waarop   hy   'n
  eredoktorsgraad van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch  ontvang  het,  het
  Mbeki uit die hart gepraat.

Later on in the same report it stated:


  Hy erken ook die rol wat Stellenbosch speel as die bakermat van die taal,
  maar die leiersrol bring ook die verantwoordelikheid om toe te  sien  dat
  die taal en sy sprekers deel van die hoofstroom word  om  'n  nie-rassige
  gemeenskap in Suid-Afrika te bou.

We agree wholeheartedly with this.

I would just like to say to President  Mbeki:  Sir,  throughout  your  first
term, and on the eve of your second term, you have touched  every  Afrikaner
heart. Many of our people out there can come home. It is only  the  DA,  the
FF Plus and a few others who are bogged down in the day before yesterday.

The DA is in a  political  wilderness;  they  do  not  understand  President
Mbeki's international leadership role, and they  understand  nation-building
and reconciliation even less. The DA is an opposition that denies the  past,
but is not nor does it want to be, part of Africa. In fact, from where I  am
sitting, I look at them and, with an exception here  and  there,  they  look
worse than the old CPs of the House of Assembly of those days. [Applause.]

It is, after all, the hon Tony Leon who said: What is bad for  South  Africa
is good for the DA. His  point  of  departure  is  negative  and  one  could
seriously question his loyalty to  South  Africa  and  the  people  of  this
country. Let us say to one another in plain language:  Unseen  spectres  are
haunting the DA. Indeed, this is giving them serious nightmares.

Another Thirstland trekker in this election is not in the Chamber now -  the
FF Plus. The FF  Plus  and  their  leader  are  disappointing  me  somewhat,
because since they have swallowed up the CP they define ethnic  identity  as
racially exclusive. Racial exclusivity necessarily means racism. This  is  a
dead-alive situation. Your Afrikanership is in your heart, in  your  mind  -
not in the colour of your skin.

Demographically  South  Africa  is  irrevocably  like  scrambled   eggs.   A
volkstaat in the Northern Cape - indeed with  the  additional  ludicrousness
of its own currency - is a dream. I want to ask, make peace with  your  past
instead, no matter how painful it is, and accept reality. If  you  do  this,
you will feel at home in your fatherland, South Africa.  The  time  is  over
when the people spoke with one voice. That  desire  for  one  identity,  one
voice, is the other thing lurking in the  bushes  that  must  be  addressed.
Stop that madness; come back to the path on which you were,  leader  of  the
FF, it was a more positive path, but after feasting  on  the  CP  you  would
seem to be suffering from indigestion that is forcing you into the desert.

I am  asking  Afrikaners  not  to  fall  prey  to  unrealistic  promises  by
opposition leaders. These  promises  actually  manipulate  people's  deepest
racial fears and do not contribute one jot to  reconciliation.  The  DA  and
other Afrikaner parties are either courting one another or quarrelling  with
one another, are experiencing one failure after the other.  [Interjections.]
They are still struggling with the indigestion of the past, just  listen  to
them!

In fact, their ineptness in promoting reconciliation and nation-building  in
this country would have been comical if it  had  not  been  so  tragic.  The
racial obsessiveness of the past is an expensive lesson that some  people  -
it appears to me - just do not want to learn. The opportunity  for  openness
of political spirit will present itself on 14  April.  Afrikaners  must  now
struggle to disengage, dissociate and detach themselves from a sad  history.
They should not become inwardly negative; they must get rid of the  spectres
lurking in the bushes. They must enter the mainstream  and  become  builders
of a better future. On 14 April it will be time  to  come  home  and  become
part of the mainstream.

We make this request,  because  the  exclusive,  white-dominated  debate  on
establishing a strong opposition is just another mirage, like so many  other
unattainable   ideals   that   have   been   pursued   in   this    country.
[Interjections.] This  debate  on  a  strong  opposition  in  the  so-called
interest  group  opposition  will  just  lead  to  another  round  of  white
Afrikaner disillusionment. The Afrikaner is part of Africa and  they  should
not be driven into a corner on the basis of ethnicity again; they must  rise
up against this. [Applause.]

On the eve of President Mbeki's second term we  are  inspired  anew  by  the
reconciliatory role that he is  playing.  There  are  a  growing  number  of
Afrikaners out there who will be part of the mainstream of politics  because
they want to be. They will join forces with  President  Mbeki  to  eradicate
the inequalities of the past. They want to work for lasting  prosperity  and
as our message takes root and bears fruit  they  will,  unlike  Kanna,  come
home to flourish here. [Applause.]

I want to ask, in conclusion, of all  South  Africans,  and  especially  the
Afrikaners, to follow my example on 14 April, namely to  take  the  hand  of
the President of this country, to be a builder and vote  ANC,  because  this
country is also your country. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  let   me   express
appreciation to everybody who participated in this debate.  It  is  an  open
political debate and I think many of the contributors  had  focused  largely
on the matter at hand, namely the Appropriation Bill. So, I  would  like  to
express my sincere appreciation for that.

I think that one of the key issues that we need to talk about on an  ongoing
basis is economic policy in general and  how  it  resonates.  I  think  that
there is still a degree of misunderstanding about the  power  of  the  state
and the ability of the Budget to do all of  the  things  that  we  think  it
ought to do.

In an article published in the name of Prof Servaas van der Berg on  Tuesday
this week, he wrote:


  Government economic policy has a  potentially  asymmetrical  impact.  Bad
  policies can be disastrous. But  good  policies  usually  cannot  improve
  outcomes all that much since  outcomes  are  also  influenced  by  market
  forces and other events outside  of  the  Government's  control  such  as
  global economic conditions.

This is something that some members reflected on and I  think  some  members
chose, in the debate, to be oblivious of. It's important that we  come  back
to this issue. It's important that we again realise that the Budget at  hand
is one  that  builds  on  the  past,  but  one  that  only  has  a  measured
contribution to the future. It is not a Budget intended in a cruel  way,  in
respect of the poor, to try and say  things  to  them  that  can't  be  done
simply because we want  to  catch  their  votes.  So,  understanding  global
trends and understanding what the Budget can  and  can't  do  and  why  this
Budget takes the position that it does is exceedingly important.

The second issue is the matter of  employment.  Now  here,  clearly,  people
have all kinds of weird and wonderful ideas.  But  what  the  Budget  Review
does on  page  44  is  to  recognise  that  the  way  in  which  we  measure
unemployment or employment at the moment is inadequate and that we  need  to
undertake  a  lot  more  work  because  the  base  of  what  we  measure  is
insufficient. And, having recognised that, we must then go forward and  say,
as we have said, that 2 million net jobs have been created  since  1994  and
not dispute that because that can be proved and then move  on  to  the  next
base. [Applause.]

It's  exceedingly  important  that  we  deal  with  the  position   of   the
unemployed, because what political parties are doing that is so wrong is  to
lie to  the  unemployed.  You  lie  to  the  unemployed  because  you  don't
understand the  dehumanising  impact  of  unemployment  on  the  individual,
families and communities. I say without fear of contradiction that there  is
no political party in this House or  those  desiring  to  enter  this  House
which has any panacea for unemployment in this country. [Applause.]  So  let
us not lie to the poor. Let us recognise what the impact of this is. Let  us
recognise what the constraints are.

Hon Odendaal, we would all like full  employment.  Full  employment  is  not
realisable in any country, at this stage. So, there are constraints  and  we
must deal with those issues for what they are. But we must also,  in  trying
to deal with those, not fail to recognise ... [Interjections.]

Mr T D LEE: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Lee, I want to say  goodbye  to  you  today  for
good reason, so let me speak first. You see, what we must not do is fail  to
recognise the history of this country, what poverty does to people  and  why
workers'  rights  matter  in  South  Africa.  So,  this  notion  of   untold
flexibility, of the ability of employers to treat workers as floor rags,  is
not something that will ever resonate with working people in  this  country.
[Applause.] Let's take that out of the equation and  deal  with  the  issues
for what they are. Let's deal with the rights of people for what  they  are.
I make this very strong appeal, because if we ignore that then we will  fail
to realise the collective responsibility that we have to communicate  a  set
of messages about change that is positive, and change that  impacts  on  the
lives of the poorest of our people. It's  in  this  context  then  that  the
issue of the Expanded Public Works Programme needs to be understood.

I don't think that there is anybody on the side of Government who would  say
that these jobs  are  permanent.  But,  what  we  are  saying  is  that,  in
recognition of  the  impact  of  unemployment  and  the  minimal  access  to
training opportunities for young people in South  Africa,  equipping  people
with a set of portable skills can be done and will be done. And once  people
have passed through these programmes with the skills they  have,  they  will
be in a much  better  position  to  undertake  what  we  have  described  as
sustainable livelihoods.

At the moment the gap between where young people are since  they  have  left
school and where they need to be is too great and this  is  an  intervention
that is calculated and designed to support this enormous gap.  So,  it  will
reach a number of people. It will grow in impact. It  will  improve  on  the
quality of infrastructure that people  have.  But  I  don't  think  that  we
should delude ourselves into suggesting that these  would  be  permanent  in
nature.

There were also debates about the state of the  economy  and  the  issue  of
privatisation was trundled out  by  the  opposition  parties.  Well,  it  so
happens that by and large business and Government and the trade  unions  are
ad idem about the position of both  the  energy  sector  and  the  transport
sector in South Africa. You  see,  if  you  deal  with  this  energy  sector
negligently and fail to recognise  that  the  bulk  of  our  industries  are
energy intensive, you will destroy the industrial base. And, unless we  deal
with the transport sector to unlock the potential by  looking  at  logistics
quite differently from how they have been looked at in  the  past,  we  will
fail to unlock the potential of the vast industrial  part  of  South  Africa
which happens to be very far  from  the  ports  through  which  we  need  to
export. So we much approach these issues and if we break up these  companies
for the sake of the ideology of privatisation, we will destroy the  base  of
our economy. [Applause.]

The hon Groenewald  raised  issues  -  he  is  not  in  the  House  -  about
corruption. Let me say that  I  agree  with  him,  and  certainly  with  the
passion of  the  hon  Mentor,  that  we  must  work  together  to  root  out
corruption from society. I want to agree with the hon Mentor that  it  is  a
curse and a cancer, and we must root it out. But I want to also say  without
fear of contradiction that the ANC has never been afraid to act against  its
own where instances of corruption are  proven.  [Applause.]  We  must  guard
against this notion that every allegation is a fact. But where  allegations,
through the process of law, are proven, it's necessary to  deal  with  these
individuals, whoever they are. Regarding where the hon Groenewald  got  this
idea that some people may be untouchable, I would like to engage with him  a
bit more, but we must never allow corruption to take root in a way  that  it
can't be dealt with.

In the course of the debate the hon  Jassat  made  a  very  important  point
because I think he debunked one of the myths that's trundled out in  respect
of Government's caring. He did so by demonstrating that the  Government  has
the largest programme to prevent mother-to-child  transmission  anywhere  on
the globe. [Applause.] That is not what people are  saying.  It's  not  what
people are saying in the way in which  election  campaigns  are  structured.
It's not what  people  are  saying.  Also,  in  recognising  this,  we  must
recognise that the use of drugs  like  nevirapine  have  now  produced  side
effects which previously weren't known. We must remain alive to the  debates
and not merely be satisfied with chemical  interventions  and  believe  that
all problems will be solved. [Applause.]

Let me also draw attention to the fact that  there  was  a  fair  amount  of
populism in the debate. We need to caution against populism.  I  would  have
hoped that before this House rose today I could get an abacus or at least  a
pocket calculator for the leaders of  the  opposition  parties  so  that  we
don't say the things that we do because we confuse the poor. You  see,  even
my sister, Comrade Rajbally, in suggesting that the child support  grant  be
increased to R500 a month, would see the numbers move from R6,7  billion  to
R24,6 billion in this year. That is unaffordable. If we say those things  to
people we will destroy our own credibility. We will raise their  hopes  that
would only be dashed. I think the privilege that we  have  in  a  democratic
South Africa is that the  poor  are  unbelievably  tolerant.  But,  we  will
destroy that and we will destroy it through populism.

On the subject of populism, Madam ... - who is in the  Chair  now?  -  Madam
Deputy Speaker. I thought that there was a different person  there.  I  have
done some calculations on some of the party manifestos  on  the  subject  of
populism. The manifesto of the DA would push up costs  by  R28  billion,  in
addition to what we are spending.  It  would  add  a  further  2,1%  to  the
deficit, pushing our deficit to  R70  billion  or  5,2%  of  GDP.  The  debt
service costs on that would be R15 billion that wouldn't  be  available  for
spending. And in addition to that, we know that VAT would be  increased  and
that would impact  on  the  poor.  I  want  to  say  to  the  DA  that  your
macroeconomic populism is unsustainable and doesn't  accord  with  what  you
are saying in this House. [Applause.] Do the calculations and  you  will  be
embarrassed. Do the calculations and you will be embarrassed,  because  what
you are putting on the table by way of a basic income grant,  the  abolition
of certain taxes, the abolition of property taxes,  allowing  businesses  to
deduct the first 15% or the first R2 000 a month, the  opportunity  vouchers
and the bursary voucher programme, are unaffordable  in  South  Africa.  You
will not do it in a million years of Sundays. Forget it. [Applause.]

But, fortunately the voters will not be misled. I think that it  is  a  good
thing that our voters, as the hon Mentor has said, may not have had all  the
benefits of education but they aren't stupid.

Let me express my  sincere  appreciation  to  the  many  stalwarts  of  this
Parliament who are taking leave of us. Certainly,  regarding  Comrade  Billy
Nair who has been there, not just in the  10  years  of  Parliament  but  in
contributing to democracy all his adult life, it's  a  big  moment  to  take
leave of you; but, the same applies to Comrade Reg  September,  Comrade  Iso
Chiba, Comrade Essop Jassat. They are  four  of  the  stalwarts  whose  life
contribution has been to bring about democracy in this country. I  think  we
owe all of them an enormous round of applause. [Applause.]

But I think it is also appropriate  that  we  express  our  appreciation  to
members of other parties who have indicated that they are leaving.  It's  in
the spirit of what we do  here.  Ken  Andrew  has  worked  with  me  in  the
committee on Trade and Industry and later in the committee on Finance. I  am
sorry that your speech was  interrupted  because  we  don't  interrupt  swan
songs or maiden speeches. I want to  say:  Thank  you  very  much  for  your
contribution. I am glad that you  are  stepping  out  in  African  style  on
design day today. [Applause.] To Colin Eglin and  to  Moorcroft:  Thank  you
very much, stalwarts in the House. You  particularly,  hon  Eglin,  I  think
have earned the title `hon' over and over again. Thank  you  very  much  for
your contribution to democracy. [Applause.] And then,  to  the  incorrigible
but wonderfully charming at the podium Nigel Bruce, the best speaker of  the
afternoon: We wish you well, as well, Nigel. [Applause.]

Who else did I ... [Interjections.] Oh!  I  didn't  know  that  the  hon  Dr
Odendaal is leaving but thank you also. We have seen you and  we  have  felt
your presence in the committee on Finance. [Applause.] I want  to  wish  you
pleasant cycling on that wonderful bicycle of yours, Dr Odendaal.

Deputy Speaker and hon members, it is also  the  conclusion  of  a  term  of
office. I keep saying I don't know what's  going  to  happen.  Maybe  Cassie
Aucamp will come back as the President.  [Laughter.]  We  know  Patricia  de
Lille is too busy trying to become the President to be in  the  House  here.
But, I want to express my sincere appreciation certainly to the  members  of
the Portfolio Committee on Finance who have  worked  very  closely  with  us
over the past decade. Thank you very much. You have kept us on our toes  and
you make it so much more of a pleasure to serve South  Africans.  Thanks  so
much. [Applause.]

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Rulings)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I've just been reminded that I actually  wish  to
first make some rulings, before moving on to the next piece of business.

I wish to give a ruling on a point of order raised by the hon Nhleko  on  10
February 2004 about remarks made by Ms T E Millin in her speech  during  the
debate on the President's state of  the  nation  address.  Mr  Nhleko  asked
whether the expressions Ms Millin used were  appropriate  language  for  the
House, and I undertook to examine the Hansard.

Having had an opportunity to study the unrevised Hansard, I wish to rule  as
follows: The expressions used by Ms Millin are not strictly  unparliamentary
in that they do not reflect on the integrity of another  member.  Therefore,
I will not request her to withdraw the  offending  phrases.  However,  I  do
want to appeal to  members,  as  public  representatives,  to  refrain  from
resorting to coarse or vulgar language that detracts from  the  dignity  and
decorum of the House.

The Chief Whips have recently been discussing the issue of  decorum  in  the
House, and have agreed that they will be more vigilant about  such  matters.
One trusts that the Whips of the next Parliament will  be  equally  vigilant
and that they will have the co-operation of all  members,  especially  those
who come back after the elections, in maintaining the esteem in  which  this
House and the next Parliament would always seek to be held.

Hon members, I also wish to give a ruling on a matter  that  arose  the  day
before yesterday. During questions in the House on  Wednesday  25  February,
the hon Mr Andrew raised a point of order concerning the hon Mr  De  Lange's
remark that the hon Mrs Kalyan had deliberately misled the House.

I undertook, before giving a ruling, to study  Hansard  both  in  regard  to
what Mrs Kalyan had said earlier, and in regard  to  the  remark  by  Mr  De
Lange. I have had the opportunity to study the Hansard and wish to  give  my
ruling.

I'd like to deal first with the remarks made by Mrs Kalyan. As I  understand
it, Mrs Kalyan's remark that the  Minister  of  Health  was  misleading  the
House arose from the Minister's reference to Mr Waters.  The  Minister  said
that the question Mr Waters put to her,  in  the  House,  should  have  been
asked in the meeting of the portfolio committee, but  that  nobody  did  so.
Mrs Kalyan then corrected the Minister by saying  that  she  had  personally
asked the question in the meeting of the portfolio committee, but  that  the
Minister was not there at the time.

In response to a point  of  order  raised  by  Mr  De  Lange,  that  it  was
unparliamentary for Mrs Kalyan to say that the Minister was  misleading  the
House, I ruled that it is  only  unparliamentary  when  one  member  accuses
another of deliberately misleading the House.

I will now deal with the remark made by Mr De Lange.  Mr  De  Lange  clearly
said that Mrs Kalyan had deliberately misled the House. In  compliance  with
my ruling that it is unparliamentary to  accuse  a  member  of  deliberately
misleading the House, the hon Mr De Lange should,  therefore,  withdraw  the
remark. [Interjections.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. In respect to your  ruling  and
in deference to the outgoing Mr Ken  Andrew,  I  withdraw,  unconditionally,
the word ``deliberate''. I , of course, however, do not  withdraw  the  word
``misleading'',  as  the  member  accused  ...  [Interjections.]  I  do  not
withdraw the word ``misleading''.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon De  Lange,  I  do  not  wish  you  to  put  a
condition on what you are withdrawing, because I asked you to just  withdraw
the remark. First, you say you are  unconditionally  withdrawing,  then  you
say you are not withdrawing a part of it.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker,  I  said  I'm  unconditionally  withdrawing
``deliberate'', but not the other word. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  De  Lange,  I  really  wish  for  your  co-
operation. I just want you to withdraw, please.

Adv J H DE LANGE: I unconditionally withdraw, Madam Speaker. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, we will now go  back  to  the  first
Order of the Day.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

  (Decision of Question Adoption of Report of Portfolio Committee thereon)

Question as moved by the Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  put:  That  the
Report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

                               FAREWELL SPEECH

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, I now wish to take this  opportunity  while
I'm still in the Chair, because I'm about  to  vacate  it,  to  say  my  own
farewell. I wish to take the opportunity to thank South Africa for  allowing
me to grow from this Chair. I've learned a lot  from  being  in  the  office
that I've been occupying and, of course, it is in  the  nature  of  politics
that none of us know what's going to happen after the elections.

Therefore, I should like to take this opportunity  to  say  thank  you  very
much for your co-operation, for the  lessons  we've  all  learned  together,
both from positive and difficult situations, from which I'm quite  sure  all
of us, individually and collectively, developed.

I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to speak  to  the  members
who have said farewell, in particular members who are definitely not  coming
back. I will not go through the names, but I want  to  single  out  the  hon
Colin Eglin, with whom I  personally  have  had  the  opportunity  to  work,
especially during the Constitution-making days.

Hon Eglin, thank you very much, for being a very good colleague and  a  very
good South African, I must say. [Applause.] I remember  the  experiences  we
have had, including a bus breaking down in the middle of the  night  on  our
way from New Delhi to Jaipur in India. [Interjections.]
An HON MEMBER: How many were you?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: There were about 10 of us. [Laughter.] I hope that,  hon
Eglin, when you get home you will sit down and write, because I  think  that
the history of the  process  of  coming  up  with  a  new  Constitution,  in
particular,  is  one  from  which  all  of  us,  and   in   particular   our
greatgrandchildren and our grandchildren, can learn a lot; just the  process
itself - the interactions, the challenges and how we were  all  called  upon
to put aside our personal preferences, our  political  preferences  and  put
South Africa first. It was a very rewarding experience. [Applause.]

I also must, of course, in particular, thank our veterans,  those  who  have
given many years of their lives to bring South Africa to where it is  today.
Thank you, very much. Go and have a very well-deserved  good  life,  because
you still have a long life from here. [Applause.]

I will also thank my comrade, Valli Moosa. I'll never forget  arriving  from
abroad and checking my messages, and there  was  Cyril  Ramaphosa's  message
saying, ``Only our friend could do it'', and I wondered what was  happening.
It was only later, when I got to the airport  that  I  read  the  newspapers
about Valli being naked somewhere in some part of the  country.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.] I hope that he will enjoy whatever he's now  going  to  do,  and
remain as energetic as ever.

I would now like to go back to the Order Paper,  and  the  Speaker  will  be
taking over the Chair. [Interjections.] [Applause.]  No,  not  yet.  I  just
wanted to say my own farewells. The Speaker  will  be  coming  to  take  the
Chair shortly. In the meantime, let us go back to the Order Paper.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS - ICASA
                                  VACANCIES

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  There  is  no  list  of  speakers,  so  are  there  any
objections  to  the  recommendations   of   the   Portfolio   Committee   on
Communications? [Interjections.]

Question put: That Dr  T  Cohen,  Adv  Z  R  Masiza  and  Mr  P  Mashile  be
recommended for appointment as councillors to Icasa.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the DA does have  objections  and  calls
for an opportunity to make a declaration.

 Mrs S A SEATON: Deputy Speaker, the IFP also  objects  and  we  would  also
like to make a declaration.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will give you time for declarations in a minute.

Mr J DURAND: The New NP does not  object,  but  we  would  like  to  make  a
declaration, Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Before calling for declarations, I would like  to  first
put the question and ask that all those in favour  say  ``aye'',  and  those
against ``no''. [Interjections.] I think the ayes have it. I would  like  to
allow parties an opportunity to make their declarations.

Declarations of vote:

Ms M SMUTS: Deputy Speaker, Icasa is not just any  old  sectoral  regulator.
It is a constitutional Chapter 9  institution,  because  the  governance  of
broadcasting had to be put beyond  the  reach  of  Government  in  order  to
protect free speech.

Now, since the time  that  the  Constitution  was  finalised,  technological
convergence has brought broadcasting and telecommunications,  including  the
information technologies like the Internet, under one  regulatory  umbrella.
The filling  of  vacancies  such  as  the  three  now  occurring  under  the
statutory rotational appointment system is therefore of unusual  importance.
The four sitting councillors who remain are  Chairman  Mandla  Langa,  Lumko
Mtimde, Nadia Bulbulia and Mamodupi Mohlala.

One of the three new nominees was a universal choice. We  were  all  willing
to compromise with the ANC on the second choice, even though we are  worried
by his  view  that  the  licensing  authority  can  actively  seek  out  and
encourage applicants for community broadcast licences. This is a recipe  for
the political patronage which many people suspect is already occurring.

We were willing, however, to compromise, even though  it  meant  losing  the
chief economist at the Competition Commission and though  the  Act  requires
economics as  a  skill.  The  Competition  Commission  has,  in  fact,  just
recommended that  Telkom  be  fined  10%  of  turnover  for  anticompetitive
behaviour towards the Internet companies, which  Icasa  itself  has  so  far
failed to control.
Now I  have  said  that  we  were  willing  to  compromise  on  that  second
candidate,  but  the  ANC,  regrettably,  no  longer  seeks   consensus   or
compromise. In the end, the issue  between  us  is  the  sitting  councillor
Gerhard Petrick whom the ANC flatly  refused  to  consider  or  to  discuss.
Gerhard Petrick has the confidence  and  the  multiple  nominations  of  the
industries; he has the confidence of Icasa itself at which he has  acted  as
chair; he has the confidence of all of the parties except the ANC.

The ANC no longer gives reasons for its choices. It no longer seems to  care
even about appearances. One is left to speculate about what it  is  that  it
does care about, possibly control. It is  in  these  circumstances  that  we
very greatly regret that we cannot support the full slate. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Thank you,  Madam  Speaker.  The  IFP  cannot  be  a  complacent
participant  in  the  further  disempowerment  of  Icasa.  We  have  to  ask
ourselves why not one significant foreign company  was  prepared  to  invest
the kind of money that this country needed to build  infrastructure  in  the
second national operator as competition for Telkom.

Why are those shares now parked? A few British pennies  emerged,  belatedly,
in one of the rejected bids  -  absolutely  nothing  else.  And  if  we  are
honest, we know why. Two leaders of two European  telecommunications  giants
personally informed me  that  they  wouldn't  touch  our  telecommunications
market with a bargepole. Why? Because they said our  regulator,  Icasa,  was
seen as weak, that it lacked capacity and, critically, that our  councillors
were not seen to be sufficiently independent  of  Government,  that  is  ANC
control.

Icasa and the SABC Board have to stop being seen  as  repositories  of  jobs
for comrades, irrespective of their capacity to add real value. This is  not
to deny the outstanding work that  has  been  done  and  is  being  done  by
certain hugely talented and committed councillors  and  board  members  over
the years.

However, the Icasa council, as currently being  rammed  through  Parliament,
does not now possess the  range  of  skills  and  experience  that  the  law
requires, and the IFP will  vote  against  these  appointments.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mev A VAN WYK: Mev die Speaker, die Nuwe NP dra graag gelukwense oor aan  dr
Tracy Cohen, 'n pasaangewese nuwe lid van Okosa. Sy is een van drie wat  aan
die einde van Junie hul plekke sal inneem. Sy is uitnemend gekwalifiseer  om
dié werk te doen.

Soos in die geval van die aanstelling van die SAUK-raad, is die  aanstelling
van die Onafhanklike Uitsaai-owerheid van Suid-Afrika ongelukkig  ook  reeds
gebrandmerk as 'n verspeelde  geleentheid.  In  hierdie  land  is  daar  die
wonderlikste talent, vermoëns en  gewilligheid,  maar  as  ons  kyk  na  die
aanstellings van owerheidsweë word dit nie voldoende weerspieël nie, en  dit
is waarom die beste planne, bedoelings en liggame  op  elke  vlak  struikel.
Die ontsluiting  van  die  positiewe  kragte  van  die  enorme  onderbenutte
mensehulpbronne berus by die aanstelling van die regte  drywers,  die  regte
leiers.

Okosa  sukkel,  maar  van  die  beste  leierstalent  is  reeds  al  in   die
kortlysstadium oor die hoof gesien. Dit  lyk  asof  die  portefeuljekomitee,
wat hom vantevore onderskei het vir sy objektiwiteit en moed, nou in  trurat
gegaan het. Die SAUK-raad het dié vermoede laat ontstaan; die  vul  van  die
vakatures  op  Okosa  bewys  dit.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK:  Madam  Speaker,  the  New  NP  would  like  to  convey  its
congratulations to Dr Tracy Cohen, a newly appointed member  of  Icasa.  She
is one of the three members who will take up their positions at the  end  of
June. She is extremely well qualified to do this job.

As in the case of the appointment of the SABC Board, the appointment of  the
Independent  Broadcasting  Authority  of  South  Africa  has   unfortunately
already been branded as a wasted opportunity. In this country there  is  the
most wonderful talent, capacities and willingness, but when we look  at  the
appointments by the authorities, this is not adequately reflected, and  this
is why the best  plans,  intentions  and  bodies  stumble  at  every  level.
Unlocking  the  positive  powers  of  the  enormously  underutilised   human
resources depends on  the  appointment  of  the  right  drivers,  the  right
leaders.

Icasa is struggling, but some of the  most  talented  leaders  were  already
overlooked  at  the  shortlisting  stage.  It  seems  as  if  the  portfolio
committee, which distinguished itself in the past for  its  objectivity  and
courage, has gone  into  reverse  gear  now.  The  SABC  Board  caused  this
presumption to arise; the filling of the vacancies in Icasa has proved it.]

In section 3(b)(1) of the Icasa Act it is clearly stated  that  when  viewed
collectively persons  appointed  ``are  representative  of  a  broad  cross-
section of the Republic''. The authority, as newly composed, will  not  meet
this requirement.

Section 3(b)(2) requires that the persons possess  suitable  qualifications,
expertise  and  experience  of,  among  other   things,   broadcasting   and
telecommunications policy, engineering technology, etc.

The one engineer, as we've heard, councillor Gerhard Petrick, who  has  been
in this position for a scant year and has  been  doing  sterling  work,  has
been inexplicably dropped.  Such  unreasonable  and  harsh  treatment  of  a
person who left an excellent career to join Icasa  reflects  poorly  on  the
portfolio committee. Moreover, in this respect as  well,  the  council  will
not fulfil the legal provisions of the Act.

The  New  NP  regrettably  does  not  support   the   list   of   vacancies.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M K LEKGORO: Madam  Speaker,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  committee  has
complied with the requirements of section 5 of the Icasa Act,  which  guides
the constitution and appointment of councillors  to  Icasa.  We  would  also
like to assure all those who were interviewed that not having selected  them
is not a vote of no confidence in them at all. It is a simple  reality  that
there were only three vacancies to fill.

I hope that the complaint of the opposition parties is not that  each  party
could at least  have  got  their  preferred  candidates  onto  the  council,
because whatever dissatisfaction they have cannot be on the grounds that  we
have selected people without the necessary knowledge for the type of work.

When you short-list people for an interview, you are by your  own  admission
saying that they are candidates who, in their varying  ways,  could  qualify
for the job. It is not surprising that on  a  panel  there  will  always  be
differences of opinions as to who is more outstanding among the  candidates,
more so when among your  interviewees  you  have  sitting  members  of  that
council. Naturally, a dispute  would  arise  as  to  the  retention  or  the
substitution of such members.  That  is  why  on  matters  of  this  nature,
whether in public or private, those who take such a decision do  so  on  the
basis of popular feeling.

We could not be different. We had different preferences based  on  different
perceptions of what the job at this point in time required.  All  the  names
that were put  forward  from  different  committee  members  were  names  of
respected people in the different fields of expertise. At  the  end  of  the
day, the popular view prevailed. It is against this background that  we  ask
the National Assembly to ratify the names of these men and women who are  of
undoubted expertise in  the  communications  industry.  They  are  Adv  Z  R
Masiza, Mr P Mashile and Dr T Cohen. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I rise on  a  point  of  confusion.  Could  we
please perhaps give the New NP an opportunity  to  clarify  their  position,
because it is unclear to me what their position is going to be?

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I said very  clearly  that  we  would  not  vote
against this, but that we wanted to make a declaration. That's all.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, let me also assist in clarification and  in
taking the process further. The Deputy Speaker  has  already  declared  that
the ayes had it. We've given an opportunity for members to  make  statements
in declaration of their vote or of their intentions. Do any parties wish  to
record their objections? If so, please just indicate.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, but that doesn't mean to say that you will  not
be putting the vote as well. We do want to record our objection. Thank you.

The SPEAKER: I will be putting the vote. I will now ask those in  favour  to
say ``aye'', and those against to say ``no''. Those against please  say  no.
I think the ayes have it.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, is this not a Chapter 9 body where  we  have
to vote anyway?

The SPEAKER: We do not need to record the vote.

Question agreed to (Democratic  Alliance,  Inkatha  Freedom  Party,  African
Christian  Democratic  Party,  National  Action  and   Independent   African
Movement dissenting).

Dr T Cohen, Adv Z R Masiza and Mr  P  Mashile  accordingly  recommended  for
appointment as Icasa councillors.

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, this is a very  special  day  for  most  hon
members. The general election will  be  held  soon  and  I  understand  that
something like a third of the members will not be returning. I refer to  MPs
retiring voluntarily and involuntarily.

Some, like my colleagues Nick  Koornhof  and  Frik  van  Deventer  and  many
others, leave after decades of service  to  their  parties  and  some  after
decades of service in Parliament. We wish them all  well  and  thank  people
from all parties for their service to our country and to our people.

Some, like my close colleagues Ken Andrew, Colin Eglin and  E  K  Moorcroft,
have never had the privilege of serving in government. They have  served  in
opposition throughout their political lives, but they retire having  made  a
significant contribution to the fight for human rights, democracy, the  rule
of law and good governance in our country. [Applause.]

This second Parliament has been a very interesting one. People often ask  me
what it is like being in the National Assembly. I  tell  them  that  I  like
Parliament. I feel  very  comfortable  with  colleagues  from  every  party,
language, colour, religious  background  and  area  in  South  Africa.  This
Parliament is a true  reflection  of  our  country  and  it  is  a  precious
democratic possession which we must treasure.

I like parliamentary debates  and  I  enjoy  nothing  more  than  trying  to
communicate with the people of  South  Africa  while  honourable  colleagues
opposite scream and shout. I find that I can shout  even  louder  than  they
can and it is certainly one of the highlights of my time in Parliament.

The SPEAKER: Order! I have noted that, hon Gibson.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Yes, Madam Speaker. This Parliament has worked better  than
the first Parliament. The reason for this  is  obvious.  Many  more  members
have now had experience of being public  representatives  and  of  being  in
Parliament and how to run an institution such as this. For this  reason,  it
has not been nearly as frustrating being an MP during the last  year  as  it
was before 1999. It is still by no means perfect.

Some of the delays and the failure to support members  are  things  which  I
regret. I know that these are also regretted by the presiding  officers  and
some of the officials. I hope that we are going to  recognise  that  in  the
third Parliament there is great room for improvement. We  need  far  greater
efficiency and speed in  decision-making  and  efficiency  in  carrying  out
those decisions.

Members can do with considerably more backing and support to enable them  to
live up to their full potential and to  serve  the  public  of  our  country
better.  I  am  still  not  happy  with  the  whole  arrangement  concerning
constituency offices. The amount which Parliament pays  is  insufficient  to
enable every member to have an independent office to serve the  constituency
allocated to her or him by the party.

The amount needs to be increased so as to avoid having several  MPs  grouped
together and sharing one office, thus creating an area of  service  that  is
so large that one becomes remote from the  public.  Members  of  the  public
then do not have proper access to help when they  need  it.  This  does  not
apply to me. I am very fortunate, but it certainly  applies  to  many  other
members of this House.

Concerning presiding officers and all of the officials  at  every  level,  I
want to thank them for their unfailing courtesy  and  consideration  to  me.
They always treat me well and I really do appreciate this. I would  like  to
thank the Whips of the ANC and all other  parties  for  their  friendly  co-
operation. I wish to thank my deputy, the hon Mike Ellis, and all  DA  Whips
for their loyal support. I am very grateful to my party for having  honoured
me by appointing me as Chief Whip for the whole of this last  term.  It  has
always been a challenge.

Finally, I would like to thank the voters for having given me this  term  in
Parliament. It is a privilege and an honour to be a member of Parliament  in
South Africa. We must never forget this. It is  something  which  I  cherish
and I will never take this for granted. May I wish all of you  Godspeed  and
good fortune. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. [God bless Africa.] [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, as many speakers during  today's  debate  and
throughout the past week have said,  we  have  come  a  long  way  in  South
Africa, as a nation, over the past ten years. We are now at the end  of  the
first decade, and we have got to a stage where we are just  at  the  end  of
the second term of office.

Millions of lives have been  transformed,  and  we  have  new  hope  in  the
country, and we are generally a nation proudly South African. We  have  made
a start, but we still have a long way to go. We still have  to  create  jobs
to eradicate the major unemployment problem that we have in this country.

We still have to uplift  many  rural  communities,  and  provide  many  more
functional schools. We still have  to  effectively  and  efficiently  combat
crime. There are many issues still to be addressed,  and  the  onerous  task
lies with the next Parliament.

As a Parliament we have seen transformation:  major  changes  in  procedure;
strengthening the committee system; the formation of the Chief Whips  Forum;
the introduction of a new financial system;  improved  budgetary  processes;
and one could go on. While one can proudly say we've come  a  long  way,  we
must acknowledge that we still have a long way to go.

We still have to make substantial changes to our  rules  of  Parliament,  to
the code of conduct  for  members  of  Parliament,  to  the  functioning  of
committees, and to the composition of committees. We still have  to  improve
the parliamentary budgeting process, the attendance of  meetings,  providing
adequate  resources  and  facilities  for   members   to   undertake   their
parliamentary obligations sufficiently and effectively, and the list can  go
on.

But today we should not dwell on what still needs to be done,  that  is  for
the next Parliament. We need to acknowledge  the  many  successes  over  the
past ten years, and in particular over the past five years,  and  those  who
have made a contribution to the success that has brought  us  where  we  are
today. And I too would like to add my congratulations  and  good  wishes  to
people like Colin Eglin, and  Billy  Nair,  and  many  others  who  will  be
leaving us voluntarily. Good luck, God will bless you all.

 To the Presiding Officers - Madam  Speaker,  I  congratulate  you  and  the
Deputy Speaker, on the way you have  conducted  yourselves  in  this  House.
You've been unbiased and you have certainly  helped  things  to  improve  in
this Chamber over the years. To the Chief Whips of the ANC and other  Whips,
thank you for your co-operation to myself and to my  party  throughout  this
time. To all the officers of Parliament, the  Secretary,  the  Secretary  of
the National Assembly, as well as all other officers, and service  officers,
and all staff, we thank you most sincerely  for  all  you've  done  for  our
party, for myself, and for Parliament and this nation as a whole.

We've made many friends over the past years and, as Mr  Douglas  Gibson  has
just said, we have  made  friends  across  party  politics.  Members  become
friends notwithstanding their party-political differences.  There  has  been
tremendous co-operation amongst the members,  generally,  and  for  this  we
thank you all.

To those of you who are to be redeployed, or are retiring, may we  wish  you
every success, happiness and peace. To those of you hoping to  return,  good
luck. The IFP will be back here in large numbers. Good luck to the  rest  of
you. To you all ``hamba kahle'', go well, God bless. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: In this final session, it is my pleasure to say a few words  of
thanks on behalf of the New NP, and to convey our best wishes to all.

Die  afgelope  vyf  jaar  was  besondere  betekenisvolle  jare  waarin   die
Parlement steeds verder sy eie  karakter  ontwikkel  het.  Dit  was  'n  tyd
waarin daar weer eens oomblikke van plegtigheid en ook  oomblikke  van  erns
was, maar ook tye van skerp debat en gesonde humor was aan die orde van  die
dag. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The  past  five  years  were  particularly  significant  years   in   which
Parliament continued to develop its own character further.  It  was  a  time
during which there were once again moments of ceremony and also  moments  of
seriousness, but also times of keen debate, and healthy  moments  of  humour
were the order of the day.]

The fact that the parliamentary processes as a whole ran like  a  well-oiled
machine was, however, not only because of the members, but also  because  of
the hard work of a diverse  group  of  people.  And  therefore  we  want  to
express our thanks and appreciation.

Namens my party wil ek graag aan ander lede  dank  betuig  met  wie  ons  in
debat kon getree het - soms vriendelik en  soms  krities  -  maar  waar  die
debatte soms hewig was, het ons  dit  egter  almal  met  een  doel  voor  oë
gedoen,  en  dit  is  omdat  elkeen  van  ons  wou  hê  dat  Suid-Afrika  'n
suksesvolle land moet wees. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[On behalf of my party I would like to thank  other  members  with  whom  we
could enter into debate - sometimes friendly and sometimes  critical  -  but
whereas the debates were sometimes hectic, all of us, however,  participated
with one purpose in mind, and that  was  because  all  of  us  wanted  South
Africa to be a successful country.]

It is my pleasure to thank you,  Madam  Speaker,  the  Deputy  Speaker,  the
Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of  Committees,  for  the  manner  in
which you managed the Chair, sometimes under very difficult circumstances  -
especially during the past year with the number of parties  increasing  from
13 to 17, which complicated matters even more.

Our thanks to the Chief Whip and Deputy Chief Whip  of  the  majority  party
for the co-operation we enjoyed in specific forums. I  would  also  like  to
thank the Whips of all the other parties for the co-operation  that  existed
between us.

To the Secretary of Parliament, Secretary of the  National  Assembly,  table
personnel, service personnel, caterers - especially oom Sam  and  Barnie  at
the two bars [Laughter.] - the security personnel ...

... aan die media wat 'n belangrike rol speel om die Parlement se  werk  aan
die gemeenskap daar buite bekend te stel, wil ons graag ons dank  betuig  en
waardering.  Baie  van  die  lede  wat  hierdie  Parlement  verlaat  het  'n
besondere rol gespeel in die geskiedenis van hierdie land  en  in  die  skep
van hierdie demokrasie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... to the media who play an important role  in  introducing  the  work  of
Parliament to the community outside, we would like  to  express  our  thanks
and appreciation. Many of the members who are leaving this  Parliament  have
played a special role in the history of this country and in the creation  of
this democracy.]

I am sure a lot of what we have experienced over the  past  ten  years,  has
been made possible because of your character, your  stature,  and  the  fact
that you have put South Africa first. To the Minister who  is  leaving  -  I
spoke to him a few evenings ago in one of the bars - it is a great  loss  to
South Africa and to our Cabinet. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Speaker, dit is half nostalgies om te staan by  die  einde  van
hierdie tweede Parlement van ons Republiek. Ek voeg my graag  by  die  mense
wat dankbetuigings uitgespreek het aan almal wat hierdie trein op  sy  spoor
hou. Dis somtyds moeilik, somtyds loop die  wiele  langs  die  wa,  maar  in
hierdie chaos is daar tog metodiek. En ons sê vir  die  mense  wat  vir  ons
ondersteun en wat hierdie proses aan die gang hou, 'n warm en  baie  opregte
dankie.

Tweedens, sê ons graag totsiens. Ons sê totsiens  aan  kollegas,  ons  groet
hulle met die hoop dat ons na 14 April die  geleentheid  kan  hê  om  mekaar
weer te groet. Ons wil glo dat die kundigheid wat  hier  opgebou  is  in  'n
groot mate gaan terugkom, sodat die parlementêre proses  na  die  verkiesing
vinnig oppad kan kom, en dat daar nie onnodige ontwrigting sal wees nie.

En dan derdens sê ons vaarwel. Ons sê vaarwel aan 'n klomp pioniers wat  oor
'n periode, nie net in die laaste tien jaar nie  maar  langer,  aan  hierdie
ontwikkeling gewerk het en wat hierdie land  gedien  het.  Daar  is  opregte
waardering vir hulle, en ons wens hulle 'n rustige aftrede toe.

En dan sê ons totsiens aan  vriende,  vriende  oor  politieke  grense  heen,
vriendskappe wat lopgebou  is  buite  hierdie  Huis,  op  toere,  met  ander
interaksies, vriendskappe wat gaan hou vir die res van ons lewens.  Ons  glo
dat dié vriendskappe sal  sterk  staan,  en  daar  is  besondere  waardering
daarvoor. Ek dink self aan die keer toe ek en Duma Nkosi op  'n  besoek  aan
Noord-Transvaal in  ons  adamspakke  getoyi-toyi  het,  en  dit  is  werklik
vriendskap bou. Ons leer mekaar verstaan, en ons  leer  mekaar  vertrou,  en
ons kan 'n pad vorentoe loop. Baie sterkte aan almal vir die verkiesing,  en
mag dit met ons almal baie, baie goed gaan. Dankie. [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Speaker, it is quite nostalgic to be at the end of this  second
Parliament of our Republic. I  would  like  to  associate  myself  with  the
people who have expressed their thanks to everyone who keeps this  train  on
track. Sometimes it is difficult, sometimes the coach derails, but there  is
nevertheless still method in this chaos.  And  we  extend  our  sincere  and
heart-felt thanks to the people who support us and  who  keep  this  process
going.

Secondly, we would like to say good-bye. We say good-bye to  colleagues,  we
greet them in  the  hope  that,  after  14  April,  we  will  be  given  the
opportunity to greet  one  another  again.  We  want  to  believe  that  the
expertise that has been developed here will return to  a  great  extent,  so
that the parliamentary process  will  be  up  and  running  soon  after  the
election, and that there will be no unnecessary disruption.

And then thirdly we say farewell. We say farewell to  a  group  of  pioneers
who, over a period of time, not only in the past ten years but before  that,
worked on this development and  served  this  country.  We  appreciate  them
sincerely and wish them a peaceful retirement.

And then we say goodbye to friends, friends  across  the  political  divide,
friendships  built  up  outside  this  House,  during  tours,  during  other
interactions, friendships that will last for  the  rest  of  our  lives.  We
believe that these friendships will stand the test of  time,  and  there  is
special appreciation for that. I myself  remember  the  occasion  when  Duma
Nkosi and I toyi-toyied  in  our  birthday  suits  during  a  visit  to  the
Northern Transvaal, and that is how true friendships are  formed.  We  learn
to understand one another, we learn to trust one another, and  we  can  face
the future together. All the best to everyone in the election,  and  may  we
all do extremely well. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  the  second  democratic
Parliament of South Africa is winding down its business.  Despite  our  many
differences and  disagreements  we  can  all  look  back  with  a  sense  of
gratitude and wonder,  recognising  a  miracle  of  a  truly  representative
assembly of the people of South Africa, debating and working on  building  a
new society after the long night of apartheid.

Looking back on the past five years of this democratic Parliament,  each  of
us should do some introspection and ask this question: Have I remained  true
to the oath of office that I took?  Whilst  recognising  the  miracle  of  a
representative and democratic Parliament, when we  can  all  still  remember
the oppression of our recent past, we should not lose sight of  the  massive
task that lies ahead.

For those who will return to the next Parliament, this  continuing  task  of
building a more just and equitable society must  remain  foremost  in  their
minds. To those who will not  return  we  extend  our  gratitude  for  their
contribution in whatever fashion to the debates and consultations  that  are
the bedrock of multiparty democracy.

In the past five years we have often  disagreed  with  each  other  in  this
House but yet, even in our differences, we have confirmed our commitment  to
meeting and debating  here  in  this  assembly  of  the  people  instead  of
expressing our differences in other undemocratic ways.

We have conflicting ideas and personalities but  we  should  all  thank  God
that we no longer resort to  armed  conflict.  I  would  like  to  extend  a
special word of thanks to the office bearers, the committee chairs, as  well
as the  parliamentary  and  political  staff.  We  are  grateful  for  their
contribution in keeping the wheels of this institution turning.

Abahambayo, bahambe kakuhle, kanti abasalayo, basale  kakuhle.  Enkosi.  [We
wish those who are leaving well and we wish those  who  will  be  remaining,
good luck. Thank you.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity  to  say  a  few
words on behalf of the FF at the end of this short session, but  quite  long
term. I think reality will soon reflect the  basic  truth  that  nature  has
four principle ways of thinning  out  the  herd,  namely,  drought,  famine,
floods and elections.

Madam Speaker, I would also like to convey my heartful thanks  to  you,  the
Deputy Speaker, the Chairperson and Deputy  Chairperson  of  Committees  for
the very competent manner in which you have led the House during this  term,
sometimes under very difficult circumstances.

I also want to express our sincere gratitude to the Secretary,  each  member
of staff of Parliament, the  Table  staff,  Hansard  staff  and  the  entire
administration of Parliament, service officers,  the  catering  section,  as
well as the police service which takes care of our safety. To  each  one  of
them we would like to express our heartfelt thanks  for  the  selfless  work
that they do, which we sometimes just take for granted.

I also want to address a word of thanks to the press who  report  everything
that happens in this House. To all  the  Whips  from  various  parties,  the
Chief Whip from the governing side as well as from the opposition,  as  well
as all the other Whips, a word of sincere thanks, and also to each an  every
member of this House.

Today is a very important day, being the 27th of February. On this  day,  in
1881, the Afrikaner Boer forces defeated the then world power,  the  America
of the 19th century,  the  British.  So,  we  intend  to  do  the  same  but
unfortunately I have to  warn  you,  Mr  Deputy  President,  that  you  have
approximately six weeks to govern. When we come back after the elections  we
will then be happy to take charge.

I would like to end by not saying goodbye on behalf of the FF  because  that
could send a wrong message. I would like to use the Afrikaans  words,  ``tot
wedersiens'' which means, until we see one another again. We  intend  to  be
back after 14 April to play the role that we are playing. We  will  be  back
in larger numbers and we would like to ask that each one of us,  during  the
campaign, plays a positive role and does our democracy proud in the  way  in
which we behave ourselves. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members,  the  Book  of  Ecclesiastes
states that there is time to come and a time to go, a time  to  meet  and  a
time to part and that moment has dawned  for  us.  From  this  afternoon  we
shall be partying and going our ways as parties and individuals.

There are those who leave Parliament in  honour  after  serving  for  years.
Amongst them we note stalwarts such  as  the  hon  Nair,  Reggie  September,
Colin Eglin, the doyen of South African politics, and others. We  wish  them
all the best in their well-deserved retirement.

We accept that the battlelines are drawn and  we  shall  be  traversing  the
length and breadth of this country in a quest for votes after which some  in
this House will be casualties, who may not be able to grace the  portals  of
this institution again, perhaps ever. Those who will survive the  onslaught,
inter alia, the UCDP, will come back full of life and with more  members  at
the expense of others.

We pray a lot for the strength of the indefatigable Madam  Speaker  and  the
Deputy Speaker. They showed lots of commitment to the task at  hand  and  we
hope that the baby they are nurturing with great passion, the AU, will  grow
from strength to strength to find a permanent home in Umzans'Afrika.

We thank  the  chairpersons  of  committees  and  our  colleagues  in  those
committees for appreciating that some parties have been hamstrung  by  their
lack of numbers. We could not make it without the assistance of the  affable
service officers in the sometimes forgotten Marks Building and even  in  the
Chamber. They have done us proud.

The Secretary to Parliament and the  entire  administration  have  at  times
appeared to be hard on members but have never  hesitated  to  show  maturity
and revise their earlier thinking where it mattered. My  colleagues  in  the
Whips' Forum under  the  chairmanship  of  the  gentle  giant,  hon  Nhleko,
deserve a big round of applause for keeping the  proceedings  of  the  House
intact. Otherwise, the altercations we have seen in this  House  are  merely
comparable to a Sunday school picnic.

To all of us in this House, I say fare thee well wherever  and  whenever  we
meet, let us do so in peace and not in pieces.  Let  us  go  and  place  our
Constitution  of  South  Africa  above  all  personal  and  political  party
considerations. Let us go out there and learn to find common ground  in  our
differences and in our attempts to win the  hearts  of  our  compatriots  to
vote for us. May God be with you. [Applause.]

Mr T GODI: Madam Speaker, comrades and hon members, as the curtain falls  on
the second democratic Parliament and the first decade of our liberation,  we
cannot avoid looking back with some measure of satisfaction. The  democratic
and progressive forces have consolidated  the  political  transformation  of
our country beyond doubt. Parliament  has  been  the  focal  point  of  this
transformation. Many pieces of legislation have been  passed  in  line  with
our democratic mandate.

Who could forget the floor crossing legislation and the drama it created  in
our country? The PAC still bears the scars of this legislation.

Coming to Parliament was, indeed, a personal  experience  and  as  we  close
today I want to extend my gratitude to colleagues from across the  political
spectrum who have helped to ease my arrival in Parliament.

For the PAC, our third democratic election is still defined by our past.  It
is a contest between  the  progressive  forces  on  the  one  hand  and  the
antitransformation forces on  the  other.  These  elections  must  hand  the
democratic forces  a  decisive  victory  to  create  space  for  accelerated
transformation.

Dialectically the next decade must generate a dynamism of its own to  propel
our country forward. We are looking forward to the elections as the PAC,  we
are prepared and we are confident. We wish all  democratic  and  progressive
forces the best outcome possible. [Applause.]

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ: Mev die Speaker, die  FA  is  in  1999  verkies  tot  die
Parlement om opposisiepartye tot die besef te bring  dat  kiesers  wil  sien
dat hulle kan verenig en sodoende demokrasie in  Suid-Afrika  versterk.  Ons
missie is afgehandel. Die FA groet u. Ons  het  in  ons  doel  geslaag.  Die
fondament vir 'n sterk opposisie is gelê en ons wil die DA gelukwens met  sy
meer  as  1 000  stadsraadslede,  sy   formidabele   lys   parlementêre   en
provinsiale kandidate wat landswyd genomineer is  en  sy  besielende  leier,
mnr Tony Leon. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, the FA was elected to Parliament  in  1999
to bring opposition parties to the realisation that voters want to see  that
they can unite and thus strengthen democracy in South  Africa.  Our  mission
has been completed. The FA greets you. We have  succeeded  in  reaching  our
goal. The foundation for a strong opposition has been laid and  we  want  to
congratulate the DA on its more than 1 000 city councillors, its  formidable
list of parliamentary and provincial candidates nominated  countrywide,  and
its inspiring leader, Mr Tony Leon.]

We have succeeded in convincing supporters  of  the  opposition  parties  to
unite  behind  the  DA's  agenda  to  cut  down  the  numbers  of  the  ANC.
[Interjections.] Dr Van Niekerk and I gladly take  leave  of  Parliament  to
help build the DA. [Interjections.]

Aan die ANC sê ons: julle bly in ons visier  en  ons  gaan  julle  jag,  van
Berseba tot Dan! [Tussenwerpsels.] Aan die res  van  die  opposisie  sê  ons
sterkte! Daar's 'n stryd te stry, daar's  'n  nasie  te  lei,  daar's  werk!
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[To the ANC we say: You remain in our sights, and we are going to chase  you
from Bersheba to Dan! [Interjections.] To the  rest  of  the  opposition  we
say: Keep up your spirits! There is a battle to fight, there is a nation  to
lead, there is work to do! [Interjections.]]

To the voters of  South  Africa  we  say:  Vote  DA,  because  South  Africa
deserves better! [Interjections.]

En aan u, mev die Speaker, sê ons net tot siens. Baie dankie. [And  to  you,
Madam Speaker, we say only goodbye. Thank you very much.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is amazing how time  flies  as
we all say farewell after another term of governance. However,  we  conclude
proudly, knowing how much we have achieved and how much further away we  are
from our horrific past.

Hon President, Deputy President, hon members of the electorate,  legislature
and judiciary, all spheres of government, NGOs and all  South  Africans,  we
have worked hard to achieve this democracy for all our  people.  The  MF  is
proud to be part of this history, but we are even  more  proud,  with  eager
determination, to make every effort to uphold and strengthen our democracy.

The MF calls upon everyone to be careful,  rational  and  civil  during  our
break for the election. We should bear in mind that South Africa  is  united
in diversity. We should especially during this period  uphold  our  national
Constitution and respect individuality and diversity. The  MF  prays  for  a
peaceful, democratic and safe 2004 election all the  way.  I  wish  you  all
well upon the adjournment of the House, may  your  endeavours  be  met  with
success and may we all return for a new  term  with  the  determination  and
zeal necessary to improve South Africa.

To the  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Secretary  to  Parliament,  the
National  Assembly  Table,  the  Chair  and  Deputy  Chair   and   all   our
parliamentary staff, a very big thank you for your  kind  assistance  during
this term of office. Thank you to the MF supporters and voters, and to Mr  A
Rajbansi, leader of the MF, for giving me these five  years  in  Parliament.
Farewell to all those who are retiring. The MF wishes you well. May you  all
enjoy your retirement and your golden years.

To you, hon Minister Valli Moosa, fare thee well and  I  wish  you  well  on
your retirement and I hope we don't go back to  plastic  bags  again!  Thank
you very much. [Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker ...

An HON MEMBER: Cassie, waar's jou rugbyspan,  jong?  [Cassie,  where's  your
rugby team, man?]
Yes, the rugby team ... It didn't go so well. It was a very rough and  tough
game, but then I sent on the hon Manie Schoeman and Joe de Lange  as  impact
players, and that changed the complexion of the game! [Laughter.]

Unfortunately,  this  is  my   last   farewell   speech   in   this   House.
[Interjections.] After the elections one  of  my  whips  will  perform  this
duty. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Today is really what we can call D-day; deposits day, and for  every  party,
paying its deposit at the IEC has  a  different  meaning.  For  Patricia  de
Lille it is like playing the Lotto; you have a chance, but  it's  one  in  a
million. [Laughter.] For the DA it's like buying a Beetle for a Grand  Prix;
it will not win, but at least it makes a helluva noise. [Laughter.] For  the
UDM it's like the Jew of the town who said to the boere-omies [old  farmers]
when they were going to church on a special day of prayer for rain:  ``Julle
kan maar traai, maar die wind waai wes!'' [You can do  your  best,  but  the
wind's blowing west!] [Laughter.] For the New NP it is  like  taking  out  a
funeral policy with Avbob ... [Laughter.] ... ``Betaal nou vir  jou  gat  en
sien hom later''! [Pay for your hole now and see it later!] [Laughter.]  The
FF Plus, I understand, has a problem. They want to pay their deposit in  the
new Orania currency, but the IEC does not accept  the  rijksdaaler  anymore.
[Laughter.] They will now try the koeksister! [Laughter.]

On a more serious note, I want to thank each and  every  one  for  the  role
they have played during the past  five  years.  First  of  all,  you,  Madam
Speaker, who led not only this House,  but  also  the  whole  place  with  a
dignity and authority of your own; the  co-chairs,  whips,  colleagues  from
all parties, personnel, security staff, catering staff,  everyone,  and  the
people from the media with the impossible task of satisfying  every  one  of
us. Whoever comes back in April, it will  be  the  same  place,  but  a  new
Parliament.

Personally, I  will  always  be  grateful  for  having  been  part  of  this
Parliament  that  ends  today.  Being  part  of  it  was  a  most  enriching
experience, since the very first day when I arrived here as,  of  my  party,
the sole MP, but never a lone MP.  [Laughter.]  Amidst  all  the  rough  and
tumble of politics I witnessed a strange kind of goodwill that tells  me  we
will make it in this country. [Applause.]

I wish everyone a peaceful and troublefree election campaign. I  would  like
to say, may the best team win, but I know this will  not  happen;  not  this
time. I thank you! [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Madam Speaker, this is a time of mixed emotions for those  of
us who are approaching the end of an era, a time when one  looks  back  over
the years, particularly those spent in active politics. In  my  case  it  is
from 1994 to February last year as an IFP MPL in  KwaZulu-Natal.  This  last
year was spent as an MP and a leader  of  my  own  party,  the  IAM,  which,
judging by the many ANC members who chant its name,  they  would  very  much
like to join. Watch out, ANC! I am privileged to have  participated  in  the
NA proceedings, which has indeed been the cherry on top for  me,  surrounded
by the unsurpassed beauty of Cape Town and its surroundings, not to  mention
the magnificence of our Parliamentary precinct.

Warmest thanks must go to  all  the  presiding  officers  and  Parliamentary
support staff, who, without exception, have been so  helpful.  Also  to  hon
colleagues in the House, including the ruling party and opposition  benches,
who have not hesitated in offering assistance in so many ways. There is  one
person without whom none of my amazing ten  years  in  politics  would  have
materialised, namely the hon Dr MG Buthelezi. Even though things  might  not
have panned out quite as planned, regarding the IFP and myself,  I  want  to
sincerely thank him for the priceless  opportunity  beyond  all  measure  he
afforded me all those years ago.

In conclusion, while I personally shall be taking a back seat, the IAM  will
be participating in the forthcoming elections in the  province  of  KwaZulu-
Natal, where my 28-year old son, Mark Millin, an Economics Masters  graduate
and currently lecturing in economics at  the  University  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
will be standing as our number one candidate,  not  only  because  he  is  a
candidate of the highest calibre, but because the IAM believes  it  is  time
for our youth to become actively and constructively engaged  in  Government.
The future belongs to our youth. The youth are our  future.  Nkosi  Sikele'l
iAfrika. I thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE:  Madam  Speaker,  I  am  privileged  to  have  come  to
Parliament.  I  am  privileged  because  when  I  came  here,  I  was  again
associated with many of the comrades that were with all of  us  in  bringing
about the change that we deserve. When I came here  for  the  first  time  I
could not draw a distinction between  the  staff  members  around  here  and
myself. I got confused when I got to areas where it said  ``members  only''.
I was asking myself: What is this separation about? I  think  at  the  Chief
Whips' meeting some of you noticed when I was arguing very  vehemently  that
I did not approve of this separation. I did not understand it  and  I  still
don't. [Interjections.]

With the limited time that I spent here, I have come to  learn  that  in  my
organisation, Azapo, this is indeed another arena of struggle. When  I  came
here, we had been theorising about the different arenas of struggle  and  we
felt, well Parliament is Parliament. My stay  here  has  convinced  me  that
when I come back, it is another arena of struggle for the poor.

I want to take this opportunity to say to  the  Ministers  that  more  often
than not when I came to the podium, I did not greet you. It  is  because  of
the limitation of time. Let me take this opportunity now to  greet  all  the
Ministers that I have never greeted. [Applause.]
I am also taking this opportunity to say:  Fare  thee  well,  Comrade  Billy
Nair; Comrade Laloo - those of us who were  together  on  Robben  Island.  I
hope we will meet again, because where you are  going,  it  is  yet  another
arena of that struggle.

Let me thank my comrades in the portfolio committees that I served  in;  the
chairpersons - I enjoyed serving in those  committees.  Lastly,  I  want  to
thank the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Majority  Party  and  his  deputy  for  the
``broederskap'' that they have shown to me and I hope that we will  continue
to be associated; even if I do not come back. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, Madam  Deputy  Speaker,
hon Deputy President, hon  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers,  hon  members,
comrades, this House  is  happy  today.  The  House  is  happy  for  it  has
successfully concluded the business of its second  five-year  term.  At  the
close of our first decade of freedom it knows that  life  is  indeed  better
for all. But, before allowing myself to get carried away  by  these  smiling
walls, I must do as they say: first things first.

Somlomo,  umkhulu  kakhulu  wena  mama  wethu.  Phini  likaSomlomo,   hhayi,
besiyini  phela  thina.  Wena  wangasenhla!  [Uhleko.]  Sihlalo   wamaKomidi
nePhini lakho, siyabonga  bantu  bakithi  ngomsebenzi  wenu  omkhulu  omuhle
eniwenzile. [Hon Speaker, our mother, you are so great. Deputy Speaker,  we,
the  humble  creatures  here,  salute  you.   [Applause.]   Chairperson   of
committees and your Deputy, we thank you, good people, for  the  great  work
you have done.]

These walls are smiling not only because they are  rejoicing  at  being  the
site  of  democratic  struggles,  but  more  importantly  because  of   your
beautiful performance. These walls are smiling at  witnessing  the  majestic
dances of our Presidency ...

Bona abayibiza phansi bayishaye phezulu. Siyabonga maqhawe  esizwe.  Sibonga
umkhombandlela. Singekhohlwe-ke isifuba sempi elwa nendlala  nokuhlupheka  -
oNgqongqoshe  bethu  namaPhini  abo.  [We  thank  them  for  their  hands-on
leadership and direction. We also thank our Ministers and Deputy  Ministers,
who form the top leadership in the fight against poverty and hunger.]

And, at this particular point we should also take this opportunity  to  wish
our retiring Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mr Valli  Moosa,
well. I am told you like the story about  birds  flying  upside  down.  It's
quite an interesting one. But we wish you luck in everything  you  undertake
after the elections.

The forces of poverty and suffering know your devastating blows and that  is
why  they  are  forever  retreating.  Sinethulela  isigqoko   nina   balweli
benkululeko. [We salute you, freedom fighters.]
Regarding the advisers to the President and Deputy President - sometimes  we
refer to them as hangers-on, whatever that means because  you  can't  define
them as to where they actually stand or something, not politically though  -
we wish to thank them for excellent work done  in  terms  of  operating  the
areas that they have been assigned to.

Committee chairpersons, whom we regard as drivers in  the  engine  rooms  of
Parliament, we thank you  for  contributing  to  making  this  Parliament  a
people's Parliament. To ANC Whips, we thank you for your  comradeship,  your
collective wisdom and the discipline, dedication and hard  work  with  which
you executed your tasks. Our thanks also go to members of the  Chief  Whips'
Forum.  We  wish  to  express  our  appreciation  for   the   good   working
relationship that we enjoyed in the  forum  and  for  your  co-operation  in
ensuring  that  Parliament  functioned  smoothly,  as   mentioned   by   the
President, who belongs to my party and who spoke here before me.
To members, your dedication and sacrifices have brought tears to  many  eyes
but they have made these walls  smile  in  the  knowledge  that  slowly  but
surely from one day to  another  we  have  moved  towards  our  ideal  of  a
nonracial, nonsexist, democratic, people-centred and people-driven society.

We also pause at this stage to wish members that  are  retiring  ie  Comrade
Billy Nair,  Comrade  Laloo  Chiba,  Comrade  Valli  Moosa,  Comrade  Reggie
September, Colin Eglin and Mr Ken Andrew well.  We  remember  those  members
who started this journey five years ago but who are not here with us  today.
We say to them: Rest in the knowledge that your spears have been picked up.

Regarding the Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority  Party,  the  ANC,  I  would
just like to tell this  story.  When  we  were  assigned  to  do  this  work
together, members of the ANC caucus may remember that I actually  threatened
to poison him. I am very happy to announce that I actually never got  around
to doing it. ``So baie dankie, broer.'' [Thank you very much, brother.]

We want to conclude doing first things by extending our appreciation to  the
Secretary to Parliament  and  all  members  of  the  parliamentary  service,
cleaners, service officers, security personnel,  catering  staff,  managers,
Hansard  staff,  Table  staff,  legal  advisers,  the  media,  parliamentary
officers, staff in the Office of  the  Leader  of  Government  Business  and
other members of the Public Service, support staff of  various  parties  and
organisations of civil society - in short, all those  who  contribute  on  a
daily basis to enable Parliament to serve the people of South Africa.

We are about to hold national and provincial elections.  We  would  want  to
share this secret with other parties: a fish quietly  goes  about  laying  a
million eggs while a chicken, after laying just one  egg,  will  cackle  the
whole day. We wish you good luck for we  fully  appreciate  your  situation.
[Laughter.]

Fellow members, as we leave this Parliament, let us rededicate ourselves  to
honouring our contract with the people to create a better life for all.  May
you all have safe journeys home. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we bring to  an  end  the  second  term  of  South
Africa's democratic Parliament as this country prepares to enter its  second
decade of democracy. The evaluation of our achievement, the lessons we  have
learned and the preparations to meet new challenges will  in  the  next  few
weeks  be  submerged,  regrettably  but  inevitably,  in  the  rhetoric   of
electioneering. But no one can truthfully challenge or deny the  measure  of
our achievement as  an  institution  that  has  helped  to  consolidate  our
democracy.

We have created and put in place the legal framework which will protect  our
society and ensure the realisation of the promise of  our  first  President,
Nelson Mandela, at his inauguration. He said then,  ``Never  and  never  and
never again will it be that this beautiful land will  again  experience  the
oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk  of
the world.''

The achievement of parliaments  is  not  measured  in  the  number  of  laws
enacted. It is the intention and objective of the laws, the degree to  which
they improve society and the quality of life of South Africans that must  be
our test. The final judgment will be that of history, but I do not  hesitate
to presage this verdict.

By any measure, our achievement has  been  positive  and  considerable.  The
steps we have put  in  place  have  given  flesh  to  our  Constitution  and
resulted in the realisation of its principles, and have deepened  democracy.
I will not list the many areas where we have changed  or  transformed  South
African society.

In addition to the legislative over load, and I use that word  deliberately,
members have carried out many of the other functions  of  MPs  which  rarely
get publicised in the media. In addition to maintaining oversight  over  the
functioning of departments, committees have travelled and presented  reports
from across the country on how departments are performing.

We have still to develop the capacity to scrutinise  the  implementation  of
the programmes of departments as they are being put in place as well  as  to
bring reports of what is happening in constituencies for  the  attention  of
the House and the executive.

A task for  the  new  Parliament  is  to  improve  its  own  procedures  for
developing the budget of Parliament and engaging  with  Treasury  to  ensure
appropriation of greater and adequate resources to  help  it  to  realise  a
vision for the second decade of democracy.

This  Parliament  has  begun  to  develop  its  own  role  as  a  player  in
international relations. We can be particularly proud of the  role  we  have
played on the continent of Africa. We have  hosted  members  and  staff  and
assisted many new parliaments as they come on study tours.  We  have  helped
to bring together parliaments across the continent and played a  major  role
within SADC in developing the protocol on the  Pan-African  Parliament,  and
now as it will be constituted at  its  inaugural  session  in  three  weeks'
time. We believe we can continue to play  a  role  in  building  continental
unity, democracy and good governance in the years ahead, and  in  particular
if South Africa is selected to host the Pan-African Parliament.

In all these areas, notwithstanding our achievements, much more needs to  be
done. We can improve our procedures to allow broader  participation  of  all
members in debates and not confine knowledge and discussion  on  legislation
to members of particular committees. We can improve the quality and  content
of our debates so that we are truly the national forum for  engaging  ideas,
challenging   perspectives,   and   enhancing   and   strengthening   mutual
understanding.

One member, yesterday, referred to the need  for  fewer  speeches  and  more
debates. I would add: less heckling and more  repartee;  less  rhetoric  and
sharper wit; greater competition for the hon Aucamp in his efforts to  bring
more humour to the House; and more substance and  less  noise.  That  sounds
like a Speaker's wish list and it is, but it is only part of it.

Whatever our shortcomings and whatever the evaluations that may be  made  by
the next Parliament, we can be proud that we  bequeath  to  that  Parliament
and our citizens sound democratic foundations  and  practices.  Many  people
have contributed to this legacy.

To all staff at all levels, the Secretary, Deputy  Secretary  and  Assistant
Secretary, the Secretary and Table staff of the National  Assembly,  Chamber
personnel,  legislation  and  oversight,   legal   advisers,   library   and
information services, finance, committee section, human resources,  cleaning
and catering staff and many more, we  owe  a  great  deal  and  our  sincere
appreciation.

We also need to acknowledge the work of the trade unions in  Parliament  and
their shop stewards who help to keep  us  functioning  relatively  smoothly.
Our appreciation must go  to  the  protection  services  of  the  SA  Police
Service who have enabled us, in troubled times, to function in security  and
with complete safety.

I would ignore the media at my peril, the tensions and  differences  between
politicians  and  commercial  media  are  inevitable  and  not   necessarily
unhealthy. What I would hope for  is  more  analytical  reporting  based  on
proper research, and not on leaks and  sources,  as  well  as  more  factual
information on what Parliament does. That is a request which,  perhaps  more
appropriately, should be directed to the editors  for  more  space  than  to
members of the PGA who work hard and deserve our thanks.

To all our counterparts in the  National  Council  of  Provinces,  including
especially the presiding officers, I express our thanks. We in the  National
Assembly sometimes overlook the very vital role they play in making  this  a
national  Parliament,  and  in   ensuring   co-operative   governance   both
horizontally and vertically.

My appreciation must also go to the Chief and senior Whips and to all  Whips
who carry out their responsibilities as both shop stewards  and  supervisors
of all the members of their political parties. Thank  you  for  facilitating
the functioning of the National Assembly on a  daily  basis;  for  generally
helping to promote order and debate and only occasionally or  rarely  rising
on spurious points of order in order to make a party political point.

The Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of Committees have  gone  into  their
expanded function with ease and have contributed much thought to  developing
an improved committee system which we will pass  onto  the  new  Parliament.
The parliamentary advisers have been diligent in  maintaining  liaison  with
the President and Deputy President, and have facilitated  communication  and
understanding at all times.

The  Leader  of  Government   Business   has   not   neglected   Parliament,
notwithstanding  the  burden  of  office  as  Deputy  President.   We   have
sympathised with you, sir, as you have tried to whip Cabinet and  colleagues
into setting and abiding by priorities, and working with us  to  ensure  the
completion  of  Government's  legislative  programme.  [Applause.]  We  have
appreciated your co-operation in ensuring also  that  Parliament's  business
such as questions and other aspects have been  able  to  proceed  relatively
smoothly.

I want to thank each member who has served  in  this  Parliament.  You  have
contributed significantly to the development of  democracy  over  a  crucial
period in our country's history. To those of you who intend  to  retire,  we
thank you and wish you well in whatever ventures you intend to undertake.

I will not repeat the remarks made earlier this morning nor list  the  names
of those who are leaving, from all parties. Many  of  you  came  here  after
decades of serving the South African people in the struggle  for  democracy.
You can go forward satisfied with what we have  achieved.  You  will,  I  am
sure, maintain vigilance over this House to ensure that your legacy  is  not
dissipated.
To the Deputy Speaker I owe an immeasurable  debt.  She  has  provided  both
counsel and comfort, and has willingly undertaken the many  tasks  that  one
tends to delegate. These  are  often  neither  the  easy  nor  the  pleasant
duties. As a result, she shares most of the burdens and problems but not  an
equitable part of the more pleasant aspects of the responsibilities  of  the
Speaker. [Applause.]

Hon members, you have conferred on me the unique  honour  and  privilege  of
serving as the Speaker of the National Assembly for a decade.  For  this,  I
thank you. I have endeavoured to live up to your expectations and trust;  to
always protect the interest of Parliament and its members; to speak out  for
democracy, human rights and good governance; to  ensure  the  principles  of
our Constitution underpin our legislation; and  to  imbue  our  culture  and
practices. From that unique vantage point I am only too aware of how far  we
have travelled and yet how far we have to go.

As we go forth from here, we will have to account for our actions  and  face
the verdict of those who sent us here and have power  to  do  so  again.  Go
well, dear colleagues. [Applause.]

The House rose at 14:42.
