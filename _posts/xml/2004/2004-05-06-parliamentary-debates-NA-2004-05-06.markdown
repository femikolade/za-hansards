                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! May I request that anybody  who  has  a  cellphone  make
sure that it is switched off? Could we please just  honour  the  decorum  of
the House by always either leaving our cellular phones outside the House  or
switching them off as we come in?

Order! I have been advised that because of the late finalisation of  seating
arrangements, not all members will have the correct name on the  screens  at
their desks. This should not stop the  proceedings,  and  will  only  be  of
relevance if we have to vote. The situation will be corrected  in  time  for
the next sitting. Whips should please assist members who  have  problems  to
be seated.

I wish to announce that Mr N D Habedi was nominated  on  26  April  2004  to
fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr M  A  Mangena.  The  member
made and subscribed the oath in the Speaker's office.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                    (The late Mr Abdullah (Dullah) Omar)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with profound sadness the untimely death of  the  hon  Abdullah
       (Dullah) Omar, who passed away on Saturday, 13 March 2004;


  (2) recognises that Dullah Omar was a South African patriot who lived his
       entire adult life working toward the fulfilment  of  the  goal  of  a
       South Africa free from poverty, racism and sexism;


  (3) recalls that he played an active and leading role in the struggle for
       the defeat of apartheid, as a defence lawyer for political  prisoners
       and activists, and also as a disciplined member and leader of,  among
       others,  the  United  Democratic  Front  and  the  African   National
       Congress;


  (4) acknowledges the great contribution that hon Minister  Omar  made  in
       the making and shaping of our democracy, as both  a  member  of  this
       House and our Government;


  (5) believes that he leaves behind a legacy of dedicated service  to  our
       country; and


  (6) conveys its deepest condolences to the Omar family and all his  loved
       ones.
The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and hon members,
it is with deep melancholy that I rise to pay tribute to a great patriot, a
selfless freedom fighter, a revolutionary human rights lawyer, and a
distinguished former member of the Parliament of our country, the late hon
Dullah Omar.

Throughout his life, from humble beginnings in District Six, the hon Omar
successfully wove the revolutionary vision of the Freedom Charter into his
everyday life as a people's lawyer, as a political activist and later as an
hon member of this House and as a member of state.

It is difficult to separate his professional life from his role as a
political activist. The human rights lawyer and the political activist were
found in equal parts. He brought to both a measure of integrity and a depth
of understanding, not only of what we were fighting against, but also of
what we were fighting for. His steadfast stand against apartheid led to
several terms of detention and solitary confinement, notwithstanding his
status as a member of the Bar. This experience led him to say, and I quote:


  Up to 1985, until my arrest, I saw my main role as being the role of
  lawyer and therefore, even though I was active politically, politics
  played a secondary role to that of lawyer. The year 1985 heralded, for
  me, the beginning of a new chapter that was the primacy of the struggle
  for liberation, the primacy of direct resistance and a battle to
  overthrow the apartheid regime. That became the main objective of my
  life. Therefore, even though I continued to practise law and did my bit,
  politics began to play the dominant role.

During those years he was able to align organisations of professional men
and women such as Nadel to the struggle for democracy by identifying what
he termed, "the key demands of democracy".

His understanding of the nature of the struggle for liberation, his
national and class content and his commitment to a culture of human rights
enabled him to understand the importance of coming to terms with our past
in order for us to move forward. Many of us know him as one of the key
architects of the truth and reconciliation process. As the first Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development in a democratic South Africa, he
aspired to create, as he put it:


  ... a legal system designed to protect South  Africa's  people  from  any
  form of oppression and exploitation, to defend their  rights  to  liberty
  and equality. There shall be a system of justice fit for human beings and
  designed to humanise all South Africa's people and encourage them to live
  in peace and harmony with each other.

During his second term of office he served as the Minister of Transport
until his end - a proud and distinguished legacy indeed. He left us a
legacy to build on as we move forward into our second decade of democracy,
to implement and deliver on the people's contract, to create jobs, to
eradicate poverty and to create a just and humane society. [Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, it is an honour and a pleasure for me, on
behalf of the DA, to pay tribute to the late Minister Dullah Omar. For the
past five years, it has been a pleasure to work with him in my capacity as
the DA spokesperson on transport. Despite our many differences of approach,
we always had the same objective in mind, namely to make South Africa's
transport system work. My colleague Douglas Gibson also had the pleasure of
working with him in his capacity as the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development from 1994 to 1999, and my leader, and a number
of our members on these benches today, also worked with him in the
constitutional negotiations.

Although they often clashed, and some hard trading took place, they all
agreed that he was ever the gentleman, and absent in him was the personal
rancour and pettiness which sometimes mars political debate and democratic
discourse.

When he fell ill, people on this side of the House, and no doubt members in
general, sympathised greatly with him and his family. Warm letters were
exchanged between him and several of our members of the DA. He leaves
behind him a proud record and a legacy of struggle and commitment during
South Africa's darkest days of apartheid from the 1960s to the 1980s. He
pushed the state of emergency to its legal limits, whilst personally
suffering greatly under it, and he died as he lived - with dignity and
courage.

My own association with him was one of an open-door policy. He was always
willing to listen to my many transport-related problems and to respond to
my many questions. During his term as Minister of Transport he faced major
challenges, from the unruly minibus taxi industry to the alarming road
accident casualty rate, unroadworthy vehicles, the urgently needed
tightening of regulations relating to law enforcement, public transport in
regard to buses and rail, and all this coupled with an ailing Road Accident
Fund and deteriorating infrastructure in regard to our roads, railways and
harbours.

Dullah Omar always took on these challenges, often with little capacity
within his department, with commitment, dedication and humility. With the
foundation now laid it is important for his work to continue, and I look
forward to working with the new Minister in order to implement his thoughts
and inspirations for a truly efficient and safe transport sector in South
Africa.

We take this opportunity again to extend our deepest sympathies and sincere
condolences to his wife, Farida, and his three children and grandchildren.
We also extend our sincere sympathies to his friends and colleagues in the
ANC on the passing of one of its leading members. Together we can work to
ensure that his legacy lives on. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Madam Speaker, Dullah Omar's place in South Africa's history is
undisputed, for his role in the liberation struggle and his distinguished
service as the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development and then
as Minister of Transport in the first two democratic Parliaments.

That Dullah Omar conducted his duties diligently to the very end testifies
to the depth of his commitment. Yet, the profound sense of loss is felt on
both sides of the House and across our nation. Perhaps it points to an even
more profound and enduring legacy, for Dullah Omar was a true patriot in
the noblest sense of the word, a proud South African, first and foremost.
At a time when we are all trying to construct a new meaning of citizenship
and forge a spirit of national unity, Dullar Omar's example shone brightly.
His unswerving loyalty to his party and its cause never prevented him from
reaching out to others across the political divide and beyond. He rejected
political sectionalism and refrained from engaging in puerile political
point-scoring.

With Dullah Omar's passing, on this side of the House we have not just lost
a political colleague and opponent, we have lost a friend. The essential
hallmarks of his character were his humanity, decency, and generosity of
spirit. His life showed that it is possible to traverse the loftiest peak
of human endeavour without losing the common touch, or being tainted by the
trappings of power.

The IFP joins with members across this House in paying tribute and
celebrating his rich and full life. The best way we can cherish his memory,
as always, is by emulating his examples. Our deepest sympathy and
condolences go to his family and his many friends. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Speaker and hon members, today we say goodbye to the
late Dullah Omar, who was elected twice to this House and served in both
the previous Cabinets. The UDM would like to take this opportunity once
more to extend our condolences to his wife, family, friends and the ANC.

It would be impossible in this short space of time available to pay proper
tribute to every aspect of Dullah Omar's life. Suffice it to say that he
had dedicated his entire adult life to the attainment and advancement of
freedom and democracy under the auspices of Nadel, later at Codesa, and
eventually in the Cabinet. His was a life dedicated to the service of
others.

The UDM president, the hon Holomisa, describes him as someone who was "a
father figure for many, a rational person, a thinker and a warm person."

He will be sorely missed in public and private life, but we may be consoled
by the fact that his legacy lives on. I thank you, Madam Speaker.
[Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, on behalf of the
Independent Democrats we bring condolences to the family of the late
Dullah, his wife Farida, and his sons, and also to the ANC. We certainly
know Dullah as a family man. The last time I visited him, I found his sons
and his family all around him. And he was always a great and respected man
in his own community too.

He was never a man after material gain. During the years of the struggle he
defended many comrades without getting paid for it, which led him to suffer
financially. He also struggled to get his own sons through university, but
he never complained about it, and he continued to defend many of our
comrades.

I also recall that when we were negotiating the interim Constitution and
the AWB burst into the World Trade Centre, I was with the late Barney Desai
and the late Dullah Omar and that we were saying that maybe we should move
the talks to Cape Town, because it was too dangerous in Johannesburg. And
certainly even there during the negotiations for the interim Constitution
he played a valuable role. He was with us through all those late nights,
and he was very, very principled on all the issues that we agreed on.

He certainly will be a great loss to South Africa, and to his family. The
Independent Democrats wish his family strength and we wish them well. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mev die Speaker, die Nuwe NP ondersteun hierdie mosie
heelhartig. Daar is twee uitstaande kenmerke van wyle Dullah Omar waarvan
baie min mense bewus is en wat ek vandag hier wil openbaar.

Tydens 'n aanslag op my lewe was dit Dullah Omar wat op 'n dag vir my gevra
het om na sy kantoor te kom om te kyk na die bekentenis van 'n sersant van
die weermag wat deur die BSB gehuur was om my om die lewe te bring. Ek
onthou Dullah Omar die oggend toe die tornado Manenberg getref het. Toe
persone van verskillende politieke oortuigings probeer het om politiek
daarvan te maak, was dit hy wat op sy stil manier gesê het: "Mense, ons het
hier te doen met 'n tragedie. Vergeet julle verskille. Kom ons kyk na 'n
plan om hierdie mense te help."

Dit is die tipe persoon wat ons graag sal wil onthou.

Die ander punt wat ek wil uitlig, is dat dit 'n jammerte is dat Dullah Omar
nie kon geleef het om te sien dat die padsterftes oor die Paasnaweek
verminder het nie. Sy woorde was altyd: "Een sterfte was een te veel."
Ons sal hom onthou vir die sagmoedige manier waarop hy altyd te werk gegaan
het, en die Nuwe NP wil graag sy meegevoel betuig aan sy naasbestaandes en
sy kollegas.

Ons steun hierdie mosie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech
follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Speaker, the New NP supports this motion
wholeheartedly. There are two prominent characteristics of the late Dullah
Omar of which very few people are aware, and which I want to reveal here
today.

During an attempt on my life it was Dullah Omar who invited me to his
office one day to look at a confession made by a sergeant in the army who
was hired by the BSB to assassinate me. I remember Dullah on the morning
when the tornado hit Manenberg. When people from different political
persuasions tried to politicise it, he was the one who said in his quiet
manner: "Mense, ons het hier te doen met 'n tragedie. Vergeet julle
verskille. Kom ons kyk na 'n plan om hierdie mense te help." [People, we
are dealing with a tragedy here. Forget about your differences. Let us look
at a way to help these people.]

This is the type of person we would like to remember.

The other point I want to highlight is that it is a pity that Dullah Omar
could not live to see that the death toll on our roads had decreased over
the Easter weekend. He always said: "Een sterfte was een te veel." [One
death is one too many.]

We will remember him for the gentle way in which he conducted himself, and
the New NP would like to extend its condolences to his next of kin and
colleagues.

We support this motion. [Applause.]]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and members, on behalf of
the ACDP I rise in support of this motion in honour of the late Dullah
Omar.
The late Minister Dullah Omar was a respected and selfless man of the
people of South Africa. He embodied many of the qualities and values upon
which this country's Constitution is built. As such it was fitting that he
was chosen as the first Minister of Justice of our new democratic order in
1994.

As an intellectual he was a mentor and voice of reason to university
students during those turbulent days of marches and student protest. As a
legal activist he gave much of his time and energy to represent the many in
detention, and was a great source of strength to those families who
believed that they had in him a trusted friend of those either in prison or
in exile.

He often, at great expense to himself and his own family, used his own
resources to help those less fortunate detainees. In this he proved that he
loved his political purpose in South Africa more than he loved his own
life. The work of the UDF was given the necessary stature and mass appeal
because of individuals such as the late Dullah Omar.
Although he sacrificed his time with family for the sake of others, he
remained a steadfast and committed family man. In fact, his love for a just
and free South Africa was his personal quality that strengthened his family
ties.

The late Dullah Omar had one great quality and that was that he never
allowed his personal views to come in the way of helping others,
irrespective of their political views. He was able to represent and speak
to anyone, because he believed in a South Africa that would be a home for
all who lived in it, black and white, and for all who held different
persuasions of belief and custom. This is the legacy he leaves behind.
South Africa will become a great nation if we nurture such values
throughout the width and breadth of our nation.

The ACDP extends its sincere condolences to his  wife,  Farida,  his  family
and friends, his party the ANC, and all who  dearly  loved  Dullah  Omar.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President, Mr Dullah Omar was one
of twelve children of Asa and Mohammed Omar, a greengrocer hawker here in
Cape Town.

He was born in Cape Town on 26 May 1934, and then he attended a small
Muslim primary school in Salt River, and the Wesley Training School, after
which he matriculated at Trafalgar High School in 1952. Between 1953 and
1957 Mr Omar attended the University of Cape Town where he completed a BA
degree and an LLB degree. Following graduation, he completed his legal
articles in Cape Town, and then opened a legal practice in partnership with
Cadoc M Kobus in Cape Town. He spent almost all of his life in Cape Town,
and played all the major roles in his life basically in Cape Town, and
later here in Parliament.

Mev die Speaker, die Vryheidsfront Plus het met Minister Omar te doen gekry
veral tydens die onderhandelingsproses, en ook kort ná die 1994-verkiesing,
toe hy die Minister van Justisie was, rondom die amnestie-prosedures, en
die justisiedebat wat daar in daardie tyd was. En ek dink minister Omar sal
waarskynlik eendag onthou word as Suid-Afrika se eerste Minister van
Justisie ná die nuwe Suid-Afrika tot stand gekom het, en ook vir die hele
Waarheid- en Versoeningskommissie-proses wat hy gelei het, en deur die
Parlement gevoer het, as die verantwoordelike minister.

Ek wil namens die Vryheidsfront Plus ons opregte meegevoel betuig, nie net
met sy kollegas in die ANC wat 'n kollega verloor het nie, maar veral met
sy familie. Ons het 'n kollega verloor, maar sy familie het 'n eggenoot, 'n
pa en 'n oupa verloor. Ons betuig ons opregte meelewing, en ons bid sy
familie sterkte toe. Baie dankie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Madam Speaker, the Freedom Front Plus started dealing with Minister Omar
especially during the negotiation process, and also shortly after the 1994
election, when he was Minister of Justice, regarding the amnesty procedures
and the justice debate that was conducted at the time. And I think Minister
Omar will probably one day be remembered as South Africa's first Minister
of Justice after the new South Africa was established, and also for the
whole process of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission under his
leadership, and which he piloted through Parliament as the responsible
Minister.

On behalf of the Freedom Front Plus I want to express our sincere
condolences, not only with his colleagues in the ANC who lost a colleague,
but especially with his family. We have lost a colleague, but his family
lost a husband, a father and a grandfather. We express our sincere
condolences and we pray that God will grant his family strength. Thank you
very much. [Applause.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and hon Ministers, the
UCDP wishes to express its condolences to the family and friends of the
late Minister Dullah Omar.

His passing away has robbed the country of a leader with a vision to
transform the transport sector and a commitment to making our roads safe
for both motorists and pedestrians. He is well remembered as Mr Arrive
Alive. His mission was to reverse the bad image of our roads as death
traps. Yes, indeed, he was winning the war, as witnessed by the reduction
in fatalities on our roads during major public holidays.

He has also distinguished himself in the area of justice as a luminary who
laid a solid foundation for judiciary transformation to take root. We
sincerely believe that the only way to preserve the legacy of the late
Minister Dullah Omar is to carry on with his ideals of a better society for
all.

Dullah Omar e ne e se motho yo o mafaratlhatlha. E ne e le motho wa batho,
tsala ya ditsala. Re tla mo gakologelwa ka bonolo ba gagwe mme re
gakologelwa le ba losika lwa gagwe bogolosegolo ba ANC ka tatlhegelo e ba
nang le yona. Le rona re lela le bona. A moya wa gagwe o lale ka kagiso.
[Legofi.] [Dullah Omar was not a difficult person. He was a people's
person, a friend amongst friends. He will be remembered for his gentleness,
and his family is thought of, and especially the ANC, for their loss. We
sympathise with them. May his soul rest in peace. [Applause.]]

Mr T GODI: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and hon members, on behalf of
the PAC we join the House in saluting the late Minister of Transport,
Comrade Dullah Omar.

His life is indeed instructive and exemplary, not unique, but equally and
certainly not common. Comrade Omar belonged to that category and generation
of cadres and leaders who were not motivated by selfish and material
rewards, but who were motivated by a higher ideal of service, suffering and
sacrifice in the interests of the collective, in the interests of all.

When others chose the comfort of home and family, he chose the comfort of
struggle, whose guaranteed menu from the enemy's side then was exile,
prison, torture and even death. As an activist attorney he served us all in
the liberation movement without partiality. We of the PAC were amongst the
first to benefit from his services as a lawyer in the early sixties.
Comrade Omar, as testified before, provided legal services to communities
often for no fees whatsoever.

Comrade Omar not only fought and lived to see the demise of the evil that
is white domination, but had an opportunity to contribute to the building
of a new society and a new nation. He served his country with a deep sense
of commitment - a commitment he showed in spite of the severity of his
illness and one which he showed to the end. Omar is remembered as a person
who was humble and devoted and who had striven for a just and equitable
order in our country. May his example be emulated.

He is missed not only by his family and the Congress movement, but by the
whole nation. May his soul rest in peace. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, the Azanian People's Organisation
wishes to join other hon members of this House in expressing our heartfelt
condolences to both the biological and the political families of the late
Comrade Dullah Omar.

All members of Parliament who spoke before me have expressed, almost in
unison, the deep sense that accompanied the passing on of this gallant
fighter and campaigner for human dignity and freedom. Many still will extol
his virtues as a determined, fearless and yet humble servant of his people
who really soldiered on in spite of his failing and deterioriating state of
health.

To Azapo, Comrade Omar has not just been another member of the ruling
party. Our association with him actually predates the existence of our
party. We will always remember him as a very helpful comrade who was not
just a lawyer for the SASO BPC trialists on Robben Island, but was also an
inspiration to some of us who benefited from his services. He inspired some
of us to study, and even assisted in making arrangements for the pursuance
of such studies.

We therefore would like to say, in the words of one writer: heaven and us
had part in his life; our part we could not keep from death, so heaven has
kept its part for eternity. May his soul rest in peace. Thank you.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I wish to formally add the condolences of the
Deputy Speaker and myself.

We will forward the message of the resolution to the family.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, all members standing.

              INVITATION TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  on
behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises that this year marks the tenth year of a democractic
       Parliament in South Africa;


  (2) recalls that on 10 May 1994, Mr Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the
       first President of the democratic South Africa, after he had been
       elected unopposed by the National Assembly on 9 May; and


  (3) therefore resolves -


       (a)  to celebrate our ten years of a democratic Parliament; and


       (b)  subject to the concurrence of the National Council of Provinces,
           to invite former President Nelson Mandela to address a Joint
           Sitting of the Houses on 10 May, the day of his inauguration ten
           years ago, in order to commemorate ten years of a democratic
           Parliament.
[Applause.]

Agreed to.

                    RETIREMENT OF SECRETARY TO PARLIAMENT

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! I have to announce  that  the  Secretary  to  Parliament
will be retiring from the Parliamentary Service  with  effect  from  1  June
2004.

                    RETIREMENT OF SECRETARY TO PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  on
behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party:


  That, in view of the  retirement  of  the  Secretary  to  Parliament,  Mr
  Sindiso Mfenyana, with effect from 1 June  2004,  the  House  desires  to
  place on record its appreciation of the distinguished service rendered by
  him as an officer of Parliament since 1994.

[Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, it's a privilege for the DA to join in
supporting the resolution relating to the retirement of the Secretary to
Parliament, Mr Sindiso Mfenyana. The abiding memory I will have of his term
is his unfailing and gentle courtesy and friendliness. He is a very decent
man, who coped with his many tasks behind a curtain of imperturbability.
Nothing seemed to ruffle his feathers or make him lose his temper.

I am somewhat more volatile, but in many years of interaction between us he
never once shared his irritation with me, even when he must have felt it on
some occasions. [Laughter.] [Applause.] The Secretary is married to a very
nice woman, who supported him loyally. [Interjections.] I hope members are
agreeing with me. We got to know her socially and she really is a very nice
woman. She supported him loyally throughout his career over very many
years. We on this side of the House wish them both health and happiness,
and many good years in retirement. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the IFP, to
express our appreciation to Mr Sindiso Mfenyana for the service that he has
delivered to this Parliament, and more specifically to the IFP, over the
past years. Mr Gibson has already said, and I would repeat, that he has
been an absolutely courteous, kindly and pleasant gentleman all the way
through. No matter what we asked, he tried to oblige. His door was always
open. He tried very hard to assist the members wherever possible.

I am probably also not a very quiet person. I am a little demanding at
times, and I must say that every time I have asked for a meeting with him,
he has gone out of his way to make it possible to speak to him and to do
whatever he could to assist our party wherever possible. I got to go to
Russia with Mr Mfenyana some time back and I want to tell you that I got to
know a great deal more about the man there. He really is an interesting
man. [Laughter.] [Applause.] I want to tell you that it's not the way you
think it was. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mrs S A SEATON: Mr Gibson spoke about his wonderful wife. While we were in
Russia, all Mr Mfenyana spoke about was his wonderful life, and his
wonderful wife and son. So you can forget about that. [Laughter.]

I would like to say to you, Sir: Thank you so much for what you have done
for our party and for Parliament, and for the many years of service you
have given to us here. I hope that you enjoy your retirement with your
wife, and I would like to end off by saying to you in the little bit of
Russian that I learnt with you: "spasibo", which means "thank you", and
"dosvidanya", which means "goodbye".  God bless and goodbye. [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, the
UDM wishes to extend its appreciation to Mr Mfenyana for the work that he
has done during his term of office. Parliament has a surprisingly larger
administration than most people would guess. Being at the head of that
administration can be a difficult and complex task at the best of times.

Mr Mfenyana also had to steer this institution through a long and thorough
transformation. All in all, he acquitted himself well. As such, he has left
his mark on this Parliament and will be remembered as a fellow architect of
the first democratic South Africa.

The new Secretary to Parliament is inheriting a vibrant and dynamic
institution. We wish him well in his endeavours. The UDM wishes Mr Mfenyana
a well-deserved rest after a job well done. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, we all arrived here ten years ago very much
thrown into the deep end of things and had to find our way through a lot of
rules and regulations, and certainly Mr Mfenyana was there with us in
transforming this institution. He made Parliament accessible for disabled
people, which it was not when we arrived here. I think we will always
remember him for that. I also know that he must have had a hard time with
two very demanding presiding officers, but he was never angry and was
always diplomatic. He would say silently to us that this was what "they"
wanted and we knew exactly what he meant.

We wish him well in his future travels and with his family. We hope that,
like many other people leaving this Parliament, he will find some time to
write down some of the events that took place here so that we can keep that
for posterity, for our future generations. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C H F GREYLING: Mev die Speaker, namens die NNP is dit vir my aangenaam
om mnr Mfenyana te bedank vir die tydperk wat hy as Sekretaris van die
Parlement gedien het. Met die totstandkoming van die eerste verkose
demokratiese Parlement moes hy 'n baie moeilike taak op sy skouers neem om
in totaal nuwe omstandighede hierdie instelling te bestuur en aan die
transformasieproses mee te doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Madam Speaker, on behalf of the NNP it is a pleasure for me to thank Mr
Mfenyana for the term he served as Secretary to Parliament. With the
establishment of the newly elected democratic parliament he had to take on
the daunting task of managing the institution under these new circumstances
and participating in the transformation process.]

It was not always an easy task but through dedication and commitment he
managed to overcome the challenges he faced and he weathered many a storm
with a budget which not always corresponded with the demands made.

Sy bydrae om van hierdie Parlement 'n volledig demokratiese instelling te
maak, word in die besonder waardeer. Die pos van Sekretaris van die
Parlement is nie altyd die mees populêre posisie om te beklee nie.
Desondanks het hy te alle tye 'n oopdeurbeleid vir al die partye gevolg.
Die proses om deursigtigheid te bevorder en die instelling oop te stel vir
die gewone burgers van Suid-Afrika getuig van sy toegewydheid. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[His contribution to making this Parliament a totally democratic
institution is especially appreciated. The position of Secretary to
Parliament is not always the most popular. Despite that, he always followed
an open-door policy in respect of all parties. The process of promoting
transparency and opening the institution for the ordinary citizens of South
Africa bears testimony to his dedication.]

It is my pleasure to wish our retiring Secretary all the best for the
future and the path that he has chosen. We trust that his new task will be
less tiring than that of the past decade. We know that when Mr Mfenyana
looks back at his term as the Secretary of the first democratic parliament
he will do so with pride, and we wish him all the best. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker and hon members, on behalf of the ACDP, I would
like to thank Mr Mfenyana, the Secretary to Parliament, for his faithful
service to Parliament since 1994. His friendly, helpful and peace-loving
manner was always appreciated. We pray, Mr Mfenyana, that you will find
happiness and fulfilment as you move into this new phase of your life.

The ACDP would also like to take this opportunity to express our
appreciation for the outgoing Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene
Ginwala. Dr Ginwala is held in high esteem by many and we in the ACDP would
like to commend and congratulate her on her excellent handling of such an
exacting task. Dr Ginwala, we hope that you will enjoy your retirement from
politics and pray that you will be blessed with health and happiness in all
that you do. I thank you.

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, the FF appreciates and
expresses it support for this motion in front of the House in terms of
wishing the retiring Secretary to Parliament everything of the best.

Ek het mnr Mfenyana die afgelope tien jaar leer ken op verskeie
geleenthede, maar veral in die hoofswepevergadering, waar hy ons van tyd
tot tyd kom besoek het. Somtyds het ons mekaar gevind; en somtyds het ons
nie. Ek wil wel graag vir u lees uit die voorwoord ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [I got to know Mr
Mfenyana over the past ten years on several occasions, but in particular
during the Chief Whips' Forum which he visited from time to time. Sometimes
we found each other, and sometimes not. I would like to read from the
foreword ...]

... the foreword to the guide to Procedures of the National Assembly. I
think it is a very good thing that this is being published now after 10
years, just as the Secretary is leaving. New members will find out that it
takes approximately 10 years to find out what is going on in this place. I
just want to read a short passage from the foreword written by the
Secretary:


  When the new democratic Parliament was opened on 9 May 1994, more than
  half of the members sworn in had never set foot in the South African
  Parliament, let alone understood the procedures to be followed. Thus
  between 9 May 1994 and the first joint sitting on 24 May, the
  parliamentary officials and senior staff conducted intense induction
  workshops to take the members through the then existing rules of
  proceedings. Newly elected Chairpersons of committees had to hit the
  ground running, largely assisted by the committee clerks. Service
  officers were on their feet throughout the day, helping the members first
  to find their own offices and then their committee rooms. The forms of
  address varied between "honourable" and "comrade" and the dress code was
  simply defined as clean and decent, in keeping with the prevailing
  weather.

Mr Secretary, on behalf of the FF Plus we wish you well, and we wish you
well in your retirement. It was an honour and a privilege to know you.
Thank you very much and goodbye.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, the UCDP also wishes to bid
Mr Sindiso Mfenyana farewell after a job well done. He can be viewed as one
of the midwives in the delivery of our democratic Parliament. He has been
at the coalface of ushering in a democratic dispensation in the
parliamentary discourse. Despite his many assignments he has always had an
ear for the concerns of political parties and members of Parliament. As
administrator he did his utmost to ensure that the lives of members were
pleasant, while on the other hand he had to ensure that the integrity of
the institution was not compromised. On some occasions he has had to make
unpopular decisions in a bid to make sure that things were happening.

He surely is a decisive man who does not leave things or issues to chance.
His quiet nature belies a man of strong character. While we wish Mr
Mfenyana the best in all his future endeavours, may I take this opportunity
to advise him to know that retirement means being tired twice: First being
tired of working and then being tired of not! Nonetheless, in the spirit
and the mood of this afternoon, we the UCDP say farewell to u tataMfenyana.
[Applause.]

Mr N T GODI: Madam Speaker and hon members, Ntate Mfenyana, we in the PAC
join the House in bidding you farewell. You served us as a party and the
institution of Parliament well. We thank you for your service and
contribution to the smooth running of this democratic Parliament and
ultimately the entrenchment of democracy itself. It is not an everyday
occurrence that a citizen gets an opportunity to serve his or her country
at such a high level. You got the opportunity and have served admirably.
You belong to the new breed of administrative cadres who use the
institutions of the state to serve the people, a living testimony of and
for the democratic order. We wish you well in your new endeavours. We are
confident that you will again prove yourself worthy of the trust that will
be bestowed on you. We hope that you continue to serve our country and
people in whatever capacity. We are also hopeful that the new Secretary
will at least maintain the ethos you and your team established.

Hi ri ndlela nhle ndoda ya ka Mfenyana hi na va PAC. [On behalf of the PAC
we say: Thank you, Mr Mfenyana.]

MR P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, Azapo joins other parties in expressing
its appreciation for the work and distinguished service rendered by Mr
Sindiso Mfenyana since 1994. Although our association with his office
started only in 1999, we have always felt warmth and a brotherly spirit
from him and members of his staff. Azapo wishes him well in his future
involvement in the service of our country, his family and our people. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, Deputy President and
hon members, in 1962, around the 2 nd of January, the ANC arranged for a
small group of nine young people to leave the country through Botswana in
search of skills to bring about our country's freedom. Driven by a burning
desire to create a humane South Africa out of the ashes of crime against
humanity, these young people journeyed to learn languages and cultures
unknown to them. From Botswana they went to Zambia, Tanzania, London,
Moscow, Hungary or to Havana in Cuba. By the time they began arriving back
on South African soil in Johannesburg, from the 1990s, they were statesmen
and women, they were tried and tested soldiers for positive change to
create a better life for all. When in 1994 Mr Mfenyana began serving this
Parliament as the undersecretary and in June 1997 got appointed as
secretary to this honoured institution of our people, we had chosen one
amongst the then nine young people who in 1962 crossed the border to
Botswana in search of solutions to their country's problems.

Yours, Mr Mfenyana, has been an honoured role at the helm of the
institution that from 1994 became the historical site of the noble
struggles for the development and adoption of a democratic constitutional
and legal framework.

We thank you, Comrade Mfenyana, for your valued contribution in this
Parliament. We salute you on your lifelong commitment to the cause of
freedom, peace, social justice and a better life for all in our country, in
Africa and in the world. As we face the challenge of creating work and
reducing the number of our people dependent on social welfare, we know that
even in your happy and peaceful retirement - which we wish you dearly -
your profound experience will always remain an asset of value to us and to
all of humanity. Baba uMfenyana, may you enjoy the beauty that
characterises our valleys and mountains, our cultures and unity. As we said
in 1962 when that young fresh face of yours jumped to other lands, so we
say today to your wisdom-filled eyes:

Sithi ndlelanhtle, baba. Uphumule kamnandi. Siyawubonga umsebenzi nobuqhawe
bakho. [Ihlombe.] [We say goodbye to you, Sir. Have a good rest. We are
grateful for the work you have done and for your bravery. [Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: Again, hon members, I wish to add the congratulations and the
good wishes of the Deputy Speaker and I to those of hon members to our
retiring Secretary to Parliament. However, we should not fool ourselves
that he is about to rest. Mr Mfenyana immediately gets into his next task
in the Department of Foreign Affairs. He leaves the country to be posted to
one of the countries abroad where he will represent us, as he has always
done, as the people of South Africa. And for that we really thank him but
we do wish that he could take at least a month off. That is, of course,
falling on deaf ears. He has already laughed at me when I raised that with
him. I did not understand how he could just move from one job, which he has
held for 10 years, straight into the next one. But that is how it is when
you have been moulded in the way that he was.

Thank you very much, Mr Mfenyana, for your service. Indeed there are no
objections to the motion. It will be forwarded also to your wife, Rita
Mfenyana, who has in her own way also served because she did prop you up so
that you could serve us as well as you did. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

              The Department of Provincial and Local  Government  will  bear
              the costs.

         Council of Provinces as well as to the Joint Standing Committee on
         Defence, and wish to request that you bring the contents of this
