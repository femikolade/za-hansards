[The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:


  That, notwithstanding Rule 23, the House -


  (1) resolves that, on Tuesday 15 June, the hours of sitting will be from
       09:00 to adjournment; and


  (2) condones the starting time of the House at 10:00 on Monday, 10 May.]

Question put: That the motion be agreed to.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Speaker, the hon the Chief Whip speaks
impeccable isiZulu and mine is not as good as his, but I still did
understand what he was saying. What he was trying to do was to sneak past
the House a resolution concerning 10 May. I want to make it clear for the
record that the DA greatly disapproves of the House breaching its own
rules and doing so in a calculated fashion and doing so ...
An HON MEMBER: Again?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: No, this was the  last  time  and  I  am
hoping that it will not happen again in future.

Because, what we succeeded in doing was, to an extent, casting blight over
what should have been a happy occasion for South Africa. I  think  it  was
really unfortunate that instead of planning the thing properly and getting
the House in advance to approve, what happened was that the  House  agreed
to go ahead and breach its own Rules and  now  it  is  asking  for  us  to
condone it. It is a shame. We believe in the rule of law and we must abide
by the rule of law. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Gibson, what I want to correct, though, is that you  said
that the hon the Chief Whip was sneaking something past the House.  It  is
actually on the Order Paper. It is part of the Draft Resolution  that  the
hon the Chief Whip is moving. So, I mean, you may put  your  view  forward
without saying that it was sneaked in because it is actually on the  Order
Paper.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  could  Mr
Gibson withdraw  that  statement,  because  it  implies  an  improper  and
dishonest motive on the part of the Chief Whip.

The SPEAKER: Hon Gibson, do withdraw that because I think the record  must
be straight about what was happening. There has been a request for you  to
withdraw the reference to having sneaked it in because  it  does  in  fact
indicate dishonesty, which really is unfair.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: The hon the Chief Whip is certainly not
dishonest, madam. I did not see the Order Paper, but I withdraw the
statement. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: All right. So, there was an objection to the motion. The DA
has already expressed its view on this matter and it is thus known.
However, the House would like to indicate that this issue has been brought
back to the House as we had promised ourselves that we would do on the
morning of 10 May.

In view of the fact that we have had that objection we would then proceed
to record our views on the issue that is in the motion and so I now put
the question and those in favour will say: ``Aye'' and those against will
say, ``No''. I think the ayes have it.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: The DA calls for a division.

The SPEAKER: The DA calls for a division, so we will have the bells rung
for two minutes.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, but Mr Gibson
still has not withdrawn.

The SPEAKER: No, he did. Did he not? Did he not withdraw?

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: [Inaudible.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, can you please settle down. I would like
to first proceed with the voting and then we will come back to the issue
of the withdrawal. A division having been called for, we will now record
our voting. Members must make sure that they are sitting at their desks
where their names appear so that we can record their positions accurately.
Those in favour of the question should press ``yes'' and those against
should press ``no'' - and those who would like to abstain should press
``abstain''. [Interjections.]

Division demanded.

The House divided:

Motion accordingly agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, regarding the withdrawal of Mr Gibson, I have
verified both with his senior Whip and with himself and have received
confirmation that he indeed did withdraw. [Interjections.] Let us take Mr
Gibson's word that he withdrew. We really have no reason to want to do
otherwise. The hon member says he withdrew. Let us take his word for it.
[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, it sounds as if there are
some people who doubt it, so to put it beyond doubt, we can look at the
Hansard. In any event, I withdraw it again.

The SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Mr Gibson. [Applause.]
Hon members, that concludes the business of the House. Members are
reminded that we still have extended public committees taking place in the
Old Assembly Chamber and in E249. These will start in ten minutes from
now.

The House adjourned at 14:14.
