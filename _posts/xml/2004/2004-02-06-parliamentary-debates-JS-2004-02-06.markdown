The Speaker announced that the Presiding Officers  had  received  a  message
from the President requesting that a Joint Sitting of the National  Assembly
and the National Council of  Provinces  be  convened  in  terms  of  section
84(2)(d) of the Constitution, read  with  Joint  Rule  7(1),  on  Friday,  6
February 2004, at 11:00, to enable him to  deliver  his  annual  address  to
Parliament.
                    ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam Speaker, Chairperson  of  the  National
Council of Provinces, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the  national
Houses of Parliament, Deputy President of the Republic,  honourable  leaders
of our political parties  and  hon  members  of  Parliament,  Ministers  and
Deputy Ministers, our esteemed Chief Justice and members of  the  judiciary,
heads of our Security Services, Governor of the Reserve Bank,  distinguished
Premiers of our provinces,  mayors  and  leaders  in  our  system  of  local
government, our honoured traditional leaders,  heads  of  the  state  organs
supporting our democratic system, directors-general  and  other  leaders  of
the Public Service, President Mandela and Mrs Graca Machel,  President  F  W
de Klerk and Mrs Elita de Klerk, Your  Excellencies,  Ambassadors  and  High
Commissioners, distinguished guests, friends and comrades, people  of  South
Africa, I am honoured to welcome to  this  Chamber  representatives  of  two
families whose loved ones were killed 30 years  ago  in  Gaborone,  Botswana
and Lusaka, Zambia, while opening what proved to be  parcel  bombs  sent  by
agents of the apartheid system. These were Onkgopotse Tiro, a leader of  the
SA  Students  Organisation,  SASO,   and   Adolphus   Mvemve,   then   Chief
Representative of the ANC in Zambia. [Applause.]  I  am  very  pleased  that
they were able to join us today.

Nelson Mandela delivered our first state of the nation  address  before  the
first democratically elected Parliament on 24 May 1994. In that  address  he
quoted from a poem by Ingrid Jonker. In that poem Ingrid Jonker says:


  the child is present at all assemblies and law-giving
  the child peers through the windows of houses
  and into the hearts of mothers
  this child, who only wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga,
  is everywhere


  the child, grown to a man, treks on through all Africa
  the child, grown to a giant, journeys
  over the whole world
  without a pass!

Nelson Mandela then went on to say:


  And in this glorious vision, she instructs that our  endeavours  must  be
  about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the  man  and  the
  liberty of the child. It is these things that we  must  achieve  to  give
  meaning to our presence in this  Chamber  and  to  give  purpose  to  our
  occupancy of the seat of Government.


  And so we must, constrained by and  yet  regardless  of  the  accumulated
  effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for  ourselves
  what we want to make of our shared destiny.


  The Government I have the honour to lead and I dare say  the  masses  who
  elected us to serve in this role, are inspired by the  single  vision  of
  creating a people-centred society.
  Accordingly, the purpose that will drive this  Government  shall  be  the
  expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, the continuous  extension
  of the frontiers of freedom.

He said:


  The acid test of the legitimacy  of  the  programmes  we  elaborate,  the
  Government institutions we create, the  legislation  we  adopt,  must  be
  whether they serve these objectives.

Today we begin the last session of  our  second  democratic  Parliament.  We
begin this session two and a half  months  before  we  celebrate  our  first
decade of liberation  and  democracy.  We  also  meet  in  these  Houses  of
Parliament not long before we hold our third general elections.

It is, therefore, natural that our national legislature  should  spend  some
time reflecting on what we have achieved or not achieved during the last  10
years. Inevitably, all of us will also make speeches aimed at improving  our
fortunes in the forthcoming elections.

 But perhaps the correct starting point  for  the  Government  would  be  to
recall what was said as we began our journey into our democratic future.  It
was for this reason that I quoted what President Mandela said at  the  start
of the first session of the first democratic Parliament.

To repeat what he said:


  The Government I have the honour to lead and, I dare say, the masses  who
  elected us to serve in this role are inspired by  the  single  vision  of
  creating a people-centred society. Accordingly,  the  purpose  that  will
  drive this Government shall be the expansion of the  frontiers  of  human
  fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.


  The acid test of the legitimacy  of  the  programmes  we  elaborate,  the
  Government institutions we create, the  legislation  we  adopt,  must  be
  whether they serve these objectives.

Sometimes it is difficult fully to understand the fact that  we  are  barely
10 years away from a time in the lives of our  people  when  our  collective
future was very uncertain. Some among us will hardly remember that  even  as
we met in this House to listen to President Mandela  deliver  the  state  of
the nation address, fellow South  Africans  were  continuing  to  die  as  a
result of political violence.

For instance, the South African Yearbook of 1995 reported:


  Although political violence declined during  and  after  the  April  1994
  election, extensive criminal and political violence continued to  persist
  in the country, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and on the East Rand  of  the
  Gauteng province.

Daily fatalities from political violence still numbered six in May and  just
under four in June.

Others among us will have forgotten that as we sat here  listening  to  that
first state of the nation address, the commitment made by President  Mandela
to ensure ``the expansion of the frontiers of  human  fulfilment''  was,  to
many, little more than a  promise  they  appreciated  but  could  not  fully
comprehend.

The question had still to be answered as to where  the  resources  would  be
found to finance the expansion of  the  frontiers  of  human  fulfilment  of
which President Mandela spoke. In the decade up to the middle of  1993,  the
average annual GDP growth rate was less than 1%. During the  first  half  of
1995, the annual growth rate stood at 1%. For the fiscal  year  1994-95  the
Budget deficit stood at 6,6%. Consumer price inflation in the 12  months  up
to April 1995 was 11%.

By the end of that year, the interest rate stood  at  13%.  On  14  February
1995 the then Governor of the Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, said:


  A more restrictive monetary policy  is  needed  to  make  sure  that  the
  current economic upswing will not be of the boom-bust nature  of  earlier
  times, but will be more durable.

On 29 June of the same year, Mr Stals sounded an ominous note when he said:


Underlying inflationary pressures are undoubtedly increasing  again  in  the
South African economy. If left unchecked, this trend would eventually  force
the abortion of the welcome improvement over the past year in real  economic
growth,  and  will  frustrate  the  objectives  of  the  Reconstruction  and
Development Programme.

On 28 August 1995, Chris Stals said:


   Basically, the South African economy is not competitive enough to  enable
   it to maintain an economic growth rate at a level high enough for its own
   needs. More drastic economic restructuring will be  needed  to  lift  the
   growth potential of the economy to the desired and more acceptable level.

In the same speech he expressed the uncertainties of the day when he said:


   Economic growth will, in the final situation, be dependent not only on an
   improvement in the economic structure of the country, but even more so on
   political and social stability. In  the  final  situation,  all  business
   decisions are influenced by the overall environment  in  which  they  are
   taken.

On 12 October 1995 he said that  the  country  was  still  faced  with  some
political uncertainties which impacted on our economic prospects. He said:


   At this stage ... the country still has to face:


     • the first fully democratic election for local authorities  scheduled
       to take place in early November this year;


     • a more clear definition of the  political,  economic  and  financial
       relationships  between   the   central   government   and   regional
       governments; and

     • the drafting of a final Constitution to replace the current  interim
       Constitution before the next general election can take place.

Since time immemorial, the overwhelming majority of  our  people  had  known
nothing but despair. They knew this as an incontestable matter of fact  that
tomorrow would not be better than yesterday. It was  also  fixed  and  given
that the following day would be worse. But then, April  27,  1994  came  and
things changed radically and irrevocably for all South Africans.

For the black, especially the African majority, suddenly a new  dawn  broke.
After these masses had cast their votes, they still  had  nothing  in  their
stomachs and in their pockets. They walked away from the polling  booths  to
return to their miserable  shacks  and  their  children,  made  listless  by
hunger and the brutish thugs  who  prowled  the  unlit  dirt  roads  of  the
shantytowns, ready to pounce on their victims with no sense of mercy.

They walked the long distances  to  return  to  their  homesteads  of  rural
squalor; to the mornings of the drudgery  of  women  with  buckets  full  of
dirty river water on their heads; to the daily diet of  mealie-pap;  to  the
dark, still and menacing nights broken only by the  weak,  flickering  light
of the paraffin lamp; and to the dying embers of an exhausted  fire  on  the
humble hearth.

Yet they had a spring in their step, because they knew that a new  dawn  had
proclaimed the coming of a  bright  day.  Though  their  hands  carried  the
emptiness to which generations of deprivation  had  accustomed  them,  their
hearts and minds were  fired  up  by  a  newfound  sense  of  hope  and  the
attendant feeling of dread lest that hope  turned  out  to  be  but  a  mere
mirage, the false creation of a wish that was intensely felt.

The experience of many decades had taught us to understand  that  the  black
poor of our country valued a just peace  as  deeply  as  they  valued  their
lives. It had taught us that their sense of pride  in  themselves  as  human
beings made it impossible for them to join in  a  mass  slaughter  of  other
human  beings,  even  to  satisfy  the  base  instincts  of  vengeance   and
retaliating to settle scores.

Over many decades we had seen that these masses would always refuse to  turn
racist, simply because they were subjected to cruel,  racist  rule.  When  a
hero in their midst, Chris Hani, was murdered in cold  blood,  they  refused
to fulfil the prophecy of the poet  that  the  blood-dimmed  tide  would  be
loosed, to drown the ceremony of innocence.

They stood in the voting lines side by side with those who  had  been  their
oppressors, and never uttered a single word of anger, nor jostled the  white
person next to them because they felt that their  time  to  become  the  new
masters had  come.  [Applause.]  Black  and  white  stood  together,  acting
voluntarily together for the first time in our  history,  together  to  give
birth to a new social order that  would  serve  the  interests  of  all  our
people.

When the leadership of these black masses said to  them  that,  despite  the
fact that their children, their brothers  and  sisters,  their  mothers  and
fathers had been slaughtered in Boipatong and elsewhere on the many  killing
fields in our country, they as leaders were obliged to pursue  the  peaceful
advance to a just peace, these masses agreed and  urged  that  the  dialogue
chamber should bring to the nation the gift of a just peace.

They thought and acted as they did, because they knew better than those  who
had been certified as learned that it was only a just peace that  would  end
their despair and bring into their lives the sense of hope that  would  make
it possible for them to bear the pain of hunger, until  the  day  came  when
they would no longer go hungry.

It was for these reasons that they had  fought,  ready  to  sacrifice  their
lives, for the just peace and the sense of hope  they  saw  as  a  necessary
condition for their survival as human beings. Those among us  who  are  fond
of threatening violence to promote their causes should learn to  know  this,
that the masses of our people are  ready  and  willing  to  sacrifice,  once
again, to defend the peace and keep alive the sense  of  hope  that  enables
them to behave in mysteriously miraculous ways. [Applause.]

I must presume that many of  us  read  the  moving  article  by  Rian  Malan
published last Sunday. He says:


  On this day, 10 years ago, I was hiding gold coins under the  floorboards
  and trying to get my hands on a gun before the  balloon  went  up.  As  a
  white South African, I was fully expecting war as  right-wing  boers  and
  Bantustan chiefs conspired to annihilate Nelson Mandela's people and  the
  ANC leader squabbled with President F W de Klerk over who  deserved  more
  credit for their shared Nobel Peace Prize.


  In my view, peace would never come. There was too much history, too  much
  pain and anger ...
  Ten days  before  the  predicted  apocalypse,  there  came  a  miraculous
  reprieve. A reverent quiet settled upon  the  nation,  and  the  election
  passed off entirely peacefull ...


   I set out to discredit the outcome. "The peace is illusory",  I  sneered,
   "Anarchy is still coming. Look at crime! Rape! Guns and mayhem!  Decaying
   cities! Abandoned factories!  Incompetence  and  corruption  everywhere!"
   When our new rulers dismissed such criticism as racist, I said, "Fine: if
   that's the price one pays for speaking the truth, I will consider  myself
   honoured and  continue.  Hospitals  don't  work  anymore!  Surly  nurses!
   Drunken teachers! A civil service where the phones just ring!"

He ends his personal testimony with these words:


   It is infinitely worse to receive than to  give,  especially  if  one  is
   arrogant and the gift is something big, like mercy  or  forgiveness.  The
   gift of 1994 was so huge that I choked on it and couldn't say thank  you.
   But I am not too proud to say it now.

[Applause.]

I have borrowed these honest words from  Rian  Malan  to  tell  the  painful
story that strangely, but not surprisingly, because of 27  April  1994,  our
Freedom Day, despair had changed its domicile. Now, because freedom for  all
our people had become the defining feature of our  reality,  those  who  had
rejoiced in the supremacy of their race opened their doors to despair.

Those who had had despair imposed upon them, rejoiced in the triumph of  the
angel of hope that brought a new life of a shared neighbourhood to  all  our
people, no longer fractured by high, fortified walls  of  hatred,  fear  and
mistrust.

But this too, the transference of the burden of despair, became part of  the
reality that the new order had to address. It became part of what had to  be
done to achieve what President Mandela foretold  when  he  spoke  from  this
podium about the expansion of the frontiers of  human  fulfilment,  and  the
continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.

Almost 10 years after its liberation from white minority rule,  our  country
still faces many challenges. Many of our people are unemployed. Many of  our
people continue to live in poverty. Violence against the person in  all  its
forms continues to plague especially those sections of our  population  that
are poor and live in socially depressed communities.

The burden of disease impacting on our people, including AIDS, continues  to
be a matter of serious concern, as do issues that relate to  the  fact  that
many of our people, including the youth, lack the education and skills  that
our economy and society need.

There are still many of our people who live in shacks and  others  who  have
no access to clean water, proper sanitation and electricity. Imbalances  and
inequalities that impact on fellow citizens on the  basis  of  race,  gender
and geographic dispersal continue to persist.

In the 1994  state  of  the  nation  address  to  which  we  have  referred,
President Mandela said:


   We have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what  all  humanity
   should not do.

The point we have sought to make in the last few  minutes  in  referring  to
the challenges we continue to face, is that the blemishes  of  which  Madiba
spoke continue to disfigure our society. We have not as yet  eradicated  the
cruel legacy we inherited that he characterised as the  blemishes  that  all
humanity should avoid.

However, despite this reality, the answer we have given  and  will  continue
to give to the question whether we have made progress  with  regard  to  the
fundamental tasks of which Nelson  Mandela  spoke  on  24  May  1994,  is  a
resounding - yes!

Together with all other objective observers of social development,  we  have
always known that our  country's  blemishes  produced  by  more  than  three
centuries of colonialism and apartheid could not be removed in  one  decade.
Nevertheless, we have no hesitation  in  saying  that  we  have  made  great
advances to ensure the expansion of the frontiers of human  fulfilment,  and
the continuous extension  of  the  frontiers  of  freedom  of  which  Nelson
Mandela spoke almost 10 years ago.

The statistics and concrete information with  which  the  hon  members,  the
distinguished guests and our country are familiar, tell the  real  story  of
what we have done and had to do to create the  people-centred  society  that
has been central to the  work  of  both  our  first  and  second  democratic
Governments.

The real story is that before 1994:

  • Estimates of the housing backlog ranged from 1,4 million to  3  million
    units and people living in  shacks  were  between  5  million  and  7,7
    million;
  • 60% of the population had no access to electricity;

  • 16 million people had no access to clean water;

  • 22 million people did not have access to adequate sanitation;

  •  there  were  17   fragmented   departments   of   education   with   a
    disproportionate allocation of resources to white schools;

  • there was 70% secondary school enrolment.

A decade later:

  • About 1,9 million housing subsidies have been provided and 1,6  million
    houses built for the poor of our country;

  • more than 70% of households have been electrified;

  • 9 million additional people now have access to clean water;

  • 63% of households now have access to sanitation.

  • there has been  a  successful  formation  of  an  integrated  education
    system, even though there is a clear need for more resource  allocation
    and capacity building in poor areas;

  • nutrition and early childhood interventions have  been  established  to
    improve better results for children from poor backgrounds;

  • by 2002 secondary school enrolment had reached 85%.

Again, the real story of our country tells us that 10 years ago:

  • South Africa was in its 21st year of double-digit inflation;

  • the country had had three years of negative growth -  the  economy  and
    the wealth of the country were shrinking;

  • South Africa had experienced more than a decade of declining growth per
    capita - the average income of South Africans had  been  falling  since
    the 1980s and the overall wealth of the country declined by nearly  one
    third;

  • from 1985 to the middle of 1994, total net  capital  outflow  from  the
    country amounted to almost R50 billion.

  • Government had run up a budget  deficit  equal  to  9,5%  of  the  GDP,
    including the debt of the so-called independent homelands;

  • the net open forward position of the SA Reserve Bank was $25 billion in
    deficit;

  • public sector debt was equal to 64% of the GDP.

It is this unhealthy economic situation that led Chris  Stals  to  make  the
observations to which we have referred.

A decade later:

  • Inflation is down to 4% if you use the CPIX or less than 1% if you  use
    the CPI index. [Applause.]

  • the country is experiencing the longest period of  consistent  positive
    growth since the GDP was properly recorded in the 1940s. [Applause.]

  • the net open forward position of the  SA  Reserve  Bank  rose  to  $4,7
    billion in surplus by the end of last year. [Applause.]; and

  • public sector debt has come down to less than 50% of GDP.

[Applause.]

Since 2001 we have engaged our  people  in  the  various  provinces  in  the
process of Iimbizo, the 7th and latest being KwaZulu-Natal. By  these  means
we have sought to deepen the interaction  between  the  national  Government
and the masses of our people. The national ministers, provincial  and  local
governments have also carried out their own imbizo campaigns  for  the  same
reason.

We have just presented some of the statistics that tell part  of  the  story
of our progress during our first decade of freedom towards the  creation  of
a people-centred society. The imbizo  process  has  given  us  an  excellent
opportunity to hear directly from the people  what  these  figures  mean  to
them.

It has been truly inspiring  to  hear  directly  from  the  people  as  they
expressed  their  concerns,  communicated   their   aspirations   and   made
suggestions of what needs to be done to take us further forward to meet  the
needs of the people.

These masses, essentially, but not exclusively, the  poor  of  our  country,
invariably speak well of the improvements to  the  quality  of  their  lives
that have occurred during the past ten years. They talk about the  increased
access to better housing, water, electricity, roads, land, school meals  and
social grants.

But these masses are equally insistent about the need for all of us  to  act
together to address the outstanding challenges.  Regularly  they  raise  the
issue of the need for jobs and the need  to  provide  appropriate  training,
especially for the youth, to ensure that on completing their  school  years,
they are able to find employment. Like  others  of  our  rural  communities,
rural KwaZulu-Natal called on the Government to help with the  provision  of
tractors and seed to assist the people to till the soil.

The people have not  hesitated  to  make  frank  and  critical  assessments,
especially of the quality of service delivery in their localities,  as  well
as the performance of the municipal  councillors.  They  also  boldly  raise
other questions such as crime, health matters and instances of perceived  or
actual corruption and malpractice.

On Thursday last week we  were  at  Msinga  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  One  of  the
participants at the  imbizo  complained  that  though  people  had  cellular
phones in this rural and mountainous area,  they  could  not  use  them.  He
explained that this  was  because  the  cellular  phone  companies  had  not
erected the necessary masts.

The staff of  the  President's  Office  immediately  contacted  Vodacom  and
informed them of the complaint made at the imbizo. I am very pleased to  say
that two days ago one of the local leaders at Msinga called to say that  the
service providers had come to  the  area  within  hours  to  attend  to  the
complaint. [Applause.] In less than a week, the people of  Msinga  had  been
given the possibility to communicate among themselves and with the  rest  of
the country and the world by telephone. [Applause.]

We held our last imbizo in KwaZulu-Natal at Gamalakhe near Harding,  in  the
Ugu District  Municipality.  At  this  imbizo  a  local  resident  drew  our
attention to instances of  corruption  in  our  prisons.  He  then  gave  us
details of his experience of this corruption.

We have passed on these  details  to  Judge  Thabane  Jali,  who  heads  the
judicial commission investigating malpractices in our  correctional  system,
and who, I understand, is also present in the Chamber. Again  I  am  pleased
to say that within days  of  receiving  this  information,  Judge  Jali  has
already instructed  people  assisting  him  in  KwaZulu-Natal  to  meet  the
complainant and follow up on his allegations. [Applause.]

I mention these two instances because they  demonstrate  both  the  positive
response by the public and private sectors to the call we have made for  all
our people to work together in the spirit of letsema to  tackle  the  common
problems facing our country and people, and the  fact  that  the  Government
takes the imbizo process very seriously and tries at all  times  to  respond
to the issues raised by the people, within the context of  the  availability
of resources.

Again, I mention this because some in our country, for  reasons  best  known
to themselves, seem very keen to criticise the Government's response to  the
iimbizo on false grounds. [Interjections.] This happened recently when  ill-
informed allegations were made about commitments we made to  the  people  of
Bekkersdal in Gauteng.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Vodacom and  Judge  Jali
and express the hope that others will  follow  the  excellent  example  they
have set for all of us. [Applause.]

But perhaps more striking than everything we have  said  so  far  about  the
imbizo process has been the palpable sense of confidence  among  the  people
in a better future for their country  and  themselves.  This  goes  together
with the complete absence of any sense of distance or  alienation  from  the
Government they elected.

These masses attend the iimbizo confident  of  their  right  to  communicate
directly with their Government and certain that the  process  presents  them
with a  genuine  opportunity  to  have  their  concerns  addressed.  I  have
listened to our people boldly expressing their views even in areas that  not
so long ago were paralysed by the fear that  to  speak  one's  mind  was  to
invite death.

This has said to me that we have moved forward  most  significantly  towards
the realisation of the objective presented by Mr Mandela when  he  committed
us to the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.

Most of us present here will remember that not so long ago,  the  Government
and the state were to the masses of our people  public  enemy  no  1.  Then,
some thought that to advance the demand that the  people  shall  govern  was
mere rhetoric of politicians hungry for power. Institutions  that  were  the
cause of our despair have today become repositories of hope.

When we presented the state of the nation address to our  second  democratic
Parliament on 25 June 1999, we spoke of "the enormity of  the  challenge  we
face to succeed in creating the caring society we have spoken of."

We said:


  For this reason this is not a  task  that  can  be  carried  out  by  the
  Government alone. The challenge of the reconstruction and development  of
  our society into one which guarantees human dignity, faces  the  entirety
  of our people.


  It is a national task that calls for the mobilisation of the whole nation
  into united people's action,  into  a  partnership  with  Government  for
  progressive change and a better life for all,  for  a  common  effort  to
  build a winning nation.

I further said:


   The Government therefore commits itself to work in  a  close  partnership
   with all our people, inspired by the call "Faranani!" to ensure  that  we
   draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give  birth  to  something
   that will surely be new, good and beautiful.

The masses of our people, individuals and institutions, among whom today  we
cited Judge Jali and Vodacom, are responding magnificently to  the  call  we
repeat today and will repeat in future - Faranani!

In a few months' time we will return to these  Chambers  to  inaugurate  our
third democratic Parliament. Whoever will be President then ...  [Laughter.]
... will deliver yet another state of the nation address.  [Applause.]  That
will provide an opportunity to address  the  more  detailed  issues  on  the
Government's programme as well as  matters  that  will  be  covered  in  the
Budget speech and the Medium-Term Revenue and Expenditure perspectives  that
will support the Government's actions  as  our  country  begins  its  second
decade of democracy.
Today  we  present   the   longer-term   perspective   for   the   continued
transformation of our country that will and must be based on  our  country's
achievements during its first decade of liberation. In this regard we  would
like to restate this matter unequivocally, that the policies we required  to
translate what President Mandela said in May 1994 are firmly in place.

Accordingly, we do not foresee that there will  be  any  need  for  new  and
major policy initiatives. The task we will all face during the decade  ahead
will be to ensure the vigorous implementation of these  policies  to  create
the winning people-centred society of which Nelson Mandela spoke.

If I may say  this,  creating  that  winning  nation  must  include  greatly
improved organisation,  management  and  performance  by  all  the  national
teams, Bafana Bafana, the Springboks, the Proteas and our  athletics  teams.
[Applause.]

The work we will do must move our country  forward  decisively  towards  the
eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country. We must  achieve
further and visible advances with regard to the improvement of  the  quality
of life  of  all  our  people,  affecting  many  critical  areas  of  social
existence,  including  health,  safety  and  security,  moral  regeneration,
social cohesion, opening the doors of  culture  and  learning  to  all,  and
sport and recreation.

We  will  have  to  score  new  victories  in  the  struggle  to  create  an
egalitarian society, successfully addressing  the  important  challenges  of
persisting racial and gender inequalities, the disempowerment of  our  youth
and people with disabilities, and proper care for children and the elderly.

We must ensure that our country and people are  properly  positioned  within
the global community of nations, fully understanding and responding  to  the
diverse political, economic, social  and  technological  challenges  of  the
process of globalisation. In this regard, we will have  to  persist  in  the
work we are doing towards the regeneration of Africa  and  the  construction
of a new and more equitable world order.

The advances we must record demand that we ensure  that  the  public  sector
discharges its responsibilities to our people as a critical  player  in  the
process of the growth, reconstruction and development  of  our  country.  In
particular this will require that we further strengthen our system of  local
government and ensure that the system of traditional  government  plays  the
role ascribed to it in our Constitution and legislation.

We must achieve greater progress with  regard  to  the  integration  of  our
system of governance, achieving seamless co-operation both within and  among
all spheres of government. At the same time,  we  must  further  consolidate
the  practice  of  creating   public-private   partnerships   and   building
government-civil  society  co-operation,  to  ensure  that  we  utilise  our
collective capacities to give further impetus  to  the  overall  development
and transformation of our country.

With regard to the public sector, I would like to take this  opportunity  to
salute and thank especially the cadre of public sector managers and  leaders
that has emerged over the last decade, many of whom  are  with  us  in  this
Chamber. [Applause.] The work they have done and are doing has  placed  them
at the very forefront of the historic processes that are giving birth  to  a
new society.

I have no hesitation in  saying  that  they  stand  tall  even  among  their
counterparts elsewhere in the world. [Applause.] We will  continue  to  rely
on them to lead the state and parastatal machinery as we  break  new  ground
towards the creation of a people-centred society.

As we enter our second decade of liberation, we must continue to  build  the
sense of national unity, united action and  the  new  patriotism  that  have
manifested themselves in our people's response  to  the  calls  -  faranani,
masakhane, letsema  and  vukuzenzele!  Working  together  in  conditions  of
entrenched democracy, respect for human  rights,  peace  and  stability,  we
must continue to produce the good news that has made our country a place  of
hope, even for other people in the rest of the world. [Applause.]

We already  have  the  policies  and  programmes  that  will  enable  us  to
translate all the strategic  objectives  we  have  just  spoken  of  into  a
material factor in achieving the goals of the expansion of the frontiers  of
human fulfilment, and the continuous extension of the frontiers  of  freedom
of which Nelson Mandela spoke a decade ago.

We have already identified the challenges posed by the second economy,
which economy constitutes the structural manifestation of poverty,
underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country. We must therefore move
vigorously to implement all the programmes on which we have agreed to
ensure that we extricate all our people from the social conditions that
spell loss of human dignity.

These include the  Urban  Renewal  and  Rural  Development  programmes;  the
Expanded Public Works Programme; the  expansion  of  microcredit  and  small
enterprises; the provision of adult basic education and modern  skills;  and
the development of the social and economic infrastructure.

This will also help  us  enormously  to  achieve  the  goals  of  nonracism,
nonsexism, balanced urban-rural development and social cohesion.

At the same time, we must continue to focus on the growth,  development  and
modernisation of the first economy, to generate the resources without  which
it will not be possible to confront the challenges of  the  second  economy.
This  is  going  to   require   further   and   significant   infrastructure
investments; skills  development;  scientific  and  technological  research;
development  and  expansion   of   the   knowledge   economy;   growth   and
modernisation of the manufacturing and service sectors;  deeper  penetration
of global markets by our products;  increasing  our  savings  levels;  black
economic  empowerment  and  the  further  expansion  of  small  and   medium
enterprises.

We will have to  focus  on  the  implementation  of  the  measures  we  have
identified to ensure that we achieve better value for  the  money  spent  on
social delivery. Among other things, our successes with regard to  both  the
first and second economies must create the conditions for us to  reduce  the
numbers of our people dependent on social grants.

This will increase the resources available for social  expenditures  focused
on investing in  our  people  further  to  empower  them  to  become  better
activists for reconstruction  and  development,  away  from  trapping  large
numbers within the paradigm of poverty alleviation.

We will also have to ensure that the  institutions  and  processes  we  have
established  and  instituted  to  give  effect  to  the  constitutional  and
practical requirement for co-operative governance function  effectively.  We
must also focus especially  on  raising  skills  levels  within  the  public
sector and ensure its managerial and technological modernisation, driven  by
a clear understanding of the developmental tasks of our democratic state.

We must be impatient with those in the Public Service who see themselves as
pen-pushers and guardians of rubber stamps ... [Laughter.] [Applause.] ...
thieves intent on self-enrichment; bureaucrats who think they have a right
to ignore the vision of Batho Pele, who come to work as late as possible,
work as little as possible and knock off as early as possible. [Applause.]

We have also established institutions and processes to give  effect  to  our
shared desire to mobilise all our people  voluntarily  to  act  together  to
achieve the tasks of reconstruction  and  development.  Quite  clearly,  the
sustained calls for all of us to respond to a new patriotism have  struck  a
chord among all our people, black and white, with the exception of the  most
selfish and self-centred among us. [Applause.]

Needless to say, the further translation of the vision of  faranani  into  a
powerful motive force for progressive change can  only  be  achieved  within
the context of  democratic,  popular  and  open  participation  of  all  our
people, black and white, in determining our shared destiny.
In this regard, I notice that the traditional doomsayers are back  at  their
favourite sport of trying to frighten us with scarecrows.  Seemingly,  these
have not achieved the maturity of a Rian Malan. Instead, they  are  painting
monstrous pictures of impending violence during  the  forthcoming  elections
and radical constitutional amendments  after  the  elections,  by  the  very
people who drafted this constitution. [Applause.]

The masses  of  our  people  sacrificed  everything  to  achieve  peace  and
democracy for all  of  us.  These  masses  will  not  allow  that  desperate
politicians do desperate things to  win  or  retain  power  for  themselves.
[Applause.]

We are all perfectly aware of the  tasks  of  the  African  Renaissance,  or
should be. Together we have worked very hard to  ensure  that  we  make  the
necessary  progress  with  the  challenges  of  the  regeneration   of   our
continent. At the same time, we still have to contribute as much as  we  can
to the common African effort to strengthen such institutions  as  SADC,  the
African  Union  and  Nepad,  and  help  ensure  that  they  discharge  their
responsibilities effectively. We must do this work driven by the  conviction
that we will not allow anything to stand in our way towards the building  of
a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Africa.

In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the  officers,  the  men  and
women of the SA National Defence Force, who are doing sterling work to  help
advance the cause of democracy and peace in various parts of our  continent.
[Applause.] The new equipment they are receiving will  give  them  increased
capacity to meet this and other obligations. [Applause.]

Other regions of the world, including  the  most  developed  countries,  are
hard at work to change their neighbourhoods for  the  better.  We  can  only
ignore or minimise this task with regard to  ourselves  at  our  own  peril,
driven by a lingering sense that we are not an integral part of the  African
continent. This we will not do.

All major current international developments  emphasise  the  importance  of
constructing a new world order that is more equitable and responsive to  the
needs of the poor of the world, who constitute the overwhelming majority  of
humanity.

The Iraq affair; the continuing and painful conflict  involving  Israel  and
Palestine; the WTO failure at Cancun; the seeming  paralysis  around  issues
relating  to  the  democratisation  of  the  UN   and   other   multilateral
institutions; the dissonance between the  process  of  globalisation  and  a
multilateral system of governance; the  issue  of  global  terrorism  -  all
these matters underline  the  importance  of  moving  forward  significantly
towards the building of the new world order that has been spoken  of  for  a
long time already. We must stand ready to play our part in  addressing  this
urgent challenge, in our own interest.

During our second decade of liberation we will ensure that Freedom  Park  is
built and completed, together with other legacy projects that celebrate  our
humanity, our commitment to the all-round emancipation of all  human  beings
and to human dignity.

A decade ago, Nelson Mandela said:


   The acid test of the legitimacy  of  the  programmes  we  elaborate,  the
   Government institutions we create and the legislation we  adopt  must  be
   whether they help to create a people-centred society,  the  expansion  of
   the frontiers of human fulfilment, and the continuous  extension  of  the
   frontiers of freedom.

As we progress to the celebration of our  first  decade  of  liberation  and
democracy, I trust that the  national,  provincial  and  local  legislatures
will give themselves the opportunity to answer  the  question  whether  they
have passed this acid test.

What I will say is  that  during  this  first  decade  we  have  made  great
progress towards the achievement of the goals we enunciated as we  took  the
first steps as a newborn child. We also laid a strong  foundation  to  score
even greater advances during the  exciting  and  challenging  second  decade
ahead of us, as a people united to build a better South Africa and a  better
world.

When he contemplated the advent of the end  of  the  20th  century  and  the
beginning of the 21st, the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda, wrote in The Men:


  The era's beginning: are these ruined shacks,
  these poor schools, these people still in rags and tatters,
  this cloddish insecurity of my poor families,
  is all this the day? The century's beginning, the golden door?

We have it within our power to build our own golden  door  into  our  second
decade of liberation. We have demonstrated that we have the will  to  answer
the question in the affirmative, and say: Yes, this is the day!

I thank you very much. [Applause.]
