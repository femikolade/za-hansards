                   THE CRUEL KILLING OF MR NELSON SHISANE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its deep sense of shock and sadness  at  the  circumstances
       surrounding the death of Nelson Shisane;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  Mr Shisane is alleged to have been thrown into a lion  enclosure
           by four people at a farm near Hoedspruit in Limpopo; and


       (b)  crimes of this nature are not only in violation of our  criminal
           laws, but are also in direct conflict with our Bill of Rights in
           respect of guarantees of the right  to  life  and  freedom,  and
           security of the person; and


  (3) calls upon all South  Africans  to  be  tolerant  and  respect  human
       rights.

Agreed to.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No other motions without notice?
Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I think you did ask if there were any  members'
motions and it happened so quickly that Ms Kalyan  never  had  a  chance  to
respond. May I ask that she puts the motion to the House?

The DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  Hon  member,  I  actually  gave  her  an  opportunity.
[Interjections.] What happened?

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, as you can  hear  from  the  member's  response
behind me, the hon Ms Kalyan did stand up but you did  not  really  look  at
her. It happened very quickly.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ms Kalyan, did you stand up?

Ms S V KALYAN: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: All right. I  will  give  you  an  opportunity  to  give
notice of a motion.

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Ms S V KALYAN: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I hereby give notice that  I  shall
move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with serious concern that the Hon Minister of Health  will  not
       join her departmental officials  in  meeting  with  a  delegation  of
       dissatisfied doctors to discuss the problems in  the  health  sector;
       and


  (2) therefore resolves to call on the Hon Minister to stop  running  away
       from the problems caused by her Draconian policies,  and  to  resolve
       them in the interest of health care in our country.

         ILLEGAL SMUGGLING OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS INTO SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms O R KASIENYANE: Madam Speaker, South Africa is still confronted with  the
problem of the illegal smuggling of  counterfeit  products  of  questionable
quality into the country.

It should be noted that the illegal smuggling of cheap products  robs  South
Africa of much-needed revenue which  is  critical  for  the  eradication  of
poverty.

We need to strengthen our border and port control  measures  and  vigorously
support the Proudly South African campaign.

[Deputy Speaker, it is surprising how these people cross our borders. It  is
important  to  have  co-operation  between  the  national   Government   and
municipalities to conduct investigations about these people. They should  be
arrested  because  this  is  leading  to  the  collapse  of   our   people's
businesses. Criminals are the ones who now own  businesses.  Our  people  no
longer have businesses. Thank you.]

            BY-ELECTION RESULTS OF LADYSMITH MUNICIPALITY REFLECT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs G M BORMAN  (DA):  Madam  Speaker,  yesterday  the  DA  triumphed  in  a
municipal by-election fought in the New NP's former stronghold of  Ladysmith
in KwaZulu-Natal. The DA won 446 votes to the 227 votes casted for  the  New
NP-ANC alliance candidate. The vacancy occurred when  a  New  NP  councillor
resigned,  rather  than  accept  his  party   leadership's   decision   that
incorporated the ANC into running of the municipality.
This DA victory comes as the general election campaign gets  under  way  and
it shows that former New NP supporters are choosing the DA  to  bring  about
real change. Of even broader significance is the fact that  the  ANC  openly
canvassed on behalf of the New NP and encouraged their people  to  vote  for
their former apartheid bosses. Almost two thirds of the votes cast  for  the
New NP were from ANC supporters.

This by-election shows that the voters are sick and tired of  the  duplicity
of the New NP and that they reject its  relationship  with  the  ANC.  These
voters agree that South Africa deserves better. [Applause.]

        PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE HON DR BUTHELEZI BY THE HON DR JORDAN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP  Caucus  today  discussed
the uncalled-for attack on our leader by the hon Pallo Jordan in  the  House
the day before yesterday. We unanimously regard the attack  as  being  on  a
personal level; solely aimed at embarrassing Minister Buthelezi, and not  in
line with the ANC's usual courteous style. It is  apparently  not  supported
by the leadership in the ANC.

Minister Buthelezi has faithfully carried the burden for  this  country  for
longer than half a century and he will continue to  do  so,  long  after  Mr
Jordan has disappeared from the political scene. [Applause.]

            TASK TEAM SET UP BY MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N V CINDI: Madam Speaker, the ANC welcomes the task team set  up  by  the
Minister for  Safety  and  Security  to  investigate  the  suspected  serial
killing of women in Dinukana Village in  Zeerust,  North-West  province.  We
commend the Minister's prompt action in the spirit  of  partnership  against
crime. We appeal to the community of Dinukana to co-operate and  assist  the
police and task team with their investigation.

The ANC believes that  the  people's  contract  to  create  work  and  fight
poverty also requires the  strengthening  of  the  partnership  between  the
police and the communities to create safe  neighbourhoods.  We  support  the
ANC Government's efforts aimed at  creating  safe  and  secure  communities.
[Applause.]

                       COALITION OF THE IFP AND THE DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mev ANNA VAN WYK (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Speaker, wanneer  Suid-Afrikaners  op
14 April gaan stem, moet hulle partye beoordeel op grond van hoe goed  hulle
kan regeer en nie hoeveel beloftes hulle  maak  nie.  Die  Wes-Kaap  is  die
provinsie in die land met die beste regering. Dis nie ek wat so sê nie.  Dis
die mense van Suid-Afrika wat so sê. Nou vra 'n  mens  jouself  af  wat  die
verskil is tussen die Wes-Kaap en ander provinsies.  Die  antwoord  is  baie
eenvoudig: Die Nuwe NP maak 'n verskil. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die IVP en DA het in die debat oor die President se staatsrede baie  kritiek
gelewer op die hantering van MIV/Vigs. Wat moeilik  is  om  te  verstaan  is
waarom is die Wes-Kaap, daar waar die Nuwe  NP  en  ANC  regeer,  myle  voor
KwaZulu-Natal  met  die  behandeling  van  die  siekte  met  antiretrovirale
middels? En dit is nie ons wat so sê nie. Dis die Treatment Action  Campaign
wat so sê.

Die desperate koalisie van verandering tussen die IVP en die DA is  aan  die
bewind in KwaZulu-Natal, maar hoe goed gaan dit waar hierdie  party  regeer?
Die KwaZulu-Natal regering stuur vanjaar af op oorbesteding van meer  as  R2
miljard, sowat dubbeld die skuld in 1999 wat die nasionale Regering  gedwing
het om in te gryp en beheer oor die KZN-administrasie oor te neem.  Ook  die
Kaapstadse Stadsraad is nou weer besig om kop bo water te kry nadat  die  DA
sy geldsake vernietig het tydens 'n baie kort tydperk  toe  hulle  daar  aan
die bewind was. Wat is die gemene deler in albei hierdie sake?  Dit  is  die
DA wat deel van die Regering geword het ...  [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK (New NP): Madam Speaker, when South Africans  go  to  vote
on 14 April, they should judge parties on the basis of  how  well  they  can
govern and not on how many promises they  make.  The  Western  Cape  is  the
province with the best government in the country. It is not I who say  this.
It is the people of South Africa who say this. Now  one  asks  oneself  what
the difference between the Western Cape and other provinces is.  The  answer
is very simple: The new NP makes a difference. [Interjections.]

During the debate on the President's state of the  nation  address  the  IFP
and the DA were very critical  about  the  handling  of  HIV/Aids.  What  is
difficult to understand is why the Western Cape, where the New  NP  and  ANC
govern, is miles ahead of  KwaZulu-Natal  regarding  the  treatment  of  the
disease with anti-retroviral remedies. And it is not we who say this. It  is
the Treatment Action Campaign that says this.

The desperate coalition of change between the IFP and the  DA  is  governing
in KwaZulu-Natal, but how well is it going where this  party  is  governing?
This year the government of KwaZulu-Natal is  heading  for  overspending  of
more than R2 billion, approximately twice as much as the debt in 1999  which
forced the national Government to intervene and take  over  control  of  the
KZN administration. The Cape Town City Council is also  once  again  getting
its head above water after the DA ruined its financial  affairs  in  a  very
short period when they were governing there. What is the common  denominator
in both of these cases? It is the DA that became part of the Government  ...

       INAPPROPRIATE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES AND TREATMENT FOR HIV/AIDS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the escalating crime and the  scourge  of
HIV/Aids, alleviating poverty  and  unemployment,  addressing  land  issues,
improving education and restoring family values are the main  focus  of  the
African Christian Democratic  Party's  2004  election  manifesto  launch  in
Parliament today.

The primary function of Government is to  protect  the  lives,  liberty  and
property of its citizens and the ACDP's  tough  policies  on  crime  send  a
clear message that criminals must be held  accountable  for  their  actions.
Education is also a priority and the  ACDP  committed  itself  to  providing
quality value-based education and establishing the central role  of  parents
in the education of children.

The issue of land and housing was addressed and  the  ACDP  emphasised  that
land acquisition in South Africa must be based on  a  principle  of  willing
buyer, willing seller.

With more than 600 Aids-related deaths in South Africa  per  day,  the  ACDP
criticised  Government   for   inappropriate   preventative   measures   and
inadequate treatment. The ACDP believes that  moral  denegeration  in  South
Africa is a direct result of certain Government laws and policies,  such  as
the   legalisation   of   abortion,   the   acknowledgement   of    same-sex
relationships,  the  legalisation  of  pornography  and  gambling,  explicit
sexual education in schools and access to  contraception  and  abortion  for
children without parental consent. We will pursue all legal  means  possible
to protect the right to life for the elderly, the  infirm,  the  unborn  and
the disabled. We will strive to ensure that our children enjoy the  benefits
of growing up in a safe and secure environment ... [Time expired.]

                 URBAN RENEWAL PROJECTS IN THE EASTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M P MENTOR (ANC): Madam Deputy  Speaker,  the  urban-renewal  and  rural-
development projects of the presidential nodal  points  currently  unfolding
in Galeshewe, Kgalagadi, Alexandra, Winterveldt, KwaMashu  and  other  parts
of the Eastern Cape have brought joy  to  South  Africans  living  in  these
areas. These efforts  are  progressively  improving  living  conditions  and
environments,  pushing  back  further  poverty  and  squalor.   The   people
celebrate this delivery, singing joyously, saying, ``Today is a  bright  day
but tomorrow will be even better.'' With their dignity being restored,  they
renew their schools, build their roads in  townships,  villages  and  remote
rural areas and reconstruct our infrastructure. As we do  all  these  things
together with the people, we see that our despair has turned into  hope  and
our future is bright, because the ANC lives and the ANC leads. [Applause.]

                           DROP-OUT RATE OF PUPILS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G T MADIKIZA  (UDM):  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  UDM  is  shocked  and
dismayed by the fact that a large number of pupils in the country  drop  out
of school at a very young age. Official statistics show  that  one  in  five
pupils nationally drop out before they reach Grade 3. If pupils continue  to
drop out in this early phase of education, it means that the  Department  of
Education is sowing seeds that will haunt this country  for  many  years  to
come. These shocking figures give urgency to the  national  policy  of  free
and commensurate education until Grade 9. The UDM calls on the  Minister  of
Education to thoroughly investigate this  high  drop-out  rate.  We  suspect
that educators are not properly  trained  to  implement  the  outcomes-based
education curriculum. Poverty and HIV/Aids  presumably  also  contribute  to
this drop out. The mere fact that in the Eastern Cape Province alone 40%  of
pupils drop out before  reaching  Grade  3  clearly  shows  that  the  South
African education system is failing the poorest  in  the  country.  The  UDM
calls for a bigger education budget to improve  teacher  training,  increase
teachers' salaries and improve its infrastructure. Thank you.

                        PASSING AWAY OF BILLY PRINCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms H M MPAKA (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the passing away  of  stage  personality
and comedian Billy Prince last week robbed South Africa of one of  her  most
talented artists. Prince, who grew up  in  an  orphanage,  having  lost  his
father as a toddler and seeing his mother for the first time when he was  an
adult in his 30s, died  at  Chris  Hani  Baragwanath  Hospital  after  being
involved in car accident in November last year.

He was a comedian of note, fluent in 11 languages and  a  regular  guest  on
the TV programme Maak 'n Las. We salute Prince  who,  despite  his  deprived
background, provided endless pleasure to audiences throughout  South  Africa
and rose to become a role model and a shining star. We  urge  our  youth  to
take a leaf out  of  this  exemplary  life  of  hope  and  courage,  and  to
persevere in their studies so that they will in future lead this country  in
a  people's  contract  to  create  work  and  fight  poverty.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]

  ALLEGATIONS OF ARMS DEAL AND IRAQI OIL FUNDING FOR ANC ELECTION CAMPAIGN
                            (Member's Statement)

Ms R TALJAARD (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, colleagues, in recent days  former
ANC MP Andrew Feinstein has restated that two key ANC  NEC  members  alleged
that the ANC received election  funding  from  arms-deal  contractors.  This
follows calls in Sweden  in  November  last  year  for  a  formal  probe  of
allegations that the ANC received US$35 million to  secure  the  JAS  Gripen
contract.

Furthermore,  recent  reports  have  highlighted  worrying  visits  by   ANC
heavyweights Kgalema Motlanthe and Mendi Msimang to pre-war Iraq and  placed
the cosy relationship between the  ANC  and  former  Iraqi  dictator  Saddam
Hussein squarely under suspicion under the banner of the oil-for-diplomatic-
patronage scandal.

This House must  express  its  disapproval  of  the  unavailability  of  the
Minister of Foreign Affairs during  question  time  today  to  answer  these
allegations before the South African people. And we must call on the ANC  to
reassure the voters and this Chamber  that  its  election  campaign  is  not
being bankrolled by either crude-oil cash from the Baathist group  or  arms-
deal cash. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                  FRAUD AND CORRUPTION IN BARBERTON PRISON

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Deputy Speaker, it is with great concern  that  we  note
the grave incidence of fraud, corruption and  intimidation  that  occurs  at
the Barberton Prison Farm. The  illegal  practice  of  warders,  who  accept
bribes from families  of  inmates  to  secure  the  early  parole  of  these
inmates, is unacceptable.

Seven alleged syndicate members, four prison officials, a prisoner  and  two
civilians have been arrested  and  appeared  on  charges  relating  to  this
crime. The Department of Correctional Services must be commended  for  their
action in setting up a task team to investigate the syndicate. It  is  hoped
that all those arrested will be shown the full might of  the  law  and  that
all prisoners released  as  a  result  of  this  corrupt  practice  will  be
rearrested and face supplementary charges. I thank you. [Applause.]

                       DA ATTITUDE TOWARDS AFRIKANERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr W A ODENDAAL (Nuwe NP):  Mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  verskeie  politieke
partye vry tans erg na die Afrikaanssprekende stem. Dit is  nie  verniet  so
nie, want ons gáán van Suid-Afrika 'n sukses help maak!

Die bedenklike wyse  waarop  die  DA  Afrikaners  van  alle  rassegroepe  as
stemvee probeer misbruik, steek ons egter dwars in die  krop.  Kyk  maar  na
hul kandidatelyste. Afrikaners is goed genoeg om DA te stem, maar nie om DA-
parlementslede te word nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Nog erger is die  vernederende
wyse waarop die DA-leier van 'n geliefde Afrikanerleier, mnr F W  de  Klerk,
praat. Om hom as 'n verraaier en 'n rugsteker uit te kryt gaan sleg  by  ons
af. [Tussenwerpsels.]

As dit die minagting is waarmee die DA van Afrikanerhelde  praat,  dink  net
wat sê hulle agter ons rug van ons gewone Afrikaners! [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die
mees arrogante van alles is die neerbuigende wyse  waarop  die  DA-hoofsweep
sy leier as die ware Afrikaner-ikoon in ons kele wil  afdruk.  Verbeel  jou:
ou Kleintoonikoon! Afrikaners laat nie met hulle ploeg nie! (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, various  political  parties
are at present trying hard to get the Afrikaans-speaking vote.  There  is  a
good reason for this, because we are going to help make a success  of  South
Africa!

However, what we find most offensive is the alarming way in which the DA  is
trying to abuse Afrikaners of all race groups as voting cattle. Take a  look
at their candidate lists. Afrikaners are good enough to vote DA, but not  to
become  DA  members  of  Parliament.  [Interjections.]  Even  worse  is  the
humiliating way in which the DA leader  speaks  about  a  beloved  Afrikaner
leader, Mr F W de Klerk. We  do  not  appreciate  his  being  branded  as  a
traitor. [Interjections.]

If that is the contempt with which the  DA  talks  about  Afrikaner  heroes,
just imagine  what  they  say  behind  the  backs  of  ordinary  Afrikaners!
[Interjections.] The most arrogant of all is the condescending way in  which
the DA Chief Whip wants to impress upon us  that  his  leader  is  the  true
Afrikaner icon! Imagine: Old ``Kleintoon'' icon!  Afrikaners  do  not  allow
themselves to be used!]

                            STDs AMONG TEENAGERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP): Madam Deputy Speaker, at the  Public  Health  Conference
in Washington DC in December 2003, doctors cited evidence of an epidemic  of
sexually transmitted diseases among the teenagers of all nations  and  cited
safe-sex programmes ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I rise on a point of order?  Is  one
member allowed to have two statements in one afternoon? I don't  think  that
the rules allow for that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, is it possible  for  your  statement  to  be
made by another member of the ACDP?

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker,  at  the  Public  Health  Conference  in
Washington DC in December 2003 doctors cited  evidence  of  an  epidemic  of
sexually transmitted diseases among the teenagers of all nations  and  cited
safe sex programmes and condom distributions as contributing factors of  the
problem.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I rise on a point of order?  Is  one
member allowed to repeat what another member has already said? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon  member,  please  allow  the  ACDP  to  make  their
statement.

Mr S N SWART: Thank you for the assistance, Chief Whip of the  DA.  Many  of
these STDs cannot be cured, leading to long-term health problems,  including
infertility and even cancer. Ninety-five percent of all  cases  of  cervical
cancer are associated with HPV infection, yet teenagers continue to  be  the
most targeted group for the safe-sex message, which advocates condom use  to
prevent the spread of STDs, including  HIV.  According  to  groups  such  as
Planned Parenthood and Love Life, safer sex allows couples to  reduce  their
sexual health risks. New statistics and  studies,  however,  have  concluded
that condom usage have also increased STDs amongst teenagers.

The popular claim, therefore, that condoms help prevent the spread  of  STDs
is not supported by the data, as condom usage  increases  the  incidence  of
STDs. I thank you.

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO ANC COUNCILLOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  ANC  would  like  to
congratulate the councillor  who  achieved  an  overwhelming  victory  in  a
Gugulethu by-election yesterday in Ward 42. We wish to note  that  only  one
other party was brave enough to contest the ANC in this ward  and  that  was
the PAC and  congratulate  our  new  councillor  for  the  overwhelming  86%
majority. [Applause.]

                   VALUE-BASED EDUCATION AND SEX EDUCATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Hon Deputy Speaker, there were two different  and
discrete interventions on education. In response to the  ACDP,  we  on  this
side look forward to the details concerning  your  quality  and  value-based
education. We regret to note, of course, that  until  now  your  value-based
education has largely been anti-life and certainly contrary to  the  general
assumptions of the National Curriculum Statement.

What we must remember, the ACDP and this House,  is  that  the  Constitution
says two things in relation to rights. The  first  is  absolute  equality  -
political equality, equality in terms of voting, the  right  to  leave  your
country. We know this absolute equality - it is what we fought for.

The other part of the Constitution that the ACDP refuses to  accept  is  the
absolute right to be different from one another.  What  the  Government  has
said, with the overwhelming support of this House, is that  women  have  the
right to choose. We are not compelling anyone to have an abortion,  it's  an
available facility. It's antihuman and undemocratic to say women should  not
have the right to choose while men  have  the  right  to  choose.  The  same
applies to books - the absolute right of people to  choose  the  books  they
want to read. It's a right to  be  different.  You  may  have  a  particular
inclination to only read books on creationism; other people  want  to  learn
about evolution too. So, it goes down the line of what we on  this  side  of
the House are trying to do in this democratic society  -  absolute  equality
in all areas and the absolute right to be different.

I think the ACDP must learn that lesson and not go  on  a  provocative  tour
across the country and say that the ANC Government is doing this  and  that.
I don't understand the issue around this  explicit  sex  education.  I  have
asked the ACDP for information as to where this explicit  sex  education  is
occurring. What we are trying to do is to  have  education  on  sexuality  -
that is a different thing altogether. And this is the only  way  to  protect
women, for example. Part of this whole design is the right of women  to  say
no, and for men to understand their own responsibilities in this  situation.
That is pro-life.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon  member,  your  two  minutes  for  the  first
response has expired.
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you very much. [Applause.]

             ARTICLE FROM NEWSPAPER AND MORE MONEY FOR EDUCATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Speaker,  this  response  relates  to  the
other statement by the UDM. I regret to say that  the  UDM  will  come  back
with fewer members of Parliament after the 27th - if this is  an  indication
of your capacity to bring a statement here. You have lifted, word for  word,
an article from page two of This Day. Frankly, I think it  is  an  abuse  of
the process of this House. I've ordered  an  investigation  into  this.  The
document is incomplete, and there is no statistical basis  on  which  I  can
come to a conclusion.  Nobody  has  told  me  about  the  research,  because
newspapers are full of so-called statements of that type.  Members  must  be
informed - it's not worth the candle to bring  questions  here  based  on  a
newspaper article that has not been verified.

Regarding the other question, it shows that the UDM is unqualified to be  in
Government - absolutely. [Laughter.] More money? Seventy-four  billion  rand
for education - where do you find more  money?  What  we  want  is  for  the
quality to be there. The fact is that the provinces are  doing  their  work,
for which they are allocated  over  R60 billion  -  that's  the  fundamental
issue - and we've all helped to do that.

And, of course, there is this nonsense about bigger salaries  for  teachers.
You have to work out that three years ago 90% of the  Education  budget  was
spent on salaries. We've brought it down now to 83%, so  we  have  17%  more
money to spend on facilities for the  running  of  schools.  That's  how  we
should do it, and we are  going  to  give  performance-related  payments  to
teachers, particularly to teachers who  don't  want  to  be  principals  and
administrators. They want to be bloody good ... sorry  ...  [Laughter.]  ...
they want to be good teachers. [Laughter.] And  we  will  pay  them  on  the
basis of performance-related activities  in  schools.  That's  why  the  UDM
should learn a bit more about education policy and then they might get  more
than four or five members of Parliament after 27 April. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mind your language, hon Minister. Hon Nqakula, I  expect
you want to respond?

       CONTRABAND GOODS; MURDER INVESTIGATIONS; DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: I want to respond, Deputy Speaker,  to
the three statements  by  the  hon  members  Kasienyane,  Cindi  and  Mentor
respectively.

There have been many instances, and I am sure many of the members are  aware
of this, in which the police have confiscated  a  lot  of  contraband  items
that have come into South Africa by way  of  a  dumping  process.  This  has
bedevilled our situation for quite some time. I do wish  to  say  to  people
that it will help tremendously if they informed the police  when  they  come
across such goods, because it is not right that items  and  commodities  are
dumped on our soil; it  is  not  right  that  contraband  comes  across  our
borders into our country. Our people should assist so  that  we  can  handle
this situation.

The matter of the various murders in Dinokana is a very serious matter.  But
I'm sure hon members have also noted that these days our investigations  are
prompt and yield results very quickly. We've had situations in which  crimes
have been committed  and  within  a  matter  of  days  the  police,  through
intelligence-driven  investigations,   have   apprehended   the   criminals.
Dinokana is one of those instances in which there was a rapid  investigation
followed by the apprehension of criminals.

Hon Mentor referred to our programme  of  development,  which  is  part  and
parcel of the developmental state that we are building as the ANC  in  South
Africa. Indeed, various programmes have been established in various  centres
of our country. What many of those programmes do  is  that  they  contribute
towards crime prevention, because these are programmes that respond  to  our
urban renewal  and  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programmes,
which  assist  in  fighting  poverty  and  thereby  also  in  removing   the
conditions that create the possibilities for crimes to be  committed.  I  am
certain that our Government, as  it  indeed  accelerates  the  programme  to
establish more centres that will benefit from our  developmental  programme,
will also reduce crimes in which poverty has acted as  a  cause.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any more ministerial responses?

                            BARBERTON FARM PRISON

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you, Madam Speaker. First,  let
me thank the hon member, Mr Bloem, for raising  the  Barberton  Farm  Prison
issue. I must say that, yes, regarding the  war  on  corruption,  I  believe
it's a front on which we need to intensify our efforts very much, and it  is
something we should face squarely in our prisons and within our  society.  I
think that is why we have put in place the special investigation  units  and
the task teams, and also the judicial commission of inquiry,  to  deal  with
these issues.

However, we should  also  bear  in  mind  that  we  should  keep  things  in
perspective when it comes the old and the new. Some of the things  that  are
coming out are old things, because some of these things have  been  embedded
in the prison system for many years, and it will take many  more  years  for
us to eradicate that type of practice.

I think members should also look at the prison system and remind  yourselves
that prisoners - rapists, murderers, thieves and  drug  pushers  -  are  not
born in prison and they are not born on Jupiter  or  Mars.  They  come  from
within our societies. Now, how do we prevent this from  happening?  Even  in
our societies, clearly, they are not born as rapists, murderers or  thieves.
They are the spawn of the badlands. How do we prevent  that  from  happening
with this influx into the institutions?

When they get into the institutions, the prison facilities, rapists  do  not
stop their practice when they go through the prison gates or  prison  doors.
The influence, the element and the psyche is still there. The  murderer  and
the gang leader do not stop their practice simply  because  they  are  going
through the gates of a prison.

So, those elements are still there and they try to assert themselves  within
the institutions, and then we find that our  prisons  officials  are  facing
things which they were not even trained to deal with. I think  we  ought  to
bear that in mind.

                          COMMUNAL LAND RIGHTS BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy  Speaker,
three times in my youth I attended speeches by Dr Verwoerd. I'm  sure  there
are members here - I can see at least two or so - who  had  to  suffer  more
than that in their lives; I'm sure Mr Colin Eglin listened to him a lot.

He had an almost hypnotic way of speaking, with his high-pitched voice.  The
reason it was almost hypnotic was that he  always  tried  to  give  a  moral
basis or justification for what he  was  doing  and  proposing  and  talking
about. His whole idea was  that  he  would  sell  the  apartheid  system  by
presenting it as a system of fair emancipation.
Yesterday I looked at some old books. I found a book  that  was  part  of  a
prize I got after matric, ``nogal'', as Prof Kader  Asmal  always  says.  It
had the title Die Apartheidsgedagte. It was very interesting to  look  at  a
book from those days today. It contains quotes, for example, from Dr  Malan.
Let me read this one for you. Dr Malan said:


  The difference in colour, as the most evident racial  difference,  became
  tantamount to a difference between one way of life and  another,  between
  barbarism and civilisation, between heathenism and Christianity. ... This
  colour consciousness remains as active as ever; it has become a tradition
  into which almost every white child is born, an indivisible part  of  his
  mental make-up.

So, you must understand that it is with great humility that I  stand  before
you today, honoured to have had the opportunity to make a contribution  -  a
small one - to tearing out the heart of apartheid, which we are doing  today
with this Bill. It is simply a debt that I owe to all.
You know what Verwoerd did - a masterstroke in an evil sense -  was  to  add
to the  1913  and  1936  Land  Acts,  once  he  got  them,  the  1951  Black
Authorities Act and also the 1959 Promotion  of  Self-Government  Act.  That
was one way in which he wanted to give a moral  basis  to  whatever  he  was
selling. What he did was  to  integrate  the  political  and  constitutional
aspects of his policies with land administration.

That was the key to understanding why  this  was  the  heart  of  apartheid,
because grand apartheid was built on that basis.  There  was  nothing  wrong
with traditional authorities as such. What was wrong was the  way  in  which
apartheid used the traditional leadership,  in  conjunction  with  the  land
question, to make it a building block of grand apartheid.

The key was that the apartheid state remained in ultimate control  of  these
traditional lands. The ownership remained with  the  state.  It  was  state-
owned land.  Even  later,  when  some  of  the  land  was  held  by  the  SA
Development Trust, the state never divested  itself  of  dominium.  That  is
what we must address before we can say that we are tearing out the heart  of
apartheid in that sense.

That is why the land question lies at the core  of  the  problems  in  South
Africa. That is also why when the  Government  now  comes  with  a  balanced
approach towards land administration, we stick to the rule of  law.  We  do,
however, expect that both from the extreme left as well as from the  extreme
right we will get attacks on  the  land  reform  programme.  Just  today  in
Pretoria, Dr Philip du  Toit  presented  or  launched  his  book,  which  is
actually quite an unscientific study, quite spurious, and there  are  racist
undertones in it. His basic message is: Blacks can't farm. That is the  type
of attack which we can expect from the right wing.

Now, you can't have any development without empowerment, and there  will  be
no empowerment without asset empowerment,  and  you  won't  have  any  asset
empowerment without security of land tenure. We already  said  that  in  the
Reconstruction and Development Programme. I can give  you  this  quote  from
the RDP:
  The land policy must ensure security of tenure for  all  South  Africans,
  regardless of their system of land-holding. It must remove all  forms  of
  discrimination in women's access to land.

In another part of the  RDP  document  it  says  that  the  Government  must
support the development of new and  innovative  forms  of  tenure,  such  as
community land trusts and other forms of group land holding.

In June 1999 Minister Thoko Didiza concluded that the  policy  direction  of
the then Communal Land Rights Bill was,  in  fact,  a  continuation  of  the
model adopted by the apartheid  government.  It  was  a  continuation  of  a
bifurcated state. That model was based on the continued state  ownership  of
communal land and the continuation of the status quo.

What we simply do with this Bill is to  provide  a  system  and  to  provide
administrative structures to transfer communal land to  communities  and  to
make it possible to acquire individual title or  full  ownership  -  exactly
what we said in the RDP.

The Communal Land Rights Bill responds directly  to  what  the  Constitution
provides, which demands from us to obtain security of land for those  people
whose title in land is  legally  insecure  as  a  result  of  past  racially
discriminatory laws or practices.  It  enables  communities  to  become  the
architects of their destiny  on  the  land  that  bears  the  scars  of  the
forefathers, the scars of being dumped in the homelands and  left  to  their
own devices to survive.

One of the most important provisions of this Bill is to give effect  to  the
constitutional entitlement to secure tenure to a person, including a  woman.
The Bill also confers the right of ownership of land on women in  their  own
right. The reported perception that the Bill maintains and even  exaggerates
the second-class treatment of women has no foundation at all  when  examined
and analysed against the provisions of the Bill.

Secondly, the criticism to the effect that  the  Bill  confers  second-class
status on a woman is baseless. The  Bill  goes  so  far  as  to  state  that
regardless of marital status, customary  law,  practice  or  usage,  or  any
other law, a woman has an equal right to land in the same way as a man.

Further to this, the Bill entrenches the principle of  women  representation
in institutions that deal with the welfare of the  community,  such  as  the
land administration committees and land rights boards. At least a  third  of
the total membership of the land  administration  committees  and  the  land
rights boards must be women. This does not,  of  course,  detract  from  the
fact that the community can elect more women to serve on such institutions.

Women form the backbone of our communities, and most of  them  are  also  de
facto household heads. It is exactly for this reason that  we  are  ensuring
that women have secure tenure on the land on which they work and reside.

Let me just refer to chapter 7 of  the  Bill,  which  deals  with  the  land
administration system. What we tried to do was to draft it  in  such  a  way
that it struck a balance between community norms and traditions on  the  one
hand, and our democratic ethos and practices on the  other  hand.  There  is
simply no way that anyone with a sane mind can wish away the institution  of
traditional leadership, which is so  inextricably  linked  to  the  people's
social, cultural, economic and political milieu.

The need to  strike  a  balance  between  the  recognition  of  customs  and
traditions on the one hand, and the democratic ethos on the other hand,  has
been recognised, also in the recent  judgment  of  the  Land  Claims  Court,
which said: ``The conflict must be resolved by legislation. It  is  not  for
the courts to do so.''

It is not our intention nor  duty  to  dictate  how  traditional  leadership
should govern. The task which we have as the Ministry and the department  is
merely to provide a framework as to how a traditional council, when it  acts
as a land administration committee, must conduct its  business  with  regard
to the land owned by that community - a fair balance. You know that  in  the
ANC manifesto, one sentence for the elections says  it  all.  It  says  that
what we want to do is to fully  integrate  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership into democratic governance and development, and that  is  exactly
what this Bill is doing.

In the process of the administration of the Bill, the Bill  makes  provision
for two types of communities: on the one hand, a traditional  community  or,
on the other hand, a nontraditional community. This is in  order  to  ensure
that those who do not regard  themselves  as  a  traditional  community  are
still able to administer their land in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
this Bill.

It is imperative for us to note  that  the  powers  and  duties  of  a  land
administration committee are subject to  a  well-regulated  system  in  this
Bill. For example, clause 19 deals with community rules that will be  vetted
by  the  Department  of  Land  Affairs  to  make  them  compliant  with  the
Constitution and the Bill. Those rules will  then  provide  the  ideological
and legal basis for the administration of communal land,  or,  for  example,
clause 24(1) says  that  the  land  administration  committee  represents  a
community - it is the representative of a community - owning  communal  land
and it has the powers and duties, as conferred  by  this  Act,  and  by  the
rules of that community.

The land administration  committee,  in  other  words,  is  an  organ  of  a
community as such. In  its  administration  of  communal  land,  it  has  to
function within the rules of the community and  the  prescriptions  of  this
Bill.

We are therefore calling for a realistic  and  purposeful  -  one  can  say,
pragmatic or eclectic - approach to the administration of communal  land  in
a traditional community. The Bill provides this pragmatic approach  to  land
administration by bringing customs and traditions  and  a  democratic  ethos
and practice to coexist in a symbiotic relationship with each other.

The land we are talking about is still registered in the name of the  state,
or held in trust by the Minister for the benefit of the rightful owners.  By
divesting the state of ownership of the land in question, the Bill  confirms
the rightful ownership, as should have been the case all the  time,  in  the
hands of the community.

So, to put it simply: We give the land to the people. The  state  gives  the
land to the people to whom it has belonged since ancient times,  or  from  a
long time ago, as it should always have been.

The provision of security of tenure for millions of people living  in  these
communal areas is the crux of the Bill. We are talking about an  area  about
four times the size of the Netherlands, with perhaps more  than  13  million
people living there. We hope this will be the start of development,  because
you cannot have development,  you  cannot  have  a  system  of  empowerment,
without secure tenure of land.

There is provision in the Bill for comparable redress, which  is  absolutely
necessary. We say in the Bill that the Minister may, on application  by  the
holder of an old-order right which is insecure and cannot  be  made  legally
secure, determine an award of comparable redress to such  a  holder.  Again,
here, we respond to the call of the Constitution to ensure that  our  people
on the ground not only have security of tenure but also access  to  land  on
an equitable basis. Hence, the importance  of  such  comparable  redress  in
helping to deal with the legacies of the past in land ownership patterns.

Within the framework of this Bill, we can solve  the  central  problem  with
regard to the land question in traditional areas. I do not say that it  will
be an easy task. It will be a difficult and complicated task. It  will  need
the utmost willpower of the Government  to  follow  this  task  through,  to
implement this Bill in a way that will not create conflict. I'm sure we  are
capable of doing that, and we will create the capacity to do that.

Let me just say this, which is the message I have today:  It  is  abundantly
clear that the national Government has lived up to its promises  to  provide
forms of ownership that accommodate different choices. The intention  is  to
provide people with a range of options from which they can choose, and  also
to design the system to be flexible enough to accommodate change over time.

Let me just say thanks to a few people - firstly, to Vuyo  Nxane,  the  head
of that branch of the Department of Land Affairs; a special word  of  thanks
to Dr Sibanda, the thinker; and to Colin Brocker, the lawyer. Thanks  go  to
the chairperson of the portfolio committee, the hon  member  Neo  Masithela,
and to all the portfolio committee members for enriching the  discussion.  I
must also say thank you to our extraparliamentary opposition, who also  gave
us a lot to think about and we used many of their ideas.

We are using the terms in this Bill of ``old-order rights'' and  ``new-order
rights''. Antonio Gramsci, in one of  his  letters  from  prison,  said  the
following ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has long since expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Okay.  Thank  you,
Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Deputy Speaker, according to section 25 (5)  and  (6)
of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,  this  Bill  seeks  to:
Firstly,  recognise  and  formalise  the  African  traditional   system   of
communally held land within the  framework  provided  by  the  Constitution;
secondly, legally secure land  tenure  rights  of  communities  and  people,
including women, the disabled and the youth  within  the  tenure  system  of
their choice. Therefore, the  DA  supports  the  Bill.  This  Bill  is  long
overdue.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to focus a little on a matter  raised  by
the Director-General for Land Affairs in our portfolio  committee  meetings,
which was a matter of concern. Can the Deputy Minister tell  this  House  if
the department is about to include racial classifications  on  title  deeds;
if so, it raises the question: Will the department reinstate  the  notorious
pencil test to establish people's race?

Dr Gilinqwe Mayende, Director-General for Land Affairs, told  the  portfolio
committee on 4 April 2003 that racial classifications,  which  were  removed
from title deeds in 1996, would be  included  again.  Clearly,  somebody  is
going bananas in that department.

This is another example of the Government's insistence on the use of  racial
quotas to inform everything from employment practices to the composition  of
sports teams and now private land ownership.

The ANC's obsession  with  race  is  disconcertingly  similar  to  apartheid
thinking. The reason given - that this information will be  used  to  assist
in land reform - is vague and could in truth imply anything.

Dr Verwoerd and the former NP  government  also  used  a  myriad  reasonable
justifications to rationalise racial classification. Determining race  is  a
murky issue at best, and  it  becomes  more  so  as  South  African  society
becomes increasingly integrated.

One also wonders what Government plans to do with this information. Will  it
be used, in the long run, to influence national policy, or  will  it  impact
on individual land deals by  private  citizens?  Is  Big  Brother  watching?
While acknowledging that a great deal still has to be done  to  correct  the
past injustices, employing mechanisms used by the former oppressors  is  not
the way to go. Ga se tsona. [It is not the way to go.]

Can the Minister  account  for  the  Chief  Land  Claims  Commissioner  Tozi
Gwanya's  statement  of  5  February  2003  that  said  the  Government   is
considering opening a six-month window period for the Eastern Cape?  Such  a
move would be nothing more than an election manoeuvre  to  try  and  appease
people in the Transkei and Ciskei. Extension cannot be granted  because  the
land restitution legislation stipulates that the window period  has  already
passed.

It would be highly problematic  to  single  out  one  province  for  special
treatment. People in other provinces who had  missed  out  on  the  deadline
would definitely have grounds to challenge the constitutionality of  such  a
move. If two million  people  in  the  Eastern  Cape  lost  out  because  of
bureaucratic bungling on the part of the  Government,  then  the  Government
has a case to answer,  and  those  people  should  be  encouraged  to  claim
against the state for its maladministration.

Madam Deputy Speaker, we are told that land restitution is to  be  completed
by the year 2005. Can the Deputy Minister inform this  House  how  that  can
possibly be when it is  known,  to  the  DA,  that  numerous  claims  remain
unresolved in Limpopo and Eastern Cape? This was through  no  fault  of  the
claimants, but were not  finalised  due  to  bureaucratic  bungling  by  the
Department of Land Affairs, resulting in the  affected  communities  missing
the window-period deadline.

In the case of the Limpopo Province, which has six municipal  districts  and
about 5 000 claims, 40% of those claims are only at the  research  stage  to
verify legitimacy. This  is  mainly  because  of  the  commission's  ad  hoc
staffing and losses  of  staff  members  to  greener  pastures  due  to  the
insecure status of the Land Rights Commission.

At best they process and complete three claims minimum  per  annum.  How  on
earth are they expected to complete 5 000 claims in  18  months?  Where  are
those resources going to come from? One  example  is  a  claim  in  Tzaneen,
Mamatlola, which cost the department R47 million. What if out of the  5  000
remaining claims, 100 of them are valued at a similar price of R47  million?
Can the Minister explain where those resources are going to  come  from  and
where such capacity to deal with business of that magnitude comes from?  So,
the notion that land restitution will  be  complete  in  the  year  2005  is
nothing but an electioneering ploy.

In the case of the Eastern Cape,  members  of  the  Keiskammahoek  community
were promised payment of R55 000 per household as a result of  their  forced
removal from Theresa Farm. However, through  some  convincing  cohesion  ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

MR D K MALULEKE: Thank you. South Africa deserves the best. [Applause.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Madam Speaker, I was rising on a point of order. This  is  a
debate on the Communal Land Rights Bill. I heard  the  hon  member  speaking
about land restitution and other  such  matters.  He  didn't  appear  to  be
addressing the issue of the Communal Land Rights Bill at all. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Maybe you will be pleased to know that he is through.

Mr N H MASITHELA: The debate today is  about  what  I  regard  as  the  most
transformatory legislation ever in South Africa, after the  passage  of  the
Constitution of this country, namely the Communal  Land  Rights  Bill.  This
Bill will contribute  to  changing  the  land  ownership  patterns  in  this
country. For the first time in the history of South  Africa,  people  living
in the former homelands will no longer feel like outsiders in this  country.
They will also have a right to occupy land and will be full  owners  of  the
land they use and occupy.

Deputy Speaker, allow me to briefly take the House through what people  went
through. From the time when the white  settlers  arrived  in  South  Africa,
black people were pushed off their land. Land  dispossession  of  the  black
population was driven by the need to reduce competition with  white  farmers
and to create a pool of migrant cheap labour on the farms and in the  mines.


The Native Land Act of 1913 was the main nail to the land  dispossession  of
black people by the apartheid government. I cannot agree more with the  then
Secretary General of the ANC, Sol Plaatje, when he said the Native Land  Act
of 1913 was ``the start of a deliberate and  systematic  framework  to  deny
black South Africans their birthright''.

Through  that  Act,  black  people  could  only  reside  in  areas  reserved
exclusively for them, which later became homelands where  only  13%  of  the
land was available to black people. This meant that 70% of the  total  South
African population who lived in the former homelands was allocated only  13%
of South African land, while the minority whites occupied  the  largest  and
best portions of land that was suitable for both farming and housing.

What this meant was that our people were just pushed into overcrowded  areas
where they even struggled to produce food for their  survival.  These  areas
were characterised by severe poverty and isolation from economic growth  and
developmental opportunities. It is the lack of clarity about the  status  of
land rights in  these  communal  areas  that  inhibits  development  in  the
communities.

Even though black people occupied and used the land  for  many  years,  they
were not allowed to register them in their own names. Instead  most  of  the
land in these areas was registered in the name of the state  as  state  land
or registered as being held by a trust in the name of the  Minister  or  the
Ingonyama Trust, in the case of KwaZulu-Natal.

As a result of the lack of clarity on the status  of  land  rights  and  the
breakdown of the land administration system in the former homelands,  people
who occupied land were sometimes pushed around  and  dispossessed  of  their
land to allow investors to come  in  and  develop  their  land  without  the
owners benefiting  from  it.  Thus  a  legislative  intervention  is  needed
urgently to clarify and secure the land rights of people who occupy and  use
the land to facilitate development in these areas that will benefit them.

People are asking: How will the rural people benefit  from  the  passage  of
this Bill? Let me briefly deal with this matter. This Bill,  for  the  first
time, is going to give people living in the communal  areas  an  opportunity
to own land like any South African. It will put  an  end  to  discrimination
towards people living in former homelands or rural areas.  It  is  going  to
secure tenure rights to communities and individuals living in  these  areas.
The land will no longer be registered in the name of the state, Minister  or
the Ingonyama Trust in KwaZulu-Natal.

At the moment, land tenure rights available to  people  living  in  communal
areas are largely based on customary law  or  on  insecure  permits  granted
under the laws that were applied  to  African  people  only,  for  instance,
permission to occupy. These rights do not have legal status and  holders  of
such rights  cannot  use  them  as  security  in  banks  to  get  loans  for
development in the particular areas.

This Bill seeks to reverse the historical legacy of colonial  apartheid  and
strengthen the land tenure rights of the people  living  in  these  communal
areas. This Bill also gives the rural people a chance to decide on how  they
want land to be administered. As the ANC we  do  not  just  decide  for  the
people, as the previous government did; what we do, if we are to decide,  is
that we consult our people. That's what the ANC believes in.

For the first time, people in the communal areas are given  an  opportunity,
through this Bill, to decide whether they want their land to  be  registered
in the name of communities, households,  families  or  individuals  in  full
ownership.

Furthermore, communities are also given a choice  to  decide  on  how  their
land has to  be  administered  because  they  are  the  people  who  develop
community rules that will serve as guidelines for  the  land  administration
committees.  The  communities  are  given  rights  to   establish   a   land
administration committee in a democratic fashion to  manage  and  administer
communal land in their areas. The communities will  also  have  a  right  to
reject the land administration committee process if it does not  qualify  to
deal with matters that benefit them.

This Bill goes further to  protect  the  land  tenure  rights  of  the  most
vulnerable  groups  in  our  society,   like   women   and   children-headed
households. It also ensures  that  these  groups  participate  in  decision-
making processes in  both  the  boards  and  the  traditional  councils.  My
colleagues in all political parties, but specifically  from  the  ANC,  will
deal with this matter intensively to  disprove  the  argument  that  women's
rights are not protected.

For the first time in the history of this country, the people of the  former
homelands will be able to hold their title deeds with  dignity  as  rightful
owners of the land they occupy or use. It is with pride  that  I  note  that
the registration of land tenure rights in the name of  the  communities  and
individuals  will  provide  an  enabling   environment   for   socioeconomic
development in communal areas, and the  participation  of  our  people  will
actually be taken care of.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I had never seen such a crowd of people. When we  were
dealing with the  public  hearings,  we  had  more  than  32  organisations,
including statutory bodies, academic  institutions  doing  research  on  the
land issues,  community  organisations  and  NGOs,  and  interested  parties
representing workers, women and traditional leaders presenting their views.

We had public hearings for approximately four days. They started very  early
in the morning and ended very late  in  the  evening  and  we  ensured  that
everybody participated in these public hearings, including people  who  were
not scheduled to address the committee.

During  the  public  hearings,  most  important  issues  were  raised.   The
complaint that the department did not consult was also  an  issue  that  was
dealt with. However, regarding this point, we are convinced that  the  final
submission presented to the committee was the twelfth version  of  the  Bill
because that Bill went through the process of consultation  for  about  nine
years. As a committee, we asked the  department  to  give  us  the  list  of
people who were consulted; the list is endless.

We are convinced that most of the people in  this  country  were  consulted.
We, further, gave everybody a  chance  to  present  the  matter  before  the
committee so that we could take their views and opinions on board.  On  this
topic, let me  thank  the  communities  who  participated  in  this  matter.
Because of them, we are able to present this Bill before this  House  today.
The amendment that was made was because of  the  contribution  made  by  the
public.

Let me briefly touch on issues that were raised during the public  hearings.
The main issue that was raised concerned the discretionary powers  given  to
the Minister for Agriculture and  Land  Affairs  to  determine  whether  the
rights of holders of old-order rights are to  be  converted  into  new-order
rights, and the context and the extent of such rights. It  was  argued  that
it is unconstitutional to give these  rights  to  the  Minister  because  we
don't  have  guidelines  that  dictate  how  the  Minister  should   operate
regarding this matter. However, this committee did acknowledge  this  point,
conceded on that matter and amended the Bill.

It is also important to note that, regarding  every  Bill  that  deals  with
land reform, the powers of the Minister have been  under  serious  scrutiny.
What people fail to realise and understand is that like any other  Minister,
the Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  would  not  execute  her
responsibilities outside  the  confinements  of  the  Constitution  of  this
country. As a committee, we sought advice  about  the  constitutionality  of
the  Bill.  Legal  advisers  from  Parliament  told  us  that  the  Bill  is
constitutional, hence we present this Bill before Parliament today.

The second main issue raised was that  the  Bill  did  not  protect  women's
rights. There is no way that the ANC would actually allow  the  Bill  to  go
through  without  taking  women's  rights  into  cognisance.  I'm  happy  to
announce and report today  that  that  gap  in  the  Bill  was  successfully
amended. As we speak today, women's rights are enshrined  in  this  Bill.  I
will not deal with this  matter  extensively  because  the  hon  member  who
represents the ANC will elaborate on this issue. However, what  I  think  is
important for people to  understand  is  that  women's  rights  are  already
enshrined in the Constitution of this  country.  The  Constitution  of  this
country takes precedence over any other legislation.

A third issue raised is around  the  composition  of  traditional  councils.
Most of the critics said that  there  was  no  way  we  could  allocate  the
administration of land to the traditional leaders because  they  were  prone
to corruption, abuse their power and so forth.  I  am  convinced  that  this
matter has been handled efficiently.

However, it is important to clarify to the  public  that  in  terms  of  the
composition of traditional councils, the Bill before the House  today  could
not be amended by the committee because it was not  under  the  jurisdiction
of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land  Affairs.  It  was  under
the  jurisdiction   of   the   committee   on   local   government   because
``composition'' in the  Bill  comes  from  the  Traditional  Leadership  and
Governance  Framework  Bill,  which  provides   that   at   least   30%   of
representatives who participate  in  these  councils  should  be  women.  It
further suggests that at least 40% of the people  who  will  participate  in
these  should  be  democratically  elected  and  the  remainder  should   be
appointed  by  traditional  leaders.  People  should  also  understand  that
traditional leaders would appoint people from their communities.  Therefore,
it's not going to be predominantly traditional leaders  on  that  particular
board or council.

Before I sit down, I would like to, on behalf of the committee, commend  the
Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs and the Ministry  in  particular,
because this Bill would not have been where it is today had they not  played
a pivotal role.

Let me conclude by saying that through  this  Bill,  the  dignity  of  black
people in communal areas will be restored; through this  Bill,  people  will
be proud owners of the land they occupy and use; through this  Bill,  people
will have title deeds as legal documents to show  their  rightful  ownership
of communal land - and no one will take that right away from  them;  through
this Bill, no more black  people  will  be  treated  as  outsiders  in  this
country, particularly in the land of  their  ancestors;  and,  through  this
Bill, the ANC has delivered a major piece of legislation that  benefits  all
South Africans,  especially  the  rural  poor  and  traditional  leaders  in
particular.
People need to understand that traditional leaders  have  played  a  pivotal
role in land administration in the past. Democracy should  not  in  any  way
undermine their  culture  but  should  be  used  to  develop  this  cultural
institution and to make sure  that  they  are  accountable  to  the  people.
President Thabo Mbeki put it very nicely when he said, and I  quote,  ``This
Bill  will  not  undermine  communal  relations  and  elements  of   culture
consistent with democracy and human rights.''

The ANC understands that the role  played  by  communities  and  traditional
leaders in the past is very important to  our  society.  The  role  that  we
played was to democratise traditional councils. In our opinion, as the  ANC,
we think this is the right step in  democratising  the  traditional  council
institutions.

This shows that the ANC, despite the many obstacles faced in  ensuring  that
our people get security of tenure in their communities  and  the  imbalances
of the past are redressed, will not stop but continue  to  ensure  that  the
rights of women, children, the disabled  and  traditional  leaders  are  not
trampled upon. Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr  M  V  NGEMA:  Deputy  Speaker,  the  IFP  wishes  to  congratulate   the
traditional leaders of our land for standing together yet  again  to  defend
what belongs to the indigenous people of this country. It is this  unity  of
traditional leaders that enables the hon iNkosi S P Holomisa to speak as  he
did in the article published in the Business Day of yesterday, for which  he
and all amakhosi of our land get a big hallelujah from the IFP.

For centuries, Africa and her children have been denied the right to  define
to the rest of the world who she is, where she comes from, where she is  now
and where  she  is  going.  In  South  Africa,  the  indigenous  people  saw
themselves defined according to the agenda of those who conquered and  ruled
over them. The right of the African  majority  of  this  country  to  define
themselves with their institutions of  culture  and  governance  became  the
centre of the liberation struggle. The defence of this right was  the  basis
and core foundation of the liberation struggle even before 1912.

It is ironic that at Codesa the IFP found  itself  alone  in  this  historic
mission when it called  for  a  clear  and  unequivocal  definition  in  our
Constitution of how our indigenous institutions would be  promoted  as  part
of  our  democratic  future.  It  is  against  this  background   that   the
traditional leaders, as a form of  self-governance  in  this  country,  were
quite amazed by the onslaught they were subjected to when  local  government
and  powers  of  municipalities  were  imposed  through  an  Act   of   this
Parliament.

The earlier drafts of the Communal Land Rights  Bill  reflect  the  original
thinking of the ANC regarding traditional communities and  their  governance
structures. This is in line with its standpoint on local  government,  which
sought to eliminate  any  semblance  of  an  indigenous  form  of  democracy
inherent to a way of life in traditional communities.

Thus, the IFP celebrates and welcomes the change of heart  on  the  part  of
the ANC. This enables both of these parties  to  agree  on  this  particular
Bill,  after  opposing  each  other  on  the  content  of  the   Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill. The  IFP,  therefore,  appreciates
the improvements effected in the Bill  after  the  hon  Minister  negotiated
with traditional leaders in this country.

The  sensitivity  and  understanding  on  the  part  of   the   Cabinet   is
demonstrated and shows a marked difference between  the  Bill  as  presented
before Parliament today and that draft of 2001.  However,  the  Bill  to  be
passed today still falls far short in restoring pride and a sense  of  value
necessary to form the foundation of a democratic state.

As much as one swallow does not make a summer, so  do  the  actions  of  one
President of Zimbabwe, which is a democratic state, not mean that  democracy
must be thrown away. In a  similar  fashion,  corrupt  practices  by  a  few
isolated traditional leaders should not be used  as  a  pretext  to  condemn
what is our way of life. It is known  in  African  languages  that  ``Inkosi
iyinkosi ngabantu.'' [A chief is a chief because of the people.]

Allowed the freedom to  flourish,  the  traditional  way  of  life  has  its
internal checks and  balances  to  sort  out  and  rid  itself  of  negative
elements. The serious flaw in the thinking of the critics of  this  Bill  in
its current form is that whether they be university academics  or  analysts,
they either come from other cultural backgrounds or they are too  young  and
uninformed to understand what they criticise. In their book,  these  critics
see  any  concept  of  governance  other  than  the  western  democracy   as
undemocratic and primitive.

In African culture, any form of abuse against  women  and  children  is  not
allowed. Certain changes have been made in the Bill to strengthen  both  the
participation and protection of women and the  interests  of  children.  The
Bill will unlock the potential of rural economic  development  as  it  gives
security of  tenure  to  communal  land.  Limited  protection  against  land
disposal through sale or otherwise is assured for the next 10 years only.

Iqembu  leNkatha  yeNkululeko  yeSizwe  likubona  kahle  ukuthi  izibonelelo
ezenziwe  uNqgongqoshe   nesigungu   sikaHulumeni   kulo   mThethosivivinywa
kaziyivimbeli  imbedumehlwana  yokunyundelwa  nokuhlakazwa  kohlelo  lomdabu
lwempilo, ikakhulukazi  ubukhosi.  Ngenxa  yokhetho  oluzayo,  ngomhlaka  14
April 2004, i-ANC kungenzeka ukuthi ibone kufanele  ukukhohlisa  imiphakathi
yomdabu namakhosi sengathi  iyalalela  okufunwa  yile  miphakathi  ngenhlalo
yayo. [Ubuwelewele.] Iqiniso ngukuthi emva -  ngisho  okubhalwe  lapha  kulo
mthetho - iqiniso ngukuthi emva kweminyaka eyishumi lo mthetho uvumela  noma
ubani  onobufakazi   bobuninimhlaba   ukuba   acele   imvume   kuNqgonqgoshe
yokwehluka ohlelweni okuqhutshwa ngalo kuleyo ndawo akuyo.  (Translation  of
Zulu paragraph follows.)

[The Inkatha Freedom Party could see very clearly that the  provisions  made
by the Minister and the Cabinet with regard to this Bill did not  prevent  a
very unpleasant situation where there is  bad-mouthing  and  dissolution  of
the  traditional  system,  and  of  traditional  leadership  in  particular.
Because of the election that is due on 14 April 2004, the  ANC  saw  fit  to
deceive traditional communities and leaders, as  if  it  were  listening  to
their social needs. [Interjections.]  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  -  I'm
talking about what is written in this Act - that after ten  years  this  Act
allows anybody who has a title deed to ask for permission from the  Minister
to divert from the system that is used in that particular place that  he  or
she lives in.]

The second hidden time bomb is  that  land  disposal  is  not  outlawed  but
merely delayed by a period of 10 years. The IFP takes  this  opportunity  to
assure rural communities and  their  traditional  leadership  that  it  will
attempt to firmly restore and secure power, to  put  the  control  of  their
lives back  in  their  own  hands,  and  not  in  the  hands  of  Government
officials. It is in this context that the IFP has been calling for the  land
rights boards to become more accountable to the  communities  they  will  be
serving, as opposed to these boards that are effectively tools in the  hands
of the Minister. This demand is no reflection on the current Minister.

This Bill is not going to be properly implemented in spite of the  hopes  it
raises. Its implementation is dependent on the success  or  failure  of  the
Traditional Leadership  and  Governance  Framework  Act,  which  establishes
traditional councils on the one  hand,  and  local  government  legislation,
which conflates the role and powers of traditional  leaders  with  those  of
municipalities on the other hand.

These two laws face enormous problems of implementation. The department  has
repeatedly been telling us that implementation of the Bill  depends  on  the
conclusion of the Commission  on  Restitution  of  Land  Rights,  which  the
President has ordered  to  be  completed  by  2005.  Given  the  backlog  in
finalising claims ... [Time expired.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Mhlalingaphambili,  zinkosi  eziphakathi  kwethu,  malungu
abekekileyo ale Ndlu yoWiso-mthetho, ingqungquthela yesizwe sama-Afrika,  i-
ANC,  iwuxhasa  ngaphandle  kwamathandabuzo,  iwamkela  ngazo  zozibini   lo
Mthetho uYilwayo ongaMalungelo kuMhlaba woLuntu, eneneni  kumhlaba  wezizwe,
iCommunal Land Rights Bill ngesilungu.

Eneneni i-ANC, njengombutho owalwela inkululeko  yeli  lizwe  nabantu  balo,
ayikwazi kwenza ngakumbi. Kaloku abaseki  bayo  yayiziingqondi,  izifundiswa
nabefundisi ababengamafanankosi, kanti ke neenkosi ngokwazo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
Eyam ikumkani, uDalindyebo ngokwakhe,  uBhexesh'  ilanga,  aliqal'  elwandle
aye kuliyeka eGqili, apho litshona khona, umfo kaNgangelizwe,


  Irhamb' elineendevu lakwaMtirara,
  Elabonwa ngabafazi bakwaMbanga bephangela.
  Ukhalakhulu lilumla abantwana. Yakhuph' iinkabi zeenkomo laa mhla wasekwa
  lo mbutho,
  Isithi: ama-Afrika mawatye,
  Angalambi ngemini yokuxoxa ngendlel' entsha yokulwelwa komhlaba.
  Watsho esithi, ngolo hlobo, uyalela bonke abaThembu
  Ukuba babe ngamalungu e-ANC. [Uwelewele.]

Ngaloo   mhla   zazikho   neenkosi   zelakwaMshweshwe,   ezintabeni,   kanti
nezakwaSobhuza,   kwelamaNgwane,   zazilapho.   Zazingasalanga   nezabaLozi,
kwelaseZambiya.  UDinuzulu,  isihlobo  sakulo  Dumehlezi  kaMenzi,   uMshay'
akashayeki,  ilembe  eleq'   amanye   amalembe   ngokukhalipha,   kwagqitywa
kwelokuba makawunike isidima lo mbutho  ngokuth'  abe  ngumongameli  wewonga
(honorary   president).   Kanti   ke    uMongameli    wokuqala,    umfundisi
uLangalibalele   Dube,   uMafukuzela,    yena    ngokwakhe    wayengumntwana
wasebukhosini kwisizwe samaQadi.

Lo Mthetho uYilwayo wenza  elawo  igalelo  ukubuyisela  isidima  sama-Afrika
nobukhosi bawo. Lo Mthetho uYilwayo  uthi:  yayingekho  kakade  into  yokuba
bathi  abelungu  bathi  basigcinela   umhlaba   wethu   ngokungathi   izizwe
zakokwethu  zingoontemekwane.  Ngolu  hlobo,  sifumana  ithuba   lokulungisa
umonakalo owenziwa ngoorhulumente babarhwaphilizi nabacinezeli,  ekutolikeni
imithetho namasiko omz' ontsundu ngendlel' engeyiyo.

Ngalo Mthetho uYilwayo, umhlaba  wesizwe  ngasinye  uza  kulawulwa  yikomiti
yolawulo-mhlaba, komiti leyo eza  kwenziwa  ziinkosi  apho  zikhoyo,  abantu
ezibaphetheyo abantu basetyhini, abakhubazekileyo,  abantwana  abaziinkedama
ezigcin' imizi  yakwamawazo,  ulutsha  nabadala.  Ikomiti  le,  khon'  ukuze
amalungelo  amakhosikazi  anganyhashwa,  iza  kuthi  ibe  nenkosikazi   enye
kumalungu  amathathu  (one-third).  Nabameli   besebe   lemihlaba,   bebhodi
yamalungelo   omhlaba,   bomphathiswa   wolimo   ephondweni,    bomphathiswa
woomasipala ephondweni naboomasipala waloo ndawo  umhlaba  lowo  ukuwo  baza
kuba nelungelo lokubakho kwiintlanganiso zekomiti  leyo  yolawulo  lomhlaba.
Ngubani  na  ke  ngoko  onokuthi  abemi  bomhlaba  baza  kuhleleleka?  Umntu
onokutsho ngulowo kuphela  uzixelele  ukuba  ama-Afrika  akakwazi  ukuphatha
izinto zawo ngeendlela zawo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Le komiti, kaloku, iza  kulawulwa  ngemigaqo  yoluntu,  ngokwamasiko  esizwe
eso,  kusetyenziswa  wona   lo   Mthetho   uYilwayo   kwaneminye   imithetho
efanelekileyo,  kwakunye  noMgaqo-siseko  weli   lizwe.   Ngokwesiko   lomz'
ontsundu, umhlaba wesizwe ngowabantu bonke nenkosi  yesizwe  sabo.  Umhlaba,
isizwe, inkosi, azohlulwa ezo  zinto.  Indoda  yokwenyani  ithi  xa  izazisa
kubantu   basemzini   ixele   ukuba   uyise   ngumthile,   unina    yintombi
yasemathileni, iphuma  ekuthini,  kwisizwe  sikankosi  ubani.  Ingawuxelanga
umlambo  esela  kuwo   nesibuso   senkosi   yayo,   ayigqibanga   ukuzazisa.
[Kwaqhwatywa.]

Umhlaba  lo  ke,  ngoko,  lilifa  lesizwe   ekuthi   ke   kufuneke   wabiwe,
usetyenziswe ngobunono. Awabelwa nabani na.  Kufuneka  kucace  kuqala  ukuba
unabantu abaxhomekeke kuwe, ukuze  babe  nekhaya,  bafumane  ukutya  nezinye
izinto zempilo. Indoda enomfazi iyaliphiwa inxiwa. Elo nxiwa  lelaloo  mfazi
nabantwana bakhe. Xa  iswelekile,  lilungelo  lakhe  umhlolokazi  nabantwana
ukuhlala kuloo mzi, bangahlutshwa mntu.

Umntu  othi  uyindlalifa  kamfi,  ngumsebenzi  wakhe  ukunonophela,  ukondla
nokukhulisa abantwana  bakamfi.  Izinto  zikamfi  azizizo  zendlalifa  ukuba
yenze ukuthanda  kwayo  ngazo.  Uthe  ke  umlungu  esakungenelela  kwintlalo
yomntu  ontsundu,  wayiguqula  impilo  yethu.  Wath'   umfazi   akanalungelo
kumhlaba womzi wakhe. Uthe xa ebhalisa amanxiwa kwimiqulu  yakhe,  wabhalisa
indoda yodwa, wamshiya ngaphandle oyena mnikazi wenxiwa,  umfazi  nabantwana
bakhe. Neenkundla  zakhe  ke,  umlungu,  ziwutolike  ngolo  hlobo  ungelulo,
umthetho  wamalungelo  omhlaba  nalowo  wamafa  ngokwesintu.  Silungisa  loo
manxele ke ngalo Mthetho uYilwayo. Bonke abanelungelo kwisiza nomhlaba  baza
kubhaliswa   kuxwebhu   lwamalungelo   omhlaba   khon'   ukuze    kungabikho
mathandabuzo nakuqhatheka.

Awuthengiseki ke umhlaba wesizwe, umthetho wawo.  [Uwelewele.]  Masikhumbule
ukuba  sithetha  ngesiqwentshana  nje  seshumi  elinesithathu  ekhulwini  xa
sithelekisa   nomhlaba   osezandleni   zegcuntswana   labamhlophe.    Nalowo
sisalindele ukuba wabelwe wonk' umntu, ngobulungisa. Kambe ke noko  kunjalo,
lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo  uthi  xa  ikomiti  yolawulo-mhlaba  ifumana  isicelo,
sisenziwa ngenjongo zokuba kubolekwe  imali  yemveliso  nophuhliso,  isicelo
eso ingasikhaba okanye isamkele. Xa isamkela isicelo esinjalo, ikomiti  leyo
isigqithisela kwibhodi yamalungelo omhlaba phambi kokuba  sibe  siphumelele.
Ngale  ndlela  sinqanda  abarhwaphilizi   ukuba   bangaxhaphazi   ubuhlwempu
babantu, ngokubafaka ematyaleni abangena kuphuma kuwo.

Ndiqinisekile ukuba izizwe, Madlokovu, neenkosi zazo ziya kuwuxhasa nazo  lo
Mthetho uYilwayo.  Lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo  uhamba  namaxesha  esiphila  kuwo,
amaxesha amalungelo oluntu ngohlobo lwasemzini, olugxininisa  lona  esiqwini
nangaphezulu  koluntu   jikelele.   Ukwahlonipha   imbali   yethu,   amasiko
nezithethe zobukhosi bomz' ontsundu. Akukho mntu  uqhathiweyo  kulo  Mthetho
uYilwayo.

Xa  kukwesi  sithuba,  mandiqaphule  malunga  neBhodi  yeNgonyama   yoMhlaba
kwaZulu-Natal. Le bhodi iza kuhlala ikho,  isebenza,  ichotshelwe  yikumkani
ngokwayo. Iza  kuthi  ke  lakuphela  ixesha  lamalungu  ayo  akhoyo  yakhiwe
ngokutsha, ngokwendlela yalo Mthetho  uYilwayo.  Le  bhodi  nayo  iza  kuthi
gqolo ukunikezela kwizizwe  zobuya  bukumkani  amalungelo  kwimihlaba  leyo,
njengoko kunjalo  kwezinye  iindawo,  ngokwalo  Mthetho  uYilwayo.  Ikumkani
yona,  uBhejan'   ephum'   esiqhiwini,   ukade   bekuvalele,   uya   kuhlala
engumhlalingaphambili webhodi leyo. Kuse kuhleni  ke,  ndiqinisekile,  ukuba
ekuhambeni  kwexesha,  naxa  sel'  usebenza  lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo,  nezinye
iikumkani zeli ziya kulungiselelwa indima ehambelana nesikhundla sazo.

Kwakhiw' ilizwe, mawethu. I-ANC isebenzela  ukuba  isizwe  soMzantsi  Afrika
sihambe sonke, kungabikho basala ngasemva. Ngoko ke, imithetho  efana  nalo,
siza kusoloko siyiphumeza ukuze kungabikho kukhwina kubhekele phi.  Njengoko
besele  nditshilo,  iimfuno,  iimfanelo   namalungelo   abo   bonke   abathe
bahleleleka ngexa langaphambili abuyiselwe  kwaye  akhuselwe  ngulo  mthetho
uYilwayo. Masiwuthembe, singabi nadyudyu, akukho  nto  ingaphaya.  Awenzelwa
voti. Sekukudala kakade zedlula  iintsuku  zokuphunyezwa  kwawo.  Iminyanya,
ndithembile, ixoliwe nayo. [Uwelewele.]

Besenditshilo  ndathi:  i-ANC,  ithambo   lenyoka   elihlab'   abayizondayo,
iyawuxhasa lo mthetho uYilwayo. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa  speech
follows.)

[Adv S P HOLOMISA: Hon Chairperson, traditional leaders among us today,  hon
Members of the National Assembly, the African  Union,  the  ANC  undoubtedly
supports and welcomes with both hands the Communal Land Rights Bill.

The ANC, as an organisation that fought for the freedom of this country  and
its people, could not avoid this moment. We should bear  in  mind  that  its
founders were very intelligent, learned people and priests, while some  were
traditional leaders. [Applause.] My own king, King Dalindyebo,  is  the  one
who leads the sun from the sea up to the Orange River  where  it  sets.  The
son of Ngangelizwe.


  Irhamb'elineendevu lakwaMtirara,
  Elabonwa ngabafazi bakwaMbanga bephangela.
  Ukhalakhulu lilumla abantwana.
  Yakhuph'iinkabi zeenkomo laa mhla wasekwa lo mbutho,
  Isithi ama-Afrika mawatye,
  Angalambi ngemini yokuxoxa ngendlel' entsha yokulwelwa  komhlaba.  Watsho
  esithi ngolo hlobo uyalela bonke abaThembu
  Ukuba babe ngamalungu e-ANC. [Praise song for King Dalindyebo.]
[Interjections.]

On that day, traditional leaders from the royal family of Moshoeshoe, up  in
the mountains, were present,  as  well  as  those  from  the  Sobhuza  royal
family, the  Ngwane.  The  Lozi  royal  family  from  Zambia  did  not  deny
themselves  that  opportunity.  Dinuzulu,  a  relative  of  the  family   of
Dumehlezi   kaMenzi,   uMashay'akayishayeki,   ilembe    eleq'amany'amalembe
ngokukhalipha, was chosen as honorary president of  this  organisation.  The
first president of the ANC, Rev Langalibalele Dube, Mafukuzela, was  himself
born of the royal family from the Qadi house.

The objective of this Bill is to restore the dignity of the African  people.
Its aim is to prove that what the white oppressors did  -  taking  our  land
and justifying it by saying that they were going to look after it for us  as
if we were small children - was stupid. In  this  way,  we  are  getting  an
opportunity to correct the wrong and fix the damage that  was  caused  by  a
corrupt government that interpreted laws, the culture and customs  of  black
people falsely to disadvantage them. This Bill  provides  that  land  issues
will  be  administered  by  a  land  administration  committee,  which  will
comprise local traditional leaders, their  subjects,  women,  the  disabled,
orphaned children that look after their families, the youth and the  adults.
Women will form one third of this committee, and that is  to  guard  against
abuse of their rights. Representatives of the Department of Agriculture  and
Land Affairs, of the Land Rights Board, of the MEC for agriculture,  of  the
MEC for  local  government,  as  well  as  those  of  local  authorities  or
municipalities, would attend meetings of the Land Administration  Committee.
Who can say, therefore, that the rights and interests  of  the  citizens  of
this country are being compromised? It can only be the one who  thinks  that
African  people  cannot  handle  their  matters  in   a   rightful   manner.
[Applause.]

This committee will use traditional and  cultural  institutional  structures
supported by other legislation as well as by the Constitution. According  to
African tradition, land is the soul of the nation; it belongs to the  people
and their chief. Land, the nation and the traditional cannot  be  separated.
A real man introduces himself by saying whose son he is, who his  mother  is
and from which tribe or clan he comes, and from chief so-and-so's kraal.  If
he would not tell the river whose water he drinks and the salutation of  his
chief, he would not have completely introduced himself, thus he will not  be
welcome. [Applause.]

The land, therefore, is the soul of  the  nation  and  needs  to  be  shared
equitably amongst the citizens of the country. Not everybody can  lay  claim
to it. It must be clear that the one who is granted  a  piece  of  land  has
family that he would be expected to take care of by  building  them  a  home
and providing them with food. According to the African tradition, a man  who
has a wife must be given a piece of land. That plot becomes the property  of
the wife and their children. When the man passes on, it is the right of  the
widow and children to remain in that home and not be bothered by anybody.

It becomes the responsibility of the deceased's eldest child  to  take  care
of the household and look after the siblings. The property of  the  deceased
is not for this child of his to waste. When the  white  man  came  into  the
lives of black people,  things  changed.  Traditional  tenure  security  was
effectively eroded, thereby alienating  the  indigenous  people  from  their
cultural and governance aspirations. The white  man  said  a  woman  had  no
right to her late husband's  land.  When  entering  names  in  the  property
register, the woman's  names  would  be  left  out,  although  she  and  the
children would be the rightful owners of  the  entire  piece  of  land.  The
courts, too, perpetuated that wrongful interpretation of our  cultural  law.
This Bill is aimed at correcting  precisely  that  historical  situation  by
addressing the needs of the previously disadvantaged masses. All  those  who
have rights to land are going to be  registered  in  the  Land  Register  to
avoid corrupt activities.

Land is a national  asset  and  is  for  sale.  [Interjections.]  We  should
remember that we are talking about only 13% of  the  land  compared  to  the
rest that is in the hands of the white minority. We are expecting that  that
land  also  will  be  distributed  among  the   people   of   the   country.
Notwithstanding that, this Bill says that if and  when  an  application  for
land has been submitted  to  the  Land  Rights  Committee  for  purposes  of
development, the committee should forward it to the Land  Rights  Board  for
verification. This is  aimed  at  curbing  fraudulent  activities  that  may
arise.

I am certain that traditional leaders will  support  this  Bill,  Madlokovu.
The Bill has been drafted to do away with  minority  individual  tenure.  It
goes with the present times, the times that emphasise individuals more  than
communities in general. It is aimed at  developing  new  laws  that  reflect
black African realities. This Bill has undermined nobody.

I would like to talk briefly  about  the  Ingonyama  Land  Rights  Board  of
kwaZulu-Natal. The King himself will chair this  board.  When  its  term  of
office expires, new members will be appointed according to  this  Bill.  The
board will administer land transfers, as happens in  other  areas  as  well,
according  to  the  new  Bill.  The  King,   Bhejan'ephum'esiqhiwini   ukade
bekuvalele,  will  always  remain  the  chairperson  of  the  board.  It  is
envisaged that in due course, when the Bill has been passed into law,  other
kings of the country would be granted their rightful place  with  regard  to
the land issue.

We are building  the  nation,  fellow  countrymen  and  women.  The  ANC  is
striving for the whole of South Africa, wishing that no one should  be  left
behind. We are therefore going to  continue  drafting  legislation  such  as
this so that there shall be no complaining. As  I  have  already  said,  the
needs and rights of the disadvantaged masses have  been  taken  care  of  in
this Bill. We should trust it; there is nothing sinister  about  it.  It  is
not being used as a weapon to garner votes. It is long  overdue.  I  believe
our ancestors are happy wherever they are. [Interjections.]

I did say that the ANC, the bone of a snake that pricks the  one  it  hates,
that is regarded by many as an enemy and  that  others  would  like  to  see
dead, supports this Bill. [Applause.]]

Mnr A S VAN DER MERWE: Voorsitter,  wanneer  'n  mens  deur  die  voormalige
tuislande ry, besef 'n mens dat die stelsel  van  beheer  oor  grond  beslis
verander moet word.

Hierdie grond maak 20% van die  totale  landbougrond  van  Suid-Afrika  uit.
Hierdie grond is egter in staat om tot 40% van totale  landbouproduksie  van
Suid-Afrika te produseer,  mits  daar  volgens  volhoubare  landboubeginsels
geboer word.

Ek moet dadelik sê dat hierdie wet beslis nie  die  alfa  en  omega  is  wat
hierdie grond betref nie. Dit is hoogstens 'n beginproses om dié  grond  wat
van sulke hoë potensiaal is, te  bestuur  om  sy  volle  potensiaal  te  kan
bereik. Gebruikers van die grond het geen sekerheid gehad nie. Dit  het  tot
gevolg gehad dat broodnodige kapitaalbesteding nie plaasgevind het nie.

Geen drade, geen kontoere, geen  instandhouding,  geen  watervoorsiening  en
geen infrastruktuur nie. Dit is die rede hoekom baie  skade  aan  die  bodem
aangerig is. Ek hoop dat die ander elemente wat nodig is om armoede te  help
verlig in hierdie gebiede spoedig in werking gestel sal word.

Laat ons nou maar vir mekaar vandag sê: kommunale boerdery  is  en  was  nog
nooit 'n sukses nie. Om van kommunale boerdery 'n sukses te maak, vereis  'n
baie belangrike element en dit is ysere dissipline. Dít is een eienskap  wat
in ons nuwe demokrasie verlore geraak het. Dit is baie goed dat  trustgronde
onder  gemeenskapsrade  se  jurisdiksie  kom,  sodat  ons  kan  toesien  dat
individue   gebruiksreg   van    die    gronde    kan    kry.    Dit    moet
langtermynhuurkontrakte tot gevolg hê. Die adjunkminister praat van  vrypag.
Dit  moet  ook  verwelkom  word,  maar  kan  ook  beter  wees.  Tradisionele
leiersgrond moet gemeenskapsgrond word sodat die gemeenskap kan besluit  oor
die gebruiksreg. Tradisionele leiers se mag in toekenning van grond  het  in
die verlede tot misbruik gelei. Dit sal egter  'n  groot  fout  wees  indien
tradisionele leiers nie betrek word nie. Hulle het groot invloed en met  die
regte gebruik van hul invloed kan hulle help  om  die  proses  suksesvol  te
maak.

Individue wat gebruiksreg kry, moet ten minste 'n tydperk van vyf  jaar  kry
om hulleself te bewys. Slaag hulle hierdie toets, moet hulle kwalifiseer  om
vir minstens 50 jaar gebruiksreg te kry. Hierdie kleinboere  moet  sekerheid
kry oor die gebruike van die grond. Dis die enigste sekuriteit  wat  hy  kan
gebruik, om byvoorbeeld finansiering  te  kry.  Hy  het  geld  nodig  om  sy
insetkoste te finansier. Ek wil weer eens pleit dat  'n  skema  geskep  word
wat bestaansboere en kleinboere kan bystaan, al moet hulle 'n jaar  of  twee
geen rente betaal nie en daarna 'n lae  rentekoers  totdat  hul  lenings  na
tien of vyftien jaar afgelos is.

Dit is noodsaaklik om nuwe landbouers op die grond  te  vestig.  Hulle  moet
ondersteuningsdienste kry, soos onder meer hulp met bemarking.

Ek mis 'n hoofstuk in die wet, naamlik een  rakende  gebruiksreg.  Sekerheid
daarvan  moet  verkry  word  in  terme  van  huur,   sekuriteitswaarde   vir
finansiering vir erwe, vroueregte moet aandag  kry.  Dit  is  egter  in  die
proses verbeter in die komitee, maar dit  mag  nodig  wees  om  dit  in  die
praktyk vorentoe verder te verbeter.  Wat  word  van  inkomstebelasting  wat
verbruikers moet betaal? Wat word  van  nie-betalers?  Wat  van  individuele
verbruikersregkontakte indien die verbruiker van grond regsekerheid kry  oor
sy regte dat grondhervormingswette op diesulkes toegepas word?

Die staat het  'n  geleentheid  om  sy  grondhervormingsdoelwitte  'n  groot
hupstoot te gee. Hierdie wet bied 'n groot uitdaging  aan  die  Minister  en
die Departement van Landbou om  die  foute  van  die  afgelope  10  jaar  in
suksesse  te  omskep.  Dan  sal  dit  ook  nie  nodig  wees  om  ongetoetsde
bewerings, soos by Trompsburg, die wêreld in te stuur nie.

Die NNP steun die wet as 'n beginpunt en wens die Regering  sukses  toe  met
die uitvoering daarvan.
Dit is moontlik my laaste optrede in hierdie Raad; 'n voorreg wat ek oor  16
jaar kon geniet het. As 'n aktiewe landbouer in die Raad, wil  ek  graag  'n
gedagte met u deel. Ek wil 'n pleidooi aan hierdie Huis  se  lede  rig.  Ons
kom uit verskillende kulture, agtergronde en opvoedingsgeleenthede. Dít  het
in die verlede konflik gebring. Ek pleit dat hierdie  verskille  vervaag  en
laat  ons  ons  liefde  vir  Suid-Afrika  voorop  plaas.  Die  President  se
strategiese plan oor die pad van die landbou vorentoe kan nie verbeter  word
nie. Die uitstaande kenmerk is om volhoubare landbou  te  skep.  Moenie  dat
die baie geleenthede wat hierdie  ideaal  bied,  verlore  gaan  nie.  Moenie
vergeet dat 'n land wat vir sy  landbou  sorg,  vir  sy  toekoms  sorg  nie.
Onthou Suid-Afrika beskik oor swak landboutoestande.  Suid-Afrika  is  egter
een van die weinige lande in die wêreld wat surplusvoedsel produseer en  kos
uitvoer en dit terwyl landbou in Suid-Afrika geen staatsubsidie ontvang.  Ek
salueer  my  mede-boere,  klein  en  groot,  in  hierdie  land!   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson,  when  one  drives  through  the  former
homelands, one realises that the system of control of land  must  definitely
be changed.

This land comprises 20% of the total  agricultural  land  of  South  Africa.
However, this land is capable of producing  up  to  40%  of  South  Africa's
total  agricultural  production,  provided  that  sustainable   agricultural
principles are followed when farming.

I must say immediately that this Act is certainly not the  alpha  and  omega
where this land is concerned. It is at best  a  process  to  start  managing
land with such high potential, so that it  can  reach  its  full  potential.
Users of the land had  no  security.  The  result  was  that  the  necessary
capital spending did not take place.

No fences, no contours, no maintenance, water supply and no  infrastructure.
This is the reason why a lot of damage was done to the surface. I hope  that
the other elements that are necessary to help  alleviate  poverty  in  these
areas will be implemented as soon as possible.

But let us say this to one another today: Communal farming is and has  never
been a success. To make a success of  communal  farming,  a  very  important
element is required, and that is iron discipline. This is  one  aspect  that
has been lost in our new democracy. It is  very  good  that  trust  land  is
being placed under the jurisdiction of communal  councils,  to  ensure  that
individuals can obtain the right to use the land. This must result in  long-
term lease contracts. The Deputy Minister  speaks  of  freehold.  This  must
also be welcomed, but it can also be better. Land belonging  to  traditional
leaders should become community land so that the community can decide  about
the right of use. The power  of  traditional  leaders  with  regard  to  the
allocation of land has led to abuse in the past. However, it would be a  big
mistake if traditional leaders are not involved. They have  great  influence
and can, with the correct use of this influence, assist in making a  success
of this process.

Individuals who obtain right of use must have at  least  a  period  of  five
years to prove themselves. If they pass this  test,  they  must  qualify  to
receive right of use for at least 50 years. These small  farmers  must  have
certainty regarding the uses of the land. This is the only  surety  that  he
can use, for example to obtain financing. He  needs  money  to  finance  his
initial production costs. I once again want to appeal that a  scheme  should
be created to support subsistence farmers and small-scale farmers,  even  if
it means that they do not have to pay  interest  for  a  year  or  two,  and
thereafter a low interest rate, until redeeming their  loans  after  ten  or
fifteen years.

It is essential to settle  new  farmers  on  the  land.  They  must  receive
support services, such as, among other things, assistance with marketing.

I am missing a chapter in the legislation, namely the one  concerning  right
of use. Certainty about this must be obtained, in terms of  lease,  security
value for the financing of erven and women's rights must receive  attention.
This was, however, improved in the process by  the  committee,  but  it  may
still be necessary in the future to improve it in practice. What becomes  of
the income tax that users must pay? What happens to those who  do  not  pay?
What about individual users'  rights  contracts,  where  the  user  of  land
receives secure tenure over his rights in order that land reform laws  could
be applied to it?

The state has an opportunity to give great impetus to its land reform  aims.
This law presents a great challenge to the Minister and  the  Department  of
Agriculture to transform the mistakes of the past 10 years  into  successes.
Then it will not be necessary either to send untested allegations,  like  in
the Trompsburg case, out into the world

The NNP supports the law as a  starting  point  and  wishes  the  Government
success with its implementation.

It is probably my last appearance in this Council; a privilege that  I  have
enjoyed for the past 16 years. As an active farmer, I would like to share  a
thought with you. I want to appeal to the members of  this  House.  We  come
from different cultures, backgrounds and educational opportunities.  In  the
past this has brought conflict. I plead that these  differences  would  fade
and that our love  for  South  Africa  would  come  first.  The  President's
strategic plan  for  agriculture's  way  forward  cannot  be  improved.  The
critical feature is the creation of sustainable agriculture. Do not let  the
many opportunities presented by this ideal be lost. Do  not  forget  that  a
country that cares for its agriculture cares for its future.  Remember  that
South Africa has poor agricultural conditions.  South  Africa,  however,  is
one of the few countries  in  the  world  that  produces  surplus  food  and
exports food,  and  this  while  agriculture  does  not  receive  any  state
subsidy. I salute my  fellow  farmers,  small  and  big,  in  this  country!
[Applause.]]

Ms E NGALEKA:  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members,  comrades  and
friends, the ANC slogan ``Mayibuye iAfrica'' was and is precisely  a  demand
for the return of the land of Africa to its indigenous inhabitants. The  ANC
recognises that other oppressed  people  deprived  of  land  live  in  South
Africa. The white people who have made  South  Africa  their  home  and  are
historically part of the South African population are as  much  entitled  to
land. Therefore, ``the land shall be shared amongst those who work it'',  as
stipulated in the people's document, the Freedom Charter.

On Freedom Day, 27 April 2003, the President said in his address:


  Since 1994, we have entered into a social contract,  as  South  Africans,
  that central to the realisation of our strategic goal is the  eradication
  of poverty and the defeat of underdevelopment  in  every  corner  of  our
  country.

In 1997, approximately 32% of South Africa's population lived in the  former
homeland  areas.  A  breakdown  of  this  figure  indicated  that  63%   had
permission to occupy the land where they lived and 26,6%  lacked  permission
to  occupy,  and  the  remaining  9,6%  were  uncertain  whether  they   had
permission or not.
Tenure reform in South Africa is mandated by section 25(5) and 25(6) of  the
Constitution. Tenure reform is seen as comprising two main areas  of  focus,
that is security  of  tenure  for  people  living  on  farms  and  improving
security of tenure for those in communal  areas,  largely  the  former  TBVC
areas. One of the objectives of the Bill is to  grant  land  tenure  rights,
individually or communally, to approximately 2,4  million  rural  households
which are largely  concentrated  in  the  former  homelands.  This  land  is
currently owned by the state and held in trust by traditional leaders.

Women, and in particular black women, have been severely  marginalised  with
regards to access to land. Customary laws  denied  women  the  right  to  be
allocated land in their personal capacity.  Women's  tenure  was  linked  to
their status in relation to male members of the family  as  wives,  mothers,
daughters and sisters. Married women who lost their husbands stood the  risk
of losing what belonged to their  husbands  although  they  were  forced  to
marry in community  of  property,  especially  if  she  did  not  have  male
offspring. Girls could not inherit  a  homestead  when  both  their  parents
died. A greedy brother-in-law, the father's brother,  could  grab  all  that
belonged to his brother. If the brother's wife was  still  alive,  he  could
place her and her children under his control. If  he  so  wished,  he  could
take his brother's wife as his additional wife. He could then use  his  late
brother's possessions to support his own family and  that  of  his  brother,
literally inheriting his sister-in-law as if she was  a  piece  of  property
and a perpetual minor.

The Bill before us changes these old-order rights and  ushers  in  new-order
rights. In terms of new-order rights,  the  wife  is  a  co-owner  with  her
husband of whatever land has been allocated to  them,  irrespective  of  the
marriage regime. Communal land and new-order rights  are  capable  of  being
and must be registered in the name of the community or person,  including  a
woman, entitled to such land or rights in terms of this Bill.

In the old system,  through  customary  law  and  practices,  the  land  was
traditionally reserved  for  men.  Women  were  excluded  from  owning  land
through the Permission to Occupy system, the PTO system. It  is  these  PTOs
that are referred  to  in  this  Bill  as  old-order  rights  that  will  be
transferred to new-order rights. The concern  raised  on  the  issue  during
public hearings was that, since women were excluded from owning  PTOs,  they
are discriminated against to get new-order rights.

This Bill  does  not  leave  the  poor  and  vulnerable  community  members,
including women, unprotected. On the  contrary,  it  provides  a  number  of
safeguards aimed at minimising some of the risks and problems identified  by
the organs of civil society, land activists  and  respected  academics.  The
reported perceptions that  the  Bill  maintains  and  even  exaggerates  the
second-class treatment of women have no foundation at all when examined  and
analysed firstly against section 4(1).

The importance of the statutory provision is  that  it  gives  effect  to  a
woman's constitutional entitlement to  security  of  tenure.  Secondly,  the
criticism to the effect that the Bill confers second-class status  on  women
is baseless when section 4 is read together with sections  14,  18,  22,  26
and 3 of the Bill.

Thirdly, the Bill makes it very clear in terms of section 4(2) that an  old-
order  right  derived  from  or  recognised  by  old-order  law,   including
customary law, held by a married person is, despite  any  law  or  practice,
usage or registration contrary to that, deemed to be held by all spouses  in
a marriage in which such  a  person  is  a  spouse,  jointly,  in  undivided
shares, irrespective of the matrimonial property regime applicable  to  such
marriages and must, on  confirmation  or  conversion  in  terms  of  section
18(3), be registered in the names of all such spouses.

Fourthly, the Bill also provides for entitlement  of  a  woman  in  her  own
right, irrespective of her marital status, to the same  land  tenure  rights
or rights in land or interest in land as a man. This  will  put  to  an  end
discrimination faced by women in communal areas where they were  treated  as
minors who could not hold title deeds on their own.
Women, for the first time, will be able to use their title deeds  to  secure
bank loans to assist them to farm or develop the land. This  will  eradicate
poverty and ensure the economic emancipation of  women,  as  women  are  the
majority in communal areas  and  many  are  heading  their  own  households.
Having new-order rights would be of benefit to the whole of the community.

The new-order rights empower  women,  including  single  women  and  female-
headed  households,  to  own  land  in  their  own  right  as  part  of  the
emancipation of women. There is no doubt that the ANC  Government  has  made
great strides in achieving a legal framework where the rights of  women  and
men are equally guaranteed. The Convention on the Elimination of  All  Forms
of Discrimination against Women, of  which  South  Africa  is  a  signatory,
recognises women's rights.

Article 14 of Cedaw obliges state parties to take all  appropriate  measures
to eliminate discrimination  against  women  in  rural  areas  in  order  to
ensure, on the basis of equality of men and  women,  that  they  participate
and benefit from rural development. This would,  in  particular,  ensure  to
such women the right to obtain all types of training and education -  formal
and nonformal - including that relating to functional literacy, and to  have
access to agriculture, credit and loans, marketing  facilities,  appropriate
technology and equal treatment in land and agrarian reform, as  well  as  in
the resettlement schemes.

In some traditional structures, women's representation are at present  being
addressed.  Some  existing  structures,  like  the   Royal   Bafokeng,   has
approximately  40%  women  representation  in  decision-making.   To   those
traditional leaders we say, keep it up and do better in order for you to  be
emulated by others.

The overall best female farmer of the  year  for  2003,  Tendani  Sinoamadi,
took over farming at a Hillcrest estate after the death of  her  husband  in
2000. She created work for  11  other  people  and  hires  temporary  labour
during planting, harvesting and debushing. This example of a  female  farmer
should inspire other women to do likewise.

The Land Bank  Amendment  Act,  Act  21  of  1998,  gives  women  access  to
financial assistance from the bank. The Prevention of Illegal Eviction  from
Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, Act 19 of 1998, makes  reference  to  women
and notes that special consideration  should  be  given  to  the  rights  of
certain vulnerable groups, which include female-headed households.  Land  is
an important source of capital used in economic activity  and  a  factor  of
production.

In conclusion, we in the ANC can proudly say, truly the tide has turned.  In
the mere space of 10 years the Government  has  brought  changes  that  have
completely confounded both friend and enemy. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson,  the  ACDP  respects  traditional  structures  and
leadership and views them as instruments for change and development and  not
as an obstruction. Traditional  leaders  are  rightly  ambitious  for  their
people and need to be on board with transformation in a way  that  does  not
threaten, but inspires.

We believe the prospect of real development, which will  benefit  all,  will
do just that. Traditional leaders have an  important  role  to  play,  which
should not be undermined, and their inclusion in a structure like  the  NCOP
would create an opportunity  for  them  to  make  a  relevant  and  positive
impact.

The ACDP shares the hope of many that the Communal  Land  Rights  Bill  will
not unnecessarily undermine traditional authority, but will  help  alleviate
poverty and hardship and bring  prosperity.  We  believe  it  is  a  sincere
attempt  to  address  the  injustices  of  the  past  without  tearing  down
traditional structures, while at  the  same  time  facilitating  freedom  of
choice and individual enterprise.

It is reformation and not revolution that will transform our  society  in  a
sustainable manner on which we can build and expand,  and  the  long-awaited
draft Communal Rights Bill will begin this  positive  process  of  resolving
urgent land tenure problems in the fertile former homeland areas.

Finding solutions to these complex  issues  presents  many  challenges,  and
whether or not the Bill provides appropriate solutions only time will  tell.
However, the urgent necessity for such a Bill  is  obvious  to  all.  If  we
opposed the  development  of  homelands  before,  then  we  must  stand  for
transformation today. The key to this  transformation  is  private  property
rights for farmers and residential and commercial development alike.

Research shows that communal farming with no individual incentive  does  not
promote productivity, and where individual families farm their own land  and
enjoy the fruit of their labour, there is far  greater  success.  Individual
enterprise applies the Biblical  principle,  ``As  you  sow,  so  shall  you
reap'', which encourages productivity.

People have a tendency to view the former homelands in a manner  that  keeps
them in bondage. These areas in fact have the  most  potential  of  all  the
land in the country, being the most fertile and having the highest  rainfall
in a country, where there are severe water shortages.

With this in mind, the ACDP believes, we must not  help  perpetuate  poverty
by continuing to lock these potential gold mines into the mind-set  of  low-
value staple-food production only. Is is time to help  these  areas  make  a
leap in the value chain by growing high-value organic food for export.

This  labour-intensive  industry  would  necessitate  skills  transfer   and
quality control, which the state can provide, plus private  joint  marketing
and distribution arrangements. The IDC has done this  before  with  tea  and
coffee plantations in Venda, and must look at doing it  again.  Ventures  in
IT, flowers and other industries should be encouraged.  These  areas  should
also be ring-fenced and free of labour  restrictions  for  a  period  of  20
years to give them the best possible chance of pulling out  of  poverty  and
flourishing.

The content of this Bill, which has changed continually throughout  its  six
years in the making, will impact on the lives  of  as  many  as  30  million
people. It is essentially a compromise  between  traditional  practices  and
democratic principles, aimed at addressing  issues  of  land  ownership  and
security of tenure, especially for women.

While communal farming  remains  an  option,  the  Bill  rightly  encourages
individual  ownership  which  will  encourage  greater  responsibility   and
greater  achievement.  Communities  can  opt  for  traditional  councils  to
administer land affairs, or elect land administration committees to  do  so.
The ACDP will support this Bill.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  intention  to  extend
security of tenure to people in rural areas is a noble one. Firstly,  it  is
commonly believed and  accepted  by  most  people  that  the  right  to  own
property, especially land, has a high emotional value.

Owing to racial and gender discrimination in  the  past,  many  people  were
deprived of their land and the right  to  own  land.  For  many  people  the
extension of the right of property ownership of the land  they  live  on  is
truly a  matter  of  dignity  and  pride.  It  makes  them  feel  like  full
participants in this new democratic society.

It is also  important  to  remember  that  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership, supported by millions, is directly linked to the  communal  land
issue. Secondly, security of tenure is a step  in  the  right  direction  in
terms of helping as many as 15 million rural South Africans to  gain  access
to the formal economy.

Without property to offer as security, these people remain  on  the  fringes
of the economy, unable to access formal-sector financing. This could be  one
of various steps that need to be taken in  order  to  stop  the  social  and
economic stagnation of rural areas.

For these two important reasons the  intentions  behind  the  Communal  Land
Rights  Bill  cannot  be  faulted.  However,  intentions   alone   are   not
sufficient, especially on such a critical and emotional  matter.  Unintended
consequences could have disastrous effects and undermine some of  the  noble
goals of this legislation.

There is far too much criticism from  far  too  wide  a  spectrum  of  civil
society regarding the Bill and the lack of consultation during its  drafting
for Parliament to accept this Bill. However, despite the above concern,  the
UDM supports the Bill. I thank you.

[Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, hon MPs present, the UCDP says  that  the  soil
is very important to the people and that unity  is  power.  It  would  be  a
great honour to women to hear for themselves if they can be included in  the
land issues.]

Let the land go back to the people, and the people go back  to  tilling  the
land for a living. The question of the right to land has been  a  source  of
concern to South Africans of a darker hue. Questions have been  asked  about
how some people came to own land, whilst sons  and  daughters  of  the  soil
remained landless.

I do not want to delve too deeply into how  Africans  were  dispossessed  of
their land - except to say that this happened through simple  bartering,  in
some cases, and as rewards for some soldiers after the war,  while  Africans
were given overcoats and bicycles.

We need to applaud the presentation of this Bill.  The  Bill  sets  out  the
procedure to follow in the transfer and registration of  communal  land.  In
the spirit of service to and respect for people,  it  is  required  that  in
making a determination on land that is not state  land,  the  Minister  must
bear in mind that the person or people in whose name or names  the  land  is
registered should be the first port  of  call.  This  makes  it  clear  that
people will never again lose or be removed from  their  land  without  their
consent.

We in the UCDP believe that when the  Bill  becomes  law  and  the  contents
thereof are followed to the letter, there will  be  no  further  complaints.
However, we wish that the Minister state categorically  what  the  situation
is in relation to claims such as those in the Eastern Cape, which are  being
brought long after the cut-off date.

While we appreciate the resolution on cut-off dates,  we  bring  it  to  the
attention of the powers that be that our people are not so sophisticated  as
to appreciate the setting of dates. We raise  this  question  of  delays  in
complying while having noticed in  the  memorandum  to  the  Bill  that  the
Minister conceded that the Bill would  require  an  expensive  communication
strategy because even the officials still have to be  trained  to  implement
the Act once it is in place. The 50 workshops which were run in  preparation
for this Bill were insufficient. I thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr T GODI: Chairperson, comrades and hon  members,  may  I  state  from  the
outset that the PAC supports the Bill. We are particularly  pleased  by  its
progressive form, character and content.

The transformation project,  which  is  an  agenda  of  the  democratic  and
progressive forces, must reach every nook and  cranny  of  our  country  and
affect every facet of the people's lives. We must resist  the  impulse  that
seeks to deny people in rural areas full democratic benefits and practice.

The PAC is content, especially with the provisions of chapters 2, 3  and  5,
which specifically deal with the recognition, empowerment and protection  of
women's rights  to  land  ownership  and  administration  on  the  basis  of
absolute equality with everybody, which is a  revolutionary  departure  from
the feudal practices of the past.

However, we decry the fact that other pieces  of  legislation  dealing  with
agrarian reform have not been this far-reaching.  Whereas  this  legislation
protects and empowers communities and individuals  on  communal  lands,  our
people in vast farming estates throughout the  country  continue  to  suffer
horrendous atrocities, ranging from brutal murders to inhuman  evictions  by
white farmers. Their security of tenure in farms  is  violated  almost  with
impunity.

The challenge for us is to tighten existing legislation to also empower  and
protect the toiling serfs on the farms.  The  PAC  guarantees  itself  as  a
ready and principled partner in the  transformation  programme.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Hon Chairperson and hon members, the object of  this  Bill  is
set out very clearly in the memorandum. It seeks to  formalise  the  African
traditional system within the  framework  of  the  Constitution  by  legally
securing tenure rights of communities and people within  the  tenure  system
of their choice.

The transfer of ownership from the state to resident communities is a  major
advance away  from  a  century  of  inequity,  but  it  is  less  clear  how
individual  people,  particularly  women,  will  be  able   to   effectively
communicate and  exercise  the  choice  provided  for  them  in  this  Bill,
especially  when  this  choice  does  not  coincide  with   the   entrenched
establishment  of  the   community.   I   do   believe   that   this   Bill,
comprehensively amended as it is now compared to the disaster  presented  to
us at the end of last year, does - although somewhat vaguely  -  attempt  to
achieve just that, namely to free up  the  individual.  [Interjections.]  If
you listen, you will learn more. But only  time  and  experience  will  tell
whether it will actually succeed in doing this.

The  background  statement  to  this  Bill  spells  out  that  the  existing
paternalistic system prevents  social  and  economic  advancement  in  those
areas. It now remains a question  for  the  future  to  answer  whether  the
latent paternalism, that could very  well  remain  entrenched  despite  this
Bill, will continue to stall social and economic advancement if  it  manages
to prevent the flowering of individual enterprise. And  that  would  be  the
acid test for this Bill.

The commercial farmland of this country is highly developed and  productive,
because the individuals, and not communities, who take the risk to till  the
land and graze it enjoys security of tenure, while the  communal  areas  are
undeveloped and unproductive because neither individuals nor  the  community
enjoy such security. It is  the  individual  risk  taker  who  develops  and
maintains the commercial heart of this city, and not communities. And it  is
individual risk takers who provide commercial  services  in  the  townships,
not communities. It is these  individuals  who  must  be  fostered,  whether
inside or outside traditional custom, to  achieve  the  desired  social  and
economic advancement that we are talking about here.

Let us therefore hope and trust that the department will be able to  develop
the capacity and the skill to implement this Bill, because  it  is  arguably
the most important Bill that this Parliament has deliberated on in the  last
five years, since it  directly  and  intimately  affects  probably  fifteen-
million people. At present the department has neither the capacity  nor  the
skill having underestimated, by  their  own  admission,  the  implementation
costs of this Bill by at least 800%. And this must surely be addressed.

Agb Voorsitter, met die genade van bo en baie  geluk,  kan  die  departement
miskien die nodige vermoë ontwikkel, maar beide die departement en  die  ANC
het reeds die reg op vertroue verbeur met  hulle  wangedrag  rondom  hierdie
wetsontwerp. Hierdie twee instansies, plus hulle nuwe skoothondjie,  het  'n
skrale  drie  maande  gelede  hierdie  Parlement  verseker  dat   restitusie
onmoontlik afgehandel kan word sonder dat die Minister  ongeoorloofde  magte
oorneem by die hof met betrekking tot wie die regmatige  eienaar  van  grond
is.

Daardie einste  mense  vertel  nou  vir  ons,  in  artikel  18  van  hierdie
wetsontwerp, dat ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, with mercy from above and lots of luck the department  may
possibly develop the necessary abilities, but both the  department  and  the
ANC have already jeopardised their right to be trusted owing to  their  poor
conduct concerning this Bill. These two institutions, along with  their  new
little  lapdog,  assured  this  Parliament  barely  three  months  ago  that
restitution was impossible to conclude  without  the  Minister  taking  over
unauthorised power from the court with regard to who the rightful  owner  of
land is.

Those very people now tell us in Section 18 of this Bill, that ...]


  The Minister may not make a determination if there is  a  dispute.  Until
  the dispute is resolved ...

... en blaa blaa op verskillende wyse, en dan op 'n einde ...  [...  and  so
on in different ways, and then at an end ... ] all by a  court.  So  in  the
last instance, a court must resolve the dispute.

Ons moet baie mooi verstaan, net  drie  maande  gelede  vertel  daardie  agb
adjunkminister Du Toit vir ons dat die DA en ander instansies  histeries  is
deur die ministeriële magte met die restitusie teë te  staan.  Maar  as  dit
kom by dieselfde beginsel verander  hy  van  standpunt  met  betrekking  tot
kommunale eienaars. Hieruit  moet  nie  afgelei  word  dat  die  adjunk  uit
onkunde so rondtrippel nie. So erg moet hy nie onderskat word nie,  want  hy
weet waarvan hy praat. Dit is bloot uit politieke  dienstigheid  wat  hy  so
optree. En die rede daarvoor is dat daar slegs 50  000  kommersiële  kiesers
is, maar daar is etlike miljoene in die kommunale gebiede wat kan stem.

Hierdie uiters belangrike wetgewing word dus blatant deur  die  ANC  gebruik
om stemme te werf. Suid-Afrika  verdien  werklik  beter  as  dit.  Maar  dis
verreweg nie die  ergste  misbruike  nie.  Die  droogtekrisis  word  net  so
blatant uitgebuit om stemme te koop.

Rampbystand met droogte - wat die ANC terloops in die  verlede  gesê  het  -
sal nooit weer gebeur nie. Ons sal nooit weer  rampbystand  in  droogte  kry
nie. Dit word heeltemal tereg aangewend om ook kleinboere en  bestaansboere,
hoofsaaklik in die kommunale gebiede, wat dus geen voedsel sal  hê  nie,  by
te staan. En niemand kan daarmee  'n  probleem  hê  nie.  Dit  sal  absoluut
onrealisties en onredelik wees. En dit lyk vir  my  of  ek  van  my  bladsye
verloor, maar laat ons aangaan.

Wat nou gebeur ... [Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We need to understand very well that just three months ago the  hon  Deputy
Minister Du Toit told us that the DA and other institutions  are  hysterical
when they oppose ministerial powers with the restitution. But  when  dealing
with  the  same  principle  concerning  communal  owners,  he  changes   his
standpoint. One should not conclude from this that  the  Deputy  is  hopping
about like this because of ignorance. He should  not  be  underestimated  to
that extent, as he knows what he is talking about. It is merely  because  of
political expedience that he does so. And the reason for this is that  there
are only 50 000 commercial voters, but there  are  several  million  in  the
communal areas who can vote.

This very important legislation is therefore being  used  blatantly  by  the
ANC to canvas for votes. South Africa surely deserves better than this.  But
this is not the worst abuse by far. The  drought  crisis  is  used  just  as
blatantly to buy votes.

Disaster-relief assistance in times of drought - which is what the ANC  said
in the past, by the way - would not happen ever again. We will  never  again
receive disaster-relief assistance during  droughts.  It  is  quite  rightly
being used to assist small-scale farmers and subsistence farmers, mainly  in
the communal areas, where they would otherwise have  no  food.  And  no  one
could have a problem with that.  It  would  be  absolutely  unrealistic  and
unreasonable. And it would appear to me that I am losing some of  my  pages,
but let us continue.

What happens now ... [Laughter.]]

I wonder what you will do if you stand here and you lose one of your  pages.
Watch me and let's see how I do.

Wat nou gebeur, is dat dieselfde ramphulp aan  plaaswerkers  aangebied  word
teen 'n bedrag van R900 oor drie maande.  Dit  is  nie  om  te  verhoed  dat
plaaswerkers hulle werk verloor omdat die boer, die werkgewer,  nou  in  die
knyp is as gevolg van die droogte nie. Hoegenaamd nie. Die boere  is  gister
in die Vrystaat baie, baie duidelik gesê dat hulle daardie mense  ten  volle
sal bly betaal terwyl hulle die R900 kry. Nou wat  op  aarde  kan  die  doel
hiervan wees? Dit kan net een ding wees, en dit is om  stemme  te  koop  vir
die komende verkiesing. Dit is die diefstal van belastingbetalers  se  geld.
Julle almal wat hier sit, insluitende julle, se geld word gebruik om  stemme
te koop vir die ANC. Daar is geen ander verklaring nie. Indien  dit  nie  so
is nie, dan daag ek die adjunkminister nou uit, wanneer hy netnou  hier  kom
praat om daardie optrede te ontken en dit stop  te  sit.  Anders  kan  ek  u
verseker die DA sal alles onder die son doen om dit stop te sit  en  al  die
ander  belastingbetalers  opkommandeer   ...   (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[What happens now is  that  the  same  disaster  assistance  is  offered  to
farmworkers in the amount of R900 over three months. This is not to  prevent
the farmworkers from losing their jobs because the farmer,  their  employer,
is in trouble because of the drought. Not at all. The farmers  in  the  Free
State were told in no uncertain terms that they will pay those people  while
they received the R900. Now what purpose on earth could this serve?  It  can
only be one thing, and that is to buy votes for the  upcoming  election.  It
is the theft  of  taxpayers'  money.  All  of  you  who  are  sitting  here,
including you, your money is being used to buy votes for the ANC.  There  is
no other explanation. If this is not the case, then I challenge  the  Deputy
Minister now, when it is his turn to speak, to deny it and to put a stop  to
it. Otherwise I can assure you that the DA will do everything under the  sun
to put a stop to it and will appeal to all the other taxpayers ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order,  hon  member,  your  time  has
expired.

Mr A J BOTHA: Dankie. [Thank you.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'll  come  back  to  the  DA,  but
first  just  a  cursory  remark.  [Interjections.]  The  DA,  by  their  own
admission - and they can shout and howl as much as they want to  -  says  it
has been the most important Bill, at least over the  last  five  years,  but
then they come here and they talk about everything but this Bill.

They talk about restitution. They talk about drought aid, but  the  Bill  is
on the back burner. And it just indicates how you rate the interest  of  the
people in the communal areas. And the voters will talk. [Applause.]

When enacted, this Bill will provide  the  basis  for  a  blueprint  of  the
future utilisation of a vast area of land on a sustainable basis. It  should
provide a mechanism to rectify the results of the injustices  of  centuries,
where land was alienated from the indigenous peoples of South  Africa.  This
occurred  through  conquests,  trickery  and  ideology,  resulting  in   the
eventual overcrowding and  degradation  of  the  communal  areas.  This,  in
conjunction with the abuse of the traditional  system,  contributed  to  the
incorrect utilisation of land, as well as the  violation  of  human  rights,
especially women's  rights.  The  lack  of  access  to  capital,  inadequate
infrastructure, training and support services, market access, etc.  are  all
contributory factors to the current desperate state of affairs  in  most  of
the former homeland areas.

The legal entrenchment of the tenure rights  of  people  working  the  land,
whilst recognising the de facto system of traditional  leadership,  demanded
extreme wisdom and insight from both the drafters of  this  legislation  and
the portfolio committee.

This  Bill,  because  of  its  importance  and  its  potential   to   create
divisiveness, demands the support, not only of civil  society  but  also  of
the total political spectrum. And one is therefore grateful  that  it  would
seem that all the political parties do support this Bill.  It  is  therefore
regrettable that the DA, however, chose, even before its final  approval  by
the portfolio committee, to shout it down in the public media. And  I  refer
to an article by the hon Graham McIntosh in the Natal Witness of 4  November
2003, in which he stated, amongst other things:


  Apart from the aspect of human rights  and  democracy,  the  Government's
  Communal Land Rights Bill is not progressive enough in building a gradual
  regime of modern property rights. It entrenches  rights  for  traditional
  leaders who have clearly shown,  with  few  exceptions,  that  they  have
  neither the capacity, nor the  energy,  nor,  as  hereditary  holders  of
  office, the accountability to administer land rights in a way  that  will
  bring development and a market in property rights.
Now he has cast a shadow of suspicion over all traditional leaders, and  one
would like to  know  what  their  allies  in  KwaZulu-Natal  say  about  it.
[Interjections.] Is Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi one of these  leaders?  What  is
his position? Are you prepared to stand up? Is the king of the Zulus one  of
those leaders? One would like to  hear.  And  I  don't  think  the  DA  must
answer. I think the IFP must answer. The IFP must say  what  they  think  of
these bedfellows.

This epitomises the political opportunism,  which  manifested  itself  again
last weekend, and I refer to Die Burger of 7 February 2004,  where  the  hon
Andries Botha was quoted. In reaction to the possibility,  as  expressed  by
the Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Mr Tozi Gwanya - and we  heard  it  from
hon Dan Maluleke - that in view of special circumstances, 1 500  restitution
claims in the Eastern Cape might, after careful scrutiny,  be  reconsidered.
Mr Botha said:


  The re-opening of claims would amount to  bureaucratic  interference  and
  would be irresponsible and unacceptable.

Now I recall that  the  hon  Dan  Maluleke  gave  notice  to  the  portfolio
committee, when the relevant legislation was  discussed,  that  he  intended
tabling members' legislation to re-open the  whole  process  of  restitution
claims countrywide. I presume that he did not only have the sanction of  his
party's leader but also of his party's caucus to  make  this  statement.  He
was not repudiated by his party colleagues. And I am sure  the  voters  will
appreciate an unambiguous reply. And it is interesting to  look  at  the  DA
component at the portfolio committee.  They  have  got  the  hon  Kraai  van
Niekerk, who acts as the DA  leader  when  the  DA  leader  is  out  of  the
country, but he is still here under the FA banner.  But  Kraai  van  Niekerk
represents the old order. He represents the thoughts of  Andries  Treurnicht
and Jaap Marais. Then you have the hon Graham McIntosh, who  represents  the
thinking of KwaZulu-Natal and Zimbabwe ...
Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman. On a point of order, Mr Chairman.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order,  please  take  your  seat,  Dr
Schoeman.

Mr M J ELLIS: I do seem to recall the hon John Jeffery  who,  while  one  of
the DA speakers was speaking, tried to take  a  point  of  order  about  the
relevance of the speech. I think that this is far more pertinent,  Sir.  And
I do have to ask the question:  To  what  extent  is  the  hon  Dr  Schoeman
speaking on the subject of this afternoon?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Dr Schoeman, will you  please  confine
yourself to the matter before the House. [Interjections.] Order! Not that  I
agree with Mr Ellis. Please continue.

DR E A SCHOEMAN: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'll confine  my  thoughts  to  the
delegation of the DA in our committee. Then you have the hon Stuart  Farrow,
and he, I think, sort of represents the DA more and more. But then you  have
the hon Andries Botha, and  he  is  the  unguided  missile.  [Laughter.]  He
extinguishes fires all the time. And then of course you  have  the  hon  Dan
Maluleke, who quite often represents views quite close to that of  the  ANC.
Now I want to tell the hon Maluleke, the DA will chew you up  and  spit  you
out when it is convenient. All you are expected to do is provide  them  with
voters. [Laughter.]

Many inputs regarding the Communal Land Rights Bill  were  made  during  the
period that was set aside for hearings.  The  portfolio  committee  listened
very carefully to these and attempted to accommodate as many suggestions  as
possible  in  the   final   Bill.   Much   reference   was   made   to   the
constitutionality of the draft of the Bill, as it was tabled originally.  In
this regard, the legal opinions of Adv Gilbert  Marcus,  as  sought  by  the
South African Human Rights Commission, and that  of  Mr  H  J  de  Waal,  as
sought by the Legal Resources Centre, Cape Town, and a summary and  analysis
of the Bill by Ms Aninka Claasens, a document entitled ``The  Communal  Land
Rights Bill and Women'' and a document entitled ``Approved  version  of  the
CLRB gives extraordinary power to Chiefs, as issued by the  NLC'',  were  of
particular relevance.

Adv  Marcus  identified  three  constitutional   flaws   relating   to   the
discretionary powers of the Minister. Firstly, the failure  to  give  effect
to  the  underlying  constitutional  right.  It   seeks   to   transform   a
constitutionally guaranteed right to a discretionary benefit,  the  granting
of which is entirely subject to ministerial discretion.

Secondly, there is the problem that, whereas the  Constitution  states  that
the extent of the right to secure tenure or comparable  redress  legally  is
to be determined by an Act of Parliament, the Bill states  that  the  extent
of the right is to be determined by the Minister.

Thirdly, the Bill makes the realisation of constitutional rights subject  to
the exercise of  official  discretion  in  a  manner  which  does  not  give
constitutionally adequate guidance to those officials as to how they  should
exercise such discretion.
The portfolio committee referred these objections to the Department of  Land
Affairs for legal opinion. The  conclusion  was  that  the  Bill  does  give
effect to the entitlement contained in section 25(6)  of  the  Constitution,
but conceded that the transformation of a constitutionally guaranteed  right
to a discretionary benefit, the granting of which  is  entirely  subject  to
ministerial discretion, is arguable. It was  also  conceded  that  the  Bill
does  not  determine  the  extent  of  comparable  redress  and   could   be
unconstitutional.

As to the  question  whether  the  Bill  gives  constitutionally  consistent
guidance to  decision-makers,  the  opinion  was  that  no  such  discretion
exists, and that if such discretion did indeed  exist,  the  principle  laid
down by the Constitutional Court, that guidance must  be  provided  where  a
wide discretion is conferred upon a functionary, should be complied with.

The portfolio committee noted the problem areas regarding  constitutionality
and  amended  the  Bill  substantially  to  ensure   compliance   with   the
Constitution. In clause 4 the aspects of  securing  an  old-order  right  or
comparable redress  is  stipulated  comprehensively.  This  also  guarantees
gender equity. The procedure of assessment which the  Minister  must  follow
with comparable redress is outlined clearly in clause 12, as amended.

Clause 18 of the Bill, which instructs the Minister how to act on  a  report
by a land rights enquirer,  was  also  amended  substantially  in  order  to
provide greater clarity and be more specific. According  to  the  assessment
of this side of the House, these amendments, which have been alluded  to  in
conjunction  with  other  minor  amendments,  ensure  compliance  with   the
provisions of the Constitution and effectively deal  with  the  reservations
expressed by Adv Gilbert Marcus, Ms Aninka Claassen and  the  National  Land
Committee.

Mr H J de Waal, in an opinion  furnished  to  the  Legal  Resources  Centre,
expressed the view that the Bill, read in conjunction with  the  Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill, establishes a  fully  fledged  new
sphere of government, specifically in circumstances in  which  it  would  be
unelected and unaccountable. The contention is  that  it  unconstitutionally
creates a fourth sphere of government by clause 24,  read  with  clause  19,
which vests public-state administrative powers in  the  Land  Administration
Committee.

It was also stated that the traditional leadership Bill increased the  power
of  a  land  administration  committee  when  such  a  land   administration
committee is established as a traditional  council.  It  supposedly  confers
additional functions, which also define  the  structures  and  entrench  the
status of the fourth sphere.

In terms of the legal advice obtained by the portfolio  committee,  however,
neither the Bill nor  the  traditional  leadership  Bill  creates  a  fourth
sphere of government, and that  such  conclusion  misconstrues  the  overall
statutory scheme of both Bills and the thrust of a number  of  their  direct
provisions.

Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie wetsontwerp sal die gebruiks- en verblyfreg  van
die bewoners van kommunale grond verseker. In wese het  dit  dus  betrekking
op die grond van die voormalige  tuislande  en  ander  geïsoleerde  gebiede.
Hoewel  dit  dus  in  hoofsaak   betrekking   het   op   die   gebruik-   en
verblyfregaspek van  grondhervorming,  het  dit  ook  betrekking  op  sekere
elemente van herverdeling. In klousule  38  word  die  Minister  onder  meer
bemagtig om vir die doelwitte van die wet grond aan te koop en te verkry  én
op enige  ander  manier  onderhewig  aan  artikel  3  van  die  Wet  op  die
Bevordering van Administratiewe Geregtigheid van  2000,  grond  te  onteien,
hetsy 'n gedeelte grond of 'n reg op grond.

Hierdie  onteieningsmagte  van  die  Minister,  soos  uiteengesit   in   die
restitusie van grondregtewet, is niks onheilspellends  nie.  Dis  egter  nie
verbasend dat daar in sekere  geledere,  soos  byvoorbeeld  die  Transvaalse
Landbou Unie en die DA, 'n histeriese  herrie  losbars  -  soos  ons  netnou
gesien het - elke keer wanneer die woord ``onteiening''  gebruik  word  nie.
Dit moet  gesien  word  as  'n  refleksreaksie  waar  die  apartheidregering
onteiening gebruik het  om  honderde  duisende  mense  met  weinig  of  geen
vergoeding van hul eiendom te vervreem.

Herhaalde uitsprake van die agb President en  die  Minister  van  Grondsake,
dat grondhervorming in Suid-Afrika binne die voorskrifte  van  die  Grondwet
én volgens  die  bepaling  van  die  wet  sal  geskied,  word  doodeenvoudig
geïgnoreer, of eerder, nie vertrou nie. Aan diesulkes het  ek  'n  boodskap:
die ANC en sy voorgangers ken  die  onregverdigheid  en  ongeregtigheid  van
kolonialisme en apartheid. In sy boesem dra hy die  sweet,  bloed  en  trane
wat  voortvloei  uit  ongeregtigheid.  Sy  strewe  was  na   demokrasie   en
geregtigheid, nie na wraak en vergelding nie. Inderdaad is die boodskap  van
die ANC een van inklusiwiteit - Suid-Afrika behoort aan al sy  mense,  swart
en wit. Kom op die speelveld, word deel van die volkskontrak om  Suid-Afrika
vir almal 'n beter plek te maak én 'n beter lewe te verseker.

Ek daag almal uit wat voorheen bevoorreg was om ook  'n  kontrak  te  sluit,
dit wil sê  'n  vaste  verbintenis,  om  te  verseker  dat  die  oneweredige
besitpatroon van grond in Suid-Afrika  reggestel  word.  As  daarin  geslaag
word om suksesvolle nuwe boere op 'n volhoubare basis  te  vestig,  sal  die
vrese van bestaande boere  vir  altyd  besweer  word.  Hierdie  ANC-beheerde
Regering was en is, en sal  altyd  'n  verantwoordelike  regering  bly.  Ons
steun  graag  dié  wetsontwerp.   [Applous.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr Chairman, this Bill will secure the right of use and occupation  of  the
dwellers on communal land. In essence, therefore, it refers to the  land  of
the former homelands and  other  isolated  areas.  Although  it  principally
refers to the right of use and occupation aspect of  land  reform,  it  also
relates to certain elements of redistribution. In  clause  38  the  Minister
is, inter alia empowered to purchase and obtain land  for  the  purposes  of
the Act, or consistent with article 3 of  the  Promotion  of  Administrative
Justice Act, 2000, expropriate land, a portion of land or a right in land.

These  powers  of  expropriation  of  the  Minister,  as  set  out  in   the
Restitution and Land Rights Act, are nothing sinister. However,  it  is  not
surprising that in certain ranks, for  example  the  Transvaal  Agricultural
Union and the DA, a hysterical uproar erupts - as we have seen  just  now  -
every time the word ``expropriation'' is  used.  It  should  be  seen  as  a
reflex reaction to where the  apartheid  government  used  expropriation  to
alienate hundreds of thousands of people from their land with little  or  no
compensation.

Repeated statements by the hon President and the Minister of  Land  Affairs,
that land reform in South Africa will take place within the  regulations  of
the Constitution and according to  the  provision  of  the  Act,  are  quite
simply ignored, or rather not trusted. To those I send a  message:  The  ANC
and its predecessors know the injustice  and  inequity  of  colonialism  and
apartheid. In its bosom it carries the sweat,  blood  and  tears  that  flow
from injustice. Its aim after democracy and  justice  was  not  revenge  and
retribution. Indeed, the message of the ANC is one of  inclusivity  -  South
Africa belongs to all its people, black and white.  Come  onto  the  playing
field, become part of the people's contract to make South  Africa  a  better
place for all and to ensure a better life.

I challenge everyone who had been  privileged  before  also  to  conclude  a
contract, that is to say a firm  commitment,  to  ensure  that  the  unequal
pattern of land tenure in South Africa can be rectified. If  we  succeed  in
settling successful new farmers  in  a  sustainable  manner,  the  fears  of
existing farmers will be allayed for ever. This ANC-led Government  was  and
is and will always be a  responsible  government.  We  gladly  support  this
Bill. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you,  Deputy
Chairperson. It remains for me to thank the great majority  of  the  members
who participated here. It's quite enjoyable  to  get  the  type  of  support
which we received. I especially want to thank the hon Ngema,  and  also  say
``hallelujah'' that we are here, and that they support  the  Bill.  We  will
have to talk a lot more in the future.

The hon Seeco referred to the problem of betterment areas. I can assure  her
that we have a good communication plan available. The  issue  of  betterment
areas is one of the great problems we have in these  traditional  areas.  It
led to a lot of bitter problems with the  people.  What  basically  happened
was that some of those people who had five hectares had to come  down  to  a
quarter of a hectare so that profit-making harvesting could take  place.  In
other places, where this did not happen, there was no real participation  of
the communities - this was done  autocratically  and  technocratically,  and
actually contributed largely to the destruction  of  subsistence  and  self-
sufficiency in the traditional areas. We have to attend to that also in  the
context of this Bill when we implement it.

But,  of  course,  as  always,  the  great  disappointment  has   been   the
performance of the DA. Regarding  the  hon  Maluleke,  perhaps  one  of  his
senior  Chief  Whips  should  tell  him  that  Question  Time  is  something
different to the debates we have  when  we  debate  Bills.  [Interjections.]
Then,  of  course,  my  old  friend  hon  Botha  was  talking  about  latent
paternalism, and then he went on and demonstrated the  open  paternalism  of
the DA, especially when  he  wants  to  push  ultra-individualism  down  the
throats of people who have a completely different culture. The only  message
he really gave was that he is against the culture of the majority of  blacks
in South Africa. [Interjections.]

Now, he also got on that old horse - and rode it again  -  of  expropriation
in the restitution Act, which is completely irrelevant  to  the  context  in
which we are now. He also talked about the drought,  which,  if  I  were  to
answer him on that, the Chairperson here  would  have  to  rule  me  out  of
order, because that is not the subject today.

Let me put it like this.

Wat ek miskien moet sê, is my agb vriend het wel in  'n  stadium  sy  bladsy
verloor, maar teen die einde van sy toespraak het hy kop  verloor.  [Gelag.]
Volgende keer hoop ons dit gaan beter. [What I should point out is  that  my
hon friend lost his paper at some stage, but towards the end of  his  speech
he lost his head. [Laughter.] We hope he will fare better next time.]

I couldn't finish my main speech earlier - I had started to  quote  Gramsci.
So I will close with that. Gramsci said in one of his letters  from  prison,
and he used the following words: ``The old is dying and the  new  cannot  be
born; in this interregnum a  great  variety  of  morbid  symptoms  appear.''
Today we  have  seen  the  morbid  symptoms  demonstrated  by  the  official
opposition.  Today  we  bury  what  I  call  the  heart  of  apartheid   and
colonialism, and today the new-order land rights can be born. I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
