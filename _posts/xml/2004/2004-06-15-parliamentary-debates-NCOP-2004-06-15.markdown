                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the Council I shall move, on behalf of the IFP:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that a hijacker was shot dead in Pretoria  earlier  this  week,
       after being involved in a shoot-out with police;


  (2) further notes that the hijack victim stopped a patrolling police  car
       and within seconds the police gave chase; and


  (3) acknowledges that police visibility is effective and it does  have  a
       major impact on combating the unacceptably high  level  of  crime  in
       South Africa.

Ms D ROBINSON: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  on  the  next
sitting day of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  National Youth Day is to be celebrated tomorrow, 16 June;
       (b)  alcohol plays a role in over half of homicides and  76%  of  all
           stabbings;


       (c)  in 2000, up to half of the people charged with  family  violence

(Translation of isiZulu draft resolution follows.)
[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I hereby  given  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of this Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) is taken aback by -


       (a)  the appalling hijacking of a taxi that was full of passengers at
           Helpmekaar  Road  and  which  was  travelling  from  Zakheni  to
           Ladysmith on Wednesday, last week;


       (b)  the fact that three males who were in a  Toyota  Corolla,  which
           had been hijacked as well, followed the taxi until it reached an
           intersection where they hijacked it;


  (2) notes that –


       (a)  three criminals forcefully  boarded  the  taxi  and  shoved  the
           driver to the back seat;


       (b)  during this altercation  the  hijackers  shot  and  killed  four
           passengers and wounded six;


       (c)  the taxi owner who just happened to come across the incident and
           tried to assist  was  shot  and  injured,  and  that  the  three
           criminals ran away and disappeared into thin air;


       (d)  that among the injured passengers  was  one  accomplice  of  the
           hijackers, and that that came to light when they  were  admitted
           to hospital;


  (3) is shocked to learn that all of this took place while the  owner  was
       inside his own car, but could do nothing;


  (4) expresses its condolences to all those befallen by this calamity;


  (5) expresses its appreciation that the  justice  department  is  hunting
       down these hijackers and passenger attackers; and


  (6) appeals to the justice system that  it  should  deal  with  criminals
       mercilessly in order to protect drivers and passengers.]

  SPORTING ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SPRINGBOKS, HESTRI CLOETE AND ROY SABBATINI

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the Springboks' victory of 31-17 over  the  Irish  in  decisive
       fashion;


  (2) further notes that Hestrie Cloete, our world-famous high jumper,  won
       an event in Europe last week;


  (3) also notes that Rory Sabbatini,  yet  another  South  African  golfer
       making his mark in the United States, tied for  first  place  in  the
       prestigious Buick  Classic  in  New  York,  unfortunately  losing  to
       Spain's Sergio Garcia in the sudden death play-off;


  (4) wishes to place on record its congratulations to these South  African
       stars on their victorious performances; and


  (5) further wishes the Springboks yet another sparkling  display  in  the
       second test against the Irish this Saturday at Newlands, Cape Town.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of policy)

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry:

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  The  hon  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,
Minister Mpahlwa, you are welcome in  this  House,  and  congratulations  on
your appointment as the new Minister of Trade and Industry.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you very much, Madam  Chairperson,
for those kind words. I would like to recognise  members  of  the  executive
councils of provinces who are here - I've seen  MEC  Lynne  Brown;  I  don't
know if there are others. Hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  allow  me  to
start by congratulating all of you on your election to the National  Council
of Provinces. In particular, I would  like  to  congratulate  the  MECs  for
economic  development  who  have  been  appointed  and,   in   some   cases,
reappointed, in each province.
This afternoon the Council deliberates on the budget of  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry, the DTI. We should not see this Budget Vote today  as  a
routine matter of business to be discharged as quickly as  possible.  Budget
Votes are  an  opportunity  for  hon  members  to  scrutinise  the  work  of
departments and to ensure that this work will deliver on  the  mandate  that
the people of this country have given us:  a  mandate  to  create  work,  to
eradicate  poverty,  to  reduce  inequalities,  and   to   expand   economic
opportunities for all. Within the NCOP this scrutiny takes on an  additional
dimension. As representatives of South Africa's nine provinces,  members  of
this  Council  are  particularly  concerned  about  how  the  work  of   the
department will improve the economy of their province and region.

It is my intention to set out this afternoon the DTI's plans  for  the  next
five years to achieve an  objective  that  I  believe  we  all  share.  This
objective is to unlock the economic potential of  all  our  towns,  villages
and  communities,  our  different  regions  and  provinces,  so   that   the
geographic spread of economic growth and development is more equitable.

Hon members, today is the first time that I stand before you as Minister  of
Trade  and  Industry  and  it  is  my  wish  that  we  can  develop  a  good
relationship between the National  Council  of  Provinces  and  the  DTI.  I
believe that a firm foundation for  this  has  been  set  at  the  level  of
officials, and I trust that over the next  five  years  we  will  have  many
fruitful interactions on those matters that are important to those who  have
elected us.

Our Constitution enshrines the  principle  of  co-operative  governance  and
compels the three spheres of government - national, provincial and  local  -
to work together in a co-operative spirit to provide a better life  for  all
South Africans. In  the  first  10  years  of  our  democracy  we  sometimes
struggled  to  give  this  important  constitutional   principle   practical
meaning. We sometimes  struggled  to  define  the  roles  of  the  different
spheres  of  government,  especially   where   the   Constitution   assigned
concurrent responsibilities to national and provincial  government.  Matters
including   gambling,   liquor,   small-enterprise    promotion,    consumer
protection, and trade, are both national  and  provincial  responsibilities.
Problems over jurisdiction  have  arisen  sometimes,  resulting  in  service
delivery gaps and even legal disputes.

There have  been  instances  in  which  responsibilities  were  assigned  to
provincial or local government before the required capacities and  resources
were in place. Government's  10-year  review  asks  two  critical  questions
about co-operative governance as we move  into  the  second  decade  of  our
democracy. Firstly, how do we balance the need  to  put  into  practice  our
common national vision while respecting the constitutional autonomy of  each
sphere of government in critical areas of delivery?  Secondly,  and  perhaps
more controversially, could we  conceive  of  an  asymmetric  allocation  of
powers and functions in those cases in which the capacity to  perform  those
powers and functions is weak?

Often, we have competed with one another to land large  investment  projects
rather than working together for  the  benefit  of  South  Africa.  We  have
duplicated  activities,  setting  up  more  than  100  economic  development
agencies across the three spheres  of  government.  Almost  every  province,
city and municipality has its  own  investment  promotion  agency,  its  own
economic development agency, tourism agency,  and  so  on.  Some  have  even
opened up offices in foreign cities - a very expensive undertaking. We  have
created confusion in the minds of investors and in  the  minds  of  economic
citizens as they are faced  with  a  myriad  of  possible  organisations  to
approach when they require support.

Does an enterprise wanting to invest in  the  Coega  Industrial  Development
Zone deal with the DTI, or with the Coega Development Corporation,  or  with
the  Eastern  Cape  Development  Corporation,  or  with  the  Eastern   Cape
department of economic affairs?  Investors,  exporters,  small  enterprises,
consumers,  co-operatives,  black  businesses  and  entrepreneurs  are   not
interested in the different roles and  functions  of  the  various  entities
that make up Government.  They  are  interested  in  getting  assistance  as
quickly and as simply as possible.

This is a challenge that we must address over the next few  years.  We  must
work towards the goal of providing economic citizens with  a  one-stop  shop
to economic development support wherever they may  be  in  the  country.  We
should consider, as a short-term goal,  introducing  a  single  call  centre
number that links all our economic departments and agencies.

We also need to develop a better understanding of the specific products  and
services  offered  to  economic  citizens  by  the  different   spheres   of
government and their agencies. Our first task in this regard  should  be  to
compile  a  catalogue  of  all  of  the  products  and  services   that   we
collectively offer to economic citizens.

Ten  years  later  the  legacy  of  apartheid  is  still  evident   in   the
distribution of productive and sustainable  economic  activities  throughout
South Africa. Eighty percent  of  South  Africa's  manufacturing  output  is
produced  in  six  metropolitan  areas.  The  unequal  access  to   economic
opportunities that  continues  to  mark  the  South  African  landscape  has
contributed to massive migration to the urban centres over the past  decade.


According to the census, which was released last year, more than 20% of  the
people living in metropolitan areas, and in some  of  the  regional  centres
and small towns, are new migrants from rural  areas.  As  a  result,  severe
pressure is being placed on infrastructure and  service  delivery  in  these
urban areas. This trend has contributed  to  the  unemployment  problem,  as
many African women from rural areas have,  upon  moving  to  urban  centres,
sought formal employment opportunities, thus expanding  the  size  of  South
Africa's economically active population  faster  than  new  jobs  are  being
created.

The mainly rural provinces of Limpopo, as well as the Eastern  and  Northern
Cape, are experiencing a fairly  rapid  loss  of  often  young  and  skilled
people,  hampering   their   ability   to   take   advantage   of   economic
opportunities. The challenge of the  two  economies  is,  in  many  ways,  a
challenge  of  overcoming  the  continued   skewed   pattern   of   economic
development.

In our sector of work, we  have  seen  that  certain  economic  sectors  are
concentrated in certain parts of South  Africa.  The  automotive  sector  is
concentrated in three provinces: Gauteng,  the  Eastern  Cape  and  KwaZulu-
Natal; whereas the chemical industry is located in  every  province,  except
for the Limpopo province. The Greater Johannesburg region is  home  to  most
of the bigger call centres in  South  Africa,  followed  by  Cape  Town  and
Durban; while two-thirds  of  the  boat-building,  shipbuilding  and  repair
sector is located in the Western Cape. Fifty percent  of  the  clothing  and
textile sector is also based in the Western Cape,  with  some  clothing  and
textile manufacturing also taking place in Gauteng, the  Eastern  Cape,  the
Free State and KwaZulu-Natal.

These patterns  are  not  static,  and  there  are  trends  that  show  that
potential does exist for new investment to take place in other parts of  the
country. For example, the agriprocessing sector has,  until  recently,  been
located mainly in the traditional  manufacturing  centres  of  Gauteng,  the
Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal, to be close to the larger domestic  markets
and to be near to the  main  ports  for  exports.  However,  with  consumers
demanding fresher produce there is a trend to locate  agriprocessing  plants
closer to the site of agricultural production. Subsequently, there has  been
an increase in agroprocessing facilities established in the Free State,  the
Eastern Cape, and the North West. However, this trend is being  hindered  by
the absence of appropriate infrastructure  and  an  undersupply  of  skilled
workers.

Not every sector can be  equally  represented  in  every  province.  Certain
types of manufacturing need to be located close to natural resources,  mines
and farms; or close to ports and other  logistics  infrastructure  close  to
major markets. Nevertheless, the potential does exist  for  certain  sectors
to develop more of  a  presence  outside  of  the  big  three  provinces  of
Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The agriprocessing sector is  a
good example of this.

The Government is implementing several programmes to address this  continued
distortion in the development of our economy, including  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme  and  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme.
Provinces are implementing  provincial  growth  and  development  strategies
while every municipality has an integrated development plan.  Unfortunately,
there are too many examples in which these various plans and  programmes  do
not link up in a coherent manner, or in which we  are  failing  to  leverage
synergies from working together  in  a  more  co-ordinated  way.  Also,  the
programmes and plans tend to  lack  economic  content.  Focus  is  correctly
placed on service delivery, infrastructure needs and social development.

However, insufficient attention  is  given  to  understanding  the  economic
potential that exists in every municipality and in the 21  urban  and  rural
nodes,  and  how  this  potential  can  be  unlocked.  Do   the   integrated
development plans of municipalities in  Limpopo  and  Mpumalanga  take  into
account the trend evident in the agriprocessing sector and include steps  to
address the  infrastructure  and  skills  constraints?  The  role  of  local
governments in providing an environment  that  is  conducive  to  productive
economic activity needs to be emphasised and  reflected  in  the  integrated
development  plans,  including  the  zoning  of  land  for  industrial   and
commercial purposes, rates and service charges, and the  delivery  of  basic
utilities.

In strengthening the role of local government in  economic  development,  we
need to think about how  we  strengthen  the  role  of  the  local  business
community and chambers, and trade union and other  community  structures  to
partner with municipalities. The emergence of a  unified  business  movement
in South Africa with last year's launch of Business Unity SA, or  Busa,  and
the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of SA, or Chamsa, is to  be  welcomed.
Strong and effective partnerships for delivery require strong,  unified  and
capacitated partners. In recognition of this,  the  DTI  will  be  assisting
Busa and Chamsa financially in the short term.

We are also supporting the trade union movement and have seconded  a  senior
official to the SA Clothing and Textile Workers Union  for  three  years  to
work on projects aimed at the development of our clothing sector.  The  DTI,
through its community-public-private partnership  programme,  has  developed
an excellent  model  for  forming  partnerships  with  communities  for  the
purposes of economic development and employment  creation.  This  successful
programme  brings  together  communities,  traditional  leaders,  provincial
governments, local authorities  and  the  DTI  in  initiating  and  managing
various projects in the ecotourism, mariculture and cut flowers sectors,  as
well as small-scale mining and agriprocessing. More  than  8  500  new  jobs
have been created, mostly in rural areas, through this programme.

It is absolutely essential that we in the National Council of Provinces,  as
policy-makers and lawmakers, understand where economic  activity  is  taking
place in our country and how these activities can be expanded. To assist  in
this work, the DTI  is  prioritising  the  compilation  of  a  comprehensive
economic map of South Africa, a map that indicates where  economic  activity
is taking place; where the power stations  and  dams  are  located;  through
which towns and communities the railway lines and  major  roads  run;  where
the mines, farms and factories are situated;  what  land  is  available  for
agriculture, mining, manufacturing and commercial use; and  the  cities  and
large towns that  have  universities  and  further  education  and  training
colleges, fresh produce markets and airports. This is  critical  information
for us to use in our economic planning.

The  department  will  work  with  provinces,  local  government  and  other
national departments in the economic and employment cluster.  This  work  is
one of the DTI's flagship projects for  the  2004-05  financial  year.  This
means that we have prioritised this project and given  it  a  non-negotiable
status within the department. We have allocated additional resources to  the
project and will be closely monitoring implementation.

The DTI will continue its work with its provincial  and  local  counterparts
on the industrial development zones. An  amount  of  R100  million  will  be
transferred  to  provincial  and  local   governments   to   fund   critical
infrastructure development around these IDZs. We are  also  working  closely
with the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Council  in  the  Eastern  Cape  and  a
range of stakeholders to unleash the enormous  potential  of  this  part  of
South Africa.

Another project that the DTI has worked on that  has  an  important  spatial
dimension is the construction of the DTI's new campus in the Sunnyside  area
of Tshwane. This world-class development, funded  through  a  public-private
partnership, was implemented in such a way  that  the  surrounding  area  is
being  upgraded.  The  private  sector  is  following  the  DTI's  lead  and
developing new retail centres and housing in what was a  part  of  the  city
that had been redlined by commercial banks.

Much of South Africa's economic infrastructure  was  put  in  place  in  the
1960s and 1970s and is now inadequate  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  modern
economy. The Government has committed itself to investing  R100  billion  in
public infrastructure over the next five years. As the  President  indicated
in his  state  of  the  nation  address  a  few  weeks  ago,  infrastructure
investment plans will be developed by October this year. It is crucial  that
we find the appropriate institutional  mechanism  for  provinces  and  local
authorities to participate in the development of these plans.  Not  only  do
we need to ensure that the infrastructure needs  of  our  different  regions
are met, but also that the development of this infrastructure uses,  as  far
as possible, labour-based construction methods so as to provide  significant
employment opportunities for many people.

The President has eloquently set out the two economies paradigm  in  several
addresses to joint sittings  of  the  National  Assembly  and  the  National
Council of Provinces. It is not necessary for me  to  repeat  his  words.  I
would like to tell the Council about some of  the  important  projects  that
the DTI will be implementing  this  year  that  are  specifically  aimed  at
addressing the needs of economic citizens  caught  in  the  second  economy.
These are the department's flagship projects. I have spoken at length  about
the DTI's work to develop a geographic spread  strategy.  In  addition,  the
DTI will disburse the first loans to micro enterprises from  the  Apex  Fund
before the end of this year. Mainly rural African women  will  benefit  from
this fund. [Applause.]

We will merge Ntsika and the Manufacturing Advisory  Centres  to  provide  a
better  service  to  small  enterprises  around  the  country,  while   also
finalising options to provide economic citizens with easier  access  to  the
DTI and its agencies. Legislation will  be  introduced  to  Parliament  that
will extend enterprise support, particularly incentives currently  available
to manufacturing firms, to all sectors of the  economy.  New  incentives  to
support the film industry, back-of-office processing and call-centre  sector
will be launched in the next few weeks.

Legislation to provide an enabling environment for the  development  of  co-
operatives will also  be  introduced  to  Parliament  this  year.  Financial
support and technical assistance will  be  made  available  to  co-operative
enterprises. A considerable amount of work will be  done  to  implement  the
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act,  including  the  appointment  of
the members of the Advisory Council and publishing  various  codes  of  good
practice. The DTI will also  be  conducting  provincial  roadshows  on  this
subject.  The  National  Empowerment  Fund,  one  of  the  DTI's   agencies,
introduced new financial products  for  black-owned  enterprises  two  weeks
ago.

Another DTI flagship project for  this  year  is  reforming  South  Africa's
consumer credit law to provide more protection to consumers when  they  take
out loans or buy goods on hire purchase. A new consumer credit Bill will  be
tabled in Parliament in the first quarter of 2005. Consumer protection is  a
concurrent responsibility and is an area that has sometimes been  neglected.
A new consumer protection policy is being  finalised  by  the  DTI  and  the
policy will be debated with provinces in the next few months.

In all these areas of work it is imperative that we clarify  the  respective
roles and responsibilities of national, provincial and local  government.  I
intend to continue to build on the platform that was put into  place  by  my
predecessor, Minister Alec Erwin, in  this  regard.  In  the  previous  five
years,  the  DTI  embarked  on  an  extensive  intergovernmental   relations
programme and set up a directorate to manage this  programme.  More  regular
interaction with the other spheres of government  was  initiated,  including
visits by the DTI executive board to  provinces  -  the  leadership  of  the
Department of Trade and Industry, and they  are  sitting  up  there  in  the
gallery; quarterly meetings with MECs; an annual meeting of MECs,  executive
mayors of metro councils, the SA Cities Network and the SA Local  Government
Association; and an annual lekgotla to forge greater alignment  of  national
and provincial economic development strategies. These arrangements  will  be
continued, and we will seek ways to improve upon them.

Hon members, as you know, I joined the DTI from the National Treasury  where
the Minister of Finance frequently referred to the group of finance MECs  we
worked with as "Team Finance". Hon members and  MECs,  let  us  build  "Team
Economy" to give concrete meaning to the  constitutional  principle  of  co-
operative governance and to implement our common vision of an  economy  that
is   growing,   creating   jobs,   eradicating   poverty   and   eliminating
inequalities; an economy that is built on the  full  potential  of  all  our
people  and  of  all  our  communities,  towns  and  villages,  cities   and
provinces. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  now  call  Ms  N  Ndalane,  acting
chairperson of the Select Committee on Economic Affairs.

Ms N A NDALANE: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members  and  special
delegates, ladies  and  gentlemen,  on  14  April  2004  millions  of  South
Africans went to the polls for the third time  to  choose  the  organisation
that would carry their mandate, continue to transform our  country  and  our
continent and build a new world order. The majority of  our  people  elected
the ANC, because of the confidence they have  in  its  leadership,  policies
and programmes - that is, the liberation movement on behalf of  which  I  am
mandated to speak in this House today.

As we discharge our responsibilities, we must always remember the  strategic
objectives that we  set  for  ourselves  for  the  next  five  years.  These
objectives include increasing the contribution of small enterprises  to  the
economy;  making  significant  progress  in   broad-based   black   economic
empowerment; increasing the  level  of  direct  investment  overall  and  in
priority sectors; increasing market access opportunities for and  export  of
South African goods and  services;  contributing  towards  building  skills,
technology and infrastructure platforms from which enterprises can  benefit;
repositioning  the  economy  in  higher,  value-added  value   matrices   in
knowledge-driven  manufacturing  and  services;  and,  contributing  towards
providing accessible, transparent and efficient access to  redress  economic
imbalances.

On 21 May 2004,  President  Thabo  Mbeki  set  out  the  tasks  facing  this
administration. As a committee we have organised our  work  in  response  to
these  challenges  into  four  broad-based  areas:  maintaining   a   stable
macroeconomic environment and increasing the  level  of  investment  in  the
economy;  accelerating  the  implementation  of  the  microeconomic   reform
strategy; targeting interventions in the second economy;  and,  implementing
a  governance  strategy  to  strengthen  the  institutional   capacity   for
implementation, sequencing, monitoring and evaluation.

The department is planning to establish a microcredit Apex fund,  which  was
approved in the Cabinet lekgotla in 2003. This will contribute  towards  the
integration of the first and second economies of our country.  I  am  giving
the thumbs up to our strategies in continuing to support  or  empower  women
and the youth in the economy.

We must also focus our attention on developing new products and services  to
address the specific needs of economic  citizens  operating  in  the  second
economy. This will also require our focusing our energies on exploring  ways
of establishing partnerships with business chambers and local government.

The  President  raised  a  number  of  challenges  facing   our   Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy. The highlights of the state of  the  nation  address
noted the following: a declining share of global trade;  our  trade  balance
still needs importers of manufactured goods;  continued  job  losses  within
manufacturing; casualisation, subcontracting and informalisation;  decreased
demand for unskilled labour and increased demand for  skilled  labour;  and,
low productive investment. We strongly support the  crosscutting  strategies
to promote BEE, increase market access  for  our  goods  and  modernise  the
regulatory environment as part of our economic reform strategy. We  have  no
doubt that this department will achieve its objectives in the near future.

When the Minister addressed the  parliamentary  media  briefing  on  24  May
2004, he spoke at length about the platforms for  economic  development  and
growth. He said that as Government we were on track in  meeting  our  target
of 80 000 learnerships as per the Growth and Development Summit agreement.

We will be able to address the area of human  resources  development  as  we
have redirected our focus on scarce skills through Setas and the  additional
allocation of R400 million  that  will  cover  an  extra  105  000  students
through bursaries. The Minister also highlighted that we were also going  to
market learnership opportunities to school-leavers and graduates. This  will
be assisted by the  positive  engagement  of  provinces  in  their  economic
reform strategies.
Now that the MECs are here today, we hope to hear how they are  planning  to
manage the alignment of their plans with the  local  authorities'  plans  to
realise greater acceleration of the provincial economies. We  hope  to  hear
how provinces are going to stimulate  local  economic  development  so  that
these local authorities can indeed be developmental in nature.  This  Budget
Vote must look critically at this matter of human resources  development  if
we are to move in line with global economic trends.

The experience of the past 10 years has shown that rural provinces  find  it
difficult to attract investment. Our wish is to see more equitable  economic
development in all provinces. We think there is  a  need  to  be  biased  in
favour  of  rural  provinces  in  attracting  investment  for  the  sake  of
addressing the second economy,  because  this  is  the  area  in  which  the
majority of poor people are located. Some provinces,  such  as  the  Limpopo
province, have shown their readiness to attract investment  particularly  in
the fields of tourism and manufacturing. We call  upon  these  provinces  to
redouble their efforts in  seeing  to  it  that  they  add  value  to  their
economic strategies.

This department is clearly creating policies and programmes  that  are,  and
will, enable the economy to grow and expand the market both  internally  and
externally for our products and services. We  commend  this  department  for
exploring ways to grow the economy and set up new  people  in  business.  We
are  convinced,  as  a  committee,  that  this  department  has  the   right
priorities and that the budget and all its  programmes  are  geared  towards
the realisation of the policies and priorities.

In conclusion, we want to congratulate the  department  on  promoting  trade
and investment links with other African countries, on support for Nepad  and
on the establishment of the International Trade  Administration  Commission.
The  conclusion  of  nine  bilateral  trade  and  investment  treaties  with
countries in Africa and the Middle East in 2003 really put  our  country  in
the right position to deal with the global economic agenda.

Our committee supports this budget without reservations. I thank  you.  Ndza
khensa. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr  D  G  MKONO:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon   MECs,   hon   members,
distinguished special delegates from provinces and hon guests,  may  I  echo
the sentiments expressed by previous speakers and congratulate the  Minister
and the Deputy Minister on their appointments respectively,  and  wish  them
well and success in these challenging posts.  Chairperson,  you  will  agree
that the history of the ANC, which  I  am  privileged  to  represent  today,
cannot be written outside the context of the ceaseless effort of the  masses
of  our  people  to  break  the  shackles  of  colonialism,  with  all   its
ramifications.  It  is  therefore  prudent  that  I  begin  my   speech   by
pronouncing that the ANC supports this Budget Vote, because as  the  ANC  we
are acutely aware that democracy will not be fully realised if the  majority
of the population does not have access to and control of the economy.

The horrifying income disparities between the rich and  the  poor  countries
have unacceptably widened to dismal proportions in  the  past  few  decades.
Similarly,  the  majority  of   South   Africans   were   deliberately   and
institutionally denied access and participation by the  grandiose  apartheid
policies. The development and support for the SMME  programme  and  the  co-
operative sector  remains  a  priority  for  Government.  As  part  of  this
commitment,  it  is  the  Government's  mission  to   create   an   enabling
environment, which stimulates growth and development  of  small  businesses,
resulting in job creation and redistribution  of  wealth  and  shifts  small
businesses from the margins of our  economy  to  the  centre.  The  national
strategy for the development  and  promotion  of  small  business  in  South
Africa was presented to Parliament. The  objectives  of  the  strategy  are,
among others: the creation of a supporting environment for SMMEs;  aiding  a
greater spread of wealth and economic opportunities; creating and  upgrading
long-term jobs; and strengthening links between  big  and  small  firms,  as
well as rural and urban businesses.

One of the key  proposals  flowing  from  the  above  was  the  creation  of
institutions to ensure sustainable support to SMMEs. This strategy  involves
the restructuring of some of the existing institutions such as the  creation
of the Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency responsible for promoting and  co-
ordinating nonfinancial support services. These services include  enterprise
management  and  entrepreneurship;  training  and  access  to   information,
counselling, extension services, technology and  markets;  the  creation  of
Khula Enterprise Finance Limited responsible for administering the  national
credit guarantee scheme and also providing financial  and  capacity-building
support  to  NGOs,  provincial  development  corporations  and  banks;   the
creation  of  the  South  African  Women  Entrepreneurs  Network  to  assist
aspiring women entrepreneurs and also those who  are  already  in  business;
the creation of  the  Industrial  Development  Corporation  which  plays  an
increasingly important role in both supporting and  assisting  with  venture
capital in the formation of new SMMEs; the creation  of  business  partners,
the National Empowerment Fund Trust - the list is endless.

Mr Minister, having tabulated the above interventions by the  Government,  I
just want to caution: Please do not  be  surprised  and  please  do  not  be
disappointed to hear what some of the misguided political parties,  such  as
the United Democratic Movement  for  instance,  have  to  say.  The  UDM  is
neither united nor democratic and certainly  not  moving  for  that  matter,
deducing and demonising government  for  dismally  failing  South  Africans;
hence their slogan, "Ten  years  of  unemployment  undermines  the  people's
democracy". What do they know about democracy? Shame on them.

I do not want to say anything in this debate to offend  my  fellow  comrades
from other provinces, but in the Eastern Cape we share  the  view  that  the
South African economy is rooted in every village town, city and province  of
the country. However, the challenge of changing the  economic  landscape  of
the country is perhaps nowhere more imperative than  in  the  Eastern  Cape,
because, due to apartheid policies and historic distortions, inequities  run
deep  in  our  province  and  leave  trails  of   poverty,   exclusion   and
unemployment in rural areas as  well  as  in  urban  areas.  Therefore,  the
imperative to focus attention on the development  of  the  former  Bantustan
areas of our province  forms  the  basis  for  planning  and  searching  for
solutions. We remain acutely aware, as the Eastern  Cape,  of  the  critical
importance of speeding up delivery even in  other  provinces  as  well.  The
challenge, therefore, is to ensure  that  the  benefits  of  urban  economic
growth are extended to the rural hinterland through productive  forward  and
backward linkages that will stimulate primarily production  in  agriculture,
forestry, mining and fishing.

The role of Government in this respect is evidently clear  and  that  is  to
invest in critical infrastructure that provides  an  operating  environment,
which will attract and keep sustainable private sector investment.  But  one
fails to understand why - and this is the question we need to  ask  in  this
debate - after all these achievements by the ANC-led Government  there  this
perpetual campaign by the conservative DA and its allies that people  should
fight back? Fight back what? Even more worrying is the  shortsightedness  of
the DA to go out of its way to project a negative image of  our  country  by
giving the impression, and highlighting both  in  Africa  and  abroad,  that
crime is a major problem in  South  Africa,  and  that  we  have  the  crime
capitals of the world. They  even  tell  companies  to  disinvest  in  South
Africa and encourage them to rather go to  the  London  Stock  Exchange  and
Wall Street in USA - all because what is bad for South Africa  is  good  for
the DA. What a shocking naiveté.

Contrary to the DA's intention of chasing away investors by  creating  fear,
what is pleasing to see is that the people of South Africa  prefer  a  sober
and  constructive  opposition.  South  Africans   have   learnt   from   the
nonsustainability of apartheid and therefore they are  not  prepared  to  be
misled by the DA's ideology. In fact,  the  majority  of  white  people  are
incredibly happy to be here because they have a  chance  to  achieve  things
they could not have achieved elsewhere. In spite of all that rubbish by  the
DA, people see the ANC as their saviour, so we are a  formidable  force.  We
are proudly South Africans and we will succeed  in  our  endeavours  because
more than ever before, we are convinced that the tide  has  turned  and  the
people's contract for a better tomorrow is taking shape.

Ngamanye  amazwi  Mhlalingaphambili,  ngesiNtu  ngeba  ndithi  ngoobhobhoyi,
ngoochebintuli  noonkalimevana  kuphela  abangayiboniyo  le  nkululeko  yale

apha  ebelungwini.  Enkosi.  [Kwahlekwa.]  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation   of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[In other words, Chairperson, in my language I would  say  that  the  people
who do not see  the  freedom  of  the  last  10  years  are  ignorant,  wild
creatures and not human beings. I do not know what the old  people  like  Mr
Mzizi, with bald heads the size of a golf course, is doing  here  among  the
white people. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

Dr B MALAKOANE (Free State): Thank  you  so  much,  Madam  Chairperson.  The
Minister, MECs present, permanent delegates and special  delegates,  I  need
to  start  off  by  indicating  the  Free  State's  position  on  trade  and
investment promotion, which recognises broadening the economic base  as  one
of its main challenges, wherein key objectives have been  identified.  These
are  job  creation,  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of   poverty,   reducing
inequalities through empowerment or  affirmative  action,  and  the  overall
growth of wealth and skills development.

The key tools identified for usage include  the  trade  reform  process  and
access promotion; the encouragement of  small  and  medium  enterprises  and
black economic empowerment promotions through  partnerships;  enhancing  and
enabling  foreign  direct  investment;  encouraging  the  practice  of  fair
competition within a specified regulatory framework; and  integrating  human
resource development, preferential procurement and  supply-chain  management
as economic development tools. Supply-chain management within  itself  needs
to be recognised as a tool that has to foster and influence joint  ventures,
SMME promotion and black economic empowerment, and as a  tool  that  can  be
used as a means to promote and regulate competition with a particular  bias.
Other tools are the promotion of skills development, including  occupational
skills and adult-based education and training  for  affirmative  action  and
employment;  the  support  of  innovative  research  and   development   for
competitiveness  and  social  benefit  within  specified   growth   sectors;
intergovernmental relations at provincial and local government  levels,  and
interdepartmental relations within provincial governments.

Regarding the growth sectors in support of a growing economic  base  in  the
Free State, as we recognise them,  the  Free  State  Provincial  Growth  and
Development Summit that was held last year agreed that the effective use  of
sector  strategies  based  on  sector  co-ordination  and  partnerships   in
identified sectors was needed to restructure the provincial economy  towards
equitable  and  employment  creating  growth.  Sectors  such  as  the  agri-
industry,   petrochemical    upstreaming    and    downstreaming,    mineral
beneficiation,  tourism  development  and  promotion,   and   infrastructure
development through the Expanded Public Works  Programme  are  sectors  that
need to be hugely penetrated, promoted and developed, through  the  creation
of access to finance and support from a variety of programmes, such  as  the
Agricultural Credit Scheme, the Apex Fund, the  National  Empowerment  Fund,
development and investment co-operations, which in our case is the FDC,  the
Umsobomvu Fund, and  by  co-operatives,  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,
companies and individuals.

Our province's value chain in this economic review process  entails  looking
at the macroeconomic stability in terms of which our country has achieved  a
level of macroeconomic stability not seen in a period  of  about  40  years.
This has created opportunities for real increases in expenditure  on  social
services and a reduction in costs and risks for all investors, as  a  result
laying  the  foundation  for  increased  investment  and  growth.  Therefore
attracting foreign direct investment into the country in  general,  and  the
Free State in particular through sound information packages and  information
management becomes a sine qua non, particularly because of  the  inclination
of the media to portray the  South  African  story  as  a  confusing  drama,
rather than a saga of steady improvement.

On the investment front the country's foreign  direct  investment  has  been
positive on balance, and foreign investments have been seen in such  sectors
as the motor vehicle industry, the  chemical  sector,  and  the  mining  and
dairy product sectors. Over and above that, since the beginning of the  year
2000 there has  been  an  improvement  in  net  foreign  direct  investment,
including greenfield investments, wherein there  are  major  investments  in
new projects and plants.
Regarding growth and wealth, since 1994 there's been little over 1% of  real
per capita growth and South Africans  grew  wealthier  at  a  rate  slightly
faster than 1% per year. This may be viewed as an unspectacular  performance
compared with most developing countries, but it  has  been  steady.  On  the
employment front, from the period 1995 to 2002  over  1,6  million  net  new
jobs  were  created.  During  the  same  period,  a   slight   increase   in
unemployment of approximately 2 million people was observed. A key point  to
note is that, while many  unskilled  workers  are  unemployed,  there  is  a
shortage of suitably qualified workers, which is a constraint on  expansion.
Skills sets  often  identified  as  those  in  short  supply  are  financial
services, information and communication technology skills.

On the  trade  reform,  industrial  restructuring  and  policy  fronts,  the
reshaping of trade and industrial  policies  is  reflected  in  an  improved
balance of trade and in a shift from primary exports  to  tertiary  exports.
These achievements are due to the Government's  success  in  supporting  and
promoting multilateral rules-based global trading regimes  and  the  use  of
general and targeted  supply-side  measures.  Key  initiatives  include  the
negotiation of the SACU agreement, the negotiation of  the  SADC  free-trade
agreement, the negotiation of bilateral trade and aid  agreements  with  the
European Union, and the aiding of South African  exports  through  the  AGOA
provisioning. These activities are contributing to new  trade  activity  and
to new foreign direct investment in South Africa and  the  provinces  up  to
local government level.

Therefore, state leverage, in this regard, is  an  economic  imperative  and
has to be done through relevant deals, and should  be  supported.  The  Free
State  does  do  so.  Export-orientated,  efficiency-seeking   manufacturing
investment has been actively promoted,  in  order  to  generate  employment,
skills transfer and the stimulation of innovation in local firms.  This  has
to be continued and encouraged. The Free State is ready and is on course.

Government has encouraged investment in Africa and domestically through  the
liberalisation of capital controls; and the economic diplomacy in  expanding
and deepening economic ties with Africa and the  global  community  has  led
this country to making a strong commitment to  promoting  the  interests  of
the African continent. The provincial  governments  have  joined  the  party
with their trade missions, and the Free State is also  a  player.  This  has
led to trading networks and export markets with our strategic  partners  and
traditional trading partners. This process has  to  continue  and  be  taken
further for the benefit of all. This has to be done through and  within  the
context  of  SADC  and  Nepad,  and  this  will  provide  a   coherent   and
comprehensive  development  agenda  on  social  and  economic  policies  and
behaviour, and will filter through to all the provinces.

The trilogy of government in terms of national and provincial  and/or  local
government and civil society and  the  business  community  as  partners  in
black economic empowerment, especially in those areas  that  depend  on  the
private sector and civil society attitudes and behaviour for investment  and
employment creation, has to be amplified and  vigorously  activated  through
the reactivation of the National Development  Agency,  the  Umsobomvu  Fund,
etc, and new tasks have to be incorporated into  its  existing  work,  which
might lead to medium-term gains.

It remains important to clarify the focus of strategies with respect to  the
different sectors of the SMME  community  in  which  the  formal  sector  is
relatively stabilised  and  largely  within  the  first  economy,  with  the
informal and grey sectors progressively increasing and found  mainly  within
the second economy. The experience with regard  to  SMME  creation  in  this
regard is reflected in the very modest impact  that  Khula,  Ntsika,  Namac,
the Umsobomvu Fund and the Small  Business  Council  have  been  making  and
doing in this regard. This is commendable, and much more  has  to  be  done.
Therefore,  intergovernmental   and   interdepartmental   relations   within
provinces in this regard have  to  be  promoted.  It  is,  therefore,  these
sectors that are in the second economy that  need  assistance  and  support,
and that's where our people, in the majority, are operating.

In conclusion, the national economic priorities are comprehensive,  coherent
and co-ordinated. That is why the national Government  has  been  successful
in ensuring macroeconomic stability; in  improving  trade  regimes;  and  in
taking advantage of  the  country's  natural  resources,  and  physical  and
financial infrastructure; and provincial and local governments have to  take
the baton and run with it.

There is an opportunity to contribute and add more value,  to  reduce  South
Africa's risk rating even further, through robust marketing strategies.  The
global economy will continue to have implications for the domestic  economy,
and we are on course to be a cut above many. This is a cherished  ideal  and
because South Africa is smart we  shall  prevail.  We  support  this  Budget
Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, all protocol observed, the DA  has  welcomed
the relaunch of the National Empowerment Fund, NEF,  as  long  overdue.  The
over-riding ambition of the NEF must be truly  broad-based  empowerment.  It
must successfully create access to the economy  to  those  who  suffered  an
inhuman denial of opportunity under apartheid, and who still suffer  a  lack
of opportunity today, because this  Government  has  failed  to  create  the
conditions necessary for more rapid economic growth.

The new vision for the NEF will allow it to be  used  as  a  tool  to  shift
empowerment from being focused on a lucky few millionaires and  billionaires
to the courageous and hardworking ordinary  South  Africans  who  alone  can
spur enterprise and growth in our country. The original focus of  the  fund,
namely to provide investment scheme  trusts,  would  have  resulted  in  the
creation of a handful and super-wealthy black business  people  -  just  the
type of individual empowerment that has been propagated through  recent  so-
called BEE deals.

Thus, the relaunched NEF will only succeed if its focus is on the  provision
of financial support for employee share schemes  and  community  and  rural-
based projects and co-operatives. While we applaud the positive  effect  the
fund should have on the funding of South African  business  development,  we
are wary of the confusion that could stem from the  launch  of  yet  another
financing agency.

The Department of Trade and Industry needs urgently to review  and  simplify
the plethora of financing  and  business  support  agencies  established  in
recent years. The system as it is  currently  structured  creates  confusion
and is inefficient. Consider, for example, the incomprehension of a  budding
businesswoman seeking Government support as she  faces  the  NEF,  the  IDC,
Khula, Ntsika and the Apex  Fund.  In  2002  Minister  Erwin  suggested  the
formation of an integrated financing agency, a one-stop shop, to  deal  with
this very problem. I am grateful to hear that the new Minister took  up  the
suggestion, and I hope  that  he  will  pursue  it  to  its  very  necessary
conclusion.

Finally, I want to deal  with  a  further  point.  Unemployment  is  without
question the biggest problem facing South Africa today,  because  it  drives
poverty and crime, and denies  the  people  of  our  country  hope  for  the
future. The Government needs to adopt a bold new attitude  to  economic  and
employment growth, and that means tackling the  microeconomic  obstacles  to
job  creation,  the  most  important  being  the  rigidity  of  our   labour
regulations.

We need to follow the example of developing countries  like  China,  Mexico,
Mauritius and Malaysia, and establish export-processing zones in  which  the
costs to investors are significantly slashed. These zones  will,  therefore,
attract foreign direct investment and spur job creation, initially  in  low-
paying, low-skill jobs, but over  time  in  better-paying  and  more  highly
skilled jobs. The DA has been calling for such an initiative for  years.  We
do so because EPZs will provide a ladder  up  into  the  first  economy  for
those in the second economy.

Tomorrow is Youth Day, and if there is one thing  that  we  as  leaders  and
public representatives owe the youth of our country it is the prospect of  a
future in which they will be  able  to  fulfil  their  dreams.  Without  job
creation today, that future is impossible. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I am just laughing at  the  side  comment  here.
The hon member  from  the  DA  had  the  audacity  to  call  me  a  comrade.
[Laughter.]

An HON MEMBER: Are you ashamed of that?

Mr K SINCLAIR:  No, I am certainly not ashamed. When I contribute  today,  I
want to speak on behalf of my province.  I  do  not  want  to  degrade  this
debate to a political debate, but rather uplift it to a  provincial  debate.
When I speak, I speak on behalf of 822 000 people  who  are  living  on  361
square kilometres, which is a  third  of  the  geographical  area  of  South
Africa. I speak on behalf of a province that has  an  official  unemployment
rate of 14,4%,  a  province  that  is  rich  in  minerals  and  agricultural
activities, but a  province  that,  because  of  various  reasons,  has  not
achieved its rightful position in the South African economy.

The two economies that our President referred to,  and  which  the  Minister
referred to here today, are indeed prevalent in our province,  the  Northern
Cape. The Northern Cape has lots of potential.  We  have  the  climate,  the
water, the people, the space, but above all, we have the will to  achieve  a
better life for all our people  in  the  province.  Our  province  also  has
international  borders  with  Namibia  and   Botswana,   and   it   has   an
underdeveloped West Coast of more than 400 kilometres.

The issue I want to raise today is: How does the Northern Cape fit into  the
bigger picture of  the  South  African  context  regarding  development  and
development corridors and zones?  When  we  look  back  regarding  what  has
happened in the past 10 years,  it  is  good  and  well  that  Gauteng,  the
Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and also the Eastern Cape were put  on  the  map
regarding economic activities.

The question that I want to raise today is: When will the time  arrive  that
there will also be a real will and a strategic objective to move  away  from
the planning of boardrooms  to  the  reality  of  the  Northern  Cape?  This
department must be the standardbearer for development.  The  people  of  the
Northern Cape are very grateful for what the department  has  already  done,
but hon Minister, if you look at the poverty and the unemployment levels  in
our province, it is certainly not enough. The two economies are prevailing.

Therefore, Minister, I want to plead here today that the DTI must embark  on
a renewed approach to also make the Northern Cape  part  of  the  mainstream
thinking and the activities of the new economy. Our province is situated  in
a very good position. Angola, as a country, is in the  process  of  revival.
Many of the products to  Angola  from  South  Africa  must  go  through  the
Northern Cape.

Part of the reality of the economy of our province is that value- adding  to
raw products is taking place outside our province.  Regarding  that,  it  is
essential  that  Government  must  take  a  principled  decision  to  launch
initiatives that make it  worthwhile  for  investors  to  add  value  to  an
abundance of raw products, also in the Northern Cape.

When will the day come that the Northern Cape will also have its own  Coega,
Iscor and manufacturing plant? These are the sorts of  questions,  Minister,
which the people of the Northern Cape are asking. We must  acknowledge  that
all the people in the Northern Cape  cannot  be  small  farmers,  miners  or
people involved in some sort of SMME  activity.  The  reality  is  that  the
Government must make a principled decision about the Northern Cape  and  its
importance, and there must be a major economic injection in our province.

The DTI and institutions like the  IDC  and  initiatives  like  the  public-
private partnerships are positioned to contribute towards  creating  wealth,
and through that improving the  quality  of  life  of  the  people  of  this
province. I, therefore, in conclusion, hon Minister, want to plead with  you
today, let us also put  the  Northern  Cape  on  the  economic  map  of  our
country. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members,  MECs,  special
delegates, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, as this is my  maiden  speech,  I
firstly want to acknowledge and thank the  ANC  for  the  affording  me  the
privilege of serving in this hon House.

Vision 2014 of the ANC manifesto states that focus should be placed on:


  ... the measures that can and will set our country on the road to  faster
  realisation of the ideals of our Constitution - a free South Africa  that
  truly belongs to all who live in it, a South Africa whose wealth is  used
  to improve the quality of life of all citizens and a  South  Africa  that
  works with humanity to build a better Africa and a better world.

Therefore, the  quest  to  accelerate  economic  growth  and  job  creation,
accompanied by an equitable and fair distribution of  the  benefits,  serves
as the overall objective for the Government and the Department of Trade  and
Industry. In order to engage in a meaningful discussion on  the  subject  of
South Africa's second economy and the important  role  that  the  DTI  plays
therein, I believe one has to  define  the  components,  namely,  the  South
African economy in terms of its neighbours and the rest  of  the  continent,
and the concept known as the second economy.

South Africa has a gross domestic product four times that  of  its  Southern
African neighbours, which equals approximately 25%  of  the  entire  GDP  of
Africa. This country leads the continent in industrial  output  and  mineral
production, and South Africa also generates most of Africa's  electricity  -
more than 50%.  Before and since 1994 the ANC based  its  economic  policies
on the ``ready to govern'' and  RDP  documents,  wherein  the  key  economic
objectives were identified as job creation, the elimination of poverty,  the
reduction of inequality, and  the  overall  growth  of  the  wealth  of  the
country.

General approval of  these  policies  for  managing  the  economy  has  been
increasing from around 45% in 1999 to 53% in 2003. This was  also  confirmed
by the overwhelming victory at the ballot box, and support for the  people's
contract. We must therefore congratulate the DTI for the leading  role  they
played in this regard. The South African economy is made up  of  two  parts,
the first economy and the second economy. The first economy behaves  like  a
developed  economy  that  includes  those  elements  that  are  increasingly
integrated into the global economy,  where  people  are  formally  employed,
whether full-time, part-time or are subcontracted; in other words they  earn
a living.

The second economy is  made  up  of  small  entrepreneurs,  who  are  owner-
managers and suppliers of services and products to the  first  economy,  the
informal sector and the rural women who apply their  skills  to  feed  their
families. People  in  this  sector  are  largely  making  a  living.  It  is
therefore important to distinguish between earning a  living  and  making  a
living. There are  significant  signs  that  Government's  new  thinking  is
organised around the concept of two economies.

In his February 2003 state of  the  nation  address  President  Thabo  Mbeki
described the division between these two economies as  structurally  faulty.
The one economy is modern  and  relatively  well  developed.  The  other  is
characterised by underdevelopment and an entrenched crisis of  poverty.  The
second economy, he argued, is structurally disconnected from the first,  and
is incapable of self-generating growth and development.

What is required, he suggested, is state intervention through  a  series  of
programmes  such  as  microcredit   for   the   poor,   intensified   skills
development, and a massive public works programme. In other words, there  is
a need to transfer resources to the second economy to  empower  the  working
poor and those in the informal sector.

It is in the rural areas, where job opportunities are few and  far  between,
that the establishment of a business is the only  option  available  to  the
unemployed. Critical areas that need  intervention  include  the  following:
access to nonfinancial support and information, access  to  finance,  access
to markets, skills development and mentoring.

We  notice  with  interest  that  the  Department  of  Trade  and   Industry
identified flagship projects, which, according to the Director-General,  are
non-negotiable, that will be delivered on before the end of  this  financial
year. These include  finalising  the  credit  law  reform  process,  merging
Ntsika and  the  manufacturing  advice  centres  into  a  single  enterprise
development agency, disbursing the first loan of the Apex Fund  targeted  at
micro-entrepreneurs, implementing a cooperative  development  strategy,  and
implementing the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Strategy.

On the question of black economic empowerment, it is critical to  understand
the magnitude of the systematic and purposeful exclusion of the majority  of
South Africans from the economy by the apartheid system,  to  enable  us  to
appreciate why we need to act  together  as  a  nation  to  bring  about  an
economic transformation in the interest of all. Any  suggestion  that  South
Africa does not need  the  black  economic  empowerment  strategy  therefore
shows complete lack of insight.

I do not think this is rocket science; I think the  DA  should  listen  very
carefully. One of the exciting new projects initiated by the  Department  of
Trade and Industry is  the  implementation  of  a  co-operative  development
strategy, where persons  could  voluntarily  join  together  to  meet  their
economic,  social   and   cultural   needs   through   jointly   owned   and
democratically  controlled  enterprises   established   on   the   following
principles; self-help, self-reliance, self-responsibility, equality,  equity
and democracy.

Co-operatives could play a  significant  role  in  eliminating  poverty  and
creating jobs in the development nodes identified by the  President  in  his
state of  the  nation  address  earlier  this  year.  Provincial  and  local
governments have an important role to play in  ensuring  that  co-operatives
are developed and supported in their areas.  I  would  therefore  appeal  to
provincial  and  local  governments  to  give  full  support  to  this   new
initiative and to give this programme every chance of success,  which  would
lead to effective and sustainable job creation in rural areas in  the  short
and medium term.

One of the main challenges in the development of the second economy  remains
the concept of integrated development planning,  and  is  one  of  the  most
important  instruments  of  co-ordination  between  provincial   and   local
governments. Such co-ordination is critical since service  delivery  by  all
spheres of government comes together at the local government level.

In conclusion, South Africa being the land of  opportunity  therefore  needs
to  develop  a  culture  of  entrepreneurship  that  matches  the  so-called
American dream. We need to translate our passion for sport  into  a  passion
for doing business. The initiatives of the DTI, I believe, go a long way  to
creating the necessary environment, and  to  stimulate  entrepreneurship  in
South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P G MASAULLE (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, pardon  my  inability  to
manipulate this technology. Hon Minister, hon MECs present and  hon  members
of this House, it really gives me pleasure to participate  in  this  debate.
May I, from the onset, Madam Chairperson, echo your words by  congratulating
the Minister  and  the  Deputy  Minister  on  their  appointment.  There  is
something that is so sweet about it. I do not know what  it  is,  but  every
time that it is said, it really makes us feel good. I thought  I  needed  to
say it once again.

The President of the country and the Premier of our province, guided by  the
masses  of  the  people  of  this  country,  have  clearly  mapped  out  the
challenges ahead of all of us. I dare say that what remains is  for  all  of
us to put our shoulders to the wheel and get  our  country  going.  This  is
what, as the province, we have  undertaken  uncompromisingly  to  pursue  in
order to deal with the challenges of job-creation, poverty  eradication  and
growing the economy of our country.

In welcoming this budget presentation I want to assure the Minister  of  our
unqualified support. We are particularly  pleased  about  his  reference  to
continuing in  the  footsteps  that  have  been  laid  by  his  predecessor,
particularly as it relates to intergovernmental operation. That,  we  think,
is at the centre of all the progress that we could achieve, and  I  want  to
say that he is assured of our support.

As a province, consistent with the rest of the country, we  are  not  immune
from some of the economic features that have been identified.  We  also,  on
the one hand, have areas that are highly developed industrial  centres  that
have the ability to compete in the global economy, as  well,  on  the  other
hand, as areas that are backward,  isolated  and  underdeveloped.  We  think
that it is quite appropriate to lift this out, so as to develop  appropriate
interventions to deal with those situations.  We have accordingly sought  to
create the necessary synergies.
I was not worried at all, in fact I was pleased, when  the  Minister  raised
the  question  of  all  of  this  taking  place  in  the  context  of  local
municipalities  that  have  local  economic  development   initiatives   and
district municipalities that have  integrated  development  plans.  We  have
developed a provincial growth and development plan that takes  into  account
all those plans, so as to create the necessary synergies, so that we do  not
have the situation as captured in the Minister's  remarks.  But,  indeed,  I
think it is further refining and doing much work in those things  that  will
ensure that we will perfect it.

We have identified particular areas that  we,  as  a  province,  think  need
particular attention and indeed  we  are  giving  such  attention  to  those
areas. Recognising that two thirds of the population is  nonurban  and  that
the province is  only  20%  food  self-sufficient,  we  have  undertaken  an
exercise with which we think, through co-operation,  we  would  be  able  to
maximise the benefits from such a massive food production programme that  is
aimed at increasing  food  production  in  our  rural  households.  We  have
targeted such areas as O R  Tambo  District  Municipality,  Alfred  Nzo  and
Amathole because of the agricultural potential that is  found  within  these
areas.

Critical, though, in these  efforts,  is  the  imperative  of  creating  and
promoting a cadre of viable black commercial farmers. In  this  respect,  we
think that access to land, access to market information and credit  are  but
key instruments that will help us leverage the potential in this regard.  We
do hope that through  initiatives  like  the  Apex  Fund,  as  well  as  the
Agricultural Credit Scheme, we shall be able to breed success  for  ventures
of this nature in order to promote growth in  the  agricultural  sector,  as
well as provide the much needed  employment,  providing  raw  materials  for
some initiatives,  which  I  think  the  Minister  has  made  reference  to,
agroprocessing, and indeed to those  industries  that  are  reliant  on  the
natural resources.

Another  component  which,  together  with  the  Department  of  Trade   and
Industry, has been embarked upon, is that which has to  do  with  the  motor
industry development plan, and indeed we think we have reached a  point  now
where we  are  articulating  very  sharply  and  indeed  in  sync  with  the
Department of Trade and Industry.

In terms of industrial diversification, we  think  that  in  those  existing
centres, particularly the Nelson Mandela Metro and  Buffalo  City  where  we
have such high growth and export-led manufacturing industries,  we  can  now
do more in terms of ensuring that we expand the supply chain and ensure  the
emergence of micro and medium enterprises in the motor manufacturing side.

We think that it is an area that will enhance the competitive edge  that  we
have in that respect, and indeed again we are seeing successes  in  this  as
reliant upon  continued  support  and  partnership  amongst  all  the  role-
players, particularly the role that has to be played by central  Government.


We have two industrial development zones, IDZs,  in  the  province.  In  our
view  they  have  the  potential  not  only  to  increase   foreign   direct
investment, but also to increase our exports, but we  do  think  that  their
success will have the benefit of expanding the local economy.  We,  however,
want to raise a few things which we  think  are  in  keeping  with  the  co-
operation that exists. If those opportunities are further  looked  into,  it
will indeed help to expedite some of these.

The President has spoken about the  need  to  make  sure  that  we  look  at
reducing the input costs in terms of ensuring that we are  able  to  attract
investment, etc. We think that rail transport can play a major role in  that
respect, particularly for areas like  Coega.  We  do  think  that  the  rail
linkages, particularly between the  Northern  Cape  and  our  province,  are
crucial and have to be looked into in the same  way  as  the  rail  linkages
between East London and Johannesburg. We think that through  these  we  will
be able to maximise the benefit in  term  of  those  economic  opportunities
that we have in these areas.

The continuing high-level support of these initiatives is always  heartening
and highly appreciated. Only today  we  read  in  the  newspapers  that  the
Minister of Public Enterprises is committing  that  with  or  without  Alcon
there will be a smelter in Coega. That is the good  news  for  the  province
and  for  the  rest  of  the  country,  but  we  know  that  it  is  through
collaborative efforts that we are able to have such levels of confidence  in
terms of where we are going. We are quite appreciative of those.

The hon Minster has already raised the question  of  ensuring  we  synergise
our activities between local municipalities, and I have  made  reference  to
that. We think that it's an area where we could do much more to perfect  it,
but already we have begun to work on  it.  The  Minister  is  most  welcome,
through the avenue that he has created, to assist  in  ensuring  that  those
yield the results that we expect. We could sound as though we are  repeating
ourselves, but once again I wish to say that,  as  a  province,  we  support
this Vote, and we are looking forward to working with the Minister and  this
department. Thank you very much.

Mr M N RAJU: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon colleagues,  my
party welcomes the hon Minister's assurances in respect of establishing  and
sustaining partnerships  with  private  agencies,  traditional  leaders  and
community institutions. Such private-public endeavours  by  the  DTI  are  a
sure recipe for greater  unity  of  purpose  and  a  deepening  of  economic
strengths for the ultimate benefit of all South Africans.
We support the Minister's call to the provincial MECs, local  unicity  metro
councils and other role-players to strengthen  co-operative  governance,  so
that every citizen in every quarter of South Africa  will  feel  part  of  a
joint endeavour to improve  the  quality  of  our  lives.  Furthermore,  the
Minister's plans to launch a team economy to  enhance  the  concept  of  co-
operative governance is welcomed, and  my  party  wishes  the  hon  Minister
every success in his endeavours in this regard.

We wish to underline the  importance  of  the  empowerment  of  workers.  If
growth and investment is to be speeded up,  workers'  skills  and  expertise
are important areas  of  focus.  Growth  and  development  require  improved
education, training and skills enhancements.  Progress  in  social  security
and job-creation contribute to economic development.  We  call  for  greater
levels of consumer awareness, consumer protection and consumer education.

The Minister in his speech reported  the  department's  intention  to  merge
Ntsika and manufacturing advisory centres to provide  a  better  service  to
small  enterprises  and  to  make  DTI  facilities  easily   accessible   to
economically  active  citizens.  My  party  fully  supports  these  laudable
initiatives and urges the Minister  to  ensure  that  these  incentives  and
initiatives are adequately  disseminated  to  the  broad  public.  The  good
intentions of the hon  Minister  must  not  falter  at  the  altar  of  poor
communication and poor education. The  people  must  be  informed  and  made
aware of the good news that the ministry wishes to send to the people.

Our global  economic  strategy  is  trade,  and  economic  development  must
consider sustainable growth as its departure  point.  South  Africa's  broad
industrial strategy cannot be developed in  isolation,  relations  with  the
rest of Africa, SADC countries, Nepad  and  with  developed  and  developing
trading partners is a sine qua non for substantive economic progress.

Policy development in international trade must continue to be  strengthened.
And here it is heartening to note, for instance, that exports to India  have
risen by 25%. Negotiations with States such as Brazil and Nigeria must  bear
fruitful  results  to  create  work  opportunities  for   unemployed   South
Africans.

It is no surprise that Africa forms  the  focus  of  South  Africa's  global
economic strategy. Partnerships with countries within the Continent must  be
considered vital and strategic. It is a matter of concern, however, that  in
2002, for  instance,  approximately  16%  of  South  Africa's  exports  were
destined for the rest of Africa, but  unfortunately  the  imports  from  the
continent were not commensurate, being  only  about  4%  of  South  Africa's
total imports. Multilateral economic relations are  also  important  in  the
world scheme of economics. The World Trade Organisation in partnership  with
Bretton Woods Institutions, the World Bank and the  IMF  have  been  setting
the parameters for  and  directing  the  economic  policies  of  governments
around the world.

This has had serious implications for the content, evolution and  trajectory
of  economic  development  strategies  pursued  by   developing   countries,
including  South  Africa.  As  the  process  of   globalisation   has   been
questioned, it is imperative for South Africa to  influence  and  shape  the
configuration of the emerging system of  global  governance.  This  is  best
done by participation, actively and effectively, in all multilateral  forums
for maximum benefits accruable,  not  only  to  South  Africa,  but  to  the
African Continent as a whole. The IFP supports the Vote. Thank you, Chair.

Mrs P C NGWENYA: Thank you, Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  MECs  from
the various provinces who are here, hon members of the NCOP and  colleagues.
Jerry Eckert, then a visiting professor  of  development  economics  at  the
University  of  Cape  Town  during  1991,  wrote  about  changing   economic
conditions in South Africa. He said:


  Major economic change within  South  Africa  will  flow  from  two  basic
  sources. First is the vital need for economic  transformation  that  will
  sustain the  political  process  now  underway.  Most  political  parties
  espouse  the  common  goal  of  a  non-racial  democratic  society.  This
  seemingly simple goal predetermines much of the direction and content  of
  the economic transformation.


  For democracy to be more than a sham, with vested  power  entrenched  and
  concentrated by economic rather than political rules,  the  bulk  of  the
  population must  feel  that  they  have  equal  access  to  the  economic
  mainstream and that it is treating  them  fairly.  Existing  inequalities
  must  be  closed  until  remaining  differences  reflect  true   marginal
  productivities.
Since inequalities in South Africa are defined along racial lines,  economic
parity is also required for the goal of a nonracial society. This  was  said
three years before the first democratic elections in 1994. If we  look  back
at the ten years of our democracy, what do  we  see?  We  definitely  see  a
country whose new democratic government has managed to deal with  the  deep-
seated structural problems in the economy inherited in  1994.  The  DTI  has
been responsible for reintegrating South  Africa  into  the  world  economy,
thus improving the country's competitiveness. The  change  in  the  economic
strategy from an inward looking economy  towards  an  export  driven  growth
strategy, led the exports growing at a rate of 25% between 1996 and 2000.

Our exports are diversified to ensure that we do not rely on  exporting  raw
materials, but that a substantial  proportion  of  raw  materials  is  being
processed locally, thereby adding  value  and  determining  prices  locally.
Indeed, 1999 value-added manufactured exports were contributing 24%  of  the
total exports. From 1995, passenger vehicle exports rose by 37% every  year,
while the export of  motor  vehicle  components  has  increased  by  31%  on
average. The success of the motor industry  development  programme  and  the
fact that through this programme our country is the  only  producer  of  the
BMW 3 series in the  world,  is  another  achievement  that  has  been  made
possible by the commitment of our  Government,  through  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry, to ensure that our economy is  modernised  and  has  the
capacity to deliver export products that meet global standards.

This is a success story that I believe must not be  undersold  and  must  be
made  known  to  our  nation,  especially   to   the   younger   generation.
Manufacturing in general has grown by 5,4% and our  South  African  products
are competing well against their First World counterparts -  such  as  South
African wine, meat products, motor vehicles and  motor  vehicle  components,
to name but  a  few.  The  nature  of  trade  agreements  reached  with  the
developed First World, championed by the Department of Trade  and  Industry,
have resulted in an enabling macroeconomic environment  which  manifests  in
reduced inflation and steady interest rates.

In the first decade of our freedom, the DTI has increased  the  contribution
of small entrepreneurs to the Gross Domestic  Product.  Yet  the  challenges
remain enormous and some, like  capacity  building,  will  be  addressed  by
measures such as the planned merger of Namac and Ntsika as announced by  the
President in the state of the nation address.

More than 726 small entrepreneurs have thus far  benefited  from  the  Small
and Medium Enterprise Development Programme. Only  the  lack  of  access  to
finance must be addressed as  this  remains  one  of  the  serious  problems
confronting  the  SMMEs  at  the  grass-roots  level.  The  DTI   has   made
significant progress in broad-based black  economic  empowerment.  Today  we
have a strategy and a broad - based BEE Act in place. Although today we  not
only speak of black millionaires, but also of black  billionaires,  ensuring
that broad-based empowerment remains a  serious  challenge  confronting  our
Government, and the DTI in particular.

The DTI has increased market access  opportunities  and  exports  for  South
African goods and services. During this period, 3 000  exporters  have  been
assisted through the Export Marketing and Investment Assistance Scheme.  The
DTI's response to the constraints  in  the  regulatory  environment  was  to
entrench  the  principle  of  equality,  where  all  citizens   are   equal,
irrespective  of  sex  or  their  geographical  location.  The  department's
activities  have  therefore   impacted   upon   overall   economic   output,
employment,  the  establishment  of  women-owned  BEE  enterprises  and  the
equitable geographical spread in investment within South Africa.

The introduction of co-operatives will,  over  and  above  everything  else,
ensure that the poor no longer have their hard-earned  savings  swindled  by
unscrupulous  pyramid  schemes,  but  this  will  also  ensure  that   these
processes are further deepened, especially with a specific  focus  on  rural
economic  development.  It  is,  therefore,  our  democratic  duty  as  true
patriots to encourage the DTI to aim for  greater  heights  as  the  country
still needs more employment opportunities,  and  more  economic  growth  and
development. The key objectives of  the  DTI  over  2004-2005  to  2006-2007
remain very relevant and must be pursued with more vigour and these are:  To
increase  the  contribution  of  small  enterprises,  particularly  to   the
economy; to significantly take forward the broad-based BEE; to increase  the
level of direct investment in the manufacturing  and  services  sectors;  to
increase market access to opportunities for  and  export  of  SA  goods  and
services; to contribute towards  the  building  of  skills,  technology  and
infrastructure  platforms   from   which   enterprises   can   benefit;   to
repositioning   the  economy  in  the   higher   value-added   segments   of
manufacturing and services; and  to  contribute  towards  the  provision  of
accessible, transparent and efficient  access to redress and fair  and  just
recourse for economic citizens such as consumers.

The track record of the DTI thus far in  meeting  its  objectives  is  ample
evidence that the budgets over the years have  thus  been  well  spent,  and
will therefore still  be  well  spent  in  the  coming  years.  I  therefore
recommend that the proposed budget for the DTI be fully supported.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms S CHEN: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members  and  guests,  this
is my maiden speech in this great House. I am very glad to be part  of  this
team  and  I  would  like,  first,  to  congratulate  the  Minister  on  his
appointment to lead the Department of Trade and Industry.
The DA has thus far been extremely impressed by the Department of Trade  and
Industry's presentation of economic  policy  and  would  therefore  like  to
congratulate the department on a job well done. Of  course,  it  is  in  the
careful implementation and execution of sound policies that success  can  be
ascertained and the benefits filtered down to grass  roots,  to  where  they
really matter. The DA would therefore like to  wish  the  Minister  and  his
department prosperous success in the service delivery  associated  with  the
policies and offer our assistance where required.

In line with the announced  policies  of  the  DTI,  we  believe  that  some
suggestions can be made that will further  contribute  to  and  enhance  the
existing policies and regulations. I will briefly outline  the  suggestions.
An important section of the DA's economic policy refers to the employing  of
unskilled labour in South Africa. This  is  an  imperative  concern  in  our
country and a major contributor to our  extreme  unemployment  problem.  The
first part of the solution is to create an environment attractive  to  large
foreign investment and local entrepreneurship. This  will  stimulate  demand
for labour in manufacturing and production.

To  address  this  issue,  the  DA  suggests  the  establishment  of  export
processing zones, or EPZs. An EPZ is an area of land that is demarcated  for
the development of industries geared specifically towards export. The  major
aim of an EPZ is to decrease unemployment among  semiskilled  and  unskilled
citizens in South Africa, while at the  same  time  increasing  productivity
and investment in the country.

For EPZs to be attractive to  business  they  will  need  to  offer  several
incentives. These will include efficient and  effective  issuing  of  import
and export licences;  tax  holidays  for  certain  periods  or  special  tax
deductions; duty-free imports of  machinery,  equipment  and  raw  material;
exemption from legislated minimum wages and more onerous labour  laws;  work
permits issued to foreigners offering expertise; and the provision  of  off-
shore banking facilities.

South Africa has often been criticised for having a dual economy  and  being
both a First World and a  Third  World  country.  This  situation,  however,
offers us advantages over other developing  countries  in  that  we  already
have   a   sophisticated   economic   and   political    system,    superior
communications, financial  and  logistics  infrastructure,  and  a  visitor-
friendly environment. Implementing EPZs will be  that  much  easier  for  us
because we have this existing infrastructure.

Many previously developing countries have  already  benefited  from  such  a
model,  and  one  such  example  is  Taiwan,  Republic  of   China.   Taiwan
established the world's first economic processing zone  in  the  1960s.  The
purpose of their policy was to balance industrial development, increase  job
opportunities and slow down the migration of the population  from  rural  to
urban areas - goals very much applicable to us as well. To date, three  such
EPZs have been established and more than US$600 million  has  been  invested
in Taiwan as a result of the establishment of the EPZ programme.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, hon member!

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Hon Chair, will the member take a question?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, can you take a question?

Ms S CHEN: Okay, I'll try.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: She must not try; we want a very satisfactory  answer.  I
want to know which country on  the  African  continent  succeeded  with  the
concept she is speaking about.

Ms S CHEN: I apologise; I didn't hear you. Could you repeat  your  question?
Thank you.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: For the sake of progress Chairperson,  I  will  relay  my
question and ask it outside the House. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Continue, hon member.

Ms S CHEN: Thank you. Can I carry on? [Interjections.] To date,  three  such
EPZs have been established and more than US$600 million  has  been  invested
in  Taiwan  as  a  result  of  the  establishment  of  the  EPZ   programme.
Furthermore, the three zones combined have created almost 70 000 jobs.  Such
EPZs offer a shortcut for developing countries like South  Africa  that  are
marching towards industrialisation. Around the world  many  other  countries
such as India and China have already begun to implement this model.

South Africa is no  doubt  a  unique  country  with  attributes  and  issues
different to many others. Nevertheless, we can learn from  other  countries'
success and adopt a model  that  we  can  customise  to  suit  our  specific
requirements and meet our needs. Hon Minister, the DA urges you to  consider
our suggestion and make additional  yet  substantial  contributions  to  our
economy, increase job opportunities and reduce poverty and  unemployment.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon member. Let me welcome  the  hon
Minister in the Presidency, hon Mr Pahad. You are  always  welcome  in  this
House. [Applause.] I also want to welcome the hon Mr Gibson in the  gallery.
[Applause.] I hope in the next term he will  be  part  of  this  NCOP  as  a
member in this House, and not sit in the gallery.

Ms L BROWN: Thank you, Chairperson. Madam Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson,
Minister of Trade and Industry, Minister in the Presidency, my  fellow  MECs
and members of the NCOP, comrades and friends,  the  Western  Cape  welcomes
the DTI budget speech and we commit ourselves as a province to  continue  to
build and deepen co-operative and developmental government within all  three
spheres of government so that we ensure that the  quality  of  our  people's
lives is bettered. In fact, it's a constitutional obligation,  but  you  are
probably wondering why I raise it here again. This is the  first  time  that
the Western Cape is under an ANC government.  [Applause.]  So  it  is  very,
very important for us to restate that.

The commitments and programmes that the DTI will embark on  this  year  will
help us in the Western Cape to  give  substance  to  the  mandate  that  our
people gave our government during the elections. I  am  pleased  that,  very
broadly, our vision and programmes in the  Western  Cape  are  aligned  with
those of the DTI.

The government in the Western Cape, and my  department  specifically,  finds
itself in the frontline  in  the  battle  to  create  sustainable  jobs  and
economic  growth.  Everything  we  will  do,  naturally,   will   contribute
considerably to reducing poverty and creating a  better  life  for  all  our
people.

The challenge to implement the right policies that lead to job creation  and
economic growth is therefore enormous. Fortunately my predecessor,  now  the
premier, Ebrahim Rasool, has done much work  to  ensure  that  we  have  the
broad banner of IKapa Elihlumayo - growing the Cape, sharing the Cape  -  as
a provincial developmental strategy to stimulate the economy.

One of the biggest challenges we have in the Western Cape at the  moment  is
unemployment and it stands at around  24%,  which  roughly  translates  into
something like 500 000 people. Of those 500 000 people, mainly in  townships
and rural areas, 80% are young people. In general there are fewer  jobs  for
lower-skilled workers and the decline in employment opportunities  for  this
group continues.

We really need to realise - and it  gives  us  an  opportunity  now  as  the
Western Cape government - that we need to ensure  that  we  intensify  black
economic empowerment and that we intensify the programmes around  small  and
medium  enterprises,  so  that  we  can  grow  our   economy   through   our
microeconomic interventions. If we don't  do  this,  our  economy  will  not
realise its full potential.

But I think perhaps more critical is the fact that we need  to  address  the
very low success rate for African job  seekers  in  the  Western  Cape.  The
actual provincial rate is about 10% of the national figure for  African  job
seekers. So three out of 100 African job-seekers  will  get  a  job  in  the
Western Cape, and 30 out of 100 coloured job-seekers will get a job  in  the
Western Cape.

Against this backdrop the centrepiece of our work in the Western  Cape  this
year will therefore be to develop and continuously update  a  comprehensive,
detailed,  intellectually  sound  and   widely   agreed-upon   microeconomic
strategy for the province, which will inform all interventions made  by  the
provincial government of the Western Cape in the economy.

We are also tasked with implementing major interventions  flowing  from  the
microeconomic strategy in conjunction with our  social  partners  and  other
spheres of government in a manner that crowds in all available domestic  and
international resources required for success.

Our  microeconomic  strategy  and  the  provincial  growth  and  development
strategy processes will yield provincial strategies and  interventions,  and
this will be done in mainly five categories. Firstly, there will be  sector-
based  interventions.  They  will  be  at  the  primary  level,   which   is
agriculture,  aquaculture  and  associated  value   chains,   manufacturing,
clothing,  textiles,  leather,  metals,  engineering,  boat  building,  ship
repair, the oil and gas service hub, etc. On the service level  it  will  be
tourism, call centres and  business  process  outsourcing,  information  and
communication technology and, of course, film.

Then there will be theme-based interventions and we  will  have  to  develop
strategies and interventions  on  the  following  crosscutting  themes  that
contribute significantly to global competitiveness in  all  sectors.  So  it
would  be  innovation,  new  materials,   new   technology,   a   provincial
manufacturing technology strategy, design and industry,  energy,  logistics,
HIV/Aids, ICT, e-commerce, and a high-tech and an HRD  strategy  that  deals
with the lower skill levels as well as  people  who  are  unskilled  in  the
formal sense.

Thirdly, there will be the economic participation  interventions  and  these
would generally have to deal with equity issues, which will include  several
comprehensive strategies and interventions,  including  the  areas  of  BEE,
women's economic empowerment, youth economic  empowerment,  empowerment  for
people with disabilities, rural dwellers and workers.

Fourthly,  we  have  economic  stimulation  interventions  which  facilitate
increased   market   access,   particularly   into   Africa;   scoping   and
dimensioning; large  industrial  projects  for  the  purpose  of  recruiting
investment; and setting up the  capacity  to  maximise  the  finance,  donor
funds, incentives and grants available  to  our  provincial  businesses.  We
will  assist  provincial  businesses  to  land  provincial,   national   and
international contracts to supply  goods  and  services.  We  will  play  an
active role in optimising all public spending in  the  province  to  achieve
maximum bang for the public buck.
Fifthly, of course, we have regional development initiatives. We  will  have
to focus our work in such a way that  we  contribute  significantly  to  the
Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme,  the  Urban  Renewal
Programme and the Presidential nodes. Those would be, broadly, some of  what
will inform the microeconomic strategy. Then, once the partners have  agreed
on the appropriate interventions, we will  scope  and  dimension  these  and
play a  key  role  in  getting  as  many  social  partners  as  possible  to
contribute towards the resources needed to translate these into action.

Besides these, there are several ongoing major interventions which  we  will
continue to drive. For example, in the BPO and  call  centre  areas  we  are
planning a major international investment promotion drive. We  believe  that
there is a unique opportunity to secure up to 20 000  jobs  in  this  sector
over the next five years. Thus far in the last two years we've been able  to
secure 7 000 jobs.
We have entered into a partnership with the DTI, the  rooibos  tea  industry
and some of the best patent lawyers you can find in the land to ensure  that
we get back the name ``rooibos'' from the company that  has  copyrighted  it
in the United States of America. The DTI has  established  an  oil  and  gas
service hub strategy task team, which is working closely with our  own  Cape
Oil and Gas initiative. Together we are targeting  a  significant  share  of
the African West Coast oil and gas  service  and  supply  business.  We  are
confident that we will soon be on a path towards significant  investment  in
the rig building and repair business.

Rapid progress is being made with the  R450  million  film  studio  project,
which is anticipated to come on line in 2006. We are driving a process  that
will lead to the completion of a feasibility study  for  a  passenger  liner
terminal in Cape Town. We are  rolling  out  a  provincial  version  of  the
Advanced Manufacturing  Technology  Strategy,  which  we  hope  to  complete
within this year.

In the SMME and black economic empowerment  arena,  we  are  rolling  out  a
strategy called RED, which stands for Real Enterprise Development, and  this
will  entail  a  single  entry  point  for  those  who  seek  to   establish
enterprises or are seeking help with  developing  existing  enterprises.  At
full operation there will be an office in every municipality. We  have  also
set ourselves the target of raising and maintaining a R50  million  business
development fund to deal with the serious  problems  related  to  access  to
finance and support for those who fall  outside  the  financial  eligibility
criteria set by the banks.

Hon Chairperson, the  Western  Cape  supports  the  Budget  Vote  and  looks
forward to working with the Minister during his term of office.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mrs M P THEMBA: Thank you, Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  Minister  in  the
Presidency, hon MECs, hon special delegates and hon members.  I  don't  want
to waste time on the hon Tereblanche because I see that  she  is  still  too
young to deal  with.  During  the  apartheid  regime  she  and  her  family,
brothers and sisters benefited from job reservation. I just want  to  direct
her  to  read  the  document  called  "Fast  Facts".  From  there  she  will
understand what BEE focuses on.

This budget will provide us with an opportunity to reflect on  the  progress
that has been made during the first decade of freedom in addressing  one  of
the cruellest apartheid legacies. I am referring to the exclusion  of  women
playing any meaningful role in the economy under apartheid.  I  assume  that
the DTI's advertisements, both in the printed and electronic  media  on  the
opportunities which the department offers our  people  to  start  their  own
businesses, is taken seriously.
In reflecting on the progress, I think it is appropriate  to  recognise  the
important contribution which the department of Trade and Industry  has  made
through its Gender and Women Empowerment Unit in helping  women  to  realise
and unlock their business potential. This unit has played  a  critical  role
in terms of the implementation, co-ordination and monitoring of  initiatives
aimed at empowering the South African economy. The first decade  of  freedom
has  been  about  identifying  the  barriers  to  economic  empowerment  and
entrepreneurship faced by women.  It  has  largely  been  about  creating  a
legislative  and   policy   framework,   within   which   we   can   address
institutionalised gender inequalities in  the  economy.  These  inequalities
have resulted  in  women  predominating  in  the  low-skilled  and  low-paid
occupations,  where  they  were  generally  paid  less   than   their   male
counterparts.

Underpinning the broad policy framework for empowering our  economy  is  the
BEE strategy. The BEE Act seeks to provide support, particularly for  women-
owned enterprises to access finance, increase the number of  women  who  own
and manage existing and  new  enterprises,  and  increase  their  access  to
infrastructure and skills training.  In  line  with  the  BEE  Act,  several
transformation charters have  been  promulgated  while  others  are  in  the
pipeline. One of the key objectives of the  transformation  charters  is  to
kick-start  gender  transformation  in  the  South  African   economy.   The
Financial Services Charter, for example,  envisages  that  by  2010  women's
representation at executive level in the financial  services  sector  should
stand at 4%, while at middle and junior levels, the figures  should  be  10%
and 15% respectively.

In the marketing and advertising charter, 51% of the industry should  be  in
the  hands  of  females  by  2006.  As  women  we  must  ensure  that  these
percentages do not become mere wish lists, but that companies  are  actually
monitored  and  kept  to  their  promises.   These   targets   have   become
particularly significant in the light of  the  results  of  a  recent  study
commissioned by the Business Women's Association, and sponsored by  Nedbank,
measuring the status of women in co-operative leadership.  The  study  shows
that while women make up 52% of the adult population in South  Africa,  they
make up only 41% o the working population and constitute only 14,7%  of  all
executive managers.

With regard to the issue of directorship positions, of the 3  125  positions
only 221 are held by women. Only 11 women hold chair or board positions  out
a total of 364; and there are only 7 female CEOs and MDs  in  comparison  to
357  men  in  the  same  positions.  According  to  the   Business   Women's
Association, this is simply not good enough. The study recognises  the  fact
that government has set bench-marks with the strong appointment of women  in
government and across the public sector,  but  the  private  sector  is  not
following the example set by government. There  are  many  constraints  that
keep women out of business. The critical areas that will have  to  be  given
attention, if we are indeed to achieve this targets and move women from  the
periphery into the mainstream of the economy, are to provide them  with  the
necessary information,  skills,  technology  and  networks  to  share  their
skills.

Our ANC government's response to  these  constraints  was  to  entrench  the
principle of equality, namely, that all citizens are equal  irrespective  of
race or  sex  within  our  economic  discourse.  This  principle  has  found
expression through the various programmes which  the  DTI  has  implemented.
Hon Chair, allow me to give  a  few  examples.  Together  with  the  private
sector, the South African Women Entrepreneurs  Network  was  established  to
advocate for the improvement of the  regulatory  environment  for  women  in
business. SAWEN is represented in all nine provinces, but it's up to  us  as
public representatives to  take  it  through  to  the  rural  parts  of  our
provinces.

The DTI supports the programme called  Technology  for  Women  in  Business,
which is aimed at encouraging women to access and use  technology  in  order
to increase the strength of their business. The  success  of  the  programme
can easily be gauged by its growth into several  sectors,  namely,  minerals
and energy, IT and ICT, agriculture, arts, culture, science and  technology.
Apart from supporting women  through  technology,  the  DTI  has  also  been
involved in increasing the quality and  quantity  of  appropriately  skilled
people. Through the Technology and Human Resources for  Industry  Programme,
female students were identified as the special target group.

In 2001, of the 2 394 students who  received  support,  887  were  black  of
which 713 were female. Rural black women have not been left  behind,  having
been on the agenda of the DTI's women empowerment  initiative.  Through  the
Khula Start Programme, a project of Khula Enterprise  Finance,  87%  of  the
black enterprises that received support through micro  credits  were  women.
The  sentiments  of  our  BEE  strategy  is  about  widening  the  scope  of
empowerment by spreading ownership among smaller players, providing  another
opportunity for empowering women. The fact that the BEE strategy is part  of
the broader economic growth strategy, automatically  widens  the  scope  for
women's involvement in the broader South African economy.

I have no doubt in my mind that the increase in the fortunes  of  women  was
brought about to a great extent by the enabling environment created  by  the
DTI through its various women empowerment programmes. I  cannot,  therefore,
emphasise in stronger terms our support as  the  ANC  for  the  Budget  Vote
submitted by the DTI. I thank you [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you very  much,  Chairperson,  and
to the members who have participated in the debate. I think one  thing  that
is clear from the debate that we've just had today is that a critical  issue
or aspect of the work that we must do as we go forward and  try  to  address
the major challenges that we still have in our  society  is  to  co-operate,
collaborate and co-ordinate more.

I think that if we were listening to MEC Brown,  when  she  was  telling  us
about the Western Cape and what they are doing, it was very clear  from  the
account that she was giving that a lot of things that are happening  or  are
in the pipeline are happening in the partnership and in  collaboration  with
the DTI and with national, provincial and  local  governments.  So  I  would
want to highlight that issue as one critical aspect of the work that we  are
going to have to focus on.

If we were to look at a project such as  Coega  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  for
instance, we have Coega today because  there  has  been  that  collaboration
between the different spheres of government and  a  whole  number  of  other
players. You have Eskom there, the National Ports Authority, and so  on.  So
this is an important aspect  to  consider,  as  we  seek  to  address  these
challenges.

To hon  Malakoane,  I  apologise  that  I  didn't  acknowledge  you  at  the
beginning. I just want to say that on the issue  of  exchange  controls,  we
have  actually  been  quite  generous  in  lifting  them  particularly   for
investments that are aimed at the African continent. Every time we  actually
made adjustments to the limits in the  exchange  controls,  we  always  made
sure that limits for people who want to take money  out  for  investment  in
the African continent were actually higher than for people who wanted to  go
and invest in other places.

I think that there are indications that there is an increase in  the  number
of South African corporates that want to  invest.  I  think  those  are  the
things that the Treasury will look at, to see whether there is  a  need  for
any adjustments. An important issue as well in  that  particular  regard  is
that as South Africans we are seeing a lot of our  companies  going  into  a
number of African countries. When you do travel, actually,  you  are  really
amazed at the extent to which South  African  companies  have  gained  entry
into the African environment.

We must be concerned as South Africans  that  as  they  go  out  there,  the
business practices of those companies are such that  they  promote  economic
development and also enhance the human conditions  in  those  countries.  Of
course, in the early period, we did have  some  negative  experiences  where
the arrival of Shoprite, or something like that, meant that people who  were
producing vegetables, fruit and other things  locally,  suddenly  were  shut
out because Shoprite was sourcing everything from South Africa. But that  is
something that has begun to change.

I was at the World Economic Forum and I listened to very good accounts  from
Tanzania and Zambia about how that situation has changed with Shoprite,  for
instance, agreeing to source 50% of what they put  in  their  vegetable  and
fruit stores from local producers. That is  something  which  we,  as  South
Africans, must obviously be interested in. But those  are  things  that  are
really starting to change for the better.

Hon Terblanche, I'm not going to say that you are too young for me  to  talk
to you, like the hon member there did. But I think it's  important  actually
to make the point that our policy as the ANC or as the Government is  broad-
based black economic Empowerment. When I listened to you I  didn't  get  the
impression that you are opposed to black economic empowerment, per  se,  but
that you are opposed to it when it is confined to a few.  We  have  to  make
our policy very clear, both from the point of view of the number  of  people
that we  have  to  empower  and  the  approaches  to  empowerment.  Our  own
empowerment is not only  about  ensuring  that  people  can  buy  shares  in
existing companies, or even necessarily establish their own businesses,  but
it is about human resources development. That  is  an  important  aspect  of
empowerment.

I want to make the point firmly - the fact that you have  seen  high-profile
deals that involve a few people and so on, is probably  more  reflective  of
the culture in South African financial  institutions  they  are  very  risk-
averse towards the small people because, whilst they are willing to come  in
on some of these big deals, they are not so willing to  come  in  where  the
small person is concerned. That is something that has to change.

In the deliberations that we had on the Financial  Sector  Charter,  one  of
the issues that I raised with the task  team  was  that  for  too  long  our
financial institutions have not been able to deal  with  some  of  the  soft
issues,  the  cultural  issues,  so  that  I  can  walk  into  a   financial
institution ke boa Tshivenda [speak Tshivenda] and find somebody  there  who
speaks Tshivenda and  who  will  understand  my  needs  when  I  explain  my
circumstances. We must teach  our  institutions  to  spend  more  time  with
people who approach them, wanting a service of one kind or another. We  must
teach them that the more time you  spend,  the  better  you  understand  the
circumstances of this person and  the  better  you  can  tell  whether  that
person has the capacity to service a loan, if that is a loan  that  you  are
extending.

In the Northern Cape, to take the point that was raised, by hon Sinclair  if
I'm not mistaken I think that again, this is  an  issue  about  co-operation
and collaboration  between  ourselves  at  national,  provincial  and  local
government, and with players. There are things  that  are  in  the  pipeline
already, as far as the Northern Cape is concerned  because  there  are  iron
ore deposits there. So there is work that the DTI is doing to  help  develop
the iron-ore fields in the Northern Cape. There is also work that  is  going
on between the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape to develop that rail  link
because you are going to have Coega now. And for the Northern Cape  that  is
an opportunity to utilise the port in order to transport and receive  goods.
Also in that direction, there is work that is going on. There is  work  that
is going on other areas as well. Agri-processing is  one  of  them.  Indeed,
the Northern Cape has not been forgotten.

To the hon Chen, we are not going to follow the route of EPZs. This  is  not
because we just don't want to, but  because  an  important  forum  in  South
Africa that brings together Government, business and labour dealt with  this
matter. It debated this issue and looked at these options and the option  of
EPZs was found to be unsuitable for South Africa. Hence the  route  that  is
being pursued is the one of industrial development zones. Since  then  there
has  been  vigorous  movement  in  the  direction  of   establishing   those
industrial development zones. Three have been proclaimed so far.

So clearly, we cannot ignore the outcomes of a forum like that. If you  want
to take us in a different direction, you would have to  say  to  that  forum
that this is what you have overlooked. It is not a preferred  option  to  go
the route of export processing zones, because you said yourself  that  South
Africa is a country with very  particular  features.  Precisely  because  of
those features the route of EPZs was not  seen  to  be  suitable  for  South
Africa.

As far as the Eastern Cape is concerned, the point made by the hon  Masaulle
about industrial diversification is an important one and  is  in  line  with
one of the things that is going to be enjoying a lot of focus and  intensive
work that is going to be done there.

As far as sectors are concerned, we are going to be focusing a lot  on  what
we regard as sectors with a lot of potential to  create  jobs,  enhance  our
capacity to export and so on. So it is an important point that  you  raised.
Indeed, we are very committed to ensuring that the  process  in  Coega  goes
ahead. We are taking note of  what  the  Minister  of  Transport  said  this
morning, but we are also committed to ensuring that, that smelter  is  going
to be there. There is a lot a work that is going on  at  this  very  moment,
which is aimed at ensuring that we can finalise the discussions  on  getting
the process of establishing a smelter there going.

Hon Raju, I just want to thank you for the support  you  have  given  us  in
terms of the global trade agenda, because this  is  something  that  we  are
very much committed to; not just in our interests as South  Africa,  but  in
the interests of the  developing  world.  We  are  very  committed  to  that
process and we are going there not  to  advance  very  narrow  and  specific
South African  interests,  but  really  to  advance  the  interests  of  the
developing world. Because our approach  to  dealing  with  the  problems  of
poverty and unemployment is that you must create  opportunities  for  people
to work and not get people used to hand-outs - donor aid and all of  that  -
the one thing that can release the potential of our people to do things  for
themselves is to actually open up the opportunities, market access, so  that
people can engage in economic activities that enable them to participate  in
global trade.

In winding up, I want to say that the things that we have  committed  to  as
the Department of Trade and Industry are things that will see  us  attaining
two important objectives. Clearly, the first economy in  our  country  needs
to be supported and assisted to grow further. So some of the  work  that  we
are going to be doing will indeed assist us  to  consolidate  and  grow  the
first economy. At the same time, some of the things that we are going to  be
doing are very targeted interventions that are aimed  at  ensuring  that  we
can address the second economy. The issue is really to ensure  that  we  can
begin to open those pathways that are closed in South Africa. If you  are  a
microentrepreneur,  you  will  stay  there  forever  because  there  are  no
pathways  that  enable  you  to  be   mobile   and   move   from   being   a
microentrepreneur to being a big businessperson.

Our interventions are really aimed at ensuring that  we  can  unblock  those
things. That's  why  at  some  stage  the  situation  in  South  Africa  was
characterised as two floors without stairs in between. If  you  are  on  the
first floor, you are there and if you are  in  the  second  floor,  you  are
there and there is nothing connecting the two. The commitments that  we  are
making are aimed at ensuring that we can  begin  to  address  those  issues.
Thank you very much, Madam Chair and hon members. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! May I take  this  opportunity  to  thank
you, hon Minister. This was quite an eye-opener, and you can  see  from  the
interest shown by the provinces that we really do want  to  ensure  that  we
take into consideration  the  interests  of  the  provinces  and  the  local
government up to the national level. We thank you very much and we  want  to
assure you that we will continuously engage your department because we  want
to see a better South Africa,  continent  and  a  better  world.  With  your
assistance, we are sure that we are going to get there. That concludes  your
debate, hon Minister. Thank you very much.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: She is chasing you out.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Minister Pahad, I'm not chasing  him  away.  We
really just appreciate his input. And you are free  to  stay  on,  Minister.
Hon members, we now come to the subject for discussion, as  printed  on  the
Order Paper. I also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  invite  the  hon
Minister Pahad to address the House, and to inform him that  he  is  one  of
the Ministers that we are going to engage. Until the end of  this  year  you
are going to frequent this House more often, and we will be engaging you.

   YOUTH CELEBRATING A DECADE OF FREEDOM AND SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF
                                  DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Thank you very much, Madam  Chair,  and  let
me say that it's always regarded as a pleasure to come  to  this  House,  so
your invitation will always be well received. Don't hesitate to invite me!

Madam Chair and hon members, this month we mark  the  unforgettable  day  28
years ago when the youth of this country took  to  the  streets  in  protest
against the unjust apartheid system. Oh, before  getting  to  that  I  still
wanted to welcome the hon Chen at the time of her  maiden  speech.  Take  my
advice: don't say too quickly that you'll answer questions! [Laughter.]

On that day, June 16, 1976, the young people's protest was met  with  brutal
force by the apartheid government. It  was  no  less  than  state  terrorism
aimed at peacefully protesting youths. It  employed  far  more  than  police
batons, birdshot and teargas. The army was  deployed  and  the  youth  faced
Saracens and sharp ammunition which mowed them down by  the  thousand.  This
day remains with us as  an  unforgettable  milestone  of  our  struggle  for
national liberation. It was a pivotal moment in our march to  democracy  and
freedom, and we must ensure that the nation never forgets. It is with  these
bitter-sweet memories that our youth throughout  the  month  of  June  -  it
being Youth Development Month - will be engaged  in  various  activities  as
they celebrate and reflect on our first decade of democracy. It is a  decade
which has brought to them greater empowerment and opportunity.

It is therefore important  that,  as  we  engage  in  today's  debate  while
solemnly saluting the martyrs of  the  past  struggle,  we  should  dedicate
ourselves to the  new  struggle,  which  is  the  war  against  poverty  and
underdevelopment that bear down so powerfully on our young people.

Yet today our tone can be modestly celebratory because, indeed, we  do  have
so much to be thankful for as a better future unfolds for the youth of  this
country. Our  Government  since  its  inception  in  1994  has  made  steady
progress in ensuring that our youth is  empowered.  This  we  have  done  by
creating  institutions,  policies  and  legislation  that  aim   to   create
opportunities for the development of the youth.

Allow me to highlight some of the progress that  we  have  achieved  in  our
endeavours as a government working together with the youth to  move  forward
in youth development. We have successfully adopted the national  development
policy  framework  for  youth,   created   the   National   Youth   Economic
Participation Strategy, implemented the Presidential Jobs Summit  resolution
to set up the Umsobomvu Youth  Fund,  registered  64  000  learnerships  for
young people, and adopted the National Youth Service  Policy  Framework  and
its implementation plan, which we should be unfolding very soon.

These are the building blocks of our strategy to change for the  better  the
lives of the youth of this country. What we need now is the  same  sense  of
business-like urgency as was shown by the President when  he  delivered  his
state of the nation address to Parliament last month. We must  put  specific
price tags and timeframes on our programmes and ensure  that  they  succeed.
We must implement them in a practical and measurable way.

It is obvious that one of the most critical challenges we face  is  the  one
of youth unemployment, and we've just heard  from  Ms  Lynne  Brown  of  the
Western Cape that 80% of the unemployed in  the  Western  Cape  are  youths.
That is a staggering figure. There is obviously the question of how  we  can
improve the skills base of our young people, because in many  instances  you
find that there are jobs available, but many of our young people don't  have
the skills to get those jobs. The development of  a  skills  base  is  quite
critical.

We need to involve not only young people, but all strata of society  in  our
programmes aimed at  empowering  and  developing  the  youth.  We  need  the
engagement of civil society, community-based  organisations,  the  corporate
world, faith-based organisations, the professions, academia  and  all  other
interest groups to reach the goal. We have put in place funds  such  as  the
Umsobomvu Youth Fund and National Skills  Development  Fund  in  the  belief
that our young people will take advantage of  these  opportunities  and  use
them for their future development.

We are all very well aware of the challenges facing  the  youth;  challenges
such  as  poverty,   underdevelopment,   communicable   diseases   including
HIV/Aids, drug abuse and crime. These are very  different  compared  to  the
bullets  of  Soweto  in  1976,  but  massive  challenges  nevertheless.  The
problems are a daily reality for many of  our  young  people  and  there  is
evidence that awareness of the dangers and a need for  lifestyle  discipline
and adjustment are growing among our youth.  It  is  our  responsibility  to
assist young people as they fight to overcome these obstacles.  We  need  to
shift away from pointing fingers at the youth and begin to engage with  them
as they collaborate in seeking solutions to these problems. Our  communities
must give sustained support to programmes aimed at tackling these issues  so
that our youth can realise  that  the  adult  community  cares  about  their
wellbeing and is also prepared to help them realise their dreams.

I have given a brief picture of where we are as a nation in terms  of  youth
issues. The youth by definition is attractive, active  and  impressive,  but
the picture  of  the  youth  in  our  country  is  not  without  blemish  or
challenge. It is up to our society to deal with the things  that  bear  down
so adversely on them. It is up  to  our  society  to  offer  them  the  real
prospect of  active  and  involved  citizenship  as  they  grow  older.  The
building blocks laid so far suggest that there is  hope  that  we  can  work
together to create a South Africa that is alive with possibilities, a  South
Africa that really offers a better life for all.

If I may, I'd like to suggest, as part of the work that the NCOP has  to  do
and  part  of  its  work  in  terms  of  monitoring   and   evaluating   the
implementation of Government policies, but very specifically with regard  to
the provinces, that when we do this we should do it in the context  of  what
I call youth development. There are many things that are  going  on  in  the
Government - you heard the Minister of Trade and Industry, for example,  too
- but they reside  in  different  parts  of  the  Government,  in  different
departments. What we need to do when we look  at  youth  development  is  we
should see how we can take a more comprehensive look  at  this  to  then  be
able to make assessments to judge to what extent we are actually  coming  up
to scratch in terms of our  own  policies,  and  our  own  commitments  with
respect to youth development as a whole.

I think it would be very helpful when members of the NCOP  do  go  out  into
the provinces and do their work, and go out into their  constituencies  that
they pay some special attention to this question of youth development,  both
at local government as well as provincial government level, so that,  acting
together, we can ensure - or we should certainly try to  ensure  -  that  we
implement our own policies and our own commitments to youth  development.  I
think this is the best message that we can send out to the  youth  of  South
Africa on June 16. Thank you very much.

Mr M C GOEIEMAN:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  distinguished
guests and comrades, it is fitting on the  occasion  of  a  debate  of  this
nature that one begins by quoting from the fountain of wisdom. I  now  quote
the late President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Reginald Tambo when  he  spoke
at the ANC's 75th anniversary in 1987:


  Our glorious youth and students have continued to hold high the banner of
  struggle, because they have dared to fight for and bring our emancipation
  so near. Our youth have been eminent  targets  of  the  enemy  forces  of
  oppression.

This was of course consistent with the agenda of  the  apartheid  regime  to
make black people the providers  of  cheap  labour.  The  black  youth  were
regarded as a source of this unskilled,  cheap  labour;  part  of  a  super-
exploited proletariat. By the eighties the apartheid system had so  battered
the  youth  that  they  lacked  the  very  basic  means  to  thrive   in   a
socioeconomic system. This led some  commentators  to  make  the  allegation
that the youth were a lost generation, because  they  lacked  education  and
skills and did not have access to economic opportunities.  Indeed,  this  is
exactly what both the survey of the Community Agency for Social Enquiry  and
the 1996 census found to be the case as far as black youth were concerned.

In commemorating the 28 years since the youth uprising  in  Soweto,  in  the
year of freedom, 25 years since Solomon  Mahlangu  was  hanged,  almost  two
months after the ANC has been affirmed  to  power  for  the  third  term  of
unfettered majority rule, we must bear in mind that this  has  been  brought
about by the struggles and sacrifices of the South African youth,  while  we
celebrate this freedom. Celebrating  Youth  Day  should  remind  us  of  our
fallen heroes and heroines and that  it  is  also  about  celebrating  South
African freedom.

This year we are saying that young  people  should  seize  opportunities  of
democracy, and our struggle should also be about the deepening of  democracy
and unity in diversity of our South African society. Our  activities  should
also highlight the unveiling of a concrete plan on how  the  National  Youth
Commission will ensure the massive roll-out of the  National  Youth  Service
Programme to urgently address the economic marginalisation of the youth.

Today the challenges faced by the youth  are  enormous  and  differ  sharply
from those that faced the generations  before  and  after  1976.  Today  the
South African youth has a Government that is  committed  comprehensively  to
fulfilling its  needs.  However,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  problems
confronting young people have been resolved. Mammoth  challenges  still  lie
ahead, but immense opportunities have been created for  the  youth  to  take
advantage of and advance  themselves.  These  opportunities  of  today  have
radically altered the environment in which our young and youth  are  growing
up. The challenges for them are to recognise that the South Africa of  today
requires that we, the current generation of youth,  be  different  from  all
the generations before us in terms of our values, materials and  behavioural
culture.

The unprecedented events in Soweto, and other parts of South Africa,  became
significant milestones in the development of the liberation  struggle.  They
coincided with monumental events  in  Southern  Africa,  among  others,  the
winning of freedom in Mozambique, Angola and the  imminent  victory  of  the
struggle of Zimbabwe. This gave hope to our  people  that  our  victory  was
indeed imminent. All of us must therefore dip our banners in salute  to  all
the martyrs and patriots who perished in the titanic battle  and  pledge  to
remain loyal to their example  and  steadfast  in  the  execution  of  their
command to pursue the imminent and total emancipation of our people.

The youth of South  Africa  has  realised  that  the  fundamental  struggle,
structural changes and distortions  in  the  economy  created  by  apartheid
policies significantly affected its ability to grow and create a  productive
employment.  Hence,  all  the  youth  support  initiatives  of  the  ANC-led
Government by availing its services to youth in offering guidance about  all
the state development projects that can stimulate the development  of  small
businesses;  thus  encouraging  the  youth  to  be  self-employers  and  job
creators by using  state  institutions  such  as  the  Umsobomvu  fund,  the
Industrial Development Corporation and the Land Bank and  by  exploring  the
possibilities of creating a youth bank, credit union and food bank  to  lend
financial, material and advisory support to the youth in the development  of
their enterprises. Youth further affirmed the institution  of  the  National
Youth Service Programme as a way of engaging  the  youth  in  realising  the
development imperatives of our country.

Contrary to the narrow, sectarian view  of  some  amongst  us  who  find  it
fashionable to hasten to call for the  dissolution  of  the  National  Youth
Commission, as represented ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member,  please  apologise  for  disturbing
the hon member. [Laughter.] Hon members, please don't scare Mr Goeieman.  He
is a young person, and he is talking on behalf of the young people  of  this
country.

Mr M C GOEIEMAN: Chair, contrary to  the  narrow,  sectarian  view  of  some
amongst us who find it fashionable to hasten to call for the dissolution  of
the National Youth Commission, it represents the  resentment  of  our  youth
against the fight-back  strategy.  Our  youth  want  participation  and  co-
operation in solving the problems of this country,  as  well  as  their  own
plight, not some  fight-back  strategy  which  is  reminiscent  of  a  small
faction of our society.

We must advocate the establishment of agricultural  corporate  villages  and
banks. We must further advocate for youth brigades  on  various  aspects  of
rural development to be deployed to the poorest rural areas.

It is also of utmost importance that we should strive  to  facilitate  youth
employment  through  income-generating  activities  such  as  infrastructure
development  projects,  creating  services  and   other   initiatives   that
reorientate youth  away  from  job  seeking  towards  wealth  creation.  And
lastly, we should advocate for skills development on strategic economic  and
management areas.

In conclusion, a great challenge lies ahead and  awaits  the  generation  of
youth in the ANC-led Government today to mobilise, organise and educate  our
youth to become masters of their own destiny. We must strive to  become  the
repository of the  best  youth  in  society  and  be  the  catalyst  of  the
community and particularly youth development. A great decade lies  ahead  of
us to  continue  to  champion  the  all-round  political  and  socioeconomic
aspirations of the youth.

It is critical also to intensify the global work on poverty  for  peace  and
Africa's development. This also means that  we  must  "nepadise"  the  South
African  youth  and  force  personal,  political   and   economic   changes,
interactions and co-operation between  South  African  youth  and  youth  in
other  parts  of  the  continent.  We  must  seize  these  opportunities  of
democracy, because history has charged us  with  the  obligation  to  become
masters of our destiny. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms D ROBINSON: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  members,  as  a  former
teacher young people and their future are very  close  to  my  heart.  South
Africa has made progress since those  dark  days  of  oppression  under  the
apartheid regime of the NP where little attention was paid to human  rights,
except for that of the chosen few, and where education for the majority  was
of  an  inferior  standard  in  order  to  suppress  the  next   generation.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: You were one of them.

Ms D ROBINSON: I was not. [Interjections.] There  is  no  greater  gift  for
children than knowledge - giving them the opportunity  to  read  widely  and
finding their place in society. Libraries are the  storehouse  of  knowledge
and  our  youth  needs  greater  access  -  not  less.  We  must  seize  the
opportunity to  improve  their  lot  in  order  to  assist  them  to  become
entrepreneurs and grow our economy.  We  need  a  society  of  literate  and
numerate citizens who can compete with  the  rest  of  the  world  and  lead
Africa to peace and prosperity.

For centuries libraries have  provided  access  to  a  range  and  depth  of
information and knowledge that we as individuals cannot  afford.  As  places
of learning libraries perform vital functions in a caring society. Outcomes-
based  education  cannot  succeed  without  libraries.  Libraries   are   an
essential back-up for schools,  since  most  school  don't  have  their  own
libraries. They give families who don't have resources access to  books  and
Internet facilities. [Interjections.] They  provide  basic  adult  education
and  literacy  classes.   They   have   business   corners   for   potential
entrepreneurs. For those living in over-crowded conditions, the  library  is
a quiet and safe place to study.

Many of our libraries are in a sad state. Instead of being a treasure  trove
of knowledge, which is  accessible  to  all,  they  are  becoming  unstaffed
storerooms. More librarians are needed, but they  are  not  being  replaced.
Fewer books are being purchased because of cuts in staff. Opening times  are
being reduced. Students are being denied access, especially at night and  on
Saturday afternoons.

In the Sunday Times of 4 April, Professor Seth Manaka said that  fewer  than
40% of the population has access to libraries in urban areas and  less  than
15% in rural areas - a sad indictment of our society.  In  1994,  provincial
governments were given the financial responsibility for libraries, but  they
were given no extra budget; so, municipalities  that  provided  the  service
became the victims of unfunded mandates, hence the cutbacks.  Municipalities
looked to the provincial and national Government  for  funding  with  little
result and much finger pointing. Task  teams  set  up  to  investigate  have
reached no conclusions. This fiasco must be resolved urgently. I  appeal  to
you, Minister:  National  Government  cannot  simply  assign  responsibility
without providing the funding.

Access to information is a right in the Constitution. Because  the  majority
of people do not have access to libraries, they are denied  this  right.  We
have radio stations collecting books  and  promoting  "Zifundela.  Read  for
yourself",  but  the  Government  of  the   day   does   little   to   help.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

There has been a decline of 43% in  the  publication  of  books  in  African
languages -  a  tragedy  for  a  developing  country.  What  better  way  to
celebrate Youth Day than by giving us funding  for  freedom  libraries,  for
improving staffing and services.  [Interjections.]  Libraries  provide  food
for their minds. Let us nurture a culture of learning and reading -  an  on-
going celebration of our decade of freedom - enriching  and  empowering  our
nation for the future. [Interjections.]

And for your information, I have started so  many  Friends  of  the  Library
associations where we are providing the funding. I appeal  to  you;  let  us
look  at  this.  [Interjections.]  I  investigated  that   one   personally.
[Interjections.] I was part of the situation when we  put  in  the  computer
system, which came with those libraries.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member  Robinson,  can  you  listen?
You have to speak through the Chair and not talk directly  to  the  Setswana
lady. Your time has expired.

Ms D ROBINSON: Madam Chair, I apologise, but this lady  is  making  it  very
difficult. I apologise. [Laughter.]

Mr K SINCLAIR:  Hon  Chairperson,  in  my  preparation  I  prepared  a  very
moderate speech to contribute to this debate  today,  but  after  I  thought
about the political situation in South Africa, I had second  thoughts  about
my contribution today. I am going to tear up the speech that I  prepared.  I
am going to speak about the political scene in South  Africa  and  the  role
that the DA is playing in this whole process. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!

Mr K SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I will do that in terms of  the  topic  that  we
are going to discuss - the broader democratic framework.

My colleague Mr Goeieman - I will not say ``Comrade Goeieman''  because  I'm
not a comrade gave his maiden speech today. There  are  many  "goeie  manne"
[good men] in the DA.

Daar is baie goeie mense in die DA. [There are many good people in the DA.]

But the problem with  the  DA  is  that  they  are  misleading  our  people.
[Interjections.] They are misleading our people in terms  of  of  what  they
pretend to do. During the last election the youth  of  this  country,  inter
alia, alternative government. [Interjections.] The DA  pretends  to  be  the
party for very clever people. And sometimes they ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, order!

Mr K SINCLAIR: Sometimes they are very clever - they think  so.  [Laughter.]
But  the  problem  is  that  they  are   politically   stupid.   [Laughter.]
[Applause.] Yes, politically they are very stupid. My Grade 1  teacher  told
me long ago that there is a difference between  ``equal'',  ``bigger  than''
and ``smaller than''. The DA got 12% support. [Interjections.] And  the  ANC
got  close  to  70%.  [Interjections.]  And  now  they  pretend  to  be   an
alternative government. [Laughter.] But, furthermore, they dish this  up  to
the youth of this country and they want them to believe it. [Laughter.]  But
a very interesting thing ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Can you hold on, Mr Sinclair? Hon members,  you
are making it difficult for us to hear what the member  is  saying.  Can  we
give the hon member a chance, because you had your opportunity to  say  your
say. Can we also give him a chance to say what he wants to say  without  any
interference? Continue, Mr Sinclair.

Mr  K  SINCLAIR:  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson.  Maybe  the  truth   hurts.
[Laughter.] But a very different and interesting thing  happened  the  other
day when somebody from the DA said: "Where's the New NP?"  The comrade  over
there ... the colleague over there ... I want to tell him where the NNP  is.
[Interjections.] The New NP is on its way to being part of this country  and
trying  to  resolve  the  issues,  including  the  issues  of   the   youth.
[Applause.] We are there.

But the reality is, people, and they are very good people - "Hulle is  goeie
manne" [They are good men] - like my colleague at the back who was  part  of
the old NP and is now heart and soul in the DA  ...  [Laughter.]  Yes,  he's
there - heart and soul in the DA, and he  is  enjoying  it  there.  But  the
colleague over there was lured into the DA  with  very  beautiful  promises.
[Laughter.] However, the party that he  is  representing  is  still  writing
their manifestoes in Houghton, and they do not care about the youth and  the
challenges of our time.

What are those challenges? Those challenges are  creating  work,  addressing
unemployment, and the issue of HIV/Aids, and that is  why  the  NNP  took  a
principled decision to support the ANC in its endeavours. [Applause.]

The last issue I want to  raise  is  that  the  other  day  the  DA  made  a
hullabaloo about the NNP accepting the Freedom Charter of the ANC. Today  in
this House I want to challenge the DA and the  ID  to  tell  us  where  they
stand regarding the youth and  regarding  the  principle  of  accepting  the
Freedom Charter as a policy for this country. Where do they stand?  I  thank
you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Madam Chair, hon Ministers, hon members, tomorrow we  will
be celebrating the courage of the youth of 1976. The title  of  this  debate
implies that we expect today's youth to seize the opportunities  of  freedom
and democracy. And while we have these expectations  of  today's  youth,  we
would do well to remember what the actual motivation was behind  the  events
of that fateful day in 1976.

I am speaking of the issue of  education.  Back  then,  the  youth  made  an
emphatic statement about the poor education that the  apartheid  regime  was
giving them. They recognised that deliberately insufficient education  would
condemn them to perpetual cheap labour and political subjugation,  and  they
said no. It is therefore necessary for us to acknowledge  that  their  blood
was spilt for a freedom intricately linked to education.

Hundreds of thousands of our youth matriculate and graduate every year,  but
a majority fail to find proper employment. If we want the youth  to  embrace
the opportunities of democracy, we must empower them with the  education  to
exercise that voice. We need to spend even more on  education.  We  need  to
provide our children with skills, not only to find employment, but  also  to
create employment as entrepreneurs.

We need to recognise that teaching is  more  than  a  profession.  It  is  a
calling that deserves a better salary. We need to ensure that  every  school
actually does have classrooms,  water,  sanitation,  electricity,  libraries
and sport facilities. In that sense we say that ... abantwana  bethu  kuneka
sibajonge kakhulu and kufuneka  sibalandelisile  and  kufuneka  siyazi  into
ukuba  thina  bazali  apha  simele  abantwana  bethu.  Enkosi   Mamusihlalo.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] [... we need to take care of our children, we  need  to  give
them attention and be aware that we as parents are  representatives  of  our
children here. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Ms E S MABE: Madam  Chairperson,  Hon  Minister,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, I am both honoured and delighted to be able to deliver  a  speech
on such an important commemoration as that of 16 June.  It  is  a  day  that
constitutes one of the defining moments in our history. And  being  able  to
do this in the NCOP, which is  at  the  centre  of  co-operative  governance
around important issues such  as  youth  development,  makes  it  even  more
fulfilling.

Our president, Thabo Mbeki, is correct when he says:


  Our youth is growing up in an exciting period of the rebirth of both  our
  society and continent. It is growing up  in  a  situation  in  which  the
  battle is joined to build a world that is truly focused on  changing  the
  lives of the ordinary people.

The ANC is leading this battle to improve  the  quality  of  life  of  young
people in South Africa, through our comprehensive people-centred and people-
driven programme of social transformation. Our organisation is  also  taking
the lead in creating awareness on the continent of  the  need  to  integrate
issues within the broader development  framework  for  the  rebirth  of  our
continent.

The  ANC  has  embarked  on  the  comprehensive  programme  of   fundamental
transformation that seeks to construct a prosperous  society  in  which  the
young people have unlimited  opportunities  to  pursue  their  dreams.  This
process of transformation touches upon every single aspect of  society  that
impacts on the youth, such as education, health and employment.

Our first decade of democracy is providing many new  opportunities  for  our
youth to enhance their knowledge and skills, therefore a series of laws  and
programmes have been  implemented  since  1994  to  address  the  legacy  of
apartheid, which saw  limited  access  to  education,  training,  employment
opportunities, health and recreation, amongst other things for our youth.

In the field of education, the ANC has implemented the  National  Norms  and
Standards for School Funding, which established  principles  for  redressing
past imbalances  in  the  financing  of  schools.  In  the  area  of  social
development, the ANC made health care free for pregnant woman  and  children
under six years, introduced the school feeding scheme to  help  improve  the
nutrition and general health of primary  school  students,  while  improving
their capacity to learn; and expanded the child support grant to  reach  and
benefit many more millions of children. It  introduced  comprehensive  child
care legislation in Parliament to further promote and strengthen the  rights
of children and  to  protect  them  from  abuse.  It  also  provided  water,
electricity and basic services  to  millions  of  households,  thus  freeing
millions of the youth, especially rural young  women,  from  the  burden  of
disease and stunted growth.

We  have  established  a  National  Youth  Commission  to   champion   youth
development  at  the  level  of  policy  formulation,  among  other  things,
interacting with  Government  departments  in  the  legislative  process  to
ensure a youth bias. We  have  implemented  initiatives  like  the  National
Youth Service to respond rapidly to youth unemployment,  which  is  part  of
the result of a lack of  skills  development.  The  youth  involved  in  the
programme  will  gain  working  experience,  which   will   increase   their
employability.

The Government has also implemented a National Skills  Development  Strategy
to improve the skills levels of our  country's  labour  force,  particularly
the youth,  to  enhance  their  employability.  We  have  also  set  up  the
Umsobomvu Youth Fund to assist in the creation of  youth  entrepreneurships.
It is unfortunate that  I  have  to  torture  you  with  our  long  list  of
achievements, but I am doing this for the benefit of  those  South  Africans
in the opposition benches who seem to be unaware  of  the  massive  progress
that has been made in terms of the youth development in this country.

The ANC has entered into a contract with the youth of our country.  We  must
celebrate National Youth Day and use it as  a  platform  to  strengthen  our
People's Contract towards an integrated and  sustainable  youth  development
programme. While the defining characteristic of the previous decade was  the
attainment and consolidation of freedom and democracy in our  country,  this
decade should be dedicated to accelerating  the  translation  of  the  youth
development policies and programmes into concrete outcomes. Our  success  in
this regard will rely heavily on our ability to  effectively  integrate  and
co-ordinate our various youth development policies across the three  spheres
of Government.

Our Constitution  enjoying  the  different  spheres  of  Government  to  co-
ordinate their actions with one another. This includes  actions  around  the
implementation of youth development  programmes.  National,  provincial  and
local government each has a specific role to play in  terms  of  the  youth.
While national Government is responsible for formulating national policy  on
youth development, provinces and local  government  have  to  implement  the
National  Youth  Policy  within  a  context  unique  to  each  province  and
municipality.

The NCOP, being at  the  centre  of  co-operative  governance,  is  uniquely
placed to ensure that this integration and co-ordination across the  various
spheres of government does indeed happen. This  institution  will  therefore
play a crucial role during this decade of freedom in ensuring that we  reach
our youth development objectives. I thank you. [Applause].

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon colleagues, no more the  dark  and
frightening clouds of apartheid and the regime's sinister forces  of  racial
discrimination and oppression; and no more the foisting of the  language  of
apartheid on a captive generation of black youth. No  more  living  in  drab
racial ghettos with their attendant lack of recreational amenities, such  as
libraries. A decade and more ago, life  for  South  Africans  who  were  not
white was miserable in many ways, to say the least.  The  assault  on  one's
dignity and even on one's person, if you were not  white,  was  unremitting.
Our children, our elders and especially our youth were the  victims  of  the
most pernicious form of inhumanity to man and woman.

Apartheid was an evil philosophy. The tragedy  was  that  the  practitioners
were not aliens from outer space, but ordinary men and women,  fellow  South
Africans.  The  denial,  deprivation,  desperation  and  dispossession  that
characterised apartheid, are today things of the unforgotten past.

Today we rejoice in the decade-old  sun  of  democracy  that  broke  through
those clouds of despair, thanks in no  small  measure  to  the  students  of
Soweto. Today our youth evince a new sense of joy and bounce with energy  to
live and let live.  They have welcomed the warm embrace of  the  culture  of
human rights, tolerance,  and  a  plethora  of  human  freedoms.  They  have
discarded  the  suffocating  tentacles  of  prejudice,  discrimination,  and
denial  of  human  rights.  Our  young  people  are  displaying  a   welcome
generosity of spirit and a willingness to comprehend all that  is  good  for
human coexistence.

We have a host of young stars in the firmament of sport,  art,  theatre  and
literature. Allow me just to name a  few:  Mark  Shuttleworth,  not  yet  30
years old, became the  first  South  African  astronaut  in  space;  Makhaya
Ntini, Graham Smith - cricket; Lucas Radebe,  Mbulelo  Mabizela,  Bennie  Mc
Carthy - football; Hestrie Cloete - high jump; Natalie du Toit  -  swimming;
and Leleti Khumalo of Sarafina fame. Can we forget Ma  Brrr  Brenda  Fassie?
She was the very essence of our irrepressible youth. These are  but  just  a
few of our geniuses. These icons are  proof  enough  that  given  access  to
opportunity and adequate resources, our youth will not disappoint  in  their
endeavours. They will bloom into productive citizens and make  South  Africa
proud.

But  alas!  There  are  dark  clouds  looming  ominously  on  the   horizon,
threatening  to  engulf  this  beautiful  nation.  HIV/Aids  is  exacting  a
terrible toll on the youth of our nation. Like a voracious creature with  an
insatiable appetite, this pandemic is mowing down thousands  of  our  fellow
compatriots, creating thousands of orphans and  a  myriad  of  problems  for
families and society at large. Our youth have a great responsibility in  the
next decade to ensure that indulgence in sexual activities does not get  out
of hand, and to learn that good, clean living  goes  hand-in-hand  with  any
sexual relationship.

I  pay  tribute  to  the  youth  of  the  past  decade  who  were   in   the
transformation stage, and now they are  up  and  running  towards  the  2010
World Cup, and everything else that goes with youthful endeavours.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

(Translation of Sepedi speech follows.)

[Mr M THETJENG: Thank you, Chairperson. I hope I  will  be  given  the  same
protection that was given to the previous speakers. Hon Chairperson and  hon
members of this House, there is a saying that goes: Young  ones  learn  from
their elders. Freedom in South  Africa  was  not  easily  won,  but  it  was
through the sacrifices of many people, men and women in general.

It was tough on 16 June 1976, when the youth demonstrated against  Afrikaans
as the medium of  instruction  and  other  discriminating  laws.  They  were
brutally beaten like a ruthless farmer would beat the  donkeys  that  plough
his fields. Some of them, like Hector Petersen,  lost  their  lives.  Others
were thrown in jails, whilst others went into exile.

The leaders of the previous government are still alive  today,  even  though
they are about to die. The most experienced doctor will  be  there  to  cure
them of their incurable diseases. They would have been  cured,  the  problem
is that they are so restless, like rain clouds. It is people  like  the  hon
Sinclair. The release of political prisoners was a  sign  that  victory  was
knocking at the door. The general elections of  27  April  1994  marked  the
beginning of freedom  for  South  African  citizens.   South  Africans  have
political freedom in their hands,  as  we  now  have  free  elections,  even
though they are not fair.

The saddest thing is that most of the  youth  have  lost  hope.   Statistics
show that most of them are unemployed. Let there be economic reform so  that
there will be job creation for the youth of this country. Most of them  have
given up applying for jobs.

It is obvious that those who benefit are very  few.  The  heritage  of  this
country has its heirs. These  are  the  people  who  are  politically  well-
connected. I am sorry about that.

Most of them are unable to continue with their studies after  matriculating,
because their parents cannot afford to send them to institutions  of  higher
learning. Employers cannot find suitable people for the  work  either.  That
is why we, the  DA,  as  you  can  see,  came  up  with  this  ``opportunity
vouchers'' plan that they can use in the following ways: to  go  to  school,
as parents cannot afford it financially; to start their own businesses  that
will boost them financially; and to learn  handicraft  skills.  As  we  have
already said, there are jobs, but some fail to get the jobs due  to  a  lack
of skills. This will bring the kind of happiness that will  enable  them  to
celebrate the 10 years of democracy, freed from poverty.

Oh youth, stand up for your rights in your  own  country.  Do  not  fail  to
participate  in  the  next  municipal  elections.  The  people   elect   the
government and the people also  bring  it  down  if  it  does  not  deliver.
Government is government by the people, young and old. [Thank you.]]

Mr B J TOLO: Before I start with my speech, I want to  advise  hon  Sinclair
that when the DA accuses him of having adopted the  programme  of  the  ANC,
namely the Freedom Charter, it just shows that  there  is  a  bankruptcy  of
understanding in terms of the history of this country in the DA because  the
Freedom Charter in essence is not  the  document  of  the  ANC.  It  is  the
document that was adopted by the ANC at some stage as  a  people's  document
drawn up by the people of this country, and  not  the  ANC  and,  therefore,
there is nothing wrong with you adopting the  programme  of  the  people  of
South Africa if you want to align yourself with what the people want.

Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  colleagues,  today  South  Africa  is  a
country that is the envy of many nations. This  is  so  because  in  a  very
short space of time, 10 years, we have achieved what many nations could  not
achieve in many decades. Today, we are a  fully-fledged  democratic  country
that has taken its rightful place among the community of nations. We have  a
constitution that guarantees human rights and dignity to  all.  We  have  an
ANC government that ensures  that  the  state  resources  are  used  to  the
advantage of all the people  of  this  country,  especially  the  poor.  The
foundation on which our country is built is  rock  solid  and  that  ensures
that we can only move from strength to strength to further better the  lives
of our people.
But, to be able to locate these  crises  of  achievements  in  their  proper
perspective it is proper to look back where  we  are  coming  from.  We  are
doing so in order to  identify  the  role-players,  or  some  of  them,  who
contributed enormously in order for us to be where we  are  today.  We  come
from a long history, which was characterised by oppression and apartheid.  A
system, which we all remember, that was meant to perpetually dehumanise  the
majority of the people of this country.

The people of this country, at the head  of  whom  was  the  ANC,  fought  a
relentless struggle to end that obnoxious system.  At  the  centre  of  this
struggle, at different times in history, we  always  had  young  people.  At
every turn they always pitched the struggle to a  higher  note.  It  is  the
youth league of the  ANC  to  which  Mandela,  Sisulu,  Lembede  and  others
belonged in the 40s that dynamically transformed the ANC.  It  is  they  who
catapulted the ANC to a higher level of struggle, which led to the  adoption
of the 1949 programme of action; a programme which transformed the ANC to  a
more confrontational  method  of  struggle.  Defiance  of  unjust  laws  and
boycotts were the main tactics adopted to fight the regime then.

After the Rivonia Trial the then regime thought that it had broken the  back
of the liberation movement. This was the time  when  there  was  a  relative
lull in  terms  of  overt  political  activities.  But  for  the  liberation
movement it was time to reorganise as the  arrest  of  many  leaders  caused
some disorganisation. The apartheid regime  then  thought  it  was  time  to
tighten the screws of apartheid to make it more thorough and perfect.  Among
other things, they introduced Afrikaans as the sole  medium  of  instruction
in schools. This was to further subdue the people so that the only  language
they should understand and speak better would be the master's language.

In the meantime the underground structures  of  the  movement  were  growing
stronger as we had people like Comrade Joe Gqabi  in  Soweto  who  was  then
recently released from jail and working among the youth.

June 16, 1976 will go down in the annals of history as the turning point  in
the struggle for liberation in this country. It is a day on which the  youth
of our country said enough is enough. With  stones  and  dustbin  lids  they
confronted the brutal force of the  well-oiled  apartheid  killing  machine,
the SA Defence Force and the police.  The  revolt  against  Afrikaans  as  a
medium of instruction, which started as a small beginning, but engulfed  the
whole country in no time, was a dress rehearsal for future battles.

Although some of our youth on that day and the subsequent weeks  and  months
had to go through the shadow of death, the  running  battles  ensued.  These
battles proved  that  no  force,  however  strong,  could  defeat  a  people
determined to realize their freedom and that you can win some  battles,  but
not the entire war as the South African situation proved.

Some of the youth during these battles realised that it  was  impossible  to
defeat the apartheid regime without  a  revolutionary  theory  and  arms  in
hand. Thousands left the country  to  swell  the  ranks  of  the  liberation
movement, especially MK. After political and military  training,  some  were
infiltrated back into the country to confront the  regime  in  pursuance  of
the armed struggle and defence of the people  -  a  mission  they  fulfilled
with distinction.

It was the youth of this country who, when the then President  of  the  ANC,
Oliver Tambo, in the middle 80s made a clarion call that  the  country  must
be made ungovernable and apartheid unworkable, redoubled  their  efforts  in
embracing the call. It was  for  this  reason  that  they  were  dubbed  the
roaring young lions. We therefore today salute the heroes  and  heroines  of
the June 16 detachment  and  subsequent  detachments,  including  the  young
lions of the mid 80s and many others, for fighting on the  different  fronts
of the struggle in trying to achieve social justice for our country.

Some of them paid with their  lives  for  us  to  be  where  we  are  today,
celebrating a decade of freedom under conditions of peace and stability.  We
have in mind here heroes like Solomon Mahlangu, Gordon Dikwebu, the Lion  of
Chiawelo and many others. It is befitting  therefore,  that  the  ANC  Kabwe
Conference in 1985 resolved that June 16 will  be  known  as  Youth  Day  in
South Africa in recognition of the invaluable contribution the young  people
made in the struggle for liberation. It is for  the  same  reason  that  our
Government declared June 16 a public holiday.  The  youth  of  this  country
sacrificed pleasures that young men and women enjoy in any  normal  society.
They sacrificed  their  education  and  above  all,  some  sacrificed  their
dearest possession, which is life.
We are therefore saying that the youth of 1976 and the youth  of  subsequent
years  identified  their  historic  mission   and   accomplished   it   with
distinction. Their struggles, and that of other patriots, led to that epoch-
making event - the 1994 general elections  in  our  country;  the  elections
that put us on a proper pedestal to transform this country in the  interests
of all the people.

We must, however, also point out that the youth of today cannot bask in  the
glory of the youth of 1976 and that of the years  that  followed.  They  are
not the ones who did what we  described  above.  It  is  their  fathers  and
mothers who were the youth in those years. Today's youth must  identify  its
historic mission and realise it, for we are living in  a  changed  situation
and therefore the mission has changed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev E ADOLPH: Thank  you  hon  Chairperson.  Chairperson,  Mr  Minister  and
members of this Council, I think the youth has reason to celebrate  our  ten
years of democracy tomorrow. It  is  a  well-deserved  democracy  under  the
leadership of the ANC-led Government. We have to give them credit  for  what
they did regarding the numerous  programmes  of  development  strategies  to
intervene in the lives of our youth. I am also a child of 1976 and  I  never
realised that the blood of Hector Pietersen and many  others  would  be  the
symbolic gesture to reconcile South Africans.

Ek was nooit bewus  daarvan  dat  juis  die  bloed  van  mense  soos  Hector
Pietersen  en  Stompie  Sepei  die  grondslag  gelê  het  nie  vir  `n  nuwe
demokrasie wat  ons  deur  pyn  en  leiding  daargestel  het.  Ons  het  die
politieke stryd gewen. [I was never aware that  the  blood  of  people  like
Hector Pietersen and Stompie Sepei laid the foundation for a new  democracy,
created by us  through  pain  and  suffering.  We  have  won  the  political
struggle.]

But we are facing challenges such as a major economic struggle that we  need
to tackle vigorously. I was quite surprised as a  child  at  the  idea  that
black South Africans could  never  create  anything.  Was  it  perhaps  that
somewhere in a laboratory Dr Wouter Basson created a virus  to  destroy  our
innovative or creative brain cells? Or did  it  have  anything  to  do  with
artificial intelligence or the Illuminati? I'm not sure about these  things.
I'm just asking this question. Today, all of a sudden we  have  millionaires
and billionaires.

Ons het ewe skielik nou loodse wat vlieg; ons ontdek nou dat die  swart  man
en swart vrou kan presteer op alle vlakke  van  die  samelewing,  wêreldwyd.
Ons kan met genoegdoening trots wees daarop  dat  ons  swartmense  oor  tien
jaar alreeds bewys het dat hulle kan kompeteer met  die  beste  ter  wêreld.
Miskien het ons soos `n afkophoender sonder 'n brein  rondgeloop.  Dit  walg
my om daaraan te dink, maar ek wonder somtyds  wat  in  daardie  naalde  was
waarmee ons as kinders ingespuit is. Onthou u nog  daardie  groot  naalde  -
miskien moet ons onsself vra wat daarin was.
Die wil  graag  vandag  ``jonkwees''  herdefinieer.  Ek  is  jonk  omdat  my
gedagtes en denke innoverend is. Ons kan nooit jongmense  uitsluit  uit  die
besluitnemingsproses en die politieke arena van ons  samelewing  nie.  Hulle
is die boustene en die rigtingwysers. Ons kan nooit verwaand wees en sê  ons
dink en praat namens jongmense nie.

Daarom is ons in die OD `n voorbeeld vir jongmense -  ons  het  die  jongste
parlementslid vandag, net 27 jaar oud.  Hulle  het  nie  `n  aparte  ``youth
league''  nie.  Hulle  is  daar  saam  met  ons  as  rigtingwysers  vir  ons
jongmense. Ek  wil  graag  `n  paar  uitdagings  stel  wanneer  ons  Jeugdag
herdenk. Ek wil graag vir u sê dat ons jongmense word deur MIV/Vigs  bedreig
- `n geweldige katastrofiese toekoms vir ons. Dan wil ek  graag  -  ek  sien
Mnr Dugmore, die LUR vir onderwys is hier - vir u en u onderwys  departement
uitdaag om die tikprobleem aan tes preek; 'n geweldige ``snater''  ding  wat
sy  kop  uitsteek.  [Tyd  Vestreke.]  Dankie.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[All of a sudden we have pilots flying planes; we now  discover  that  black
men and women can achieve at all levels of society worldwide.  We  can  take
satisfaction in being proud that  our  black  people  have  over  ten  years
already approved that they can compete with the best in the world. Maybe  we
were walking around like a headless chicken without a brain. It disgusts  me
to think about it, but I sometimes wonder what was in those syringe used  to
inject us with as children. Do you still remember those big  needles?  Maybe
we should ask ourselves what was in them.

The ID would like to  redefine  ``being  young''.  I  am  young  because  my
thoughts and opinions are innovative. We  can  never  exclude  young  people
from the decision-making process or the  political  arena  of  our  society.
They are the building blocks and the direction indicators. We can  never  be
so arrogant to say we are speaking on behalf of the youth.

That is why we in the ID are an example  to  young  people  -  we  have  the
youngest Member of Parliament today, only 27 years old. They do not  have  a
separate youth league. They are there with us as  direction  indicators  for
our youth. I would like to set a few  challenges  when  we  celebrate  Youth
Day. I want to tell you that our youth are being threatened  by  HIV/Aids  -
an enormously catastrophic future for us. Then I  would  like  -  I  see  Mr
Dugmore, the MEC  for  Education  is  here  -  to  challenge  you  and  your
department of education  to  address  the  tik  problem;  a  terrible  thing
rearing its head. [Time expired.][Thank you.]]

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Madam Chairperson, the subject for discussion  today  is:
"Youth celebrating a decade of freedom  and  seizing  the  opportunities  of
democracy." But Youth Day is also the commemoration of a struggle  in  which
many lives were lost - especially on 16 June 1976, in Soweto.

However, I would like to celebrate Youth Day  in  a  different  way.  Rather
than focusing on the heroes of the  past  -  although  they  must  never  be
forgotten - I want today to celebrate the new heroes of a new struggle:  the
women, grandmothers and sisters who nurture  and  provide  for  the  growing
number of children in our country who are direct  victims  of  the  HIV  and
Aids pandemic.

The first national HIV prevalence study  conducted  by  the  Human  Sciences
Research Council found that 3,3%  of  the  children  who  participated  were
maternal orphans, while 10% had lost a parent by the  time  they  were  nine
years old. In the age bracket of 15 to 18 years, approximately 25% had  lost
one parent and 3% of children between the ages of 12 and 18 years  were  the
head of a  household.  For  these  children  getting  Government  assistance
through grants is very difficult.
Children orphaned by Aids will comprise 9% to 12% of  South  Africa's  three
to five million children by 2014. In view of all this,  it  is  shocking  to
know that the antiretroviral roll-out has been stopped and, as a result  ...


THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, can you take your seat, please.

Mr T S RALANE: Chair, on a point of order,  can  the  member  focus  on  the
discussion? Thank you very much.

THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Hon  member,  can  you  offer  the  member  an
opportunity to address the House?

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Thank you, Chairperson. In view of all  of  this,  it  is
shocking to know that the antiretroviral roll-out has been stopped and as  a
result, children who are also part of the youth, as the member  would  know,
are being denied life-saving  antiretrovirals.  This  is  a  result  of  the
nondelivery of Government and  health  Minister,  Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang,
despite election promises and the so-called contract with the people.

So for some tomorrow will be a day of  celebrating,  of  reflecting  on  the
past and a struggle that is over. For others, such as  the  40  HIV-positive
children out of 72 at Amaphelo preprimary  school  in  Potchefstroom,  North
West, who don't have access to antiretrovirals, it will be just another  day
trying to survive the battle against the disease that  robs  them  of  their
childhood and that has robbed eight of their playmates of their  lives  over
the past year-and-a-half.

Therefore, I celebrate Youth Day  remembering  those  who  have  died  as  a
result of the pandemic - especially the children - and  saluting  those  who
care for and love those children. I thank you.

Mr C DUGMORE (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister  Pahad,  our  members
of Parliament, guests, friends and comrades, you know, I am really not  sure
about the last contribution ... [Laughter.] ... because the party  that  she
represents is the very party that, in the National  Assembly  voted  against
legislation to make medicines in this country much more affordable.  And  on
the basis of those studies this  Government  is,  in  a  comprehensive  way,
dealing with HIV/Aids and is beginning to roll out the antiretrovirals.

Waar kom sy daaraan om vir ons te sê dit het nou tot 'n  einde  gekom?  Waar
woon sy? [Where did she hear that, telling us that it has  now  come  to  an
end. Where does she live?]

Does she live on the moon? [Interjections.] Then, her other  colleague,  hon
member Robinson, also comes here and bemoans the  state  of  our  libraries.
Earlier on hon Sinclair said that "hierdie DA  mislei  eintlik  die  mense."
[This DA is actually misleading the people]. And that is true. They try  and
give them the impression that they are an alternative government.

Well, let me tell the members of this House that they  had  the  opportunity
at some stage to actually govern this province. And you know what they  did?
When they were in control of the city, they did nothing about the  libraries
in the city of Cape Town. [Interjections.]  It  was  they  who  did  nothing
about libraries in this  provincial  government.  Yet  hon  member  Robinson
comes here ... and I am going to deal with  the  youth  commission.  We  are
here today to talk about the opportunities.

Do you know that in this province  of  ours  the  DA  actively  opposed  the
formation of a youth commission in the Western Cape?  [Interjections.]  They
opposed that and yet they have the gall to come into  this  House  and  make
pious statements about our youth. But, hon Sinclair, when they actually  had
the chance to govern they  refused  to  allow  a  youth  commission  in  the
Western Cape.
I actually want to bring  to  the  members'  attention,  in  this  House,  a
statement by  someone  who  has  now  been  promoted  by  the  DA  from  the
legislature to the National Assembly and is now the spokesperson of the  DA.
This is what she thinks of women - mainly young women  and  black  women  in
Parliament, and I want to quote from Hansard. Hon Helen Zille,  who  is  now
the official spokesperson of the DA, said:


  I have been in some of the portfolio committees and  I  can  see  what  a
  drain token representatives are on the  public  purse.  Which  women  are
  there because they add real value and which are there  to  fill  the  ANC
  quotas?

Now this is in the context where we have all seen the value  that  women  in
this House add everyday, and we have seen it again  today.  Then  she  said,
and this is a direct quote:


  They take up space there, earn a salary, eat a big lunch,  pack  in  some
  ``padkos'' and drive off in a C-class Mercedes-Benz.

I want to challenge these women from the DA here: be braver. This  is  about
women and it's about our youth. I  want  to  challenge  these  women  to  do
something that Tony Leon has not been  prepared  to  do  -  sorry,  comrade.
[Laughter.] This is something which makes me  angry.  I  want  to  challenge
these two hon members, Robinson and Terblanche, to do  something  that  Tony
Leon has not done up until now, and that is to  distance  himself  from  hon
member Zille's statements.

Het hulle die moed om dit te doen of gaan hulle net sê,  ``Nee,  baas  Tony,
ja, baas Tony.''? [Gelag.] Wat gaan hulle doen? [Do they  have  the  courage
to do so or are they just going to say: ``No, boss Tony, yes, boss  Tony.''?
[Laughter.] What are they going to do?]

But clearly, the image of Hector Petersen being carried by a fellow  comrade
with his sister crying will forever remind us of the cruelty  of  apartheid.
In our province we remember Xolile Musi from Langa - the first student  shot
after the uprisings of 1976. We remember Ashley Kriel and  Anton  Fransch  -
people who laid down their lives to liberate this country.

Part of  the  apartheid  masters'  plan  was  to  make  black  people  their
permanent slaves.  And  people  such  as  Mrs  Robinson  were  sitting  very
comfortably in Houghton. What were  they  actually  doing?  What  were  they
actually doing other than carrying forward opposition politics here  in  the
National Assembly? But we have seen that hon  Sinclair  and  also  hon  Raju
have represented what our youth actually needs, and that is a commitment  by
all of  us  to  do  something  about  the  problem,  not  to  frustrate  and
demobilise the youth by refusing to establish a  youth  commission  in  this
province.
They introduced Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in  our  schools  and
the students rejected this. But now our  Government  is  advancing  all  our
languages,  including  Afrikaans.  Our   country   in   1994,   achieved   a
breakthrough and that gave hope to our youth; and I have said that  here  in
the Western Cape we lag behind.

Siyazi  ukuba  apha  eNtshona  Koloni  abantu  abamnyama  bathwele  umthwalo
onzima.  Siyazikhumbula  iidompas;   siyabakhumbula   oomaCrossroads   nejob
reservation. Sizikhumbula zonke  ezo  zinto.  [Uwelewele.]  UMzantsi  Afrika
ufumene inkululeko ngo-1994 sajabula  apha  eNtshona  Koloni  kodwa  ulutsha
lufumana iingxaki ezininzi. [We know that here in  the  Western  Cape  black
people are carrying a heavy burden. We still  remember  the  pass  laws,  we
still remember  Crossroads  and  job  reservation.  We  remember  all  those
things. [Interjections.] South Africa gained its  freedom  in  1994  and  we
rejoiced here in the Western Cape, but the youth is experiencing problems.]
Die swart en die bruin jeug het gely onder hierdie DA-regering van die  Wes-
Kaap. Hulle het gesukkel, omdat die voormalige  DA-regering  nie  net  blind
was aangaande die jeug in die algemeen nie, maar  in  spesifieke  terme  het
hulle niks gedoen vir swart en bruin  jeugdiges  nie.  [The  black  and  the
coloured youth have suffered under this DA government of the  Western  Cape.
They struggled because the former DA government was not only  blind  to  the
youth in general, but they did  nothing  specific  for  black  and  coloured
youth.]

And what that actually meant is that our white  youth,  our  coloured  youth
and our black youth in this province have been kept apart  from  each  other
and have not been able to actually build this particular  country.  That  is
what we have to work against. We have to unite this  province  and  that  is
why our Premier in this province has said: ``INtshona Koloni  likhaya  lethu
sonke!'' [The Western Cape is a home to all!] ``Die Wes-Kaap  is  'n  tuiste
vir almal.'' [The Western Cape is a home to all.]
We now have to catch up with the progress that the youth in  many  parts  of
our country has actually made because of the pious and  sanctimonious  style
of that DA government which actually  marginalised  and  underdeveloped  the
youth in the Western Cape. Our President has  committed  the  Government  to
achieving very visible advances in regard to improving the quality  of  life
of all of our people, including opening the doors of learning and culture  -
a proud clause of the Freedom Charter; the Freedom Charter for  which  other
members of this House want to rubbish the New NP  for  adopting.  ``Ek  vra,
het hulle al die ``Freedom Charter'' gelees? [I  ask,  Have  they  read  the
Freedom Charter yet?]  ``Bawufundile  uMqulu  weNkuleko  okanye  bathi  hayi
yinto ye-ANC nje le?'' [Have they read the Freedom Charter or  do  they  say
no, this is just an ANC thing?] ``Ek vra hulle moet die ding lees.'' [I  ask
that they read the thing.]

The President has challenged us to make a contract.  In  this  province  our
education  department  is  meeting  with  Sasco,  South  African   Students'
Congress, so that we can form a contract to wipe  out  adult  illiteracy  in
this province. So, Sasco is coming forward.
In Pelican Park there is a library that the school governing  body  has  not
only added and equipped from resources  in  the  community,  but  they  have
opened that library to the Pelican Park community to use on weekends and  in
the evenings. But then Mrs Robinson comes here and says that the youth  have
no opportunities because of this Government. No wonder the DA can  only  now
pretend to be a government-in-waiting.

Maar ons mense het al klaar besluit die DA kom nooit weer  terug  nie.  [But
our people have already decided that the DA is never coming back.]

I-DA   iphelile.   Sithi:   Phambili    lutsha,    phambili!    [Uwelewele.]
[Kwaqhwatywa.] [The DA is finished. We say forward to  the  youth,  forward!
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I call upon the  hon  Minister  to  address
the House.

Mr M O ROBERTSEN: Chairperson, on a  point  of  order:  Hon  Dugmore,  I  am
``Robertsen'' and  the  hon  member  over  there  is  ``Robinson'',  please!
[Laughter.]

Mr C DUGMORE: I specifically said "Robinson" with an "n", and I referred  to
a lady, which I am sure you are not. Thank you. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Thank you, Madam Chair. MEC Dugmore and  hon
members, before I respond to a few of them, let me first of  all  thank  all
the speakers who participated in this debate. Let me just  make  two  points
before I respond. The first one is that tomorrow, 16 June,  President  Mbeki
will be handing out national orders. There were  a  number  of  quotes  made
from the former President of the ANC, Comrade O R Tambo the last time I  was
here. That is why I like this House so much. I  think  you  must  teach  the
National Assembly members something, so they can  also  quote  comrade  O  R
Tambo more often. Part of the national awards is to do with  the  companions
of O R Tambo. [Applause.]

The second  one  is  that  Deputy  President  Jacob  Zuma  will  attend  the
unveiling of the tombstone of Peter  Mokaba  at  the  Peter  Mokaba  Stadium
tomorrow. I am raising this because when we speak about Youth  Day  I  think
it is necessary for us to remember one of the  great  young  heroes  of  our
time, and that is Comrade Peter Mokaba.

I suppose I am lucky because I  heard  two  maiden  speeches  today,  and  I
suppose Mr Goeieman's great grandfather was correct because he is  a  "goeie
man." But due to time constraints, I am going to rush  through  my  response
as I have to catch a plane, Madam Chair. Hon Raju,  who  I  told  you  is  a
poet, used the words "suffocating tentacles" and I hope sometimes  that  the
"suffocating tentacles" that prevent some of the DA people from  looking  at
the truth when they see it can be removed.

I want to start with Mr Thetjeng. When you  use  words  like  a  farmer  who
beats his donkey, just  think  about  who  your  members  and  leaders  are,
because you are still treating some of our people as if  they  are  donkeys.
To come here and say that most of our youth have lost  hope,  that  they  do
not  have  real  job  opportunities,  and  that  they  no  longer  make  job
applications, either stems  from  the  fact  that  that  this  member  lives
somewhere else, because he certainly does not live in South Africa, or  that
there is something wrong with the  NCOP  if  it  cannot  even  teach  simple
things to its own members. Because you must at  least  be  honest  with  the
truth. You can criticise us of  course,  but  do  not  come  here  and  make
nonsensical statements about the youth not having hope. They have hope,  and
that is why the majority of  them  voted  for  the  ANC  and  not  for  you.
[Laughter.]

It is nonsensical to suggest  that  our  youth  today  are  not  interested,
because they are. What we have to do to ensure that those of our  youth  who
are still not part of that is to bring them in, so that they can also  enjoy
the fruits of democracy and  freedom.  And  then  to  say  that  the  wealth
belongs to those who have  political  connections  shows  that  he  actually
lives somewhere else. The truth of the matter is that the economy  of  South
Africa still belongs to a minority of a minority of a minority and they  are
not black; they are white. Who controls corporate  South  Africa?  The  only
problem is that his party goes and looks for money from them,  but  they  do
not even want to give his party any more money because they think  they  are
unrepresentative.

And so hon Sinclair, please do me a favour. We will give you a copy  of  the
Freedom Charter and then you give a copy to Mr  Thetjeng,  so  that  by  the
time we celebrate the 50th anniversary of  the  Freedom  Charter,  he  would
have read it and he would have educated himself. Now Mr Thetjeng, if I  were
you I would hope that many people stay away from the polls during  the  next
election, because they are going to vote for the ANC anyway.

But I want to turn to Ms Terblanché. I agree with her when she says that  we
must focus on the years ahead. But you know, your youth  should  not  excuse
you from ignorance. If you want to stand in this House and  make  a  totally
untruthful statement that the antiretroviral roll-out has been stopped,  you
must come and demonstrate to us where it has  stopped  because  I  think  we
must have respect for this Parliament and for this House.  And  one  of  the
things we must have respect for is some elementary truth.  If  some  members
want to criticise us let them criticise, but at  least  let  them  tell  the
truth. So, no ARV roll-out has been stopped in South Africa -  that  is  the
first thing.

Then she talks about children at a school in Potchefstroom. That is  an  old
tactic of your predecessors too, when they want to pretend  that  they  know
some African township names, a name of a school or that  of  some  children.
Now, let me teach you something. You cannot just  take  a  group  of  school
children and make a determination that they are HIV-positive, and  therefore
they should have ARVs. You have not understood  the  first  thing.  Firstly,
have you gone to  the  school  to  check?  Have  you?  Were  those  children
properly tested? Have you checked what their count is so that if it  is  200
or less they can then qualify for ARVs? Have you done that? Do you have  the
information?

Are you ready  to  bring  this  information  to  this  House  next  week?  I
challenge you to do it. Madam Chair she must come. She must go back  to  the
school and check what the count shows of the children who  were  tested.  It
the count shows that it is 200 or less they  would  qualify  for  ARVs,  and
therefore they should be given ARVs. ARVs  cannot  be  given  as  if  it  is
aspirin. Do you understand that? So, I am a bit angry, because I think  that
the DA wants to play political games with our people's lives. It  is  wrong,
because on some of these issues we need to try to  find  the  common  ground
consensus, so that together we can  attempt  to  deal  with  some  of  those
fundamental challenges and questions  facing  us,  and  that  remains  youth
development.

My only appeal to the DA speakers is  to  stop  playing  political  football
with the lives of our people. It is not going to assist  you.  You  have  no
hope in hell or of ever winning power in this country, and you  would  be  a
grandmother by the time you think you can even get this power. [Laughter.]

So what we need to do is to say  you  must  disagree  with  us  politically,
ideologically, theoretically, and on  fundamental  policy  issues.  That  is
part of a political debate and that is part of a  political  discourse.  But
to do that Ms Terblanché - I hope you are not related  to  the  one  on  the
horse, and nogal a black  horse  [Laughter.]  -  you  must  be  honest  with
yourself.

If you want to understand anything about  HIV  and  Aids,  if  you  want  to
understand  anything  about  antiretrovirals,  if  you  want  to  understand
anything about at what point you roll them out, if you  want  to  understand
anything about what kind of campaign  we  need,  in  order  to  prevent  the
spread of HIV and Aids, come and talk to us and you will learn something.

And the last thing I will say to you is that in this province  I  know  they
make a lot of noise  by  saying  that  they  were  the  first  to  roll  out
antiretrovirals. Go and see how many thousands received it, and go  and  see
who  were  the  main  people  responsible  for  it.  It  was  Médicins  Sans
Frontiers. There is a lot of nonsense talked about who is rolling out  what.
There was very little rolled out here; in fact only a few thousands for  all
the time that the DA was in power. That is a reality. So I  just  hope  that
as we continue this  debate,  as  we  continue  to  discuss  these  critical
challenges facing the youth of South Africa, the  least  we  can  do  is  be
truthful with ourselves, if not with the rest  of  the  society.  Thank  you
very much.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much, hon Minister. We sure  are
going to continue to engage ourselves on the issues that affect our people.

May I take this opportunity to wish all members well who are  going  to  the
provinces. I was asked by the Chief Whip to request that you remain in  Cape
Town to celebrate with the people of the Western Cape. There is a lot to  be
done and a lot to learn. Let us all go and celebrate the  victories  of  our
people and of our young people tomorrow.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 17:51.
