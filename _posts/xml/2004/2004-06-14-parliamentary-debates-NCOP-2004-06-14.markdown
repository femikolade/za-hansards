                             (Review of policy)

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs:

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon  members,  dear  friends,  we
are indeed very thankful for the opportunity to address this  House  on  the
occasion of the policy debate on our Budget Vote. This  will  be  the  first
time that  we  present  a  budget  to  you  since  our  appointment  to  the
leadership of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Over the past month or so since our appointment, we have taken some time  to
come up to speed with the challenges  facing  our  department.  Through  the
assistance of our management and staff, we have looked at possible  ways  of
addressing most of these challenges. This year's budget is based  mainly  on
these possible solutions to these problems.

You may realise that this budget is designed as an intervention  budget,  as
we have identified several key areas that need our urgent  attention  during
this financial  year  if  we  are  to  start  the  process  of  turning  our
department around. The budget went before the National Assembly last  Friday
and, we hope, as was the case with the National Assembly, that  hon  members
in this House will share our urgency and support us in the need  to  address
some of the known problems we are encountering in the department.

During the debate in the National Assembly we brought to  the  attention  of
the House the situation of the !Xun and the  Khwe  communities  of  the  San
region in the Northern Cape.  These  people  were  used  by  the  former  SA
Defence Force  as  trackers  during  the  apartheid  wars  and  were  mostly
recruited into the 31 Battalion section of the armed forces.  Although  some
of  their  families  were  relocated  and  settled  in   South   Africa   in
Schmidtsdrif, identity documents were only issued to those  who  had  joined
the SA Defence Force. The rest of the family particulars  were  recorded  on
combo cards and kept by the SADF.

We celebrated the passing of our first Budget  Vote  with  members  of  this
community on Friday, after having given them due recognition for  the  first
time as citizens of our country. [Applause]. Eight hundred of them  are  now
proud holders of the new, green bar-coded  ID.  This  has  demonstrated  our
commitment to ensuring that where our department was used  as  a  source  to
humiliate others in the past, we will find a way of using  our  services  to
give back a level of dignity to all South Africans.

Today the Department of Home Affairs continues to exist, and  we  are  still
involved in the activities of civil registration and the  maintenance  of  a
population register, including the issuing of identity  documents.  A  great
difference, however, is the fact that we now have a state  whose  priorities
are based on a  completely  different  premise  from  those  who  ruled  our
country in the 1940s and 1950s when resistance to pass laws intensified.

We have made a call on all South Africans to come forward to  be  registered
and issued with a green bar-coded identity document, which serves as a  tool
to guarantee their South African-ness, an identity they can be proud of  and
one that reverses the  historical  dehumanisation  and  segregation  of  our
people. Although it was introduced during  the  dying  years  of  apartheid,
over the past 10 years we have used  the  existence  of  a  single,  uniform
population register for all South  Africans  as  a  means  of  unifying  our
country with a common identity and patriotism.

I am quite encouraged by the fact that more  South  Africans  are  requiring
these IDs as they increasingly realise their importance  in  their  everyday
lives. We are happy that these IDs  have  been  used  as  the  key  for  the
majority of people to access Government  services  in  the  form  of  health
care, social grants, education, housing and other services.

We made a commitment to  the  public  last  week  that  by  April  2005  the
Department of Home Affairs would institute a  survey  aimed  at  determining
the extent of the problem regarding adult South Africans who have never  had
identity documents. The  result  of  this  survey  will  be  useful  in  the
planning cycle of the department and in determining the scope and nature  of
the ID campaign. Some of the findings of  this  survey  will  also  help  us
determine issues of policy regarding the late  registration  of  births  and
the curbing of abuse of this provision. We will also be  able  to  determine
how many South Africans have still not converted to the green  bar-coded  ID
in order to decide whether we should set a deadline for such conversion.

It should be worrying to us that 18 years after the introduction of the  new
ID, there are South Africans who still carry the old  reference  book,  book
of life or dompas. It is important that the department, as  a  custodian  of
valuable data on population dynamics, has precise information on the  extent
of the need for its services experienced particularly by our citizens.

We believe that the finalisation  of  the  Home  Affairs  National  Identity
System, Hanis, will play a role in ushering in  this  new  approach  to  the
gathering and dissemination of data. The turnaround  objectives  of  our  IT
establishment seek to achieve several target outputs over the period of  the
MTEF and beyond, and they include the full computerisation  of  our  offices
within the coming five years; the upgrading  of  our  IT  infrastructure  to
ensure full data  connectivity  to  all  our  offices  capable  of  handling
increased data traffic,  including  the  use  of  satellite  technology  for
remote areas and mobile units; the upgrading of  Hanis  into  an  integrated
biometric database for all people served by  the  department,  incorporating
our population register,  moving  control  system,  refugee  database,  visa
system and our stop lease.

In the long term, if we have a reliable civic registration process, it  will
become central to the provision of  data  regarding  population  trends  and
that, at least at the level of counting, it will  not  necessarily  look  at
counting people through  a  census  every  five  years.  We  currently  have
several policies and operational initiatives  with  Statistics  SA  in  this
regard.

We continue to receive many complaints from the public about  the  spate  of
fraudulent marriages registered  in  the  records  of  the  department.  Our
current strategic plan for the MTEF reflects  prominently  our  campaign  to
assist women who find themselves trapped in this and similar situations.

At a public level  there  is  a  need  for  the  department  to  create  the
necessary capacity for women  to  come  forward  and  verify  their  marital
status as reflected in our records.  Women  who  are  married  in  terms  of
customary unions will also be  allowed  the  opportunity  to  check  whether
their marriages are registered or not.  We  intend  for  this  to  become  a
standing programme of the department. We will  seek  partnerships  with  key
stakeholders and relevant state institutions in the implementation  of  this
campaign.

Members  will  recall  that  in  2002  we  launched  the  accelerated  birth
registration campaign in Khayelitsha. This was largely  a  response  to  the
call by the President that close to 3 million children remained outside  the
social safety net because they were not registered for child support  grants
as a result of the lack of enabling documents, such  as  birth  certificates
and IDs, for both these children  and  their  care-givers.  I  am  happy  to
report to this House that since the launch of that campaign, the  department
has been working in partnership  with  departments  of  social  services  at
national and provincial levels and that although Cabinet had envisaged  that
we should reach a target of 3,2 million registered children by  the  end  of
2004, this partnership has already covered children in excess of  4  million
and ensured their registration in the safety net. [Applause.]

We see our  contribution  through  this  birth  registration  as  a  poverty
alleviation initiative that allows for  many  vulnerable  children  to  have
access to basic services from the Government. During the  month  of  August,
we will initiate and intensify a drive to  ensure  better  linkages  between
the Department of Home Affairs and hospitals and clinics where children  are
born in order to provide essential registration of children  born  in  these
health facilities.

Our roll-out of mobile units will also serve this campaign  specifically  in
rural areas. All the initiatives that we are raising, or have  referred  to,
are about the  need  to  improve  levels  of  service  delivery  within  the
Department of Home Affairs. No other priority can  be  more  urgent  for  us
than this one. We designed our planning processes  in  such  a  manner  that
every other priority should  be  aimed  at  attaining  this  improvement  in
service delivery levels.

One of the key priority areas in the improvement of service delivery  levels
is the urgent need to ensure that services offered  by  the  department  are
conveniently accessible to all citizens who require  them.  It  has  been  a
trend, due to the planning priorities of the previous government, that  most
of our offices are located in towns and other urban centres. This has  meant
that our people in rural areas and informal settlements  are  the  ones  who
travel long distances, wait in long queues and spend money they normally  do
not have in order to receive services from the department.

I said last week in the National Assembly that it will be necessary  for  us
to commit ourselves before that House, and before this House too, to  change
things, as it is not acceptable that our offices should remain the  greatest
source of frustration for the people who come to us for one sort of  service
or another. In this regard, I have requested the department  to  conduct  an
audit of our infrastructure needs, aimed at ensuring that  we  are  able  to
lessen the inconvenience to  our  clients  when  they  need  to  access  our
services.

In this budget we have allocated R67 million to secure mobile units,  and  I
want to emphasise that because in the National Assembly we  made  a  mistake
by reporting that we had allocated R14 million. We now want  to  put  it  on
record that, in fact, the amount is R67 million that will be used to  secure
mobile units, which will be ready for utilisation before  the  end  of  this
financial year. [Applause.]

Due to the fact that our capital works roll-out programme will not  be  able
to build a new office in each one of the rural villages and wards,  it  will
still be necessary that some  interim  arrangements  be  made  in  order  to
ensure the presence of the department in every corner  of  the  country.  In
this regard, we will convert containers into service points in some  of  the
most remote areas of our country as a stopgap measure  to  provide  services
to our people. These will at least ensure that people do not have to  travel
long distances only to fill in an application form or for the collection  of
their IDs and other certificates.

Hon members, as already announced,  we  will  launch  a  community-volunteer
campaign to clean up our offices, some of which are in a  serious  state  of
dilapidation, in order to ensure that a more pleasant environment exists  in
our offices for all our clients. This launch  takes  place  this  Friday  19
June 2004. In the spirit of Ilima, we invite hon members to be part of  this
campaign.

Still on the matter of service delivery, for  quite  some  time  there  have
been  concerns  about  the  fact  that  the  department  is  not  adequately
capacitated to fulfil its mandate. This has had a serious impact on  service
delivery levels in the department.

I must share with the House that another key priority for us is the need  to
acquire the necessary human resources and financial  capacity  required  for
us to fulfil our  mandate.  We  have  since  adopted  a  new  organisational
establishment based on  a  scientific  assessment  of  the  necessary  human
resources capacity required for us to deliver effectively  and  efficiently.
Since the start of this financial year in April, we have  filled  more  than
500 vacancies. It is our intention to fill a  further  1  000  posts  during
this year, including at the level of our front line offices. At  the  senior
management level we have advertised for 19 posts. You must  have  seen  that
yesterday. There were  six  additional  vacancies,  which  appeared  in  the
Sunday papers.

In his state of the nation address, the President emphasised  the  need  for
us to finalise the policy framework for immigration in  the  country  within
three months. This directive meant that the current  impasse  regarding  the
regulations for  the  Immigration  Act  needs  to  be  resolved  within  the
deadline provided by the President.

We have since  started  this  process  within  the  committee  of  Ministers
established by Cabinet to deal with this matter.  We  have  agreed  that  in
order to resolve some of the problems within  the  current  regulations,  we
need to make certain changes to the Act itself. In the  short  term  we  are
only looking at effecting those amendments that are  necessary  to  finalise
the regulations in order to meet the three months'  deadline  given  by  the
President in his state of the nation address.

It is our intention, therefore, to seek Cabinet's approval to introduce  the
Immigration Amendment Bill to Parliament, and to finalise its processing  by
the end of August. For us it is urgent that  South  Africa  should  have  an
immigration policy regime that is responsive to the needs of the country  in
the areas of attracting direct foreign investment,  encourages  tourism  and
contributes to economic growth through the attraction of skills.

While it is necessary for us to protect  employment  opportunities  for  our
own citizens, it will also be important that our immigration  policy  should
not  hinder  our  contribution  to  the  improvement  of  the  socioeconomic
conditions of our neighbouring countries. This will be a delicate  balancing
act indeed.

Understandably,  due  to  our  international  obligations,  specifically  to
Africa where we have some of the poorest nations of the world,  the  refugee
community within  the  country  has  been  growing.  There  is  a  justified
expectation that due to its position as  a  beacon  of  hope,  South  Africa
should be able to lend a helping hand to those who have to flee their  homes
due to wars and human rights issues - conflicts. Therefore, as you know,  we
also have economic refugees in this country.

The challenge for us in the immediate term is to ensure that we  reduce  the
amount of red tape and frustration that normally  accompany  the  processing
of applications by asylum seekers. The red tape and delays have  meant  that
even  those  people  who  do  not  need  protection  end  up   abusing   our
hospitality.  The  sooner  we  shorten  the  time   for   processing   these
applications and deal with the current backlog of applications,  the  better
it will be  for  our  service  delivery  imperatives  as  well  as  for  our
country's security.

In this regard, our new organisational establishments  make  provisions  for
an increase in the number of refugee status determination officers in  order
to provide the necessary capacity required for the efficient  processing  of
applications. It is  necessary  that  our  policies  and  operations  should
strike a balance between providing protection  to  those  who  need  it  and
addressing our security concerns.

We have all the intentions of dealing harshly with those who  undermine  our
borders and our security by sneaking illegally into  the  country.  This  is
because, in a country such  as  ours,  it  is   not  necessary  to  come  in
illegally because you can present yourself  to  any  of  our  embassies  and
apply for any one of the many temporary  residence  permits,  work  permits,
study permits or whatever permit, as there are so many and  they  are  never
unreasonably denied.

In line  with  our  commitment  to  provide  better  service,  I  have  also
requested the department to conduct an audit of  all  the  foreign  missions
where we do not have Home Affairs services around the continent  of  Africa.
At this stage, because of our role  in  the  Nepad,  people  who  come  from
certain states in Africa should not have  to  travel  around  the  continent
just to get a South African visa in order to visit South Africa.

We are still committed to the upgrading of our ports of entry in  order  for
them to be of a standard and image that  sells  our  country  positively  to
visitors who come here. The programme for the  efficient  administration  of
the border posts will, of necessity, be an interdepartmental one,  including
the other departments that work on the borders. At a Cabinet-cluster  level,
we have agreed on the integrated approach that has seen the adoption of  the
border control co-ordinating committee to ensure multi-agency  planning  and
co-ordination.

Similar multi-agency initiatives have also been put in place with regard  to
the important issue of fighting corruption within the  department.  We  have
already  decided  to  upgrade  our  anticorruption   unit   into   a   chief
directorate. The work of this unit is already visible, hon members,  in  the
many arrests that the police have  effected  as  a  result  of  the  initial
investigations within the department. The challenge, however, is to  find  a
more proactive approach to dealing with corruption involving the  retraining
of staff, screening  of  our  appointments,  gathering  of  intelligence  to
ensure that we prevent corruption, rather than reacting to it when there  is
already damage to the integrity of our systems.

It must be stressed, hon members, that most of the good intentions  we  have
might just become a pipe-dream if we do not have the kind  of  vehicle  with
the correct mindset to carry this task forward. We noted reports  about  the
levels of morale amongst our staff, and it is encouraging that we have  been
presented with plans to deal with this problem. For us, these  are  some  of
the transformation priorities facing our department.  There  is  a  need  to
make sure that the psychological make-up of our staff is at  all  times  one
that  is  beneficial  to  these  priorities.  We  will  also  be  addressing
seriously  the  matter  of  the  gender  imbalances  within  our  managerial
structures.

Lastly, I need to point out that most of the  things  that  we  have  raised
here are urgent, and we will need you, hon  members,  to  give  us  all  the
support that we need. At times we will put you under a lot  of  pressure  to
pass legislation within very short periods of time, such as the one  we  are
passing in the National Assembly tomorrow, which amends the  Electoral  Act.
We will require your support. It is  not  our  intention  to  undermine  the
legislature; however, we require your support to  do  all  this  because  we
have to move with speed and steam ahead to make sure that things do happen.

At the end of the day,  our  work  will  be  judged  on  the  basis  of  our
contribution to making the lives of ordinary South Africans  a  little  more
bearable. That is the challenge that the department is facing. I thank  you,
hon members. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you,  hon  Minister,  may  I  also
take this opportunity to thank you. On behalf of this wonderful  House,  the
NCOP, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment as a Minister  of  Home
Affairs. We have all the trust  in  you,  and  this  House  in  playing  its
oversight function will do its best to assist the department. We  thank  you
very much, Minister.

Mrs  J  MASILO:  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  Director-General  and
officials from the Department of Home  Affairs,  and  hon  members  of  this
august House, as the acting chairperson of the Select  Committee  on  Social
Services may I start by congratulating the Minister and the Deputy  Minister
in absentia on their new appointments in the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Your
appointments as Ministers are  so  appropriate  as  you  head  a  presidency
department such as home affairs; and you are presidents in your  own  rights
-  ANC  Women's  League  and  ANC  Youth  League  respectively.  [Applause.]
Mmangwana o tshwara thipa ka mo bogaleng. (A real  mother  is  the  one  who
protects her children even in difficult situations.)

I cannot overemphasise the vision your leadership is giving to a  department
that takes care of the lives of South Africans from  cradle  to  grave,  and
the people from all over who visit, stay or work  in  our  country.  It  has
become clear, from the budget briefing we received from the  department  and
the  concerns  addressed  in  the  department's  turn-around  strategy   and
strategic plan, that as a committee we need to fasten our safety  belts.  In
my own experience, the work starts now. This department has  from  a  public
perspective, the primary task  of  providing  identification  to  all  South
African citizens. The Batho Pele  principle  must  be  demonstrated  at  the
Department of Home Affairs. People  first  and  service  excellence  is  the
vision of this department.

The intervention by the  President  in  the  implementation  of  immigration
regulations is an urgent matter for  attention.  It  has  to  happen  within
three months from the date of announcement and the end  of  August  2004  is
the target time.

As for the roll-over this will soon be an experience of the  past  with  the
kind of strategic plan and turn-around strategy before us.  Indications  are
clear that the budget approved will be utilised within each  financial  year
of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The  strategic  posts  within  the
Department of Home Affairs are  about  to  be  finalised.  This  is  a  very
important wheel of delivery in a department  beyond  appointments,  and  the
culture  of  Batho  Pele  needs  to  be  implemented  in  new  appointments,
promotions or transfers.

The need to upgrade information technology  systems  in  the  department  is
crucial. The integration of the IT system is  important.  Officials  at  the
regional offices have to be monitored with ease  from  Civitas  building  in
the Headquarters in Pretoria. Many papers that are stored  as  records  have
to be computerised and accessed with ease from any point in the country.  We
also  recognize  that  the  department,  through  its  strategic  plan,   is
budgeting for  a  new  system  of  tracking  and  tracing  applications  for
identity documents. This envisaged system, we believe, will  assist  in  the
investigation of  various  acts  of  corruption,  including  fraud  and  the
contravention of the Birth  and  Death  Registration  Act  as  well  as  the
Identification Act.

This department has, certainly from a public perspective, the  primary  task
of providing identification to all South African citizens. To  most  in  the
First World and those South Africans  to  whom  the  indignity  of  being  a
citizen  without  a  country  is  a  suppressed  memory,  the  question   of
identification may not  seem  such  an  important  issue.  However,  to  the
majority in South Africa, citizenship  and  identity  is  a  very  sensitive
issue.  It  is  an  issue  fraught  with  humiliation  and  deprivation   of
citizenship because a racist government said that  millions  of  its  people
did not have the right credentials  to  be  citizens.  We  were  treated  as
foreigners in the  country  of  our  birth.  We  fought  many  personal  and
collective battles to retain the right to be identified as  South  Africans,
despite those who legislated that we needed to carry a dompas, the  book  of
life,  Nkitse  gore  ke  mang,  and  Lokwalo  la  mosepele  of  the   former
Bophuthatswana and other Bantustans to gain entry into white  neighbourhoods
and international countries.

With this kind of history  the  department  is  duty-bound  to  relentlessly
pursue a seemingly impossible mission of  bringing  ID  documents  to  every
single South African, even those who choose to  live  in  the  remotest  and
most impassable terrains in our country. We are  therefore  encouraged  that
the department has embarked  upon  and  caused  a  turn-around  strategy  to
address the restoration of the dignity  of  our  people,  as  well  as  many
administrative,  infrastructural  and  legislative  changes  needed  in  its
budget. We are further encouraged that the  issue  of  fraudulent  marriages
which plagues our women who are trapped in marriages without their  consent,
or who are bribed to marry unscrupulous foreigners, will  be  addressed.  We
look forward to legislative and regulatory changes  that  will  protect  our
poor and vulnerable women.

We are also encouraged that  corrupt  practices  will  be  eliminated;  such
cases where an immigration officer based in  Pretoria  District  Office  was
arrested on 12 May 2004 for allegedly  accepting  bribes.  We  are  finding,
especially at our offices at the ports of  entry,  that  our  officials  are
inundated with illegal propositions from potential immigrants who enter  our
country. With the most recent discovery  of  12  alleged  corrupt  officials
arrested in Bloemfontein, members of  this  select  committee  have  further
proof that the Department of Home  Affairs  is  serious  about  rooting  out
corruption.

Already the new premises of the department in Randfontein  District  Offices
serve as an encouragement to us that  the  pace  of  erecting  new  building
sites is on an upward and not downward spiral. We are glad that it  will  no
longer serve as a district  but  as  a  regional  office.  Even  with  these
upgrades, an implementation of the Hanis reloaded  project,  the  department
will have its plate full in view of the enormous backlogs that  still  exist
in its information technology.

We are happy to support this budget and encourage the department  to  fulfil
all the tasks it has set for itself in  the  turn-around  strategy.  Lastly,
the local government elections are just around the corner and  as  a  select
committee we want to know about the readiness  of  the  department  and  its
municipal electoral preparedness. This issue of ID documents  to  all  South
Africans is still an urgent matter. The accessibility to the department  and
the increase in mobile units planned by the department will  come  in  handy
for this operation.

In conclusion, I am delighted  to  learn  that  during  the  debate  in  the
National Assembly on Friday, a number of members of  the  Khoisan  community
were part of the proceedings. The number of outstanding ID applications  for
this community that needs to be processed has to be sped up for them  to  be
able to participate in  the  local  government  election.  I  fully  support
Budget Vote No 4. Ke a leboga. [I thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chairperson, let me follow in the  footsteps  of  my
colleagues by  congratulating  the  Minister  on  her  appointment  in  this
department, as well as the Deputy who is not  currently  with  us  today.  I
would also like to congratulate the department for  the  identity  documents
that were distributed to the Khoe and the Kwe communities  in  the  Northern
Cape. I think that if we start in this way, we will go a long way.  The  ANC
has been at the forefront of instigating changes in the  policy  and  vision
of all departments, but it was particularly interested  in  the  performance
of this department in the delivery  of  vital  documents.  The  delivery  of
these documents meant that the ordinary citizens would then be able to  have
access to a wide range of government services  like  social  grants,  health
services, housing and other services as well as the delivery of a  free  and
fair electoral process, which was and remains a cornerstone of the  work  of
this department.

It would therefore be fair to say that the vast bulk  of  services  expected
from Home Affairs depends, to a large  extent,  on  a  highly  sophisticated
information technology  infrastructure.  In  the  ANC's  own  assessment  of
service delivery to the provinces, the offices of the department  have  been
found to have  long  queues,  long  waiting  periods  and  even  longer  and
unnecessary return journeys to check  whether  documents  applied  for  have
already arrived. Meanwhile other governments departments  that  could  offer
IT support to Home Affairs to  alleviate  the  situation  could  not  do  so
because invariably where  there  were  networks  in  the  department,  these
systems were not incompatible with  those  systems  already  used  by  other
departments.  In  addition  to  the  handicap  of  incompatibility   between
systems, offices at the ports  of  entry  do  not  have  instant  access  to
mainframes within the department to do  verification  of  documentation.  In
fact, many of these offices are not even computerized. This also holds  true
for many rural and peri-urban home affairs offices. Overall,  the  ANC  have
found that Home Affairs offices are almost  totally  paper-based  and  where
they have computers, it is severely lacking in innovative IT systems.

Over and above the general use of  information  technology  to  deliver  its
services, the department has had for many years now  a  noble  idea  in  the
form  of  a  new  smart-card  system  called  the  Home   Affairs   National
Identification System, or the Hanis project. The idea was conceived in  1993
and received Cabinet approval in 1996 and according to the department,  this
Hanis  system  would  be  linked  to  a  centralised  database  housing  the
existences and activities of all South African  citizens,  thereby  bringing
us rapidly into the 21st century.

While no one doubts that it is vital that we are able, through  a  foolproof
system such as Hanis, to verify that an individual is indeed whoever  he  or
she claims to be, the only problem is that this system is not yet  fully  up
and running. Millions of rands have already been spent  to  make  sure  that
this system is implemented, but all is not lost. The new  Minister  and  the
Deputy Minister, together with the not-so-new director-general have  already
identified this IT area as a critical intervention area. They have in  their
turnaround strategy, and in their strategic plan  of  2004-05  and  2006-07,
set very clear target  dates  for  each  area  of  the  IT  upgrades  to  be
implemented. They should be commended under their Hanis reloaded vision  for
introducing a phased-in approach to implement a new national ID  card.  Once
the information technology is thrust into the 21st  century,  the  next  ten
years of implementation should be easier to manage.

This need for sophisticated information technology  is  especially  true  in
our new democracy. With South Africa's  peaceful  transition  to  democracy,
the global community now has increasingly looked towards  our  shores  as  a
tourist mecca, putting  additional  pressure  on  Home  Affairs  to  deliver
travel documentation on a far larger scale than ever before.  In  fact,  the
ports of entry around the country recorded that in 1994 we had  3,8  million
visitors and this number dramatically increased  to  6,5  million  in  2002.
Similarly, our new democracy  provided  sanctuary  for  over  5  000  asylum
seekers and refugees from across the continent of Africa, with  this  number
increasing to over 20 000 in 2002.

At the same time, while Home Affairs  provides  legal  means  to  enter  our
country, they  also  are  fighting  an  increasing  tidal  wave  of  illegal
immigrants testing our border control and efficacy in tracking  and  tracing
documents issued to legitimate citizens. Indeed, the department seems to  be
throwing good money after bad when it comes to  our  attempts  to  stem  the
tide of illegal immigrants resulting in the repatriation of 150 000  illegal
immigrants per year. Somewhere in the execution of their responsibility  and
in the processing of service delivery outputs much money is being spent  and
a  foolproof  national  identification  system   and   electronic   document
management system will certainly ease this problem as well as the  financial
burden placed on the department.

The ANC knows that this department is without  doubt  one  that  is  in  the
transition  phase  of  transformation  and  still  lags  far  behind   other
departments. By its  own  assessment,  the  department  has  acknowledged  a
number of key areas where drastic changes are needed in order  to  meet  the
implementation requirements of the second 10  years  of  democracy.  We  are
however encouraged that since September 2003, with the arrival  of  the  new
DG, the department has already shown an increased focus on ensuring that  we
can deliver to our people. The ANC is also confident  that  since  the  2004
elections and appointment of the new Minister and Deputy Minister,  we  will
see a dramatic change in the face of Home Affairs.

The ANC has looked at the expenditure trends of this department,  especially
the expenditure increases in the budget for the Hanis project. In  the  past
we  have  not  been  particularly  impressed  with  the  track   record   of
underspending. However, we are impressed that the  department  is  now  more
focused and that its growth  in  MTEF  takes  on  board  the  upgrading  and
development  of  mainframe  information  and  communication  technology.  We
concur with the National Treasury's  approval  of  the  utilization  of  the
savings realised in December 2003 of R79, 249 million  for  the  turn-around
strategy. We encourage the Ministry  to  continue  with  its  good  work  in
implementing the crucial interventions in the way it has done thus far.

I want to make use of this opportunity to also congratulate  the  department
for the allocation, which was given to the Northern  Cape  regional  office.
There is an  increased  amount  and  that  will  assist  us  a  great  deal.
Minister, you spoke about the R67 million mobile units that are going to  be
implemented for this financial year. I think another idea perhaps is for  us
to look at municipalities in our small  towns.  Can  we  not  utilise  those
offices as well, in  order  to  assist  our  people  to  apply  for  the  ID
documents? In conclusion, I want  to  thank  the  Minister  and  the  Deputy
Minister and we in the ANC support this Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]
Ms H LAMOELA: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  allow  me  to
extend sincere  congratulations  to  the  Minister  on  her  appointment  as
Minister of Home Affairs. I am indeed looking forward  to  solutions  to  so
many of our problems with her being there.

Laat my toe om `n wyle stil te staan, en namens die DA  ons  innige  medelye
uit te spreek teenoor die bedroefde ouers van wyle Saydie  Booysen,  wie  se
moeder blykbaar verbind is aan  die  personeel  van  Binnelandse  Sake,  wat
Maandagaand in `n koeëlreën in haar moeder se arms gesterf  het.  Ons  harte
bloei vir die Booysen-familie van Hanover Park, en ons bid hul  sterkte  toe
vir die dae vorentoe. Nóg een te veel onskuldige kind wat die  lewe  verlaat
het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Allow me to pause for a while and, on behalf of the DA, convey our  sincere
condolences to the bereaved  parents  of  the  late  Saydie  Booysen,  whose
mother is apparently linked to the personnel of Home Affairs, who died in  a
hail of bullets in her mother's arms on Monday  evening.  Our  hearts  bleed
for the Booysen family of Hanover Park, and we pray for  strength  for  them
in the days ahead. Another innocent child too many who has died.]

Mr Barry Gilder, Director-General of Home Affairs said:


  Home Affairs determines whether each of us  exists  in  the  Government's
  eyes. It registers births, deaths  and  marriages,  and  issues  identity
  documents. Its services are fundamental to  citizens  to  exercise  their
  democratic rights.

The Government of South Africa has a duty to ensure the overall  welfare  of
its entire citizenry. Therefore the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  plays  a
pivotal role by identifying citizens of the  country.  The  Director-General
of Home Affairs has admitted that too many obstacles, such as lack of  rural
offices, properly  trained  staff,  corruption,  dilapidated  buildings  and
offices and inadequate equipment  are  still  hampering  the  department  in
fulfilling its lawful duties.

Ek haal aan uit Die Burger van 11 Junie 2004:


  Die korrupsie in Binnelandse Sake is so erg dat ek lankal baie  amptenare
  summier sou afgedank het as ek kon. Net Suid-Afrika se goeie arbeidswette
  het my verhoed.

So het ons agb Minister van Binnelandse Sake Vrydag in  haar  begrotingsrede
wat grootliks aan die regruk van die departement gewy was, gesê.

Die erkenning  van  die  ontsaglike  probleem  van  korrupte  amptenare  wat
toegelaat het dat swendelaars van Nigerië en elders Suid-Afrika  se  stelsel
vir  identifikasie  besmet,  het  duidelik  tot  die  strategiese  plan  van
herskepping van die  departement  bygedra.  Een  van  die  sleutelareas  van
verbetering van dienslewering is  dat  alle  dienste  deur  die  departement
gelewer, bereikbaar en gerieflik vir alle burgers van  Suid-Afrika  -  selfs
gestremdes - moet wees. Mense het deesdae net nie die fondse of tyd  om  80-
100 km ver te reis om geboortes, sterffes of huwelike te registreer,  of  om
identiteitsdokumente af te haal of dokumentasie te voltooi,  net  om  maande
later uit te  vind  dat  daar  geen  rekord  van  is  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I quote from Die Burger of 11 June 2004:


  Die korrupsie in Binnelandse Sake is so erg dat ek lankal baie  amptenare
  summier  sou   afgedank  het  as  ek  kon.  Net  Suid-Afrika   se   goeie
  arbeidswette het my verhoed.

This is what our hon Minister of Home Affairs said in her budget  speech  on
Friday, which was mainly devoted to straightening out the department.

The acknowledgement of the enormous problem of corrupt officials,  who  made
it possible  for  swindlers  from  Nigeria  and  elsewhere  to  taint  South
Africa's identification system, clearly contributed to  the  strategic  plan
to transform the department. One of the key  areas  in  the  improvement  of
service delivery is that all services rendered by the department  should  be
accessible and  convenient  to  all  citizens  of  South  Africa,  even  the
disabled. These days people just don't have the necessary funds or  time  to
travel 80 - 100 km to register births, deaths or marriages,  or  to  collect
identity documents or to complete forms, only to discover months later  that
no record of that exists.]

As the Department of  Home  Affairs  continues  to  work  within  the  broad
framework of construction and development, we have to  address  the  problem
of implementation of limited resources and of  the  impact  of  factors  and
circumstances in order  to  improve  the  quality  of  lives  of  all  South
Africans. The department has, for instance, already spent R1 billion on  the
Hanis  project,  without  any  significant  results.  The  huge  amount   of
unclaimed  identity  documents  countrywide  is  of  great   concern.   What
guarantee do we have that each will be delivered to the rightful owners?

In 2002, more than 1,2 million refugees moving  around  South  Africa  in  a
long and perilous journey,  were  women  and  children.  They  often  become
victims of abuse and are ill-treated on the way. Most refugees  and  illegal
immigrants are hawkers on our streets, do odd jobs to support themselves  or
depend on relief organisations. Employment of our  own  citizens  should  be
protected, seeing that we too are battling with a  huge  unemployment  rate.
Fraudulent marriages registered at the Department  should  be  investigated,
because it is women who eventually find themselves in these situations.  The
nightmare of having these marriages annulled is  unmentionable,  besides  it
being a costly, long, drawn-out affair.
The sooner backlogs and internal problems in the Department of Home  Affairs
are dealt with, the better for our  country's  security.  Needless  to  say,
that priority should be given to the most competent applicants applying  for
positions to enable the department to get to the standard of  effective  and
efficient service delivery to our communities.

The morale of some staff in Home Affairs  is  of  great  concern.  Temporary
posts should be finalised into permanent ones to allow staff to  perform  to
the best of their and their department's ability.

Die uitdaging lê juis in voorkoming en uitwissing van korrupsie,  eerder  as
in die herbouing van beskadigde departementele stelsels. Die spreuk sê  mos:
"Prevention is better than cure."

Ons, in  die  DA,  verwelkom  en  steun  die  herstelpogings  wat  deur  die
departement  aangepak  gaan  word.   Ons   waardeer   dit.   Ons   sal   die
herstelpogings dophou en hoop dat dit nie ook maar weer 'n leë  belofte  sal
wees nie.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The  challenge  lies  in  precisely  the  prevention  and  eradication   of
corruption,  rather  than  in  the  restructuring  of  damaged  departmental
systems. After all, the proverb goes: ``Prevention is better than cure.''

We in the DA welcome and support the  restructuring  efforts  that  will  be
initiated by the department. We appreciate it. We will keep an eye on  watch
these restructuring efforts and we hope that this will not just  be  another
empty promise. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr K SINCLAIR: Hon Chairperson, the New NP has over the past  few  years  on
numerous occasions expressed its  grave  concern  about  the  state  of  the
Department of Home Affairs. Various reports have confirmed what the  New  NP
has been saying all along, namely  that  corruption,  misadministration  and
lack of service delivery in this department must be a serious concern.

There is no doubt that the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  needs  a  lot  of
attention and that the responsibility stops  right  at  the  new  Minister's
door. The NNP wants to add its voice to congratulating the Minister and  the
new Deputy Minister on their appointment. The people  of  South  Africa  are
becoming increasingly impatient with this department's inability to  perform
its core functions. The previous Minister always blamed  everyone  else  for
his department's problems. We are all politicians. It's strange that the  DA
did not  today  attack  the  IFP.  Maybe  it's  because  of  their  election
agreement. [Laughter.]

During the past  few  years  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  has  become
synonymous with incompetence and alleged  large-scale  corruption.  The  new
Minister  of  Home  Affairs  has  inherited  a  department  that  has  great
challenges. She has only been in her new portfolio a short while, but it  is
evident that she intends to clean up this department. It  seems  that  there
is indeed a new broom.

Every person in South Africa, citizens  and  noncitizens,  come  in  contact
with the Department of Home Affairs. Therefore, it is  vital  that  the  new
Minister must get her Department in order. It not only places  South  Africa
in a bad light with foreigners, but also hampers service  delivery  in  this
country.

The optimal functioning of the department is to provide  enabling  documents
to people, and is crucial for our  everyday  existence.  Enabling  documents
are also vital to all our people so that they can obtain  employment,  state
grants and participate in the economy.  By  not  providing  such  documents,
the department is contributing to unemployment and poverty.  There  are  too
many people who are unable to apply for state  grants  and  their  pensions,
because they do not have bar-coded identity documents.

The long-awaited Hanis card, on which the government has  already  spent  R1
billion, will play a very important role in reducing fraud. It  is  shocking
that two decades after the introduction of the new identity  document  there
are still South Africans who carry old reference books, books  of  life  and
even the dompass.

Daarom is die NNP verheug dat die nuwe Haniskaart binne  die  volgende  drie
maande  geïmplimenteer  gaan  word.  Ons  engiste  bekommernis  is  of   die
department oor die administratiewe kapasiteit beskik  om  die  terugwerkende
byvoeging van identiteitsdokumente op papier  na  die  elektroniese  stelsel
oor te dra. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Therefore the New NP is delighted that the Hanis card will  be  implemented
within the next three months. Our only concern  is  whether  the  department
has the administrative capacity to transfer the  retrospective  addition  of
identity documents on paper to an electronic system.]

There are currently almost 300 vacant posts within the  Department  of  Home
Affairs. The majority of senior director posts in the department are  filled
by people in an acting capacity, and some of them have been employed  in  an
acting position for four to five years. If the  Minister  doesn't  act  now,
she will have a department that is crippled due to a lack of  qualified  and
efficient staff.

Die meeste van hierdie probleme is niks nuuts vir  ons  nie,  aangesien  dit
voortspruit uit mnr Buthelezi se tydperk as Minister van  Binnelandse  Sake.
[Gelag.] Daarom wil die  NNP  die  Minister  van  Binnelandse  Sake  sterkte
toewens. Sy gaan dit werklik nodig kry. [Most of these problems are not  new
to us, since they emanate from the period when Mr Buthelezi was Minister  of
Home Affairs. [Laughter.] That is why the NNP wishes the  Minister  of  Home
Affairs well. She will really need it.]

The Department of Home Affairs is such a crucial department that has to  run
smoothly. There are many challenges facing the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs.
Does the Minister have the commitment, the willpower, the determination  and
the ability to deal with these issues? The New NP believes she has.

The NNP supports this Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister  and  the  hon  House,  I  am
impressed by this Budget Vote debate in which the department  has  come  out
very clearly, and in no uncertain terms, to sell  to  us  their  turn-around
strategy. In the briefings and other presentations  that  I  attended  their
watchword was around this turn-around strategy and on focusing  on  the  way
forward.
This presentation of a turn-around strategy reminds me of  an  old  biblical
story of a young man who went to a far-off country in  search  of  a  better
life. Unfortunately he came face-to-face with famine and  ended  up  looking
after pigs. However, the most wonderful thing about this story  is  that  he
came to his  senses  and  changed  strategies.  He  returned  home  and  was
received unconditionally by his father. If a man comes and says things  went
horribly wrong in the far-off country, and that he is  sorry,  there  is  no
room for further accusations. The UCDP is geared  to  concentrating  on  the
way forward rather than on past weaknesses.

I notice that R77,6 million is budgeted  for  capital  projects  during  the
current financial year, and that a sizeable slice of that cake would be  for
capital projects such as Home Affairs offices for North West,  my  province.
I find it comparatively speaking  more  worthwhile  that  offices  would  be
relocated to the rural areas to be as near as possible to  the  majority  of
our people. This means that this  department,  in  our  province,  would  in
future  be  less  dependent  on  other  departments  in  terms   of   office
accommodation and transport services than was previously the case, and  that
is commendable.

In the spending of that budget, the department would at  the  same  time  be
addressing the problem of joblessness and poverty, which  are  some  of  the
major problems that we as a  country  must  contend  with.  With  these  few
words, the UCDP supports this Budget Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M N MADLALA-MAGUBANE: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson, hon  Ministers,  hon
members, comrades and the House  at  large,  my  input  will  dwell  on  the
service rendered to the citizens, which is Programme 2  of  the  department.
The budget allocation for services to citizens this current  financial  year
is R152,227 million.  The  amount  rolled  over  to  continue  work  on  the
Electronic Document Management System is R19,693 million.  Spending  on  the
programme accounts for an annual average  of  40,9%  of  the  vote  for  the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework, the MTEF.

There is a high level of spending on the filling  of  crucial  vacant  posts
and the Home Affairs National Identification System,  Hanis,  including  the
smart  card  system.  It  is  a  turn-around  strategy.  Hon  Lamoela,   the
department does not waste money on that system. I would  like  to  emphasise
that. Of the total allocation  for  this  programme  over  the  MTEF-period,
spending on personnel costs consumes 39,6%, and the Hanis project 38,9%.

There are key challenges and bottlenecks faced by  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs on service delivery. The process of addressing fraudulent  practices
in obtaining  citizenship  is  continuing.  The  Department  is  undertaking
critical interventions in all business processes to  develop  an  integrated
action plan for improving systems and  processes  to  provide  clients  with
efficient and effective services in the spirit of Batho Pele. Some of  these
interventions are transforming service delivery through an expansion of  the
staff complement and reorganising the department's  physical  infrastructure
through upgrading and refurbishment.

I would like to mention to this House  that  one  of  the  major  challenges
faced by the department is that the  department  itself  is  underresourced.
All of us in this House know very well that prior to 1994 some  people  were
sidelined, and not all people were South  Africans.  But  immediately  after
1994, all people became South African citizens. The  vast  majority  of  our
people had been left out of the mainstream of citizenship. Some  people  who
were  unregistered  lived  far  from  centres  where  they  could   register
themselves. Some of those registered had their details  entered  wrongly  in
the system, and they had nowhere to raise their grievances.  In  fact,  they
were not given any opportunity to lodge complaints.

The department tried to accommodate such  realities  by  allowing  for  late
registration of births, amendments  of  dates  of  birth,  names  and  other
relevant details on the population register. I must also mention that  there
were some loopholes. Noncitizens wanted citizenship fraudulently,  and  this
thing in itself created problems for the department in finding  the  balance
between rectifying the remaining realities created by the  apartheid  regime
and ensuring the integrity of South African citizenship.

There is another problem faced by the department.  There  are  a  number  of
fraudulent marriages registered on the system by foreigners  who  pay  South
Africans to marry then on paper, or who  bribe  Home  Affairs  officials  to
marry them on the system so that they can become citizens of  this  country.
I must mention that  it  is  sad,  because  women  become  victims  of  such
incidents.

It is encouraging, though, that the  department  has  embarked  on  a  turn-
around intervention regarding this critical  issue.  The  department  is  to
look into its overall capacity by capacitating  the  staff  to  develop  the
infrastructure,  such  as  office  equipment,  an   information   technology
strategy, and conversion of documents and also by capacitating  the  foreign
office function.

I believe that that will stop the phenomenon of fraudulent marriages by non-
South Africans to falsely obtain citizenship,  and  protect  South  Africans
against unscrupulous, fraudulent  activities;  and  that,  of  course,  will
safeguard the rights of women, protecting them from dangers  emanating  from
the different marriage systems applicable in  this  country.  It  will  also
safeguard underaged girls from possible abuses  inherent  in  the  customary
marriages system.

As a person coming from  the  Gauteng  province,  I  must  mention  that  in
Gauteng, a smart province, especially where I am deployed in Ekurhuleni,  we
do not have  huge  problems  with  the  department.  The  department  serves
clients effectively and efficiently. In the ANC  parliamentary  constituency
offices  we  work  hand-in-hand  with  regional  offices  with  the  aim  of
rectifying some discrepancies that occurred.

In conclusion, I want to say  that  we  must  all  work  together  with  the
Department of Home Affairs on curbing the corruption  in  the  Home  Affairs
centres or regions. We need to follow a holistic approach, and  let  us  not
point back. We need a quality service for the citizens  of  our  country.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  I  also
congratulate the Minister on  her  new  position.  The  Department  of  Home
Affairs is very important to all citizens, young or  old,  urban  or  rural,
poor or rich, dead or alive. But, important as  it  is,  it  appears  to  be
proving very hard to meet all the requirements and needs of  the  people  it
serves.

The misdistribution of  Home  Affairs  offices,  chronic  understaffing  and
other  constraints  within  the  department,  according  to  my  assessment,
contributes to the long  queues  and  congestion  in  these  offices,  which
ultimately result in poor service delivery. Our Minister has just  mentioned
some of these constraints.

On behalf of the IFP I feel there is a dire need to  improve  the  state  of
overpopulated Home Affairs offices all over the country, which is  worse  in
the rural areas as a whole. People from these areas  travel  long  distances
to Home Affairs  offices  for  just  a  birth  certificate  or  an  identity
document, etc. We all know about the legacy of the past.  In  the  apartheid
government the vast majority of our people were left out of  the  mainstream
of citizenship. Many people did not bother to travel the long  distances  to
these offices,  and  those  in  power  also  did  not  encourage  people  to
register.

It is pity, though, that the budget of the Department of Home  Affairs  does
not look that enticing. It  definitely  won't  be  able  to  cover  all  the
demands of the past and the present made of this department. The backlog  is
huge and existed for decades before the  new  Government  came  into  power.
Decentralisation of offices, making them easily accessible  to  all  people,
particularly in remote areas - as they are  the  ones  who  suffer  most  in
order to utilise Home Affairs services - is  a  priority.  People  in  these
areas do not have the money to reach distant offices,  as  the  majority  of
them are unemployed. The second important resource vital to this  department
is improvement of staffing.

[Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of the department,  when  I  talk  about  the
Department of Home Affairs, I talk about the  home  department  and  there's
not much I can say, because this is the department that  is  known  for  the
following things - and given the fact that my leader, Dr M G Buthelezi,  the
Chief of the  Zulus  whom  I  respect  very  much,  has  been  heading  this
department since 1994.

This department is known for its budget that is not enough  to  execute  its
duties and needs. Today, with this  budget,  I  don't  think  that  the  hon
Minister will be able to fulfil all these needs. This  department  is  known
for its offices which are overcrowded and are not in  rural  areas  near  to
many people who live in these areas. There is also a  problem  with  busfare
in order for these people to get to those offices and  that's  why  we  find
that mothers have a problem when schools are opening, because without  birth
certificates the children cannot go to school. They squeeze themselves  into
these offices, the queues are long and there are very few  staff.  All  this
becomes the community's problem.

Most grandmothers cannot get child  support  grants  because  there  are  no
birth certificates; some of them who look  after  these  children  are  very
old; they don't even know the date  on  which  the  child  was  born;  their
pension is used to  support  their  grandchildren,  yet  there  is  a  child
support grant available from the Government, but  certificates  are  holding
the process back. I don't know,  hon  Minister,  I  heard  you  promised  to
increase offices and provide mobile services. This is good,  we  commend  it
and we will applaud it.

In rural areas we have offices  that  belong  to  our  traditional  leaders,
which have been built long ago, and these offices could be  of  great  help.
We suggested this to your department's  officials.  This  problem  could  be
minimised gradually. The problem of the identity  documents  was  a  bit  in
control during the preparation for the elections. Offices were  opened  even
on weekends and there were also mobile services, and as a result people  got
their IDs and went to vote.

Although there were those in this department who were corrupt  and  who  got
the opportunity to make money, these IDs were issued illegally, and  by  the
time the owner of the ID came, the ID was nowhere to be found - that is  but
one of many corrupt activities that was going on. There is also the  corrupt
activity of fraudulent marriages, where you find your child is married to  a
total  stranger.  We  are  glad  though  that  these  culprits   are   being
apprehended.

Go ahead with the good work; we are behind you. In the name of  the  IFP  we
are saying that we are happy to see this department in rural areas  where  a
lot of people live and not in urban areas only. We support  your  budget.  I
thank you. [Applause.]]

[Mr O M THETJENG: Hon Chairperson, the Minister  of  Home  Affairs  and  hon
members, the Department of Home  Affairs  forms  an  integral  part  of  our
country. It helps with the registration of all South African  citizens,  and
foreigners  who  have  permanent  citizenship.  It  provides  the  following
services: registration of of birth, marriages, deaths  and  issues  identity
documents.

There are problems that arise when these services  are  provided,  and  they
need urgent attention. When the director-general warned  the  Department  of
Home Affairs, he indicated the problems that the department  is  faced  with
and he showed them ways in which to resolve them.

Let me take you on this journey as we inspect only  two  services  that  are
really bugging the nation, especially in the rural areas, like  the  Limpopo
Province.

With regards to the services relating to the registration  of  births,  most
of our parents reside in the rural areas and are illiterate. Those  who  can
afford to go to hospitals or clinics are fortunate as they get  immunisation
cards  for  their  children.  This  is  proof  of  the  child's  birth.  The
unfortunate ones are those who cannot  afford  to  take  their  children  to
hospital or a clinic, as the children will have been born,  and  missed  out
on having their birth registered.

Another reason that prevents the registration of  children  is  issues  like
long  costly  trips,  which  they  cannot  afford   due   to   poverty   and
unemployment. The other reason  is  the  poor  service  by  some  government
employees when people come to them for help.

The lack of birth certificates hinders fatherless  children  from  receiving
child grants. We, the DA, plead that the  department  should  fight  against
such a shameful state of affairs in every way  possible.  If  we  can  fight
this  enemy,  I  believe  that  we  will  never  encounter  problems  during
applications for identity documents.

We are really grateful for the  efforts  made  by  the  Government  and  the
department before the recent elections. We wish that  this  kind  of  effort
would continue, even if the next elections are still far  away,  as  we  are
still encountering problems. The saddest part is that most  of  our  parents
live in the rural areas and apply  for  identity  documents  when  they  are
already too old. Most of them do not know  their  dates  of  birth,  because
they are illiterate. Some of them know  the  years,  as  they  recall  major
incidents that had happened in their country or community, or  by  comparing
with somebody from another family who was born during the  same  year.  This
would be a good form of proof if there are no other means of doing so.

The saddest thing is when the official writes the date  of  birth  according
to the parent's s facial appearance. In this way some people's years of  age
are increased or decreased. The major problem is encountered  when  the  age
is decreased.  Some  parents  are  10  years  older  than  their  first-born
children, or less, while others are younger than their  younger  sisters  or
brothers.

These are the legacies of the apartheid  regime  of  the  NP,  Mr  Sinclair,
those who currently call themselves the NNP, even though  there  is  nothing
new in what they do. I appeal to the department to deal  with  this  problem
urgently.

The officials must also stop sending people who  make  applications  to  and
fro. You normally hear the official asking for a list of documents,  like  a
letter or certificate from the church,  although  they  do  not  attend  any
church, a testimonial from the  school,  even  though  they  never  attended
school, or a letter from the chief, even though they will not be given  help
until they pay, even if they are not working.

All these are challenges facing the rural people, those who  are  struggling
and are very poor. I would suggest that this problem be  tackled  by  making
things easy by demanding fewer documents,  especially  from  those  elderly,
illiterate people.

The director-general has indicated the lack of working institutions  in  the
rural areas as a problem. We agree and we also sympathise with him  in  this
problem, even though we cannot let it be a stumbling block.  My  advice  is,
let us use  the  public  buildings  that  we  already  have  in  our  areas.
Traditional leaders use these  institutions  and  committee  rooms  to  hold
their imbizos.  These  steps  will  reduce  long  trips  that  our  parents,
brothers and sisters take in order to get service from the department.

The other matter is that  we  should  assist  the  Government  by  uprooting
idleness  in  our  places  of  work.  Let  us  get  involved,  lest  we  are
disappointed. Our officials overlook slogans  like  Batho  Pele  at  certain
times. Thank you, hon Chairperson, I am grateful.]

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Madam Chair, hon Minister, hon members, I  greet  you  all
in  the  name  of  Jesus.  [Interjections.]  Hon  Minister,  allow  me   the
opportunity to congratulate you on your  appointment  to  the  Home  Affairs
portfolio.

Kuba mnandi kuthi boomama xa ubona kukho oomama abathatha izihlalo  ezikhulu
ekwakusithiwa zifanele ootata. Ukanti ke mna Mphathiswa, ndinenkolo ethi  xa
ibanjwe ngumama soze iphuncuke. Apho ndisuka khona, eMpuma  Koloni,  indlala
isagquba ngamandla.Kusenzima ukuba abantu abadala  baye  ezidolophini  ukuya
kufuna izazisi zabo, kwaye  bathi  sebefikile  apho  ufumanise  ukuba  uhoyo
alukho kwaphela. Ndiyabulela ukuva ke Mphathiswa ukuba  ubonelele  ngeeofisi
ezithuthekayo.

Indlela ezikhutshwa  ngayo  izazisi  bekunga  ingayindlela  enokwenza  ukuba
wonke  umntu  akwazi  ukuyifumana  ngexesha  elifanelekileyo.  Kukho  abantu
abawashiya  kudala  amakhaya  abo   bahlala   ematyotyombeni.   Bekunga   ke
bangaqwalaselwa kakhulu abo bantu ukwenzela ukuba  nabo  bazifumane  izazisi
zabo ukuze nabo baxhamle kumaqithiqithi kaRhulumente.
ISebe  leMicimbi  yezeKhaya  maze  liyiqwalasele  into   yokufuna   amakhadi
abantwana  asekliniki  xa  abantwana  befuna  isibonelelo  sabantwana,  kuba
abantu  basemakhaya   abayise   so   into   yokuhamba   iikliniki.   Kusekho
mabazalisikazi basemakhaya. Abantu  ke  basafuna  ukufundiswa  ngokubaluleka
kokuhamba  ikliniki.  Umntu  usuka  athi  ngexesha  lokuya  kwenza   isicelo
sesibonelelo somntwana  asuke  athathe  umntwana  aye  kufuna  isiqinisekiso
sokuzalwa,  angakwazi  kusifumana  ke  kuba  engenalo  ikhadi   lasekliniki.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs A N D QIKANI: It is a great pleasure for us women  when  we  see  women
occupying higher positions that  were  previously  reserved  for  men  only.
However, hon Minister, I have a belief that if something is in the hands  of
a woman, it is in safe hands. Where I come from in the Eastern Cape  poverty
is still rife. It is still difficult for elderly people to get  to  town  to
get their IDs. Even when  they  do  get  there,  they  do  not  receive  the
attention that they deserve. I am grateful, hon Minister, to hear  that  you
have provided mobile offices.

I wish the issuing of IDs could be done in such a way that  the  people  can
get their IDs on time. There are people who left their  homes  a  long  time
ago, who are now staying in informal settlements.  It  would  be  proper  if
those people could also be considered and be given their IDs  so  that  they
may enjoy basic government services.

The Department of Home Affairs must  revisit  the  practice  of  asking  for
children's clinic cards when parents apply for child  grants,  because  most
of the rural people do not take their children  to  the  clinics  regularly.
For example, there are still traditional midwives. People still need  to  be
educated about the importance of regular  clinic  visits.  When  people  are
applying for children's grants, they usually take along  birth  certificates
and are denied the grants because they do not have clinic cards.]
The  other  pressing  matter  facing  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  is
corruption. We are relieved to hear that the  hon  Minister  also  considers
rooting it out as a priority.

Egameni   le-UDM,   siyaluxhasa   uhlahlo   lwabiwo-mali   lwakho.   Enkosi.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] [On behalf of the UDM, we  support  the  budget.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mr T S SETONA: Hon Chairperson of Committees,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,
hon  Deputy  Minister  Malusi  Gigaba  in  absentia,  fellow  comrades   and
colleagues, if you could, before I begin my speech, allow me  just  to  deal
with a few issues. Firstly, we indeed agree  that  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs even after the democratic breakthrough of 27 April  1994,  has  been
upside-down in the past decade. And we all agree that it  should  be  turned
around; but maybe there are some areas of difference in terms of how  we  go
about turning this department around.

Just  to  give  some  advice  to  hon  Lamoela,  who  talked  about  African
foreigners flooding into South Africa. I want to advise the  hon  member  to
ask the department to provide  her  with  the  disaggregated  statistics  of
foreigners in our country at the moment,  reflecting  which  ones  are  from
Africa, which ones are from Europe, which ones  are  from  America  and  all
that stuff. I could conclude that ... [Interjections.] ...  the  hon  member
is suffering from Afro-pessimist syndrome, but at the moment that is not  my
conclusion.

Hon Vilakazi, I do not  agree  that  the  budget  does  not  look  enticing,
because it is more enticing than it was in the  previous  decade,  and  more
enticing than the pre-27 April 1994 breakthrough. What is important  in  any
budget is not the figures, it is the vision. We can give  you  millions  and
millions of rands, but if you do not have a  vision,  you  cannot  use  that
money. You will come back to Parliament and say: "We have  this  money,  but
we could not spend it."
Hon Thetjeng, I agree broadly with some of the issues that you have  raised,
but not all of them. Furthermore, ...

Mr A  WATSON:  On  a  point  of  order  Madam  Chairperson,  is  the  member
delivering  a   speech   or   answering   on   behalf   of   the   Minister?
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Continue, hon member.

Mr T S SETONA: May I proceed, hon Chair? Yes, hon Watson must go to the  old
age home. This is a debate and I am debating, and he cannot prescribe how  I
should go about my debate. [Laughter.] But, I am saying by and  large  there
is an agreement. Allow me to join those who have congratulated the  Minister
on her new and prestigious yet challenging position. I  am  quite  confident
that the Minister is braced and prepared to steer  this  department  in  the
right course in the coming period.

The commitment of the ANC to democracy and unity in diversity has stood  the
test of time in the past  decade  of  democracy.  On  the  occasion  of  his
address to this House last year on 19 September, the  hon  Deputy  President
of the Republic, comrade Jacob Zuma, made the following observation,  and  I
quote:


  Hon members,  our  democracy  has  gone  through  a  lot  of  trials  and
  tribulation in the first decade. It has passed all the tests -  which  is
  another  reason  for  us  to  celebrate.  One  of  these  tests  is   the
  investigation of the Deputy President  by  the  National  Directorate  of
  Prosecutions. This test has indicated the extent to which  our  democracy
  has deepened and, contrary to views of so-called opinion-makers, who  are
  saying the investigation has weakened democracy, how  strong  and  mature
  our democracy has become. It is only in  a  mature  democracy  where  the
  Deputy  President  of  a  country  would  be  investigated  without   any
  interference or attempt to stop the investigation by  government  or  the
  Deputy President himself.

This observation holds true for the Department of Home Affairs in  the  past
decade of our  democratic  rule,  because  this  department  was  under  the
leadership of the hon Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the IFP. Given  the  strategic
nature of this department, it wouldn't be possible for any  other  political
organisation on this continent to give that responsibility to  a  member  of
the opposition, except the ANC. It has done that in the spirit of unity  and
diversity, and that has stood the test of time.

It is therefore fitting,  on  this  occasion  of  the  first  budget  policy
statement of the Department of  Home  Affairs,  to  salute  the  hon  Gatsha
Buthelezi for distinguishing himself as part of those who  will  be  counted
in the roll-call of men and women who contributed to the  strengthening  and
consolidation of our institutional democracy. The turbulent  tenure  of  his
leadership in the department will not go unrecorded in  the  annals  of  our
history for generations to come. As to whether he has passed or  failed  the
test is another debate that does not belong to this House.

For us in the ANC, this budget  policy  debate,  the  first  in  the  second
decade of our democracy, represents a great cause  for  celebration  by  the
masses of our people. It is a great cause for celebration because in  itself
this budget policy debate marks the breaking of  ranks  with  the  past  and
represents the dawn of a great new beginning under  the  leadership  of  the
ANC.

Hon Minister, with your appointment as the new Minister of Home Affairs  and
of Comrade Malusi Gigaba, who hails from the ranks of the  young  lions,  as
your Deputy Minister, the great storm to reposition this department  as  the
fundamental nucleus and the centre of service delivery  to  our  people  has
begun.

Our people have been  waiting  patiently  for  this  great  storm  to  begin
because no more should our children, born  in  their  homes  far  away  from
hospitals and clinics in the rural areas, be denied access  to  their  basic
rights because of a lack of birth certificates. No  more  should  foreigners
acquire citizenship through fraudulent and illegal means, and we are  saying
no more should our sisters be victims of  illegal  marriages  to  foreigners
who obtained marital certificates fraudulently for monetary gains.

It is precisely for these reasons, among others, that  your  appointment  to
lead this department represents the coming of the great  storm  to  rid  the
Home Affairs of this malice and transform it into  a  centre  of  excellence
and best practice for service delivery.

The budget has not been critical to the challenges that  the  Department  of
Home Affairs faced in the past decade of democracy - I'm directing  this  to
Mama Vilakazi. The problems that underpin this department have been: one,  a
glaring  lack  of  strategic  vision;  two,  the   prevalence   of   rampant
corruption; three,  inefficiency;  and  four,  wastefulness  and  a  general
decline in standards.

The scourge of corruption in the department must be defeated as a matter  of
urgency in this decade  of  democracy.  Hon  Minister,  other  members  have
alluded to the fact that women of our country, young and old, have been  the
target of systematic corruption in the Department  of  Home  Affairs.  There
have been reports in the  recent  past  of  fraudulent  marriages  involving
foreigners who seek speedy, permanent residence in our country  through  the
fraudulent use of identity documents of our sisters  and  mothers.  In  some
instances women are paid  to  marry  foreigners,  thereby  becoming  willing
partners in the perpetuation of corruption. Cases  where  single  women  are
lured to apply for work and in turn their identity  documents  are  used  to
forge marriage certificates have also been reported.
We  also  have  cases  where  departmental  officials  collude  with   crime
syndicates to obtain citizenship for  foreigners.  The  Department  of  Home
Affairs has proved beyond reasonable doubt its  seriousness  and  commitment
to rooting out this scale of corruption. The recent arrest of  12  officials
in the Bloemfontein  office  of  the  department  bears  testimony  to  this
seriousness.

We therefore salute the departmental management and  our  security  agencies
for their efforts in handing these corrupt officials to  the  police.  Their
arrest is a clear sign and commitment on the part  of  the  department  that
there is no hiding place for  rogue  elements  in  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs.

As the Minister has already said, it is therefore fitting that we  make  the
following proposals a part of the critical elements that should find  robust
and rigorous expression in the life of the department  and  the  turn-around
strategy in particular: ongoing retraining of  departmental  staff  in  line
with the new strategic priorities, values and norms - not just training  for
the sake of training; greater collaboration with and a greater role for  our
security agencies, including possible security vetting of all  officials  in
the department who  perform  sensitive  functions.  We  propose  that  there
should be an effort to strengthen relations with and  participation  in  the
relevant multilateral bodies in the region and globally, to design  and  co-
ordinate an appropriate multisectoral offensive against organised crime.

Throughout its 92 years of fighting history  to  better  the  lives  of  our
people, the  ANC  has  always  been  guided  by  the  belief  that  for  the
revolution to succeed, the masses of our people must be at  the  centre  not
as passive recipients, but, more importantly, as  architects  of  their  own
future. This belief and  tradition  has  been  reaffirmed  in  our  election
manifesto for the third democratic general election on 14 April  2004,  with
the slogan: "People's contract to  create  work  and  fight  poverty".  This
battle cry will indeed be our road  map  throughout  the  second  decade  of
democracy. It therefore becomes critical for  this  "people's  contract"  we
are talking about to find living expression and locus  in  the  departmental
strategic programmes and initiatives.

History has taught us that there is  no  amount  of  state  force  that  can
annihilate corruption and crime without the mobilisation  and  participation
of the broadest possible mass of our people in this fight.  Accordingly,  it
is within the masses that corrupt criminal elements that take bribes in  the
Department of Home Affairs reside. They play with  us  in  our  communities,
they eat in the  same  restaurants  where  we  eat,  they  attend  the  same
churches that we attend, they use the same  public  transport  that  we  use
daily, and they buy from  the  shops  we  do.  And  therefore  the  critical
challenge is to raise public awareness about the role of our communities  in
exposing and identifying these criminal elements.

The time has come to break the culture of silence when we see and live  with
a clerk  in  a  Government  department  whose  standard  of  living  is  not
commensurate with his or her income. Together with our communities  we  must
step up the campaign to raise the consciousness of  our  people  to  be  the
ears and eyes of our Government by  exposing  these  rogue  elements.  These
rogue elements must know that they do not deserve to be in our  communities,
but within the walls of our prisons.

This anticorruption onslaught must be complemented by a conscious effort  by
the department, through road  shows  and  buy-ins  by  the  institutions  of
Government at a  grass-roots  level,  such  as  ward  committees,  community
policing forums and community and faith-based organisations.  The  community
volunteer programme that the Minister has alluded to is a step in the  right
direction  in  this  regard  and  we  welcome  it,  hon   Minister.   Public
representatives, through their constituency offices, must also be  catalysts
in raising the level of consciousness among our communities with respect  to
this campaign.

Some among us find it opportune and glorious always to be in the company  of
journalists when overseeing the work of  Government  departments.  While  it
sounds  prestigious  for  MPs  to  appear  on  television  screens  exposing
maladministration and corruption  in  Government  departments,  we  must  be
equally cautious not to undermine quality investigation into  corruption  by
making news headlines at the early  and  sensitive  stage  of  investigation
into corrupt cases by competent bodies such as the police.

Clearly,  while  these  challenges  place  a  huge  responsibility  on   the
department, Parliament is equally confronted with  huge  challenges  in  its
monitoring and oversight role. I  thank  you,  hon  Chair.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]
The MINISTER OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you,  hon  Chair  and  hon  members.
Firstly, I want to thank all those members who participated in  the  debate,
and I want to thank you for your valuable contribution  to  this  debate.  I
would just like to make some comments,  and  perhaps  clarify  some  of  the
issues of concern that have been raised by hon members.  Somebody  mentioned
the issue of the Batho Pele campaign. Yes, it was the hon Masilo, the  chair
of the select committee. Hon Masilo, the Batho Pele campaign is  a  campaign
of Government that was started a long time ago, which supposedly  should  be
running in all the departments, amongst members of the Public Service.

Yes, it applies to the Department of Home Affairs as well. And of course  we
are trying as much as possible in the  department  through  the  turn-around
strategy and all the other programmes which we have  already  outlined,  and
which you yourselves have outlined out of the briefing  which  you  received
from the DG and the staff of the Department of Home Affairs. There is a  lot
of  retraining  and  restructuring  which  is  currently  going  on  in  the
department and you will realise that one of the major challenges  facing  us
in the department is that of  changing  the  psychological  make-up  of  the
staff of the department. We have to change the attitudes  of  the  staff  so
that they understand, for instance, that the client is always right.  It  is
something that we have to emphasise all the time. So, yes,  the  Batho  Pele
campaign remains relevant all the time.

The roll-over issue was raised by the chair,  hon  Masilo.  I  hope  we  all
understand that a roll-over, by  its  nature,  is  funds  committed  by  the
department. We have a roll-over of R180 million which National Treasury  has
granted us permission to use. Because sometimes the tendency  is  that  even
though the funds are  committed,  if  you  don't  get  permission  from  the
Treasury, because you have not utilised that money, you  then  are  required
to send that money back to the coffers of the National Treasury. But in  our
case we have actually sought the approval of the National Treasury,  and  we
have been granted permission to use that money. The roll-over that  we  have
is the money that we will still spend during this current year.  It  is  not
money that has gone down the drain in the department.

Can I just explain the problem of unclaimed IDs, because it is  not  just  a
problem of the department, it is also a  problem  of  our  own  people.  We,
their public representatives, have  to  go  out  and  explain  to  and  also
mobilise our people to go and collect their IDs. We should also  explain  to
them that they should be more responsible when applying for an  ID.  I  will
explain another situation, for  instance,  which  affects  us  here  in  the
Western Cape. Because our people are very mobile, due to the fact that  they
are  migrants,  a  person  will  leave  the  Eastern  Cape,  for   instance,
particularly the former Transkei area, and come and join the family here  in
the Western Cape, leaving Ingcobo or Cofimvaba, or  whichever  part  of  the
former Transkei.

That person has already applied for an ID in the Transkei.  She  leaves  the
copy of the ID in the Transkei, comes  to  the  Western  Cape  to  join  her
husband, and at times she lives here. When she  arrives  here,  she  applies
for another ID. When the time comes for her to go back  to  the  village  in
the Eastern Cape, the ID comes out here  again.  Sometimes  you  find  that,
precisely because of the problems that we have been experiencing,  the  same
person has an ID in the Eastern Cape, and  another  uncollected  ID  in  the
Western Cape. She will get to the Transkei  and  apply  for  the  third  ID,
without even checking whether the first ID she had applied for  has  arrived
or not. So you also have those kinds of problems.

Secondly, other people are simply irresponsible.  They  apply  for  IDs  but
never collect those IDs. So, it also has to do  with  irresponsible  conduct
and the behaviour of our own people.  So,  yes,  it  is  a  problem  in  our
department because, indeed, there is a problem regarding the people  in  the
department, a lack of systems, the fact of not doing things the  proper  way
as you, the citizens of our  country,  would  want  us  to  do.  But,  also,
regarding the rights of our citizens, people should  understand  that  those
rights are not unlimited.

You cannot be spending the resources of your government by applying for  IDs
wherever you go. We are hoping that the systems we are introducing, such  as
the Hanis for instance, are exactly what is going to enable us  to  pick  up
that a person has applied for an ID in the Transkei and would therefore  not
be able to apply for another ID. So, through  Hanis  we  are  really  hoping
that we are going to be able to clean up our  population  register,  because
these are some of  the  things  that  are  stigmatising  and  bringing  into
question the integrity of our population register.

The issue of readiness for the elections is a very difficult  question,  but
I will say yes, we will be ready for the  elections.  Even  in  2004  people
raised the  same  question.  This  time,  last  year,  people  were  raising
questions about the readiness  of  the  department  to  supply  IDs  to  the
citizens of this country in order for them to exercise their  constitutional
right to vote. Yes, our people were able to  vote,  because  the  department
had to make sure that it supplied the necessary documents. I am  optimistic.
I think we will be able to assist our people to get the necessary  IDs  that
they will need at the time when they have to go and  register  to  vote  for
the 2005 elections.

If the staff members of the department are not  ready,  they  will  have  to
make sure that they are ready, in the same way that we did in  2004.  If  we
were able to do it successfully in 2004, there shouldn't be any reason  that
prevents us from doing it in 2005.  Long  queues  are  unavoidable.  I  have
mentioned it in my speech that one of  our  biggest  problems  is  that  our
offices are situated in towns, small towns and in cities. So,  what  do  you
expect? You  will  find  long  queues,  because  people  from  the  informal
settlements, townships and small rural villages  will  stream  to  this  one
office in a particular area. Certainly, if we introduce more  mobile  units,
and we have more offices and if  we  have  service  points  in  those  rural
areas, there shouldn't be these long queues.

That is one of the reasons why we are saying we  need  to  try  as  much  as
possible to decentralise and have as many  offices  and  service  points  as
possible. People still mention that there are many  posts  in  which  people
work in an acting capacity. Actually, this is not true because there  was  a
time when there were a number of chief director posts in which  people  were
functioning in an acting capacity. But I have just said that,  for  instance
- you are aware, particularly those of you who are in the  select  committee
- during this  year  only,  we  have  filled  about  500  vacancies  in  the
department.

You are also aware that 19 vacancies at senior management  level  have  been
advertised. You are also aware of the fact that  only  yesterday,  six  more
management and middle management posts have been advertised. Two of the  DDG
posts have already been shortlisted. We are in the process  of  interviewing
and appointing. Progress is being made. It  is  not  true  that  people  are
functioning in acting capacities.

There was a time when we had an acting DG; we now have a  DG.  Some  of  the
posts are simply vacant. We don't have  people  in  acting  positions.  When
mention was made of fraudulent marriages, I heard  somebody  from  the  back
screaming and saying, ``Nigerians.'' This is actually  a  wrong  perception.
It has a very racial undertone to it. It is very  racist,  and  I  think  we
have to be very careful about making those kinds of statements,  because  it
is not just the Africans from the continent who are abusing our systems.  It
is not just the Africans from the continent who come into  the  country  and
marry these young girls and pay them for that.

People must therefore be very careful about making statements such as,  ``It
is the Nigerians, Zaïrans, or Congolese". It has a  very  racial  undertone,
and it is wrong. You are making a very wrong assumption. So please  be  very
careful when you are making that kind of statement, because it is  not  only
the Africans. I am not saying that they do not do it, but I am saying it  is
not only those people who are abusing our systems. I am saying that that  is
similar to the question of the  illegal  immigrants.  When  you  talk  about
illegal immigrants in this country, you are not only talking about  Africans
from the continent. But when we see people being deported and shown  on  TV,
we always see Africans; we see dark skins.  But  we  actually  have  illegal
immigrants from Pakistan, China, Bulgaria, and Russia.
We have a huge population from Europe as well, who  are  here  illegally  in
this country. So, people must be very careful  of  making  statements,  lest
they are seen  to  be  racist.  [Interjections.]  No,  no,  no,  it  is  not
something to laugh about, it is a very serious matter. In this day  and  age
in South Africa, there is no room for that kind  of  statement.  [Applause.]
By the way, Africans from the continent  have  a  right  to  come  to  South
Africa as asylum seekers and be given the status of  refugees.  But  if  you
talk about illegal immigrants, there are many illegal  immigrants  including
people who are not necessarily Africans from the continent.

Somebody mentioned the use of municipalities in small towns as  a  proposal.
Yes, I think it is something that we are doing, but I also want  to  caution
people about some of the things. We also  have  to  be  very  careful  about
talking issues of very serious policy matters,  because  this  is  a  policy
matter. It is about devolution of the powers of Home Affairs.
It is a matter, which, at some point perhaps as members of the  legislature,
we need to engage in, so that when we do it it's not done in a  disorganised
and haphazard manner. It is not done because I feel that I'm ready to do  it
in Limpopo, or that I'm ready to do it in the Free State, or  I'm  ready  to
do it in the North West. It should be done  because  there  is  a  need  and
there is an agreement that it has to  be  done.  I'm  raising  this  because
there has been a pilot project for instance - and Mama  Vilakazi  will  know
about this - in KZN, where tribal authorities were used. At  some  point  we
would need to sit and  discuss,  and  review  that  pilot  project  and  see
whether it has been useful or not so that we are not seen to  be  uneven  in
the manner in which we do things. If  you  say  that  the  amakhosi  in  KZN
should have access to distribution of IDs, then you have to do the  same  in
the other provinces.

Therefore, a policy decision would have to  be  taken  so  that  it  is  not
something that is being done  in  a  disorganised  fashion.  It's  something
about which we have to be very sensitive. The other tendency is that in  the
process, some of the amakhosi want to abuse our people, by  asking  them  to
pay a levy that is not necessarily going to Home Affairs, but is  one  which
is designed to pay the inkosi. These are some of the things about  which  we
have to be very careful. I'm just saying that maybe  it's  good  to  discuss
and interact more with the tribal authorities  about  how  best  to  utilise
them in the process. But I would be very careful  and  not  be  seen  to  be
using the one particular group of amakhosi and not the other.

Lastly, a number of people have mentioned Hanis, and how a lot of money  has
been budgeted for Hanis and that there hasn't been positive results. I  need
to mention that Hanis incorporates several  elements.  It  is  an  automated
finger printing system, but it is  also  about  movement  control.  And  the
money that has been budgeted for Hanis has not gone down the drain.  Because
in the years for which that money has been budgeted, a lot has been done  to
sort out the problem of our movement control systems.  A  lot  of  work  has
been done to clean up our population register; regardless of the  fact  that
we still have people who are acquiring our passports and  IDs  fraudulently.
But a lot of effort has gone into cleaning up the population  register.  But
also, our automated fingerprinting system is currently being populated.  The
back record conversion from paperwork to an electronic system will begin  in
the next three months. Therefore, it's not like money has really  gone  down
the drain. A lot of work, planning and  investigation  have  gone  into  all
these. By 2005 for instance, the smart card will be introduced. And  we  are
hoping that at the rate of 6 million per year we will be able to  produce  6
million smart cards per year.

People who don't know what's happening in the department will say a  lot  of
money has been budgeted and nothing has happened. A lot of  money  has  gone
into studying and investigations about what's  the  best  system  for  South
Africa. A lot of money has also gone into other elements of  Hanis,  because
Hanis, as I said, incorporates several elements. There is a lot to it.  It's
not just about one thing, but it's about a whole range of elements.

And  the  very  last  is  the  issue  raised  by  one   member   about   the
computerisation of our offices.  We  must  also  be  very  careful  when  we
prepare our speeches on a Budget Vote. We must check  the  information  that
we are going to use when  we  come  to  House.  It  is  not  true  that  the
department is not electronically connected right through, or that  it's  not
computerised. For example, nationally we have about  265  offices  that  are
computerised. We have 60 border posts that are computerised, and we have  84
foreign offices, all of which are electronically  connected.  And  they  are
compatible with the rest the departments of Government.

Therefore, what I'm urging people to do is also to  do  a  bit  of  research
when we come to make a presentation to Parliament, so that we  are  informed
about what's happening in the department we are going to be debating  about.
That was the last issue I wanted to raise, hon members. Thank you very  much
for your valuable contributions, hon members, and  we  have  noted  all  the
issues you have raised. We've noted all the suggestions made and we will  be
able to use that information. Thank you very much [Applause.]

[The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, as members of this  House,  we
are very grateful to you for being part of us. We would like  to  take  this
opportunity to congratulate you as the Minister of  Home  Affairs.  We  know
that you will lead this department in the  right  direction  since  we  have
seen you making a recommendation that identity documents  should  be  issued
without paying even a cent.

Hon members of this House, the debate is concluded  and  the  duty  of  this
House is over, therefore the House is adjourned. Thank you.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 15:59.
