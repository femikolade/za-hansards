            PASSING AWAY OF SOUTH AFRICA'S AMBASSADOR TO VIETNAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  with profound sadness the passing away on 11  February  2004  of
           South Africa's Ambassador to Vietnam, Mr Sipho Sydney Makana;


       (b)  that Mr Makana joined the African National Congress in 1952  and
           left South Africa in 1963 and lived for many years in the former
           Soviet Union where he obtained a Master's  degree  in  economics
           from the Moscow State University;


       (c)  that Mr Makana received military training in the  Soviet  Union,
           served on the Revolutionary  Council  of  the  African  National
           Congress, was elected to  the  NEC  of  the  ANC  at  the  Kabwe
           Conference in 1985 and worked as Administrative Secretary at the
           ANC Headquarters in Zambia; and


       (d)  that during the period 1990-1997 Mr Makana was Head of  the  ANC
           Mission in the Soviet Union;


  (2) remembers that Mr Makana -


       (a)  was a Senator  in  the  South  African  Parliament  representing
           Gauteng and also served as  Chairperson  of  the  Senate  Select
           Committee on Defence,  Safety  and  Security,  and  Correctional
           Services, as well as the Ad Hoc Committee on Intelligence;


       (b)  in 1996 was appointed as South Africa's Ambassador Extraordinary
           and Plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation and on 18 November
           2003 was appointed South Africa's first Ambassador to Vietnam;


  (3) recognises the great and selfless  work  that  Mr  Makana  did  as  a
       servant of our country and people; and
  (4) conveys its heartfelt condolences to the Makana family and his  loved
       ones.

Agreed to.

                  PASSING AWAY OF ARCHBISHOP DENNIS HURLEY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E THABETHE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice on behalf of  the  Chief
Whip of the Majority Party:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with a deep sense of sorrow  the  passing  away  of  Archbishop
       Dennis Hurley on 13 February 2004;


  (2) remembers Archbishop Hurley's  great  contribution  to  the  struggle
       against apartheid, and believes that  his  passing  away  robs  South
       Africa of one of its greatest spiritual leaders,  a  person  of  rare
       foresight and courage;
  (3) believes that, even as we mourn his loss, we must celebrate the  life
       of this South African  who,  throughout  his  life,  chose  to  work,
       together with the majority of his countrywomen and countrymen, for  a
       just solution, the reconstruction and the development of our country,
       and that his life and memory will continue to inspire  and  encourage
       us in the quest for a transformed South Africa;


  (4) expresses its great sense of  loss  at  Archbishop  Hurley's  passing
       away; and


  (5) conveys its deepest condolences to Archbishop Hurley's next  of  kin,
       the Roman Catholic Church and the millions of our people in all walks
       of life who looked up to him for guidance and leadership.

Agreed to.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Local Government: Property Rates Bill [B 19 - 2003]
  (National Assembly - sec 75).

Agreed to.

                    CONDOLENCES ON DEATH OF KARABO GWALA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms E NGALEKA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC would like to  express  its  deep
sense of sadness at the passing away of  three-year-old  Karabo  Gwala,  who
disappeared down a sewerage hole in Soweto on Monday, 2  February  2004.  We
are angered by the results of an urgent  preliminary  investigation  by  the
Department of Labour, which found that the company carrying out  maintenance
work violated health and safety regulations.

We  applaud  the  prompt  action  by  the  Department  of  Labour  and   the
Johannesburg Metro in dealing with this matter,  and  urge  that  the  final
report be expedited so that  the  bereaved  family  can  begin  the  healing
process. The ANC  conveys  its  heartfelt  condolences  to  the  family  and
friends of young Karabo. I thank you.

  ADMISSION BY MINISTER OF HEALTH THAT SA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN A SHAMBLES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S V KALYAN (DA): Madam Speaker, the admission by the Minister of  Health
that the health care system in South Africa is in a shambles  is  remarkably
honest considering that it is an admission of  abject  failure  by  herself,
the ANC and the New NP Deputy Minister.

The hon Tshabalala-Msimang has been in charge of the health care system  for
the past five years and her ANC predecessor  was  in  charge  for  the  five
years before that. Together they have turned a functioning,  and  in  places
world-class, health care system into a shambles.

She must take responsibility for this mess, not throw up her hands  and  use
it as an excuse to ignore a court ruling  to  roll  out  antiretrovirals  to
people living with HIV/Aids. The hon Minister must explain to us the  extent
of the shambles and set out her plans to put things right. We need  to  know
the timeframes for getting health care back  on  track,  and  the  names  of
those who will take responsibility for implementing this plan.

This public admission of her inability to manage the health  care  portfolio
competently and the resultant shambles  are  costing  South  Africans  their
lives. South Africa deserves better. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

         FEW SA COMPANIES RESPONDING CONSTRUCTIVELY TO HIV EPIDEMIC

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam  Speaker,  HIV/Aids  is  having  a  devastating
effect on the lives of millions of people and families in South  Africa.  It
is also having a negative effect on our economy and on business. The IFP  is
therefore disturbed to learn, according  to  a  recently  conducted  survey,
that few companies in South Africa are responding constructively to the  HIV
epidemic.

The SA Business Coalition on HIV/Aids conducted a survey of 1 006  companies
during October and November last year.  According  to  the  survey,  only  a
quarter of those surveyed had implemented a formal HIV/Aids policy and  even
fewer had voluntary counselling and testing programmes. Also,  34%  reported
a negative impact on their profits owing to HIV/Aids.

Neither Government nor business can ignore this epidemic and  hope  that  it
will just disappear. If both do not play their part in dealing with it as  a
matter of urgency, it will have a crippling effect on the  country  and  its
economy. It is therefore of the utmost importance that companies across  the
various sectors of business implement the appropriate policies and  measures
to deal with this epidemic.

Government should use every election platform  to  confront  and  not  evade
HIV, and to inform the public as to exactly where it stands on the  roll-out
of antiretrovirals, which remains, as yet, a  promise  and  not  a  reality.
Thank you.

              LAND RESTITUTION PROGRAMME REDRESSING LAND NEEDS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S F BALOYI (ANC): Madam Speaker, since coming to power the ANC has  made
giant strides towards restoring the dignity of our people through  the  land
restitution programme. This programme stands  as  a  proud  example  of  the
ANC's  commitment  to  directing  an  immediate  intervention  in  terms  of
redressing  land  needs,  alleviating   poverty   and   maintaining   social
stability.

In my constituency, Mataffin in Mpumalanga, 6 000 hectares of  farmland  has
been bought at a price of R71 million. This farmland will accommodate  6 000
beneficiaries of the Mdluli clan,  including  other  families.  Sugar  cane,
avocados, pecan nuts and litchis are produced on part of  the  land.  On  13
December last year the land was  officially  handed  over  to  the  clan  by
Deputy Minister Dirk du Toit.

This project would not have  been  possible  without  the  ANC  Government's
programme on land restitution. This programme is an example of how  the  ANC
is improving the lives of our people on the  ground,  bringing  to  fruition
the ideals of the Freedom Charter and fulfilling  the  ANC's  contract  with
the people for a better life for all. I thank you. [Applause.]

                    TELEVISED DEBATES BETWEEN ANC AND DA
                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C B HERANDIEN (NNP):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  DA  se  standpunt  dat
kiesers slegs 'n ingeligte  keuse  voor  die  verkiesing  kan  maak  as  die
President en die agb Leon deelneem aan 'n reeks debatte wat op TV  uitgesaai
word, is lagwekkend. [Tussenwerpsels.] Wat kan meer voorspelbaar wees as  'n
debat tussen die agb Leon en die President? Ons weet mos die  agb  Leon  sal
bloot kritiseer en nogmaals kritiseer.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  kiesers  het
nie nodig om die agb Leon op TV op en af te sien spring om die DA se  beleid
te verstaan nie, want elke keer as 'n DA-lid sy of haar mond  oopmaak,  stel
hulle die DA se raas-en-blaas-beleid bekend.

Die NNP wil ook graag weet of, indien so 'n debat sou plaasvind, die DA  van
plan is om grootskermtelevisies aan al die areas te  verskaf  waar  so  baie
van Suid-Afrika se kiesers woon wat nie televisies het nie.  Of  is  dit  'n
aanduiding dat die DA die sake wat die agb Leon  wil  debatteer  net  op  'n
klein  groepie  elite  kiesers  van  toepassing  wil  maak  en  nie  op  die
meerderheid van die leiers van die kieserskorps nie?

Die NNP vind dit ook ironies dat die agb Leon se pasaangestelde  pryssanger,
die agb Gibson, die President van presidensiële  arrogansie  beskuldig;  dit
komende van 'n party wie se leier opposisionele arrogansie  vervolmaak  het.
Selfs die DA se verkiesingsplakkate basuin dit  uit  dat  Suid-Afrika  beter
verdien as om na die  agb  arrogante  leier  van  die  DA  in  'n  debat  op
televisie te kyk.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  NNP  dink  dit  is  nie  net  die
President  wat  beter  dinge  het  om  te  doen  nie,  maar  selfs  ook  die
kieserskorps.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN (NNP): Madam Speaker, the DA's view that voters  can  only
make an informed choice before the elections if the President  and  the  hon
Leon  participate  in  a  series   of   debates   on   TV   is   ridiculous.
[Interjections.] What could be more predictable than a  debate  between  the
hon Leon and the President? Surely we know that the  hon  Leon  will  merely
criticise and criticise yet again. [Interjections.] The voters do  not  have
to see the hon Leon jumping up and down on TV to understand  the  policy  of
the DA, because every time a DA member opens his or  her  mouth,  they  make
known the "huff and puff" policy of the DA.

The NNP would also like to know, if  such  a  debate  were  to  take  place,
whether the DA intends providing big-screen television  sets  to  the  areas
where so many of South Africa's voters  who  do  not  have  television  sets
live. Or is this an indication that the DA wants the  issues  that  the  hon
Leon intends debating to be applicable  only  to  a  small  group  of  elite
voters and not to the majority of the leaders of the electorate?

The NNP also finds it ironic that the  hon  Leon's  newly  appointed  praise
singer, the hon Gibson, accuses the  President  of  presidential  arrogance;
this coming from a party whose leader has perfected oppositional  arrogance.
Even the DA's election posters proclaim loudly that  South  Africa  deserves
better than to watch the hon arrogant leader  of  the  DA  in  a  debate  on
television. [Interjections.]  The  NNP  thinks  that  it  is  not  only  the
President who has better things to do, but  also  the  electorate.  I  thank
you. [Applause.] [Interjections.]]

The  SPEAKER:  The  UCDP  ...   [Interjections.]   Order!   [Interjections.]
Electioneering in two weeks' time, please!

                     VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M A SEECO (UCDP): Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate  that  we  are  still
losing our daughters, who are being murdered by  their  so-called  husbands.
Thato Setlogelo from Ratloung, Thaba Nchu was laid to rest  on  Saturday  14
February 2004. Once again, we hear the  cry  to  unite  and  stand  together
against the killing of our women and  children.  Everyone  has  a  right  to
live. The UCDP wants the law to take its course.

Letsogo la molao le letelele. [Justice will prevail.] [Applause.]

                     DEATH OF TEBOGO BENEDICT MADINGOANE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S L DITHEBE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC is deeply saddened by the  news
of the death of Tebogo Benedict Madingoane  this  past  weekend  in  Soweto.
Through his multi-award-winning band, Mafikizolo, Tebogo played a  key  role
in the  advancement  of  youth  development  by  encouraging  youngsters  to
bravely face life's challenges. His band, Mafikizolo, has visited Aids  care
centres and youth centres around the country in a bid to  spread  a  message
of hope and encouragement to the youth of our country.

We call on all our people to be patient on our roads  so  as  to  avoid  the
unnecessary loss of life through road rage.  The  ANC  extends  its  sincere
condolences to the Madingoane family, friends, the Mafikizolo band  and  all
those he worked with in the music industry.

Robala ka kagiso "mpintshi". [Rest in peace, friend.] [Applause.]

                         MATOLA RAID - COMMEMORATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr V D MABUYAKHULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC would  like  to  thank  the
Government and people of Mozambique, together with the Freedom  Park  Trust,
for making it possible for families of South Africans  and  Mozambicans  who
lost  their  lives  in  the  South  African  struggle  for   liberation   to
commemorate the Matola Raid of 30 January 1981.

As we celebrate the first decade of  freedom,  it  is  appropriate  that  we
also, as people, solemnly pay tribute to the heroines and  heroes  who  paid
with their lives for us to be free. It is  also  appropriate  that  at  this
moment in our history we extend our sincere  gratitude  to  the  Mozambicans
for their comradeship and sacrifices including the loss of life  of  Comrade
President Samora Machel. We should find relief in the fact  that  all  these
heroic human sacrifices were not in vain.

Today South Africa is  a  democratic  state.  We  should  continue  to  work
together for peace on our continent and strength  in  the  AU,  and  towards
consigning to the dustbin regional aggression  and  cross-border  raids.  We
should  do  all  this  in  order  to  create,  continually,  the  conditions
necessary for us to progressively create work and push  back  the  frontiers
of poverty. [Applause.]

                            AMNESTY FOR PRISONERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam Speaker,  crime  is  one  of  our  most  serious
problems. People expect that criminals will serve their  sentences  and  pay
for the crimes they have committed.

The criminal justice system is weak. Our prisons are full of  awaiting-trial
prisoners. The ANC does not have the political will to prioritise the  fight
against crime. It fails to speed up the justice system, it  fails  to  build
enough prisons and it fails to rehabilitate  prisoners.  Because  the  jails
are bursting at the seams, now the ANC wants to release  prisoners  for  the
10th anniversary.

Voters will think that the authorities have gone crazy. They do not want  50
000, or however many prisoners, being given amnesty. They know that  between
85% and 94% of convicts commit repeat offences. Voters do  not  want  to  be
hit by a crime wave and they reject any such amnesty.

The Correctional Services department now has an NNP Deputy Minister.  Is  it
a coincidence that so soon  after  he  was  appointed  prisoners  are  given
amnesty? He must have used his influence to plead for amnesty,  or  does  he
have no influence at all? South Africa deserves better. [Applause.]

                                ATTACK ON IFP
                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP opposes  the  tactics  of  the
Christian Action Network in disseminating the Biblical Issues Voter's  Guide
2004. The IFP opposes this election propaganda in  the  strongest  of  terms
and treats it with the utter contempt that it deserves.

For the record, the IFP is a political party based on Christian  principles.
Our acknowledgement of God is evident in the  fact  that  every  meeting  is
opened and closed with a  prayer.  We  believe  that  the  Christian  Action
Network is totally ill-informed, it is deceptive and it  is  misleading  the
voters. Also, it is with shock and utter disgust that political parties  use
and  manipulate  God  as  an  electioneering  tool.  The  lies  and   deceit
orchestrated by the Christian Action  Network  are  tantamount  to  being  a
false  witness  against  God  and  his  teachings.  We  stand  against  such
vilification of our party's principles. Thank you. [Applause.]

                          SUCCESS OF POLICE SERVICE
                            (Member's Statement)

Ms L L  MABE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  we  welcome  the  good  news  by  the
Government, which on Friday 13 February, 2004  reported  on  the  successful
transformation of the police apparatus. As in many other areas,  this  is  a
success story that has been made possible by the genuine commitment  of  our
people, led by the ANC, to the people's contract of a better life for all.

Despite the enormous challenges that continue to face  our  police  service,
Government disclosed during those briefings that, since 1994,  murder  cases
had decreased by 30,7%; rape by 5,7% in  2002-03;  hijacking  by  20,2%  and
bank robberies by 15,4%. Our police  machinery  has  been  transformed  from
being an enemy of the people into a police service that prioritises  respect
for human rights and greater accountability to the community at large.

These achievements should serve as a inspiration  to  all  of  us  as  South
Africans to work to overcome the remaining challenges and to  celebrate  our
first decade of freedom with pride, rededicating ourselves to creating  work
and pushing back the frontiers of poverty. Viva ANC. [Applause.]

                              THE DEATH PENALTY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr F BEUKMAN (NNP): Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Die moord op 'n 82-jarige man en die  verkragting  van  sy  75-jarige  vrou,
oortuig die NNP opnuut  om  weer  te  vra  vir  die  herinstelling  van  die
doodstraf. Elke dag dien hoofopskrifte van koerante as 'n  stille  getuienis
van die absolute brutaliteit  en  gebrek  aan  respek  vir  menselewens  wat
voorkom onder sommige in ons samelewing. Daarom is die NNP oortuig dat  daar
net een gepaste straf vir hierdie brutale moordenaars  is,  en  dit  is  die
doodstraf.  Die  Nuwe  NP  sê  reguit:  maksimum   straf   vir   vroue-   en
kinderverkragters.

Ons glo dat die doodstraf sal  dien  as  'n  effektiewe  afskrikmiddel  teen
gewelddadige moorde. Wanneer moordenaars meer as een lewenslange  tronkstraf
opgelê word, beteken dit in elk geval  nie  dat  hulle  lewenslank  uit  die
samelewing verwyder word nie. Volgens wet moet hierdie  vonnisse  gelyktydig
uitgedien word. Hulle kan dus heel waarskynlik oor 10 tot 15 jaar  vrygelaat
word op goeie gedrag. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The murder of an 82-year-old man and  the  rape  of  his  75-year-old  wife
convince the NNP to ask once  again  for  the  reinstatement  of  the  death
penalty. Every day headlines  of  newspapers  bear  silent  witness  to  the
absolute brutality and lack of respect for  human  lives  occurring  amongst
some people in our society. For this reason the NNP is convinced that  there
is only one appropriate penalty for these brutal murderers, and that is  the
death penalty. The NNP says  frankly:  Maximum  punishment  for  rapists  of
women and children.

We believe that the death penalty will serve as an  effective  deterrent  to
violent murders.  When  murderers  are  sentenced  to  more  than  one  life
sentence, it does not, in fact, mean that they will be removed from  society
for life. According to the law the sentences must be served  simultaneously.
They could therefore quite probably be released in 10 to 15 years'  time  on
account of good behaviour.]

The NNP also calls on the Minister for Safety and Security  to  do  research
on the causes of violent crime in this country because it has become such  a
serious problem that one simply cannot ignore it any more.

The NNP also noted that the  leader  of  the  IFP  yesterday  called  for  a
referendum on the death penalty. Maybe the hon Buthelezi should  first  call
for a referendum among his party and its alliance partners, the DA,  because
they  still  do  not  have  an  official  policy  on  the   death   penalty.
[Interjections.]

Die   NNP   se   benadering   is:   geen   genade   vir   misdadigers   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [The approach of the  NNP  is:  No  mercy  for  criminals.
[Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order. Order, hon members! There were two parties that did  not
take up their slots.  Is the PAC in the House? No. Azapo? Not in the  House.
So, UCDP, you may do so now, if you have a statement you wish to  make.  No.
The ANC.

               BRINGING JUDICIAL SERVICES CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N MAHLAWE (ANC): Madam Speaker, in an attempt to bring judicial  services
closer  to  the  people,  the  Minister  for  Justice   and   Constitutional
Development has issued a notice to alter the area of jurisdiction for  which
a High Court has been established in terms of section 2(2)  of  the  Interim
Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of High Courts Act, Act 41 of 2001.

The Eastern Cape province has benefited the most from this process  as  many
communities do not have to travel long distances to  High  Courts,  as  they
used to have to do in the past. However,  the  process  has  been  met  with
skepticism by communities in the areas of  Umzimkulu  and  Maluti.  This  is
because these areas have been incorporated into the High Court  of  KwaZulu-
Natal, ie Pietermaritzburg.

Secondly, it is alleged that the staff in these KwaZulu-Natal offices  claim
that they  have  not  been  informed  about  the  changes  and  the  interim
incorporation of Umzimkulu and Maluti. Therefore, an appeal  is  being  made
on  behalf  of  these  communities  to  the   Minister   for   Justice   and
Constitutional Development to investigate these claims in  order  to  ensure
proper arrangements for the benefit of all. I thank you.

The SPEAKER: Thank you. The PAC and Azapo are still not in the  House.  That
brings us back to the ANC. I'm sorry, but I'm bound  by  the  order  in  the
regulations.

            PAC ALIGNED WITH DIKWANKWETLA PARTY IN THE FREE STATE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S PHOHLELA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the PAC has moved to align  itself  with
the Dikwankwetla Party in my constituency, which is the  Thabo  Mofutsanyane
District in the eastern Free State.

While the Dikwankwetla  Party  is  a  mere  municipal  party  in  the  Thabo
Mofutsanyane District, wielding  a  mere  0,1%  of  the  vote  in  the  last
election in 1999, with the PAC wielding 1%, it is very  ambitious  for  them
to think that they will garner 20% in the coming election as  the  ANC  wins
in this area. Thank you.

The SPEAKER: Time for statements is  now  over.  Ministers,  are  there  any
ministerial responses arising from  your  portfolios?  Minister  Asmal,  I'm
sure  there  will  be  a  way  in  which  you   will   make   a   statement.

                AMNESTY FOR PRISONERS AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The  IFP  -
which is in an the alliance with the DA - is pleading  for  the  amnesty  of
certain people who are in prison. The DA, however, is  saying  no.  This  is
but one of the many instances where you  see  the  disjuncture  between  the
members of this coalition. [Interjections.] Oh!  I  am  coming  to  that  my
friend, thank you.

By the way, I have two questions to which I want to respond.  Secondly,  the
Minister for corrections ...

Mr T D LEE: Not corrections, Correctional Services.

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: ... has  come  before  this  House.  I
know that you do speak English. I am not English-speaking. You  can't  speak
Xhosa, but I can speak English. [Applause.]

The Minister  of  Correctional  Services  appeared  before  this  House  and
explained  about  many  programmes  that  they  have  that  relate  to   the
rehabilitation of offenders. Not only that; we have also come to this  House
and indicated the various members from structures in  our  communities  that
deal with that subject. Many of  them  are  funded  by  the  Government,  to
assist them in doing this. Our rehabilitation programme is the best  in  the
world.

The Minister, who is a member of the IFP, stands condemned now by  a  leader
of a party that his party is in a coalition with. They don't  see  the  good
work that he is doing in that department. Again, this is one  of  the  areas
that indicate that this coalition, actually,  is  a  nonsensical  coalition.
But of course, we have it from the Minister of Home Affairs himself, who  is
the leader of the IFP, who said that this is a coalition that is  not  based
on any principle. He was forced into this coalition. In other  words,  these
are not people he would  ordinarily  have  wanted  to  be  associated  with.
[Applause.]  Again,  I  can  bet  my  last  money  that  the   Minister   of
Correctional Services is going to come here during the Budget debate  speech
and  indicate  the  other  things  that  have  been  done  for  purposes  of
rehabilitation.

It will always be like that, not only in South Africa,  but  even  in  other
countries in the modern democratic world, where now and  again  people  will
be released from prison on the basis of pardons, amnesties  and  so  on.  In
South Africa, because we are a democratic country, that  was  brought  about
through the very, very intense struggles, during which lives  were  lost  at
times, by people who  are  law-abiding  and  peace-loving  citizens  of  our
country. We will continue to be like that.

The second question relates to capital  punishment.  You  are  correct,  hon
member, to say that the DA has no policy on this matter. But at least  there
is one person who is clear on this matter. It is  the  hon  Douglas  Gibson.
When you read books on capital punishment, you will see that those who  push
for this type of punishment are described as conservative. That is true.  In
other words, we have somebody  who  argues  that  he  is  liberal,  but  his
attitude, even  towards  life,  is  as  conservative  as  his  position  is.
[Applause.] Now if the DA actually say that  they  have  a  policy  on  this
matter, why are they not talking about it? The last time something was  said
about it, was when the hon Gibson said, "I support", which is what the  case
is. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON POWERS AND PRIVILEGES OF
                                 PARLIAMENT

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move that  the
report be noted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly noted.

       POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF PARLIAMENT AND PROVINCIAL
                              LEGISLATURES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Madam Speaker, this  year  we  celebrate  10  years  of
freedom and  along  with  that  the  10th  anniversary  of  the  very  first
democratic Parliament of South Africa. How appropriate it is that  today  we
meet to discuss  a  Bill  that  forms  and  gives  expression  to  the  very
democratic  nature  of  this  Parliament  -  the  Powers,   Privileges   and
Immunities of Parliament and  Provincial  Legislatures  Bill.  At  the  very
outset allow me to dedicate this debate to a remarkable freedom  fighter,  a
comrade, colleague and former chairperson of this committee,  Comrade  Peter
Mokaba. It was a privilege to serve with him.

There was a time in our terrible past when Parliament was sovereign  and  as
such it was used, or rather abused, to visit all types of inequities on  our
people. Can we forget how  the  Senate  was  immorally  enlarged  to  remove
coloured people from the voters' roll and how, year after  year,  parliament
was used to keep Robert Sobukwe on Robben Island? This is  besides  all  the
thousands of immoral laws passed in that parliament.

Today we have a Constitution as the supreme law of the land under which  and
in terms of which our Parliament too must operate, thus the  need  for  this
Bill. We need to read the Bill in  conjunction  with  the  committee  report
published in the ATC on 26 November last year. I shall be referring to  both
the Bill and the report as  the  report  highlights  matters  that  must  be
further addressed by the  Rules  Committee  and  the  Constitutional  Review
Committee. May I say that both the report  and  the  Bill  were  unanimously
accepted in the committee.

Chapter 1, of course, deals with the normal definitions.  In  Chapter  2  we
see that provision is made for  the  description  of  what  constitutes  the
precincts of Parliament; that the Speaker and the Chairperson  of  the  NCOP
exercise joint control over Parliament - how this  is  done  must  be  dealt
with in accordance with the Rules; that members  of  the  security  services
may enter upon or remain in the precincts of Parliament to perform  policing
functions only with the permission and under the authority  of  the  Speaker
or the Chairperson - members might recall the problem we had last week  when
the  security  services  acted  without  the  permission  of  the  presiding
officers,  resulting  in  delays  in  the  functioning  of  Parliament;  the
execution of process or warrants of arrest may also only be  done  with  the
permission of the Speaker.

Chapter  3  deals  with  the  privileges,   immunities,   independence   and
protection of members and Parliament. The Constitution provides for  freedom
of speech in Parliament and provincial legislatures  subject  to  the  Rules
and Orders. The Bill, therefore, does not deal with the form and  manner  in
which this freedom is exercised,  but  the  committee  recommends  that  the
Rules provide for this. As the Constitution does  not  specifically  provide
for freedom of speech in joint sittings of the Houses  of  Parliament,  this
is provided for in clause 6. It is, however, recommended  that  this  lacuna
be referred to the Constitutional Review Committee.

A further lacuna is that the Constitution does  not  provide  for  a  Deputy
Minister having freedom of speech in a joint committee. Another matter  that
needs attention is that an official in the national or provincial  executive
has freedom of speech in the  NCOP  and  its  committees,  but  not  in  the
National Assembly. We believe  that  there  should  be  consistency  in  the
freedom of speech provisions for the Houses.

Clause 7 deals with prohibited acts in respect of  Parliament  and  members.
Acts that are prohibited include the following: A person may not impede  the
function of Parliament;  a  person  may  not  assault  or  threaten  members
because of his or her conduct in the House and a  person  may  not  cause  a
disturbance while a House or a committee is sitting or fail to  comply  with
an instruction by a duly authorised official.

Clause 8 deals with the improper influence of members. A person may  not  by
fraud, intimidation, force, insult or threat of any kind, or  by  the  offer
or  promise  of  any  inducement  or  benefit  influence  a  member  in  the
performance of his or her duty; or influence  a  member  to  be  absent;  or
attempt to compel a member to be for or  against  something  pending  before
the House or the committee. A member may not ask for, receive or accept  any
fee,  compensation,  gift,  reward,  favour  or  benefit  for  voting  in  a
particular manner or for not voting, or for promoting or  opposing  anything
pending before a House or a committee or for making representations to  such
House or committee.

In clause 9 we look at the attendance by  members  before  court,  and  this
provides that a member cannot be compelled to attend  a  court  on  a  civil
matter or as a witness in a criminal matter when the Speaker or  Chairperson
has issued a certificate stating that the member is required  to  attend  to
business at Parliament.

In chapter 4 - and I think this is of particular importance to members -  we
deal with disciplinary action against a member. This chapter  provides  that
a House has all the  powers  that  are  necessary  for  enquiring  into  and
pronouncing upon any act or matter declared by or under  section  13  to  be
contempt of Parliament by a member and  taking  the  necessary  disciplinary
action provided therefore. A committee must be established to deal with  all
enquiries referred to it. Such enquiries need to be conducted in  accordance
with a  procedure  that  is  fair  and  reasonable.  The  ad  hoc  committee
recommends that the Rules need to provide  for  these  procedures  and  that
they should be in place when the legislation takes effect. It is the  House,
and not that committee, that finds a member guilty of contempt.

Provision is made for sanctions, amongst others, that range  from  a  formal
warning; an apology to the House; the withholding, for a  specified  period,
of certain facilities provided to members; the removal, or suspension for  a
specified period, of the member from any parliamentary position occupied  by
that member; a fine not exceeding the equivalent of one month's  salary  and
allowances; or the suspension of the member  with  or  without  remuneration
for a period not exceeding 30 days. The Bill thus further  provides  that  a
member may not be suspended unless the House has  found  that  a  member  is
guilty of a serious  or  repeated  contempt  and  that  none  of  the  other
penalties will be sufficient. The committee also recommends that, as far  as
possible unparliamentary behaviour is  concerned,  it  be  codified  in  the
Rules.

Chapter 5 deals with witnesses. This sets out how witnesses  are  subpoenaed
to appear before a House or a committee. It provides, amongst  others,  that
a person can only be subpoenaed  by  the  Secretary  to  Parliament  on  the
instructions of the Speaker or the Chairperson or the chair of  a  committee
with the concurrence of the Speaker or Chairperson. It also makes  provision
for the administering of an oath or an affirmation. A very important  aspect
is covered in clause  16,  dealing  with  the  privileges  of  witnesses.  A
witness being examined under oath or affirmation may be required  to  answer
any question or to produce any document  despite  the  fact  that  doing  so
would incriminate him or her or would tend to expose him or her to  criminal
or civil proceedings or damages.  Provision  is  made  that  evidence  given
under oath or affirmation by a person may not be used  against  that  person
in any court or place outside Parliament, except  where  the  person  stands
trial on charges of perjury.

Clause 15 provides for certain limitations regarding  the  type  of  subject
matter about which a witness may be questioned,  or  the  type  of  document
that a witness may be requested to produce. These limitations should be  set
out in the Rules, and could include  the  following:  classified  documents,
sensitive information of  a  commercial  or  economic  nature,  the  private
affairs of individuals or institutions that are supplied  in  confidence  or
matters which are or may become the subject of sensitive  negotiations  with
governments or other bodies. These need to be determined by the Joint  Rules
Committee and contained in the Rules of Parliament.

Clause 17 makes it an offence for a person subpoenaed not to  appear  or  to
fail to remain in attendance. It is also an offence to refuse  to  be  sworn
in or, without sufficient cause, fail to  answer  fully  and  satisfactorily
all questions lawfully put. It is also an offence for a person  to  threaten
or obstruct a person in respect of evidence to be given, or  to  assault  or
penalise a person on account of the evidence they give or intend giving.

Chapter  6  deals  with  publications  and  broadcasting,  and  it  includes
protection   in   respect   of   publication,    unauthorised    publishing,
admissibility of journals as evidence, and the broadcasting of  proceedings.
The committee here, once again, requests that the Rules make  provision  for
the broadcasting or the televising of proceedings of Parliament.

Under ``General'', there is a  particularly  interesting  clause,  something
which I think exists in one other country only, and  that  is  a  protection
for members of the public. An entirely new and innovative provision is  that
of providing members of the public that are  aggrieved  by  a  statement  or
remark made by a member or a witness in or before  the  House  or  committee
about that person with an opportunity  to  have  a  response  recorded.  The
relevant committee  would  consider  such  request  and,  if  approved,  the
response would be published in the appropriate parliamentary paper.
The Act also provides for fines and imprisonment, or both, for  the  various
offences determined in the Bill. Imprisonment could be for periods of up  to
three years in some instances and, in the case of bribery, up to 15 years.

Chapter  8  has  provisions  which  make  this  applicable   to   provincial
legislatures and their members when they  so  desire.  If  I  may  elaborate
further with regard to the Rules, in the report,  the  committee  also  asks
that reflections on the judiciary be dealt with in the Rules; and  that  the
Joint Rules Committee consider whether reflections  on  members  of  another
House or legislature, as well as the deliberate  misleading  of  the  House,
should be declared contempt. Loss of  membership  and  other  sanctions  for
nonattendance of a House or committee should  also  be  dealt  with  in  the
Rules.

Members' conflict of financial interest should not  be  in  this  Bill,  but
should be dealt with in  the  code  of  conduct.  Also,  the  procedure  for
initiating disciplinary action needs to be contained in  the  Rules.  It  is
important that the report of the committee be read with  this  Bill,  as  it
contains a number of recommendations relating to the implementation of  this
Bill. It is  a  sincere  pleasure  to  recommend  the  Bill  to  the  House.
[Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker,  the  process  of  bringing  this  Bill  before
Parliament has been a long and protracted one. Drafts, 13  in  number,  have
been before parliamentary committees  ever  since  1997.  I  would  like  to
congratulate  hon  Peter  Hendrickse,  the  current   chairperson   of   the
committee, on his tenacity and persistence in getting the  Bill  before  the
House today.

Questions could be asked: How has our new  Parliament  managed  to  function
for the past eight years without a powers, privileges  and  immunities  Act?
Secondly, how has our new Parliament been able to live with the  dinosaurian
Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act of  1963,  which  is  still  on  our
Statute Book, and was drawn up in the heyday of Verwoerdian apartheid,  when
supreme power was vested in Parliament and not in the Constitution?
The answer to these questions lies in the fact that, in the apartheid  days,
all powers and privileges of Parliament were given to Parliament  by  itself
in the form of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Acts.

However, in the new South Africa, the powers, privileges and  immunities  of
Parliament derive their authority from our new  Constitution.  That  is  the
fundamental difference. But I want to  ask:  Where  is  the  full  range  of
powers, privileges and immunities of Parliament to be found? Let me  say  it
is not in this Bill.

This Bill before us is really an extension or supplementation of the  powers
and privileges. They are to be found  in  three  places.  The  core  powers,
privileges  and  immunities  of  Parliament  are  to   be   found   in   the
Constitution, and they have been there ever since 1996. The key ones are  in
section 56:


  The National Assembly or any of its committees may -
  (a) summon any person to appear before it to give evidence ...
  (b) require any person or institution to report to it;

This is a very important power.

Secondly, in section 57 is stated:


  (1) The National Assembly may -


       (a)  determine and control its own internal arrangements, proceedings
           and procedures.


  Thirdly, on privilege and immunity:


  (1) Cabinet members ... and members of the National Assembly -


       (a)  have freedom of speech in the Assembly and  in  its  committees,
           subject to its rules and orders; and


       (b)  are  not  liable  to  civil  or  criminal  proceedings,  arrest,
           imprisonment or damages for -


           (i)   anything that  they  have  said  in,  produced  before  or
                  submitted to the Assembly ... ; or


           (ii)  anything revealed  as  a  result  of  anything  that  they
                  have said in or produced before ... the  Assembly  or  any
                  of its committees.

So,  the  core  powers,  privileges  and  immunities  are   found   in   the
Constitution.

But, secondly, supplementary powers, privileges and immunities  are  located
in the Rules  and  Orders.  I  mentioned  some  of  these.  In  the  ad  hoc
committee's report before you, as Mr Hendrickse  has  mentioned,  they  draw
attention to the fact that the  Rules  and  Orders  committee  of  our  next
Parliament will have to sit down and flesh out the Rules and Orders  to  see
that, in  fact,  they  give  full  effect  to  the  powers,  privileges  and
immunities of Parliament.
However, the key ones amongst them are  these:  The  National  Assembly  may
make  Rules  and  Orders  concerning  its  business,  with  due  regard  for
representative and participatory democracy and accountability,  transparency
and public involvement. The Rules and Orders, not  national  legislation  or
the Constitution, determine how we manage our business.

Rules and Orders have to make  provision  for  the  conditions  under  which
freedom of speech is exercised. Is freedom of speech subjected to the  Rules
and Orders? When it comes to the issue of contempt of Parliament,  what  are
the important definitions of ``contempt of Parliament''?  Is  ``contempt  of
Parliament'' as it is defined in the Rules and Orders?  So,  the  Rules  and
Orders are  the  second  very  important  component  of  the  total  powers,
privileges and immunities of Parliament.

The other area where these are to be  found  is  the  national  legislation.
This Bill is part of the national legislation  which  gives  Parliament  its
powers, privileges and immunities. So, the National Assembly committees  may
compel, in terms of national legislation or Rules and Orders, any person  or
institution to comply with a summons to  come  and  bear  witness  and  give
evidence.

The committee's recommendation before you is  that  this  matter  should  be
dealt with by legislation, and not by Rules and  Orders,  because  it  deals
with the public; it doesn't deal with  arrangements  internally  as  far  as
members are concerned.  So,  there  is  provision  in  this  Bill  for  this
particular provision.

Further, the Constitution  says:  ``Parliament  can,  by  legislation,  have
further privileges and immunities by national legislation.'' So,  this  Bill
also extends the powers and privileges of Parliament  in  a  very  important
way.

Now, having said that, let me identify  some  of  the  ways  in  which  this
legislation does extend and deal with the  powers  and  privileges,  as  the
previous hon speaker mentioned, on the question of witnesses; that  is,  how
they should be handled, what their rights and privileges are, and  what  the
rights and privileges of Parliament are, which are dealt with under  Chapter
5 of this Bill.

Chapter 3 deals with powers, privileges and immunities of  the  independence
and the protection of  MPs.  This  relates  to  the  Constitution's  section
58(1), and it deals with freedom of speech  in  Joint  Sittings,  acts  from
which MPs are prohibited, attendance before  the  court,  and  with  persons
creating a disturbance. Finally, this Bill deals  with  disciplinary  action
against MPs for contempt of Parliament.

It is important to note that because Parliament has no  judicial  authority,
it cannot sit as a court of law to convict  persons  of  criminal  offences;
whether those persons be  members  of  the  public  or  MPs.  This  judicial
function, in terms of our  Constitution,  has  to  be  carried  out  by  the
courts. On the other hand,  Parliament  has  the  right  to  discipline  its
members to the extent  that  this  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the
functions  of  Parliament  are  not  disrupted  and  that  the  business  of
Parliament is carried out in an orderly fashion.  That's  why  it  can  take
action against members as far as contempt of Parliament is concerned.

The hon member dealt with this, but I want to say one thing on it - we  must
make it quite clear that although a procedure is laid  down,  and  penalties
are identified, and the House could find a member guilty of contempt and  it
could refer that matter, if necessary, to the National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions, it goes without saying that any action taken by this House  in
respect of a member's conduct must be carried out  in  compliance  with  the
Constitution; and in particular, with section 33 of the Constitution,  which
warns that there should be just administrative action and that there  should
be no kangaroo court action.

This Act deals with all  the  necessary  and  similar  legislation  to  give
effect to the powers which the Constitution  has  given  to  Parliament,  to
give effect to additional authorities and also to  give  effect  to  certain
incidental matters, like the protection of the precincts of Parliament.  The
DA believes that this Bill is not only long overdue, but is very  necessary,
and that  the  provisions  are  appropriate,  and,  therefore,  we  have  no
hesitation in supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, the birth of democracy in 1994  and  the  new
legal framework created by the 1996 Constitution  meant  that  many  of  the
laws on our Statute Book became obsolete, inappropriate and  in  some  cases
unconstitutional.  This  Parliament  and  its  predecessor   have   done   a
tremendous amount of work to weed out these laws, and to  consign  the  most
glaring examples of inequity and discrimination to the dustbin of history.

The Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act of 1963 is but  one  example  of
inappropriate and outdated legislation that still  remains  on  our  Statute
Book. Today it is also to be consigned to  the  dustbin  as  we  debate  and
approve the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament  and  Provincial
Legislatures  Bill  -  a  piece  of  legislation  that  retains  the  finest
traditions of parliamentary practice, but which is also  modern,  up-to-date
and in line with our constitutional dispensation.

It took six years and 14 drafts of  the  Bill  before  we  could  have  this
debate today. Some would say that that is way too long, but,  on  the  other
hand, no one can accuse Parliament of not being thorough when it deals  with
legislation affecting itself and its members.

The ad hoc committee established for the purpose of drafting this Bill  must
be congratulated  for  its  endeavours  and  so  must  its  chairperson  and
members, and last, but by no means least, the former chief legal adviser  to
Parliament, Adv Anton Meyer, who played a pivotal role over  many  years  in
drafting the Bill that the IFP can support.

The IFP will support the Bill because it retains and entrenches  the  finest
traditions of parliamentary practice viz the ability of the  legislature  to
control its own  proceedings,  freedom  of  speech  for  its  democratically
elected members and their immunity from prosecution for anything said  while
executing their constitutional duties.

These  aspects  are  fundamental  for  the  independence  of  the   national
legislature, the separation of powers guaranteed by  our  Constitution,  and
the successful day-to-day operation of the people's Parliament.

However, it is said that every silver cloud has a dark lining and the  Bill,
unfortunately, is no exception. The IFP, therefore, has to take  issue  with
a number of provisions contained in the Bill.

Firstly, the Bill refers to improper interference with  the  performance  of
Parliament and its members. But,  what  constitutes  improper  interference?
The term is not defined and is therefore open to  subjective  interpretation
by those charged with its  implementation.  Does  this  mean  that  peaceful
protest - a cornerstone of democracy  -  will  be  taboo  in  Parliament  in
future? Does it mean that a candlelight vigil for the victims of  Aids  over
a lunch hour will be construed as improper interference because the  subject
is not palatable to those in positions of power?

The undefined "improper" appears again in clause 8,  which  is  intended  to
stop corrupt activities by  parliamentarians  and  members  of  the  public.
Again, the subjectivity of the interpretation of "improper"  is  problematic
and could potentially give legitimate lobbyists  grey  hairs  in  trying  to
decide if their approaches are improper or not.

Somebody should also alert the Minister for Safety and Security and  the  SA
Police Service to clause 4 of the Bill which states that they  derive  their
policing  powers  within  the  precincts   of   Parliament,   under   normal
circumstances, from the permission and authority  of  the  Speaker  and  the
Chairperson, not the  other  way  round  as  was  witnessed  by  the  recent
security fiasco when an SAPS officer caused havoc  with  overzealous  access
control.

The Bill creates a standing committee to investigate contempt  and  to  take
disciplinary action in cases of contempt, as we've heard.  The  creation  of
such a committee is welcomed but the composition of the committee  is  bound
to create controversy of its own. If the normal  parliamentary  practice  of
proportional representation is followed, it  will  mean  that  the  majority
party will be able to load the committee with its members.  This  creates  a
real potential for political skulduggery and a  whitewash  when  members  of
the majority party are hauled before  the  committee.  Of  course,  it  also
creates the potential for members of  the  majority  party  to  victimise  a
member of a smaller party appearing on charges of contempt.

In the interests of balanced democracy, the IFP insists that,  in  the  case
of this standing committee, proportional representation  be  set  aside  and
that the committee should consist of  only  one  member  from  each  of  the
parties represented in Parliament.  A  chairperson  must  be  selected  from
within the committee and not be predetermined to be a member of  the  ruling
party.

Clause 25 of the Bill is truly revolutionary in that it affords a member  of
the public who feels aggrieved at  a  statement  made  under  privilege  the
opportunity to have a response recorded. This provision is  highly  laudable
on paper, but when one notes that it is the same standing committee  created
by clause 12 that will adjudicate on the  publication  of  the  response  or
not, the alarm bells must be ringing loudly.

Can  any  reasonable  person  really  foresee   a   majority-party-dominated
committee giving a critical  response  to  a  remark  by  the  President  on
HIV/Aids or Zimbabwe  the  time  of  day?  I  certainly  cannot  and  it  is
therefore crucial to true freedom of speech that  the  majority  party  must
not dominate the said standing committee.

The Bill leaves many future discussions  up  to  the  Constitutional  Review
Committee and, ultimately, many detailed implementation decisions up to  the
Rules Committee of the National Assembly. Perhaps that was unavoidable,  but
the reality of the situation is  that  the  new  Parliament  and  its  newly
constituted committees will have to cover much of the  same  ground  as  has
been covered over the past six years before this Bill  will  be  fairly  and
fully implemented. Hopefully,  it  will  not  take  another  six  years  and
umpteen drafts before a new Bill replaces the old. I thank you.

Ms E NGALEKA: Madam Speaker, comrades, friends and colleagues.  Historically
the ANC has prided itself on being a party of  the  people,  uniting  blacks
across the boundaries of ethnicity, class and ideology. Since 1994  the  ANC
Government has even become more  broad-based,  representing  all  people  of
South Africa, white and black, men and women of  all  cultures  and  diverse
backgrounds. Parliament has truly become the voice of the people.

The political landscape in South Africa between  the  first  decade  of  the
20th century and the beginning of  the  1990s  has  been  described  as  one
dominated by two streams: The history of a parliament without  a  legitimate
democratic base that passed increasingly repressive apartheid laws, and  the
other a nonracial, inclusive movement that called for and later  fought  for
political rights and freedoms for all.

Phambi  konyaka  ka-1994,   iPalamente   yayingalawulwa   sisininzi,   kwaye
yayingena bameli. Ngoko ke, iKhabhinethi  yayiyiyo  eyayilawula  iPalamente.
Amalungu ePalamente ayengena kwenza ngakumbi ngaphandle kokwaleka  umsundulo
kwiziphakamiso zorhulumente wocalucalulo.

Abahlali  namhlanje,  kufanele  bathabathe  inxaxheba  kwimicimbi   yeeofisi
zabameli babo nakuburhulumente, ukuze bafumane ingxelo eyiyo.  Le  Palamente
imalunga nokuphuhlisa kwanokufezekisa  amalungelo  abantu.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Prior to 1994, Parliament was both undemocratic  and  unrepresentative.  As
the executive dominated parliament, parliamentarians could do  little  other
than to rubber stamp the apartheid government's initiatives.

Today  Parliament  is  an  equal  partner  with  its  own   constitutionally
enshrined powers. The Constitution vests  Parliament  with  the  legislative
authority of the national sphere of government.  As  such,  when  exercising
its legislative authority Parliament is bound only by the Constitution.]

Section 1 of the Constitution sets out principles by  which  governments  in
South Africa must be informed. Thus, a sovereign,  democratic  South  Africa
is founded on the following values: human dignity, equality and  advancement
of human rights and freedoms,  nonracialism  and  nonsexism,  constitutional
supremacy and the rule  of  law,  universal  suffrage,  a  national,  common
voters' roll, regular  elections  and  a  multiparty  system  of  democratic
government, so as to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.

These  principles   require   Parliament   to   strive   towards   promoting
constitutionalism and human rights,  as  embodied  in  inclusiveness,  being
accessible,  open,   responsive   and   participatory,   effectiveness   and
efficiency, transparency,  representivity  and  a  multiparty  parliamentary
system.
The Constitution committed  South  Africa  to  a  democratic  Government  by
committing it to constitutionalism  and  the  protection  and  promotion  of
human rights. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights not only entrenches civil  and
political rights, but requires a progressive  realisation  of  socioeconomic
rights such as the right to housing, health services and social security.

Section 7 of the  Bill  of  Rights  states  that  the  state  must  respect,
protect,  promote  and  fulfil  the  rights  in  the   Bill.   Thus,   state
institutions  such  as  parliaments  must  oversee   the   development   and
implementation of policy. They must  be  proactive  in  developing  a  human
rights culture and must be central agents in the realisation of  rights  and
the transformation of the country.

The challenge to transform society  suggests  the  need  to  transform  this
institution, Parliament. Yes, indeed, we can proudly say that major  strides
have been made in changing Parliament in order for it to become  a  tool  to
ensure transformation. To this end, a legislative framework in South  Africa
has since 1994 created an enabling environment for this strategic  direction
of the country.

Unjust legislation of the past has been revisited and amended  while  taking
into  consideration  equity  issues.  The  ANC-led  Parliament  has   passed
legislation such as the Employment Equity Act of 2000 and the  Promotion  of
Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act of 2000.

In most countries politics remains the domain of men.  This  is  evident  in
the numbers of  male  representatives  as  elected  members  of  Parliament.
Statistics indicate that women constitute a mere 14% of parliamentarians  at
world and regional levels. However, there is a  gradual  increase  of  women
parliamentarians in most countries.

South Africa is one of the countries that has made the greatest  strides  in
the Southern African region towards attaining the 30%  benchmark  for  women
parliamentarians by 2005 as set by the Commonwealth  heads  of  governments.
We in South Africa have already exceeded that.
Chapter  9,  or  section  181,  of  the  Constitution  establishes   various
institutions to aid and complement the work of Parliament in overseeing  the
work of the executive. These  institutions  are  called  state  institutions
supporting constitutional democracy. They  are  independent  and  impartial,
able to exercise their powers and perform their functions  without  fear  or
prejudice and are subject only to the Constitution and the law.

Some of the institutions created by the Constitution include the  Commission
on Gender Equality, the Human Rights Commission and the  South  African  Law
Commission. The Commission on Gender Equality in  particular  has  important
consequences for the protection of women's  constitutional  rights.  It  can
make recommendations to Parliament or  any  provincial  legislature  on  the
promotion of women's interests and can  investigate  violations  of  women's
rights.

The main objective of the Bill is to define and declare certain  powers  and
immunities of Parliament, provincial legislatures, members of  the  National
Assembly, delegates to the NCOP and members of provincial legislatures.

Parliamentary privileges are not a licence  for  members  of  Parliament  to
behave in ways that are unacceptable to  society  at  large.  Some  form  of
codification of these rights is therefore needed to,  firstly,  clarify  the
immunities, powers and privileges of members both internally and to  society
at large. Secondly, it is  needed  to  create  some  mechanisms  of  keeping
members accountable for the effective execution of their functions.

Specific protection provided for in Chapter 7 includes  liability  for  acts
committed under the authority of Parliament. No person is  liable  in  terms
of damages or otherwise for any act committed in good faith.

Secondly, with regard to the duty of criminal courts in respect to  members,
the courts have  a  duty  to  inform  Parliament  when  a  member  has  been
sentenced to a period of 12 months or more without the option of a fine.
Public access to Parliament has been greatly improved, though we still  face
practical challenges that prevent people from  getting  to  Parliament.  For
the first time in the history of this country,  the  public  has  mechanisms
through  which  they  can   interact   with   Parliament,   nationally   and
provincially.

Portfolio and standing committees have assumed new ways of functioning.  The
sittings are open to  the  public,  who  can  meaningfully  input  into  the
processes of formulating policies and making law.

The ANC has the best record of servicing  constituency  offices  across  the
country.

Yes, indeed, the tide has turned. [Applause.]

Mr D M  BAKKER:  Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.  I  have  been  involved  with
committees dealing with this Bill, first the Joint  Subcommittee  on  Powers
and Privileges and thereafter the Ad Hoc Committee on Powers and  Privileges
of Parliament, since 1998,  and  therefore  it  is  indeed  a  privilege  to
participate in this debate today and to support this Bill.

It has been a very long and sometimes very frustrating process, but, I  must
admit, also a very thorough process  which  will  always  serve  as  a  good
example on how Parliament -  and  not  a  state  department  -  can  prepare
legislation. We cannot debate and accept this legislation  without  properly
thanking several role-players who, over the years,  provided  us  with  very
valuable inputs with regard to this legislation.

When acknowledging role-players' contributions, one always runs the risk  of
excluding certain people, but we must think of valuable  contributions  made
by  professors  Murray  and  Soltau,  Mr  Fink  Haysom,  the  Human   Rights
Commission, our own law advisers  -  and  in  this  regard  specifically  Mr
Palmer - and the Research Department of Information Services.

Al die lede van die ad hoc komitee sal egter sekerlik met  my  saamstem  dat
ons baie groot dank verskuldig  is  aan  adv  Anton  Meyer  vir  die  uiters
waardevolle werk wat hy  ten  opsigte  van  hierdie  wetgewing  gedoen  het.
Telkemale moes hy maar weer teruggaan en  groot  dele  van  die  wetsontwerp
herformuleer. Hy het deurgaans verseker dat ons  as  komitee  op  die  regte
spoor bly en spesifiek toegesien dat  hierdie  wetgewing  in  ooreenstemming
met die Grondwet is.

In dié verband is dit belangrik om daarop te let dat hierdie  wetgewing  nie
'n herhaling of inperking van die voorregte oor vryheid van  spraak,  vervat
in artikel 58 van die Grondwet, behels nie. Dit  brei  egter  die  voorregte
uit sodat dit ook van toepassing sal wees in  'n  gesamentlike  sitting  van
die Nasionale Vergadering en die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies.

Hierdie spesifieke voorbeeld dien as 'n goeie bewys van die  belangrike  rol
wat adv Meyer in die komitee vervul het, en daarom kan ons nie anders as  om
ons opregte dank teenoor hom uit te spreek nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[All the members of the ad hoc  committee  will,  however,  certainly  agree
with me that we owe a great debt of gratitude to Adv  Anton  Meyer  for  the
very valuable work he did in regard to this legislation. Time and  again  he
had to go back and reformulate large parts of the  legislation.  He  ensured
throughout that we as a committee stayed on the right track and  saw  to  it
that this legislation was in accordance with the Constitution.

In this regard  it  is  important  to  take  into  consideration  that  this
legislation does not involve a repetition or restriction of  the  privileges
of freedom of speech, contained in section 58 of the Constitution.  However,
it expands the privileges also to be applicable in a joint  sitting  of  the
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.

This specific example serves as proof of the important role  played  by  Adv
Meyer in the committee, and therefore we  cannot  but  express  our  sincere
gratitude to him.]

In analysing this Bill the  question  should  be  asked  whether  this  Bill
adheres to certain  very  clear  and  established  principles.  Firstly,  it
adheres to the doctrine of separation  of  powers,  in  that  power  is  not
concentrated in one place and Parliament has the power to regulate  its  own
affairs without outside interference.

Secondly, democracy requires open and critical debate of matters  of  public
interest.  In  claiming  privileges,   Parliament   has   to   respect   the
Constitution, and this Bill further  ensures  that  open  debate  can  occur
freely.

Thirdly, this Bill clearly sets out what acts would constitute  contempt  of
Parliament. Broadly stated, it is contempt of Parliament to  act  in  a  way
that imputes the functioning of  Parliament.  Contempt,  specified  in  this
Bill, includes bribing or attempting  to  bribe  a  member  of  this  House;
failing to appear before a committee of the House on  request;  obstructing,
assaulting or threatening a member and disobeying the Rules  and  Orders  of
Parliament.
Die verslag van die ad hoc komitee wat deur hierdie Huis aanvaar  moet  word
vandag, dui egter 'n groot aantal aangeleenthede  aan  wat  nie  in  hierdie
wetsontwerp hanteer word nie en waaraan dringend  aandag  geskenk  sal  moet
word.

Hierdie wetsontwerp is nie die  gepaste  plek  vir  genoemde  aangeleenthede
nie, maar  die  Reëlskomitee  en  die  Grondwetlike  Hersieningskomitee  sal
dringend na  die  verslag  moet  kyk,  want  na  10  jaar  van  parlementêre
demokrasie is hierdie aangeleenthede uiters  belangrik  vir  die  behoorlike
funksionering  van  ons  Parlement.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The report of the ad hoc  committee  that  this  House  must  adopt  today,
points to a large number of matters which are not dealt with  in  this  Bill
and which should be addressed as a matter of urgency.

This Bill is not the appropriate place  for  these  aforementioned  matters,
but the Rules Committee and the Constitutional Review  Committee  will  have
to look at the report urgently, because  after  10  years  of  parliamentary
democracy these  matters  are  of  the  utmost  importance  for  the  proper
functioning of our Parliament.]

I am of the view that  this  Bill  represents  a  huge  improvement  on  the
present Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act of 1963 and is in line  with
the provisions of our democratic Constitution.

I have no reservations in supporting this Bill, but I need to point  out  to
members that there is no provision in this Bill for the power of members  of
Parliament to strike and, therefore, members  must  remember  that  being  a
member of Parliament still  remains  an  "essential  service"  in  terms  of
labour legislation, and hon members cannot strike. I thank you.

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker, members of Parliament,  my  colleagues,  as  has
already been said, this is one piece of legislation that is  very  important
in deepening our democracy continuously  to  offer  a  better  life  to  our
people.

The fact that we have been able to use the  Constitution  as  the  basis  to
entrench and empower ourselves, to improve our privileges and to improve  on
immunity means that the supremacy of the Constitution remains.  And  we,  as
the ANC, are quite committed to sustaining that.

But, there are things that have been said and there are things that we  need
to be able to learn from and that we need to be  able  to  see.  How  do  we
continue to strengthen ourselves? That is why from the side  of  ANC  it  is
being said that this Bill is about things that  are  fundamental,  that  run
across democracies and that have always been.

What happened in 1963 has happened before in the  1800s.  The  questions  of
freedom of speech of members  in  the  legislature  and  the  power  of  the
legislature to determine and control its own proceedings  are  some  of  the
issues that cause me to say that this is  a  re-entrenchment  of  democracy.
The ANC has not moved away from what it has  committed  itself  to  do,  and
what it has always been saying to the people, namely that, as  the  ANC,  we
are a democratic movement; as the ANC we are here to  continue  leading  our
people towards entrenching our democracy.

One of the things  that  we  continue  to  build  into  our  legislation  is
something that we would want to continue in our lives today, for within  the
Constitution there is the Bill of Rights and  these  are  the  things  that,
whenever you pause and think about freedom of speech, you have  to  continue
reflecting on so that you do not go wrong in the way you do your things.

Because, as the ANC, we continue to carry that responsibility. We, the  ones
sitting here, are the ones who have  really  written  the  Constitution.  We
have used our majority to be able to achieve the goals and to lay  down  the
foundations so that we would be able to build up  a  new  South  Africa,  in
which we would be able to give fundamental rights to our own people.

So, we will never be able to shy away from continuing to  use  our  majority
to build the present, because the ANC is not a new  movement.  It  was  born
and bred in 1912. A number of us have been taken from its history  and  what
we present here to you today and what we have been able to  get  written  up
in the Constitution, even in the Bill of Rights, talks of us as  a  movement
that has a proud history; as a movement that has been able  to  live  up  to
the needs of our people, and not just our own people.

We believe that we have been able to live within the  world  in  an  era  of
globalisation. We have taken the issues of globalisation upon our  shoulders
and have been able to present ourselves as a movement that  is  progressive,
and that is able to live within the times that we are confronted with.

We continually say that we will always reflect on what happened  during  the
apartheid era. There are issues that we have not been able to make  use  of,
but we are very glad that we have never followed the trend of the  apartheid
regime. With regard to the issue of using detention cells - which were  used
during the apartheid times whenever there was a disagreement  among  members
- we have not followed that route.

But, Madam Speaker, even in the way in which you have been  able  to  assist
us in creating and making sure that there is a balance between minority  and
majority parties, you have played a very significant role  in  assisting  in
the running of Parliament.  You  have  always  made  sure  that  we  do  not
suppress or kill the voice of the minorities. That is why,  with  regard  to
the balance you have created in Parliament, we say, as  the  ANC,  that  you
have not deviated from the responsibilities we have given ourselves,  namely
that we will always carry every South African along with  us.  Wherever,  or
to whichever party you belong, we have made it our  responsibility  that  we
will carry you along. That responsibility, Madam Speaker, as  the  Presiding
Officer, has been lying with you. You have been able to carry it  on  behalf
of the ANC.

One of the other things that have happened in this House, which  is  a  very
good trend is that we have been able to go to the Public Participation  Unit
in Parliament, just to see how the participation of  our  people  has  been.
Because in the era before we came to Parliament people were  not  coming  to
Parliament. But since we came to Parliament, it is quite  clear  that  there
has been quite a lot of participation by our people.

In  February  alone  they  issued  1  239  tickets  to  people  who  visited
Parliament. In March 1 009  tickets  were  issued  to  people  who  came  to
Parliament. In June about 3 255 were issued. Now, those  things  speak  very
loudly and quite clearly about how our people feel about the  work  that  we
are doing within the institution. At this time the figure stands at  14  447
people who have visited our Parliament. Those figures speak very loudly  and
clearly about our performance, and the vision and  the  views  that  we  are
expressing in this House.

We are proud of that type of response that we get from the public,  although
we do say, as the ANC, that we need to manage  heckling  amongst  ourselves.
We need to talk to each  other,  because  it  is  not  just  about  the  ANC
heckling the DA or the DA heckling the ANC. It is something that  the  broad
public is not impressed about. It is something that we need to  be  able  to
manage amongst ourselves and be able to do something about,  because  it  is
not selling us properly to the broad public outside. They are not  impressed
with what we do.

One of the other things that we want to continue talking about - and  it  is
quite  good  that  it  has  happened  within  this  institution  -  is   our
relationship  with  the  African  continent.  We   have   been   given   the
responsibility to go and assist in building the Pan-African  Parliament.  We
are quite serious within this movement; we are  quite  serious  within  this
Parliament.

It then shows how the ANC takes seriously the  fact  that  our  relationship
with the African continent had to be entrenched. We have shifted from  using
arms and guns to build our international relations. We have taken a  totally
different approach to be able to engage with the African continent. And  the
fact that we gave you that responsibility,  Madam  Speaker,  means  that  we
take the continent very seriously. It means that we want to make  sure  that
people  on  the  African  continent  understand  our  relationship,   as   a
Parliament, with them.

So, whatever the issues are in relation to  that  -  even  the  multilateral
structures that we are creating and the bilateral commissions  that  we  are
creating with the African continent - they all  lead  fundamentally  to  the
relationship we would want to continuously build  with  the  people  on  the
continent.

The increase in women's participation in the chairing of our committees  and
speaking in the Chamber, and the way we interact  with  the  NGOs  or  civil
society all make it clear to us that there  is  a  good  response  from  the
broader public outside. There is acceptance of the way we are doing our  job
here. There is an acceptance of how we are performing within Parliament.

A lot is being said about the ANC. That is why we say, when  speaking  about
the people's contract, that it is not simply an event that we  are  planning
with a view to the elections. It is something that we have been building  on
and that has been coming for years. How  do  we  continuously  keep  up  our
relationship with our people? How do we continue showing to our people  that
this is about them, and not just about the leaders they  have  appointed  or
annointed to come and lead them? It  is  a  responsibility  that  they  have
given us.

People know that  the  ANC  has  been  fighting  for  them  since  1912.  It
continuously reiterates that our contract with the  people  is  one  of  the
most important things which will always ensure that we  continuously  better
the lives of our people. We have been able to do so under  your  leadership,
Madam Speaker. We have been able to show how important it is to us,  as  the
ANC, that we continue relating to that particular relationship, and that  we
do not shy away from it.

I still want to come back to the hon Seaton and tell her that I  think  that
the President has quite clearly said this before  to  the  IFP.  It  is  not
going to be decided within  the  parliamentary  precinct  how  a  particular
party becomes a majority party, and how you balance the act  and  treat  the
minority parties. We do have a political responsibility that  we  take  upon
ourselves of engaging all South Africans to  participate  within  committees
and to share the vision with us.

We know  that  within  the  different  committees  we  do  not  become  mere
partisans. We sit down and exchange views because we as the ANC, as  members
of Parliament and legislators, know that it is in our interests to  be  able
to convince members in different parties to understand  the  vision  of  the
ANC and the commitment with which we  have  been  able  to  stabilise  South
Africa.

It is in that commitment and it is in that responsibility that we  say  that
we will continue to go and win the elections. We will  become  the  majority
party, but we will engage you and give  you  as  the  minority  parties  the
necessary space. It has been proven over this past 10  years  that  we  have
given the minority parties opportunities, regardless of how small they  are.
Even when it comes to interpellations, even  today,  we  were  showing  that
commitment by asking and pointing out that there are parties that have  even
been able to declare their votes. That  means  that  the  ANC  carried  that
commitment and we understand our responsibility.

But it is going to be very difficult to tell  the  public  outside:  Do  not
vote for the ANC so that we do not became the majority party. That is  going
to be difficult because the majority of people are in  love  with  the  ANC.
They like it and they will always vote for it, and that is the passion  that
we carry with that responsibility. We would have  loved  to  stop  them  and
say: No, no; do not vote for us. It is not going to work for democracy.  But
within democracy there are opportunities. We should go and talk  about  your
party and let it be understood by the people.

The additional votes they give  us  will  allow  us  to  continue  with  the
majority vote which we have had since 1999. That majority vote we  have  not
used to abuse the Constitution, or to change it  the  way  people  predicted
that  we  would  be  changing  the  Constitution.  We  say  that  we  are  a
responsible political party. We do take responsible decisions  and  we  will
continue to do  so.  We  will  be  able  to  carry  you  along.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Deputy Chair, I think the short answer to  that  long
speech is to vote for the  DA.  The  adoption  of  this  Bill  today  leaves
several issues, in  fact,  no  less  than  seven,  which  in  terms  of  the
recommendations  contained  in  the  report  need  to  be  referred  to  the
respective Rules committees for further attention.

Some of the particular issues referred to the  Rules  committees  relate  to
the degree of limitation on the members' freedom of speech, the adoption  of
a  procedure  setting  out  the  relevant  Rules  and  inquiries,  with  the
reflections of  another  House  or  legislature,  and  when  the  deliberate
misleading of the House or committee  should  be  declared  a  contempt.  In
addition thereto, issues relating to the provision on loss of membership  or
other issues relating to witness  fees  and  the  procedure  for  initiating
disciplinary action against a member, still need to be dealt with.

Two particular issues  have  been  referred  to  the  Constitutional  Review
Committee, due to the fact that no specific provision has been made  in  the
Constitution for freedom of speech in the joint sittings of the  two  Houses
of Parliament. The lack of a provision in  the  Constitution  for  a  Deputy
Minister, who is not a member of Parliament, to have freedom of speech in  a
joint committee, has also been referred.

Separate  legislation  is  also  required  relating   to   the   Pan-African
Parliament and the SADC Parliament Forum.

It is clear that the Bill provides for the  application  of  legislation  to
provincial legislatures, forcing legislatures to  establish  how  far  their
own legislation and  rules  need  to  be  adopted  or  supplemented.  It  is
therefore definitely not correct to labour under the misconception that  the
Bill deals with all issues relating to the powers and privileges of  members
of Parliament.

A  few  important  issues  need  to  be  noted.  The  Bill  allocates  equal
responsibilities and duties to the Speaker of the National Assembly and  the
Chairperson of the NCOP, ensuring that both officials play  a  central  role
in the affairs of Parliament.

One of the more contentious issues in the Bill relates to clause  14,  which
states that a House or a committee requires that  anything  be  verified  or
otherwise ascertained by oral  examination.  The  person  presiding  at  the
inquiry may examine that person  or  require  that  person  to  produce  any
document in the person's possession or custody or under his or  her  control
which may have a bearing on the subject  of  the  inquiry,  subject  to  any
limitation provided for in the Standing Rules.

The law regarding privilege, as applicable to a  witness  summoned  to  give
evidence or to produce a document before the High  Court  of  South  Africa,
applies to the examination of a person. An obligation is placed on a  person
who is being examined under oath or affirmation in that he may  be  required
- and that being the operative word - to answer any question  being  put  to
him or her in connection with the subject of the inquiry and to produce  any
document that he or she is required to produce, despite the  fact  that  the
answer or document will incriminate him or her, or attempt to expose him  or
her to criminal or civil proceedings or damages. These are  the  words  that
may be required to indicate the extent of the powers of  the  committee  and
compel the witness to testify and answer questions, despite  the  fact  that
such an answer or document will tend to incriminate him or her.

The clause limits an important right as contained in  the  Bill  of  Rights,
namely the right to remain silent. However, we are of the view  that  it  is
important for the committee to be able to compel the  witness  to  answer  a
question in certain circumstances, despite the fact that such an  answer  or
document  might  incriminate  him.  Any  evidence  given   under   oath   or
affirmation by a person before a House or a committee may, however,  not  be
used against that person in any court or place  outside  Parliament,  except
in criminal proceedings  where  the  person  concerned  faces  a  charge  of
perjury.

The Bill furthermore places a duty on criminal  courts  having  convicted  a
member of Parliament of an offence and having sentenced him or her  to  more
that 12 months' imprisonment without the option of a  fine,  to  inform  the
Speaker or Chairperson of  the  nature  of  the  offence  and  the  sentence
imposed.

One of the more interesting developments which have been introduced is  that
a person, other than a member  of  Parliament,  who  feels  aggrieved  by  a
statement or remark made by a member or a witness in or before  a  House  or
committee about that person, may submit a written request to  the  secretary
to the relevant committee to have a response recorded.

The committee must consider such a request and,  if  approved,  publish  the
response of the person in the appropriate parliamentary  paper.  This  would
enable a member of the public, for instance, to  have  his  view  stated  in
response to a remark in a  House  of  Parliament  or  a  committee,  thereby
affording the member a right of reply.

Despite the identified shortcomings in the Bill, the DA considers  the  Bill
a step forward towards regulating the conduct of members  in  Parliament.  I
thank you.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I just,  in  concluding  this
debate, say to Mrs Seaton: You don't have to be so negative.  We  appreciate
your concerns, but  I  think  you  are  being  unnecessarily  negative.  You
referred to the use of the word "improper". I don't think  one  should  look
at it in isolation. It is used  in  a  sentence  in  which  you  talk  about
intimidation, force, insult, threat of any kind or inducement. So  there  is
some context as to how the word "improper" is being used.

I also do not think it is fair to attempt to pre-empt the Rules of the  next
Parliament in  terms  of  the  composition  of  the  committee  of  inquiry,
although one cannot  ignore  the  reality  of  our  system  of  proportional
representation. That's why we are out there campaigning at the moment.

I am also confident that the next Parliament will  deal  speedily  with  the
matters needed to implement this Bill successfully. This Bill is the  result
of, as has been said by others, many consultations,  discussions  and  other
forms of input from way back to 1997. We have gone through 14 drafts, or  at
least 14 drafts, over the past seven years.

One of the people involved since then until now has been  Adv  Anton  Meyer,
the former law adviser to Parliament and drafter of this Bill. I would  like
to thank him for his willingness at all times, and often  at  short  notice,
to make himself available both to me and to the committee.

Our thanks also go to Adv Adhikarie at Parliament's legal services,  and  to
Prof  Christina  Murray.  Then,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  think   it   is
appropriate that both you and the  Speaker,  who  have  presided  over  this
debate, also be thanked, as well as the other presiding officers  for  their
input and assistance.

Mr Eglin, it was indeed a pleasure serving with you; being able to tap  into
your experience and your intellect. I wish you well in your  retirement.  To
all members of this committee: Thank you very much for  your  contributions.
To all those of you who are not returning or retiring - forgive me  for  not
speaking about pensions today; we'll do that another day  -  good  luck  and
Godspeed. Can I also say thank you very much to all the  parties  for  their
unanimous support of this Bill. I hereby wholeheartedly add my  support  and
commend the Bill to the House. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                              PUBLIC AUDIT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Mr V G SMITH: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC's support for the  Public  Audit
Bill indicates the degree  of  importance  that  we  attach  to  matters  of
prudent  financial  management,  good  governance  and  the  elimination  of
corruption and wastage in Government and the private sector.

Two weeks ago, President  Mbeki  challenged  the  national,  provincial  and
local legislatures to answer the question as to  whether  they  have  passed
the acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes they  elaborated  on,  the
Government institutions they created and the legislation they  adopted.  Are
we, by passing this Bill contributing towards  the  creation  of  a  people-
centred society, thus expanding the frontiers of human  fulfilment  and  the
continued extension of the frontiers of freedom? In  our  humble  view,  the
answer to all these questions is:  yes.  And  therefore,  by  extension,  we
believe that we are well on track towards passing the acid test  alluded  to
by President Mandela a decade ago.

The ANC's 2004 manifesto informs South Africans that:


  Systems have been put in place to expose and punish  corruption  both  in
  Government and in the private sector.

The manifesto goes on to say that:


  80% of corruption cases in Government reported in the media are  actually
  first uncovered by Government itself. In the private  sector,  laws  have
  been introduced to prevent corruption being swept under the carpet.

The Public Audit Bill before this House for adoption today  is  yet  another
step towards realising the ANC's vision of creating a better  life  for  all
by decisively dealing with crime, corruption  and  financial  mismanagement.
At our national policy conference in May  1992,  we  adopted  the  ready-to-
govern policy guidelines.  Already  at  that  stage,  even  before  assuming
political power,  we  were  in  agreement,  as  the  ANC  and  our  alliance
partners, that the Public  Service  must  be  based  on  the  principles  of
representivity, impartiality  and  accountability.  At  that  conference  we
resolved that new institutions would be  developed  to  improve  efficiency,
transparency  and  accountability   in   Government   spending.   One   such
institution, is the Office of the Auditor-General.

Informed by that resolution, the ANC  Government,  in  consciously  pursuing
the policy of further strengthening the operations of  this  office,  is  in
total support of the Bill being adopted by the House. The Public Audit  Bill
is not an end in itself, but rather a means towards addressing  the  problem
of those in the  Public  Service  who  see  themselves  as  pen-pushers  and
guardians of rubber stamps. Some are  thieves,  intent  on  self-enrichment;
some are bureaucrats who think they have the  vision  of  Batho  Pele;  some
come to work as late as possible, work as little as possible and  knock  off
as early as possible, as articulated in the state of the nation address  two
weeks ago.

At our Stellenbosch conference in 2002,  we  resolved  that  the  ANC  would
undertake a comprehensive assessment  of  institutions  enhancing  democracy
and  transformation,  with  regard  to   their   mandates,   resources   and
functioning in order that their capacity be maximised. We  further  resolved
to create public awareness of the objectives of these institutions  so  that
they are optimally utilised. It is with this background that we applied  our
minds when considering the additional powers given  to  the  Auditor-General
within this Bill. The primary objective of the Auditor-General,  as  we  see
it, is to  expose  corruption  and  mismanagement  of  public  resources  by
subjecting state-funded institutions and departments to annual audits.

Powers such as search and seizure, not normally catered for in the  ordinary
course of the auditing function, are now being addressed in  section  15  of
this Bill. This Bill also obliges Parliament to finalise  the  establishment
of an oversight mechanism for  the  Auditor-General  in  line  with  section
181(5) of  our  Constitution.  The  establishment  and  finalisation  of  an
appropriate oversight mechanism will see our Stellenbosch  resolution,  that
states that Parliament  or  legislatures  and  municipalities  must  improve
their capacity to exercise their constitutional oversight  role,  translated
from mere theory into practice.

Our commitment as the ANC to continuously  work  to  improve  accountability
and oversight, as stated in the 8 January 2003 statement,  demands  that  we
ensure that the state machinery functions properly and carries out its  task
effectively and efficiently. We must  also  intensify  our  offence  against
corruption within the public sector. The introduction and final adoption  of
the Public Audit Bill seeks to do just that.

In the 1980s the Exchequer and Audit Act governed  the  Auditor-General  and
the functions of his office. In 1989 the Auditor-General  Act  was  adopted.
However, the Auditor-General was still an  employee  of  the  Department  of
State Expenditure and, therefore, the concept of independence of the  office
was nonexistent.  The  Audit  Arrangements  Act  of  1992  brought  with  it
improvements, both in the quality of audit work  and  in  transparency,  but
still more needed to be done.

If we are to do an honest review today of  how  far  we  have  travelled  in
terms of improving good  governance  and  eliminating  corruption,  we  will
without any  fear  of  contradiction  be  able  to  say  that,  without  the
necessary independence, the Auditor-General, historically, was a  nice-  to-
have. Today the same cannot be said of the Office  of  the  Auditor-General.
Historically, the general public was never certain as to  how  public  funds
were being spent,  because  the  Auditor-General's  ability  to  express  an
opinion on whether the executive exercised prudent financial management  and
good governance practices was severely hampered by the lack of  independence
of the Auditor-General from the very executive that he was meant  to  audit.
Today, with the introduction of this Bill, we seek not  only  to  right  the
wrongs of the past, but also to strengthen and protect  the  Office  of  the
Auditor-General and, thereby, safeguard our democracy.

In conclusion, I would  like  to  thank  all  the  members  of  the  ad  hoc
committee for their support and their diligence in ensuring that  this  Bill
reached the point that it is at today, and for the manner in which  we  were
able to discuss and debate matters that might not necessarily have been  our
first choice and, eventually, come up with the product that  we  believe  is
the best that could have been presented  to  this  House.  As  the  ANC,  we
support the adoption of the Public Audit Bill. Thank you very much.

Mr B G BELL: Madam Deputy Speaker and fellow members of  Parliament,  it  is
my duty to speak on behalf of the DA on the passing  by  Parliament  of  the
Public Audit Bill. This Bill will give  effect  to  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution, establishing and assigning functions  to  an  Auditor-General,
to provide for the auditing of institutions in the public sector.

The Bill will replace the existing  Auditor-General  Act  of  1995  and  the
Audit Arrangements Act of 1992, and repeal certain sections  of  the  Public
Finance Management Act,  Act  1  of  1999.  The  Bill  encapsulates  certain
requirements of the Public Finance Management Act and the Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Act.

The Bill calls  for  the  establishment  of  a  committee  of  the  National
Assembly to oversee the Auditor-General, as envisaged in  the  Constitution.
This committee will replace the existing Audit Commission. It is  considered
essential that the oversight committee established be a dedicated  committee
to the Auditor-General.

The functions of the Auditor-General are more technically specific than  any
other of the Chapter 9 bodies and,  therefore,  it  is  desirable  that  the
committee oversees only the Auditor-General. As  the  only  Chapter  9  body
that  does  not  receive  funds  through  any  Vote,  there  are  particular
oversight requirements regarding its income and expenditure.

The Bill will  instruct  the  Auditor-General  to  audit  all  national  and
provincial  departments,  all  municipalities,  parliaments  and   municipal
entities. This will include all consolidated accounts of these  bodies.  The
Bill will allow the Auditor-General  to  choose  not  to  audit  any  public
entity, but will have definite responsibilities concerning  the  appointment
and control of the private audit firms used  by  these  entities.  The  Bill
will restrict the appointed auditors of public entities  from  carrying  out
any other functions for the auditee, without the knowledge of  the  Auditor-
General.

Section 22 of this Bill allows the Auditor-General to consult  the  Minister
responsible with regard  to  the  Security  Services  Special  Account,  the
Defence Special Account and/or the Secret  Services  Act.  In  reporting  on
matters on the basis of national interest, the Auditor-General  may  exclude
confidential, secret  or  classified  details  on  written  request  by  the
Minister.

The Auditor-General, in turn, must state in the audit  report  that  certain
details have been excluded. The National Assembly,  through  its  committee,
must be in the position to examine  these  details  to  meet  the  oversight
responsibility of Parliament.

Although we had misgivings about the necessity of this  clause,  as  we  had
proposed that it be deleted from the Bill  because  we  are  firmly  of  the
opinion that  the  Auditor-General  should  not  be  able  to  withhold  any
information during  an  audit  investigation,  the  DA  will,  nevertheless,
support the Bill.

The Auditor-General  must  report  on  findings  during  the  audit  of  any
fruitless,  irregular,  wasteful  or  unauthorised  expenditure  within  the
meaning of the PFMA, or any other irregular conduct,  activity  or  criminal
conduct relating to the financial affairs of any department or account.

Critical to this legislation is the obligation  on  the  Auditor-General  to
report to Parliament even if  there  is  an  element  of  national  interest
involved. This is crucial. The Auditor-General has no right to withhold  any
information.

This Bill gives the Auditor-General the right,  after  attaining  a  warrant
from either a judge or a magistrate, of search and seizure.  It  was  agreed
to that for the Auditor-General to  carry  out  his  functions  effectively,
this right should be granted.

As this will be my last speech in this House, as  I  will  be  retiring  and
will not be returning after  the  elections,  I  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to thank all members that I've come into contact with  over  the
last five years. We have differed politically, but I  felt,  at  all  times,
that I was received courteously and I  have  enjoyed  the  association  with
this Parliament.

I trust that, when the new members return in April, my party, the  DA,  will
have a much larger section of the seating in this House, and  that  it  will
not be necessary for the ANC to overflow into the opposite  benches,  as  is
presently the case. [Interjections.] South Africa deserves better.

In conclusion, the DA will support the Public  Audit  Bill.  Thank  you  for
listening to me. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy Speaker, my party would just  like  to  wish  the
hon Brian Bell well, and say it's been our  pleasure  to  count  on  him  in
committees. We believe  that  this  is  the  second  time  he's  going  into
retirement, and so we hope this time it is as enjoyable as the first time.

The timing of the Public Audit Bill is fortuitous. At a time when the  roles
of all parties in the general corporate governance  scheme  of  things  have
been brought under question and review throughout an array of  international
corporate scandals, the role of the  external  auditor,  in  particular,  is
being given greater definition.

Through its  provisions  concerning  functions,  structures,  processes  and
arrangements, this Bill has acknowledged this recent rethink, and  the  Bill
acknowledges the requirements of our Constitution, which had already,  in  a
remarkable way, captured the key issues being dealt with  around  the  world
today.

In short, these main issues are, firstly, the independence of  the  external
auditor, the Auditor-General, which  is  essentially  an  independence  from
management, which is the executive Government; secondly, the  accountability
and reporting responsibilities of the Auditor-General to the board, in  this
case the National  Assembly;  and  thirdly,  the  unambiguous  role  of  the
external auditor, which is to audit,  meaning  strict  limitation  on  other
services to auditees.

The Bill and the process, as suggested by the hon Smith, were not without  a
few matters of contention, and there are four of these that I would like  to
mention. The first is the issue of the  Auditor-General  providing  services
other than auditing  and,  thus,  getting  into  the  conflict  of  interest
predicament seen in Enron and  other  cases  internationally.  Here,  clause
5(1) allows the Auditor-General to provide a service,  ``commonly  performed
by  a  supreme  audit  institution''.  Clearly,   the   stricture   of   our
Constitution does not necessarily allow this degree of scope.

The second matter is clause 29(3), which we  welcome,  as  it  insists  that
special audit reports be submitted simultaneously to the  executive  and  to
the legislature, thus preventing a repeat of the arms  deal  special  report
debacle. In other words, if it's broken, fix it.

The third matter is the necessity of  the  search  and  seizure  powers,  in
clause 15 and 16, which are questionable, as the Auditor-General can  easily
work  through  other  criminal  investigative   bodies   which   have   been
established, in the rare instances of this being required.  As  was  pointed
out by the ANC, as there are almost a dozen other  bodies  which  have  also
been given such powers, it was difficult to  deny  the  Auditor-General  his
wish for these powers. However, let's just hope that the  justice  committee
will review the situation at some stage in the new Parliament, as  I'm  sure
the nature of our democracy does not  really  invite  the  proliferation  of
such invasive powers across so many state institutions.

Finally, we have clause 22, which we also believe should not  have  been  in
the Bill. This is a clause  that  conspires  to  defeat  the  constitutional
principles  of  the  Auditor-General,  the  independence  of   parliamentary
oversight  and  executive  accountability.   Further,   nowhere   does   the
Constitution give the Auditor-General this discretion, once being  convinced
by the executive, to leave findings out of this report that  could,  in  any
way, fit the ambiguous definition of the national  interest,  especially  in
so far as these might concern arms trade activities.

All the audit report now has to say is that  findings  have  been  excluded,
with no details whatsoever in the actual report  on  the  exclusion.  It  is
silly, especially  given  past  experiences,  to  think  that  the  Standing
Committee on  Public  Accounts  will  challenge  the  executive's  wish  for
secrecy and call upon  the  Auditor-General  to  spill  the  beans  in  such
instances.

I was very unhappy that the  Auditor-General,  as  an  individual,  can  now
effectively decide what findings Parliament may or may  not  know  about  in
such instances. Notwithstanding these misgivings, the IFP supports the  Bill
on the overwhelming balance of its positive features  and,  because  of  the
important certainty that it brings to the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General,
this Bill should not be delayed by leaving it to the new  Parliament,  which
would obviously mean that  it  would  have  to  engage  the  Bill  from  the
beginning, once again.

Relatedly, and  also  in  support  of  the  previous  speaker,  we  want  to
emphasise the ad hoc committee's recommendation  that  the  next  Parliament
urgently needs to  replace  the  existing  Audit  Commission  with  the  new
National Assembly oversight committee, as per clause 10 of the Bill  and  as
instructed by sections 55(2) and 181(5) of the Constitution.

Mr P A GERBER: Madam Speaker, I stumbled across an old history book at  home
the other day and it  is  called   The  Cambridge  History  of  the  British
Empire, printed in 1936, a couple of years after Mr Colin Eglin was born.

I want to read something about the early history of the settlers  and  if  I
can quote something here:


  In 1685 Commissioner-General Hendrik Adriaan Van Rheede  tot  Drakenstein
  arrived at the Cape on a special mission. He had been  appointed  by  the
  Here XVII in the previous year and armed with full authority to  look  at
  the growing corruption amongst the officials  from  the  Governor-General
  downwards.

So, corruption and monkey business by officials are not new in South  Africa
and did not start in 1994. In fact, they have been here for centuries.

One can never ask too many questions when one works with taxpayers' money  -
never, ever. We should not always think that we are spending  the  taxes  of
rich people. When the old pensioner lady in a tin shack goes to  buy  a  few
groceries with her monthly old age pension, a little bit of  that  money  is
also used to pay some tax on it.

It is the proper spending of her little bit of tax and  that  of  the  other
millions in her position that we need to  take  extra  care  of.  We  should
ensure that she gets value for money for the little  bit  of  tax  that  she
does pay.

Die  ouditeur-generaal  doen  in  die  meeste  gevalle  finansiële  nadoodse
ondersoeke. [The Auditor-General  undertakes  financial  autopsies  in  most
cases.]

The Auditor-General in most cases deals  with  financial  postmortems.  Now,
the hon Mr Mike Ellis will know more of this as he owns a  funeral  parlour.
In other words,  he  starts  operating  after  the  accident  has  happened.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.] This time delay is a huge  frustration  to  the
Auditor-General, as it is to Scopa.

In many cases of financial mismanagement  or  misconduct  the  culprits  get
away under the three-year term of office Prescription  Act.  In  many  cases
certain officials are using delaying tactics or  develop  instant  overnight
Alzheimer's disease. We need the  Auditor-General  to  be  able  to  receive
early warning signals regarding mismanagement  so  as  to  take  pre-emptive
steps to prevent financial mismanagement.

The Act will do exactly that. The  Act  will  also  remove  all  uncertainty
regarding access to financial information. Over the past four years we  have
had the  intolerable  and  bizarre  situation  of  the  parastatal  Transnet
refusing  to  give  financial  information  to  the  Auditor-General  as  he
required.

Both the Auditor-General and Transnet got legal advice, both  at  taxpayers'
cost, and eventually Transnet agreed to supply the information, and  in  the
process the money-losing contract was cancelled by  Transnet  -  saving  the
taxpayer millions.

It is therefore true that there will be better and  more  focused  attention
on the financial affairs of parastatals as it is contained in the  Act.  The
shares of parastatals owned by the  state  belong  to  the  taxpayer,  which
includes the pensioner in the tin shack.

The Auditor-General  has  also  sent  a  message  to  parastatals  that  the
honeymoon is over. Clause 16 deals with the powers  of  the  Auditor-General
regarding search and seizure. It is high  time  these  powers  were  clearly
spelt out and bestowed upon the Auditor-General.

It is unthinkable that a traffic officer can  have  these  powers  in  South
Africa but  not  the  Auditor-General.  In  this  world  of  voice-activated
overseas bank accounts and 24 different bank account numbers every  hour  in
one day, it is getting increasingly difficult to stamp  out  corruption.  If
you do not follow a paper trail in following up  corruption  you  are  going
nowhere, and that is why it is so important to empower  the  Auditor-General
with these powers.

Another feature of this Act is that the  Auditor-General  in  Clause  5  can
carry out special investigations and special orders  of  any  matter  as  he
sees fit. This is the way to go as many of  the  auditor-generals  of  other
countries have already pioneered this route. In India,  the  auditor-general
recently did a special audit on  the  import  of  worm-infested  grains.  In
Australia the auditor-general did an audit  as  to  whether  the  state  got
value for money in disposing of its shares in a bank. I can  think  of  many
such potential audits  in  South  Africa.  For  example,  it  will  be  very
interesting to know, via such an Auditor-General special audit, whether  the
harvesting of abalone or perlemoen is worth all the effort that we put  into
it.

Nowhere in South Africa can you buy a tin of abalone. Everything  is  canned
here and exported to where  it  retails  at  nearly  R2  000  per  kilogram.
Meanwhile the amount of money with regard to the exported  tins  of  abalone
returning to South Africa is definitely not a tenth of the retail price.

Then, only after the company's local production  cost  has  been  subtracted
can Sars establish if they are  in  line  for  some  tax  under  the  income
declared. After that has been  established  we  still  need  to  deduct  the
taxpayers' money used to police the coasts and to police the  smugglers  and
the taxpayers, and the money used to pay and  fund  special  courts  dealing
with abalone smugglers, plus the costs of the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism officials.

A special Auditor-General's audit on this issue might have very  interesting
findings. I trust that our Auditor-General  Shauket  Fakie  will,  with  all
these new powers, now be able to continue to produce  powerful  prima  facie
audit reports.

I want to end my speech by saluting two giants for the incredible role  they
have played in Scopa and the select committee over the past decade. When  we
walked in here in June 1999 we were asked to  indicate  on  which  portfolio
committees we wanted to serve. I do not know of any of the  new  members  of
Parliament that indicated that they wanted to serve on Scopa.

When I was informed that I had to serve as  a  member  of  Scopa,  I  really
thought it was a  misunderstanding,  or  that  I  was  to  be  punished  for
something in my past. When I asked my other  new  ANC  colleagues  on  Scopa
whether they asked to be on Scopa, they also said  that  they  were  in  the
same boat. Fortunately there were the hon  Billy  Nair  and  the  hon  Laloo
Chiba. When you develop a shopping centre or a big property project,  it  is
a priority to get an anchor tenant or two. Now the hon Billy  Nair  and  hon
Laloo Chiba have been the anchor tenants of Scopa. [Applause.]

For the past five  years  their  collective  wisdom  has  kept  Scopa  going
through five very tough and difficult years.  It  has  been  an  honour  and
privilege to serve under your guidance and your experience. From all  of  us
at Scopa and the Auditor-General's office, thank you  very  much  and  hamba
kahle [go well]. [Applause.]

Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I also want to add my voice to that  of  Pierre
Gerber in highlighting the role played by the hon Billy  Nair  and  the  hon
Laloo Chiba these past 10 years in strengthening Scopa  and  their  role  in
it, and also the role of Brian in that regard.

Mr M J ELLIS: Why don't they mention your name?
Mr F BEUKMAN: The adoption of the Public  Audit  Bill  by  Parliament  is  a
further indication that the role of the Auditor-General  as  an  independent
Chapter 9 institution is being strengthened. However,  it  also  creates  an
opportunity  for  Parliament  to  strengthen  oversight  over  the  Auditor-
General.

The third term of a democratic Parliament will offer an opportunity  to  the
legislature to consider and refine oversight mechanisms for  the  Chapter  9
institutions. The status and the role of Chapter 9  institutions  should  be
protected. We in the NNP believe that the framework of the legislature  will
ensure that accountability is  given  its  rightful  place  in  the  broader
debate on oversight and accountability.

In contrast with  the  position  in  other  jurisdictions  like  the  United
Kingdom, the Auditor-General is not an official of Parliament.  Section  181
is very clear: The Auditor-General is independent and subject  only  to  the
Constitution and the law.

The replacement of the current audit  commission  by  a  parliamentary  peer
mechanism is an indication that the  role  of  Parliament  as  an  oversight
institution is growing in terms of status and responsibility.

Daar kan seer sekerlik oor artikel 22 gedebatteer word. Feit  is,  in  enige
konstitusionele en veelpartydemokrasie sal  daar  beperkings  wees  oor  die
aard en omvang van operasionele inligting. Ons is van  mening  dat  dit  die
onus op die  Ouditeur-generaal  plaas  wat  betref  sy  integriteit  en  die
uitvoering van die wet. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[One could most certainly debate section 22. Fact is, in any  constitutional
and multiparty democracy there will be limitations on the nature  and  scope
of operational information. It is our contention that the  onus  rests  with
the Auditor-General in terms of his integrity and the implementation of  the
legislation.]

We believe that the duty of the  Auditor-General  to  report  on  fruitless,
wasteful and irregular expenditure will  ensure  that  the  foundations  and
principles of the  PFMA  are  not  negated  and  compromised.  The  role  of
Parliament in terms of monitoring and scrutinising  executive  action  will,
however, be prominent.

Dit is in belang van  goeie  regering  dat  die  Ouditeur-generaal  oor  die
vermoë en bevoegdhede beskik om sy amp na  behore  te  verrig.  Ons  is  van
mening dat artikel 29 van dié wet juis daardie geleentheid vir hom  skep  om
sy rol om spesiale oudits te mag doen, te versterk. Kortliks: Die NNP  steun
hierdie wet. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is in the interests of good governance  that  the  Auditor-General  will
have the abilities and powers to fulfil his duty properly.  We  are  of  the
opinion that section 29 of this Act does indeed create the  opportunity  for
him to strengthen his position so that he can undertake special  audits.  In
short: The NNP supports this Bill.]
I also want to extend my thanks to the  chairperson  of  the  committee,  Mr
Vincent Smith, for his role. He had a  very  difficult  time  limitation  in
executing the role of the committee. I also  wish  to  thank  the  committee
secretary, Mr Lungisile Pakathi, for his role.

Mr M H STEELE: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, none  of  the  speakers
today has referred to an hon Minister in connection with this Bill. This  is
because the Constitution of 1996 places the Office  of  the  Auditor-General
in a special category of Chapter 9 institutions  which  are  accountable  to
this House directly.

The issue of accountability has been central to the discussions  of  the  ad
hoc committee charged with the preparations of this Bill. With apologies  to
the pronunciation experts who have a superior classical  education,  Juvenal
put it thus: Quis custodiet ipsos  custodes?  Or,  loosely  translated:  Who
guards the guardians?

In this  context,  the  Constitution  in  section  181  establishes  various
institutions  designed  to  strengthen  constitutional  democracy   in   the
Republic. One of these entities is the Office of the Auditor-General,  whose
powers and functions are described in section 188 of  the  Constitution  and
in more detail in sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.

My colleague, the hon Bell, has already described the constitutional  issues
which lay behind the formulations of sections 16 and 22  of  this  Bill.  I,
however, would like to focus on section 10, subsection 3 of the Bill,  which
requires the National Assembly to provide a mechanism to maintain  oversight
over  the   Auditor-General.   This   subsection   gives   effect   to   the
constitutional provision which empowers the  National  Assembly  to  provide
such oversight mechanisms.

To return, though, to the concerns of Juvenal, if the Auditor-General  is  a
duly appointed guard of public  accounts,  then  this  oversight  mechanism,
still, will have to be created to be the guardian of their office. As  such,
this committee will be acting in the  names  of  all  the  members  of  this
House,  for,  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,   the   Auditor-General   is
accountable to the National Assembly, and no one else,  and  especially  not
to members of the executive.

So, who will guard the guardians? The  Auditor-General's  office  will  have
formidable powers, though  perhaps  fewer  than  were  originally  proposed.
However, his work will be of little value and effect if we, in the  National
Assembly, do not appoint suitable guardians to exercise oversight  over  our
own guards. Where there is corruption  or  a  waste  of  public  funds,  the
people who elected us will hold us directly accountable,  not  the  Auditor-
General or the officials concerned.

I would like to  acknowledge  the  work  done  by  the  ad  hoc  committee's
chairperson, the  hon  Vincent  Smith,  in  leading  us  all  to  this  very
constructive result, which is the Bill before us. We have discovered,  as  a
committee, an unusual degree  of  solidarity  across  party  lines,  perhaps
because we all face the collective power of the executive.
I must also pay tribute to the work of the Auditor-General's  staff,  and  I
see he has a representative sitting in the public gallery, and that  of  the
parliamentary legal advisers, and to members  of  the  Audit  Committee  for
their preparation of the draft Bill.

In supporting this Bill, the DA does not necessarily believe it will be  the
final word. Circumstances will evolve, and with them the  need  to  consider
afresh how effective we are being in guarding the guardians. The success  or
failure of the proposed oversight mechanism  will  determine  how  effective
the National Assembly is at discharging its accountability functions.  Thank
you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Mr M A TARR: Madam Speaker, it's very difficult being the  last  speaker  of
the day, particularly on a Bill which all parties are supporting;  and  when
most members are  looking  forward  to  leaving.  As  last  speaker,  I  was
expected to deal with any issues  which  arose,  particularly  those  coming
from the hon member Woods and the hon member Bell, but they were  remarkably
subdued on some issues that I thought they would  deal  with.  Perhaps  they
are reserving their energies for the election task that lies ahead.

I must comment on what the hon Bell said. We wish him all the best for  when
he leaves, but I think it is a really long shot to expect  more  members  in
his benches next time. [Interjections.] Earlier  today,  I  had  a  look  at
those benches over there and, of course, there was a flashback  to  the  old
days, and I looked over there and thought  that's  the  old  NP.  It  was  a
horrible, horrible  feeling.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  Now,  I  really
can't even imagine what it would be like to  even  see  more  of  them  over
there. [Interjections.] It's absolutely true,  and  you  know  it.  Look  at
them. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr M A TARR: There were three issues raised by the hon Woods. There was  the
issue of search and seizure, in sections 15 and 16,  and  he  will  remember
that we did, at one  stage,  drop  that  section  and  then,  later  on,  in
response   to   pleas   from   the   Auditor-General,   we   actually    ...
[Interjections.] Madam Deputy Speaker, can you please deal with that  member
over there. He's continuously making comments.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon  member,  just  continue  with  your  speech.
Leave  the  hon  member  to  exercise  his  right  to   leave   the   House.
[Interjections.]

Mr M  A  TARR:  Madam  Speaker,  he  does  not  have  a  mind  to  exercise.
[Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member!

Mr M A TARR: Mr Woods will know that, then, because of representations  from
the Auditor-General, it was to decided to  reintroduce  those  two  clauses.
Then, on the issue of special  audits,  there  are  provisions  for  special
audits in many countries. For example,  in  Australia,  special  audits  are
often carried out, especially in the field of  value  for  money.  So,  yes,
there could be conflicts of interests and, yes, it's probably  something  we
need to look at and guard against.

Then, finally, is the issue of clause 22, with regard  to  which  there  was
unanimous agreement from the committee that there could be circumstances  in
which it would be prejudicial to the country were certain information to  be
made available to the world at large via an audit report. There was also  an
agreement that Parliament should, by some mechanism created  by  Parliament,
still  be  able  to  exercise  an  oversight   function   and   retain   the
confidentiality of the information.

The formulation does this by flagging - as the hon Dr  Woods  said  -  audit
reports where certain details were omitted, thus enabling Scopa  to  do  the
necessary follow-up. Now, the hon Woods is, obviously, concerned that  Scopa
would not do that, but Scopa is really a  committee  where  members  of  the
committee should actually leave their political baggage, or whatever it  is,
outside the door. It's really a reflection on  Scopa  and  the  function  of
Scopa, and I think it's important that it's flagged and left  for  Scopa  to
deal with. [Interjections.]

Now, this aspect may need the attention of the Rules Committee in  the  next
Parliament. It should be noted,  as  the  hon  Brian  Bell  said,  that  the
Auditor-General may not exclude, in the audit, any finding  of  unauthorised
expenditure, irregular expenditure or  fruitless  or  wasteful  expenditure.
So, there are not many things that, in fact, can be excluded.

In conclusion then, Chapter 9 of the Constitution creates the Office of  the
Auditor-General as a state institution supporting democracy. Section  55  of
the Constitution requires Parliament to set up  mechanisms  to  ensure  that
all executive organs of state are responsible to it,  and  section  114  has
similar provisions for provincial legislation.

So, this Bill, in fact, really gives effect to the  aforegoing.  It  assigns
the supreme audit functions to the Auditor-General; it  defines  the  status
and the function of the Auditor-General and  establishes  his  independence,
which other speakers have dealt with today; it  establishes  procedures  for
his appointment and makes him accountable to  Parliament;  it  outlines  how
audits will be done, and here I predict that, in future, there will  be  far
more emphasis given to performance audits, as set out in the  PFMA  and  the
MFMA. It also sets out the procedure for  establishing  the  Office  of  the
Auditor-General with administrative and financial aspects  of  running  that
office.

It gives me pleasure, on behalf of the ANC,  to  recommend  this  particular
Bill to the House. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 16:11.

National Assembly

1.    The Speaker


     (a)    Letter dated 20 January 2004, from the Minister of Home  Affairs
         to the Speaker of  the  National  Assembly,  in  terms  of  section
         65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act  No  1  of
         1999), explaining the delay in the tabling  of  the  Annual  Report
         for the Department of Home Affairs for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         Annual Report of the Department of Home Affairs


         In terms of section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management  Act,
         1999 as amended, you are hereby informed about the reasons for  the
         late submission of the Annual Report  of  the  Department  of  Home
         Affairs.


         The reasons for the late submission are the following:


         (a)      The  Department  had   experienced   problems   with   the
              conversion process from the Financial Management System to the
              new Basic Accounting System during the course of the financial
              year, which resulted in a delay in the timely compilation  and
              finalisation to the financial statements. It became  essential
              at  that  stage  to   consult   extensively   with   the   BAS
              implementation team from National Treasury,  who  was  driving
              the conversion process. The complex nature of  the  conversion
              process also required the office  of  the  Auditor-General  to
              deploy additional Information Technology  expertise  to  audit
              the conversion process in detail to assist in coming  up  with
              an opinion.  After  the  Department  had  done  the  necessary
              amendments, the financial statements were re-submitted  on  22
              August 2003 to the Office of  the  Auditor-General,  and  were
              accepted as a true reflection of the state of affairs  of  the
              Department.


         (b)     Furthermore, the Government  Printing  Works,  which  forms
              part  of  Home  Affairs,  had  a  problem  to  finalise  their
              financial  statements  in  time  due   to   serious   capacity
              constraints. They had first to  withdraw  the  statements  and
              submit additional documentation to the Office of the  Auditor-
              General, and could only manage to re-submit the final  version
              of their financial statements on 20 October 2003.


         The above reasons resulted in a delay in the  finalisation  of  the
         Auditor-General's report and consequently the  late  submission  of
         the Annual Report of the Department for  tabling  in  the  National
         Assembly.


         Steps have been  taken  by  all  involved  stakeholders,  i.e.  the
         Department, Auditors, Audit Committee, as well  as  the  Government
         Printing Works to prevent the  recurrence  of  the  situation.  The
         2003/04 Annual Report will be tabled as prescribed by the PFMA.


         Please accept my apology in this regard.


         Yours sincerely


         Signed


         M G Buthelezi
         MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on the Local Government: Property Rates Bill [B 19  -  2003]  (National
     Assembly - sec 75), dated 17 February 2004:


         The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government,  having
         considered the subject of  the  Local  Government:  Property  Rates
         Bill [B 19 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it
         and classified by the Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  as  a  section  75
         Bill, presents the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates  Bill
         [B 19B - 2003].


         The Committee reports further, as follows:


         1. The Property  Rates  Bill  is  certainly  the  most  technically
              challenging Bill the Committee has  had  to  deal  with  since
              1994. To process the  Bill  effectively,  the  Committee  held
              extensive public hearings, workshops  and  briefing  sessions,
              and  established  several  subcommittees  to  facilitate   the
              ongoing participation of key stakeholders, especially from the
              public. The Committee deliberated on the Bill  for  about  320
              hours. About half of this involved the active participation of
              a range of  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of  the
              South African Local  Government  Association  (SALGA),  public
              entities,  agriculture,  religious,  welfare  and   charitable
              organisations,  independent  schools,  municipal  valuers  and
              others. The Bill is an outcome of protracted negotiations with
              a range of key stakeholders.


         2. The Constitution gives municipalities the power  to  levy  rates
              on property. It allows for Parliament to regulate this  power.
              In the processing of the Bill, the Committee has been  careful
              not to undermine the constitutional power of municipalities.


         3. Consistent with the Constitution, the Bill provides an  enabling
              framework for municipalities, if they so decide, to extend the
              levying of rates to categories of owners and  properties  that
              have until now been partially or fully  excluded  from  paying
              rates. Examples of this would include the properties of public
              entities,  farmers  and  others  in  rural  areas,  religious,
              welfare and charitable organisations, independent schools  and
              conservation bodies. Stakeholders from these and other sectors
              made  strenuous  representations  to  the  Committee  for  the
              retention and even extension of these benefits. Some  of  them
              presented formidable arguments. The Committee's  response  was
              to find a balance between the need for municipalities to  have
              adequate revenue to fulfil their  enhanced,  constitutionally-
              mandated, developmental responsibilities and the need to avoid
              levying rates in a way that debilitates categories of property
              owners. The Committee also sought to strike a balance  between
              recognising the valuable developmental goals served by certain
              categories of owners (for example, public entities and welfare
              organisations) and the need to ensure that it is national  and
              provincial government, not local government,  that  bears  the
              major cost of the role served by these agencies.


         4. The Committee gave considerable attention to what should be  the
              basis for valuation. Among the options explored  were  a  land
              valuation only, land and improvements at variable rates,  land
              and improvements at a uniform rate, and annual  rental  value.
              The  Department  was  asked  to  undertake  further  empirical
              studies in regard to these various options. These options were
              also discussed with a wide range of stakeholders and  academic
              and  other  technical  experts,   both   South   African   and
              international. The inputs  by  the  Department  and  the  vast
              majority of those consulted supported the basis for  valuation
              as being the market  value  of  land  and  improvements  at  a
              uniform rate. The majority in the Committee agreed with  this.
              In any case, this is the trend internationally.


         5. The Committee stresses that the Bill  does  not  prescribe  that
              property rates must be levied in traditional authority  areas.
              Each municipality must decide for itself on this. But it  will
              be difficult to levy property rates in communal areas,  unless
              property is registered in the  name  of  an  individual  or  a
              community. Even  where  there  is  individual  ownership,  the
              property has to be first valued. The owner is not in any  case
              liable for rates unless the property exceeds R15 000 in value.
              Land reform beneficiaries  are  excluded  from  rates  for  10
              years. Thereafter, municipalities have to phase their rates in
              over  three  years.  For  most  municipalities,  the  cost  of
              valuation and administration of rates will exceed any  revenue
              derived from these properties. The Committee does not  believe
              that the levying of property rates  in  traditional  authority
              areas is on the agenda for a long time to come.


         6. Instead of providing  for  blanket  exclusions  from  rates  for
              categories of owners or properties, the Committee strengthened
              provisions in the Bill dealing with:


              (a) the phasing-in of rates;


              (b) the requirements for municipalities to consider, in  their
                  rates policies, the effects  of  rates  on  categories  of
                  owners and properties;
              (c) negotiations between categories of owners  and  properties
                  and the municipalities and SALGA; and


              (d) consultation between the Minister and SALGA on the effects
                  of rates on categories of owners and properties.


         7. With the new valuation rolls determined in terms of unit  living
              in a sectional title scheme will pay  rates  directly  to  the
              municipality. The body corporate of the scheme will thereafter
              not be responsible for paying the rates as is  the  case  now.
              This will make it easier for  people  wanting  to  sell  their
              individual units to  get  rates  clearance  certificates  from
              municipalities. This decision has been very  widely  welcomed.
              The benefits of this will be experienced  by  sectional  title
              unit owners at different  times  over  the  next  four  years,
              depending on when their municipalities do their new  valuation
              rolls in terms of this Bill.


         8. While an explicit provision to this effect was not  included  in
              the Bill, the Committee believes that municipalities should in
              their rates policies take into account the effect of rates  on
              promoting the conservation of threatened  ecosystems  and  the
              sound management of natural resources.


         9. Municipalities might also want to consider how  they  could  use
              their rates policies to offer incentives  to  attract  private
              sector investment.


         10.     As set out  in  Clause  17,  the  place  of  worship  of  a
              religious  community  and  the  official   residence   of   an
              appropriate office-bearer of the community  is  excluded  from
              property rates. However, the Committee  recognises  that  some
              religious communities provide a subsidy to the relevant office-
              bearer to buy a residence  registered  in  his  or  her  name.
              Should evidence of this  be  provided,  municipalities  should
              consider exempting such residences from property rates  as  if
              they were registered in the name of the  religious  community.
              The Committee is also aware that properties registered in  the
              name of  individuals,  and  not  a  religious  community,  are
              genuinely used by  some  religious  communities  as  sites  of
              worship. Where evidence of this  is  provided,  municipalities
              should  consider  exempting  these  properties  from  property
              rates. The Committee was also informed that the  exclusion  of
              these residences has led in some cases to speculation in  such
              properties. To  deter  this,  religious  communities  will  be
              required in terms of Clause 17 to pay rates in arrears for one
              year before the date of sale of these official residences.


         11.       In   deciding   on   rates   for   independent   schools,
              municipalities  should  take  into  account  that  independent
              schools  vary  greatly,  and  it  might  be  necessary,  where
              possible, to consider each independent school on the basis  of
              its particular circumstances. Following discussions  with  the
              Department of Education, it is suggested that in  deciding  on
              rates  for  independent  schools,  municipalities  take   into
              account the South African Schools Act and the  national  norms
              and standards for the funding of independent schools.


         12.     The Bill provides for the exclusion from property rates  of
              30% of the value of public  service  infrastructure.  However,
              where municipalities are levying rates on the  full  value  of
              some aspects of this infrastructure, they may continue  to  do
              so until they finalise a valuation roll in terms of this Bill.
              The  Democratic  Alliance  (DA)  does  not  support  the   30%
              exclusion on the value of public service infrastructure.


         13.     The general principle in the Bill  is  that  municipalities
              should  value   and   rate   all   properties   within   their
              jurisdiction. This contributes to the  White  Paper  on  Local
              Government's objective of broadening the rates  base  so  that
              municipalities   have   adequate   revenue   to   meet   their
              constitutional  objectives.  It   is   also   important   that
              municipalities have as full a sense as possible of  the  value
              of properties  within  their  jurisdiction.  This  is  in  the
              interests   of   transparency   and   will   also   give   the
              municipalities a more accurate sense of the  revenue  that  is
              being foregone. This would also be of  value  in  negotiations
              around money to be allocated by national to local  government.
              In certain instances, however, municipalities are not  obliged
              to value or rate properties. These include:


              (a) those which are fully excluded from  rates  and  which  it
                  does not make sense to value - such as the  Prince  Edward
                  Islands and mineral rights;


              (b) those for which it is difficult to establish a value - for
                  example,  because  of   past   discriminatory   laws   and
                  practices;


              (c) municipal properties; and


              (d) public service infrastructure owned by municipal entities.


         14.     As the range and extent  of  properties  to  be  valued  in
              terms  of  this  Bill  have  been   significantly   increased,
              questions have been raised  about  the  capacity  of  property
              valuers  in  this  country.   Moreover,   with   advances   in
              technology, there are constant changes in valuation techniques
              and methods. The Committee believes that  the  Department  and
              SALGA  should  inquire  further  into  these   questions   and
              facilitate greater awareness among municipalities about  these
              issues, and should take appropriate steps  to  facilitate  the
              development of the requisite capacity of valuers. The Ministry
              and SALGA should as soon as  possible  provide  guidelines  on
              valuation for municipal valuers, especially in regard  to  the
              valuation of public service infrastructure.


         15.     The Bill  provides  for  district  municipalities  to  levy
              rates only in district  management  areas.  However,  district
              municipalities are  fulfilling  certain  functions  previously
              undertaken  by  local  municipalities.  These  functions  were
              previously funded in  part  by  the  rates  revenue  of  local
              municipalities. The Ministry and the Department might want  to
              consider a rates revenue-sharing formula between district  and
              local municipalities in these cases. The Constitution  in  any
              case provides for the division of fiscal powers and  functions
              between district and local municipalities.


         16.     In their rates  policies  municipalities  are  required  to
              take the concerns of farmers into account. Properties used for
              trading in or hunting  of  game  are  not  included  in  this.
              Municipalities should  consider  each  such  property  on  its
              specific merits as to whether it qualifies  for  consideration
              in the way farm properties do. The DA believes, however,  that
              all properties used for trading in or hunting of  game  should
              be treated as farm properties.
         17.     As set out in Clause 3(3)(g), municipalities  are  required
              in their rates policies to take into  account  the  effect  of
              rates on public benefit  organisations  (PBOs)  registered  in
              terms of the Income Tax Act, if they  own  property.  However,
              the Committee recognises that there are many  legitimate  PBOs
              that are not registered. Hence, in Clause  8(q)  provision  is
              made for the properties of PBOs generally, whether  registered
              or not, to be recognised as  a  category.  In  terms  of  this
              latter provision, municipalities should consider  the  effects
              of rates  policies  on  the  unregistered  PBOs,  should  they
              provide adequate evidence of their public benefit activities.


         18.     The Bill specifically excludes properties in part or  whole
              from being subjected to property rates. For example, the first
              R15 000 of all residential properties and 30% of the value  of
              public service infrastructure are excluded  from  rates.  Land
              reform beneficiaries are also excluded from rates  for  a  10-
              year period, and thereafter their rates have to be  phased  in
              over  three  years.  This  represents  revenue   foregone   by
              municipalities.  The  Committee  believes  that  the  national
              government should, over time, consider this when  deciding  on
              the allocation of money to local government from the  national
              fiscus.


         19.     The Bill represents a significant shift  from  the  current
              property rates regime. The Committee urges the Department  and
              SALGA to embark on a massive public education programme on the
              content and implications of this Bill. Many municipalities  do
              not have the capacity to implement this Bill.  The  Department
              and SALGA will have to give considerable  attention  to  this.
              The Committee would like the Department to give  a  report  on
              its progress in this regard by the end of this year.


         20.     Ultimately, decisions  about  levying  rates  resides  with
              municipalities.  This  Bill   will   bring   into   effect   a
              significantly new system of property rates. As with much  else
              of the new local government system,  the  new  property  rates
              system has to be phased in appropriately through  consultation
              with a range of stakeholders.  The  Committee  has  sought  to
              strike  a  series   of   balances   between   the   needs   of
              municipalities and a range of key stakeholders. We  have  also
              provided for the phasing in of aspects  of  the  new  property
              rates system. Municipalities are urged to exercise their power
              to levy rates both in the spirit and letter of  the  law.  The
              Department and SALGA have a  crucial  role  to  play  in  this
              regard - and we urge them to do so. Members of  our  Committee
              and MPs generally can also play a role - and we must do so.


         21.     The Committee expresses  appreciation  for  the  manner  in
              which a range of stakeholders interacted with us in finalising
              the  Bill.  The   Committee   also   expresses   its   sincere
              appreciation to Ms Jackie Manche, Mr  Mizilikazi  Manyike,  Dr
              Peter Vaz, Mr Gerrit Grové, Mr Joe Dube and Dr Petra Bouwer of
              the Department, and Mr Ben Dorfling and Ms Shiva  Makotoko  of
              SALGA, for the considerable work they did  in  processing  the
              Bill through their interaction with  the  Committee  and  many
              stakeholders. The Committee also acknowledges  the  assistance
              of Mr Nico McLachlan  and  Ms  Zora  Ebrahim  of  Organisation
              Development Africa.
