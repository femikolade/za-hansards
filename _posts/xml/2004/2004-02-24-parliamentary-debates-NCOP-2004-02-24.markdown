ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  of  this
House I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the ANC Government's court appeal against the building  of  the
       Israeli antiterrorist wall, built to protect its citizens;
  (2) also notes that it is strange that never at any stage over the  years
       can we find any record of the ANC or the SA Communist Party objecting
       to the building (and existence) of the Berlin wall built by the  East
       German government;


  (3) further notes that it will only be possible for South Africa to  play
       any effective and credible role in the Middle East peace  process  if
       we are neutral, impartial and trusted by both the parties  concerned,
       in a spirit of reconciliation;


  (4) also takes note of the embarrassment and distress of the ACDP at this
       hostile partial treatment being meted out to a friendly government in
       good standing;


  (5) also notes that Israel is not in our primary sphere of influence  and
       is of the view that nothing can be more calculated to cut across  and
       damage our real national economic interests than this intervention in
       the International Court of Justice;


  (6) calls upon the Department of Foreign Affairs to  stop  this  damaging
       diplomatic adventurism as evidenced by this action, and by  injecting
       our President into the Haitian maelstrom recently.

  (1) kennis neem van die uiters  geslaagde  veeltaligheidskonferensie  wat
       die Parlement gister aangebied het;


  (2) voorts daarvan kennis neem dat dit die eerste taalkonferensie is waar

       Niekerk,  die  NNP  se  Taalombudsman,  en  mnr  Dawie  Kgware,   die
       voorsitter van die betrokke gekose komitee;


     4) sy misnoeÃ« uitspreek daaroor dat sekere opposisiepartye nie deel van
        sy geskiedkundige konferensie wou wees nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P A Matthee: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the highly successful conference on  multilingualism  presented
       by Parliament yesterday;


  (2) further notes that this was the first language conference at which so
       many politicians had the opportunity to  have  discussions  with  the
       Department of Arts and Culture, PanSALB and language experts;


  (3) congratulates the speakers from the National Council of Provinces who
       participated in the conference, namely the  Chairperson,  Mrs  Naledi
       Pandor, the Deputy Chairperson, Mr  M  J  Mahlangu,  Mr  Adriaan  van
       Niekerk, the New NP's Language Ombudsman, and Mr  Dawie  Kgware,  the
       chairperson of the relevant select committee;


  (4) expresses its dissatisfaction that certain opposition parties did not
       want to be part of the historic conference.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

             MEASURES TAKEN BY SA GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT CORRUPTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges the various measures that have been implemented  by  the
       ANC-led Government to fight corruption;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  in 1997 the Government launched South  Africa's  National  Anti-
           Corruption Programme, which was soon followed by Public  Service
           and National Anti-Corruption Summits;
       (b)   late  in  1999,  the  Government   also   co-hosted   the   9th
           International Anti-Corruption Conference;


       (c)  at the beginning of 2002,  the  Government  adopted  the  Public
           Service Anti-Corruption Strategy;


  (3) further notes that  other  legislative  and  administrative  measures
       include the establishment of constitutionally independent bodies such
       as the Public Protector, the enactment of the  Protected  Disclosures
       Act,  the  Prevention  of  Organised   Crime   Act,   the   Financial
       Intelligence Centre Act and the Public Finance  Management  Act,  the
       passing of the Executive Members' Ethics Act, the Code of Conduct for
       public servants and  the  creation  of  the  Directorate  of  Special
       Operations; and


  (4) believes these measures are clear signals of Government's  commitment
       to ensure  a  clean  public  administration  system,  encourage  good
       governance,  and   promote   greater   openness,   transparency   and
       accountability.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   CONGRATULATIONS TO MOZAMBIQUE ON NEW PRIME MINISTER, MADAME LUISA DIOGO

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) applauds the Mozambican President,  Joaquim  Chissano,  for  swearing
       into office the country's new prime minister, Madame Luisa Diogo;


  (2) notes that this choice was supported by members of the government;


  (3) further notes that -
       (a)  she was deputy minister for ten years until the year 2000,  when
           she became minister;


       (b)  she was also head of some committees responsible for reforms  in
           the country, especially in respect of finances;


       (c)  she introduces the value-added tax legislation in 1999  and  has
           initiated debt relief  programmes  -  she  reduced  Mozambique's
           world debt from an impossible $75 million  to  $25  million  per
           year;


       (d)  Mozambique has superseded democracies of  decades  and  even  of
           centuries by having a woman as prime minister  of  the  country;
           and

  (4) is of the view that Ms Diogo, who makes us proud as a  woman  leader,
       will do well in her leadership role as an African and as a woman.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

    PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AGAINST TERRORIST AND RELATED
                               ACTIVITIES BILL

                           (Consideration of Bill)

The MINISTER  OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you,  Chairperson  and  hon
members. The Bill has come a long way, from the  SA  Law  Reform  Commission
processes to 14 November 2002, when it was tabled in the National  Assembly.
Part of its history includes the extensive consultation process  and  public
hearings that the portfolio committee conducted, during  which  many  people
and organisations made important submissions.

The consideration of the  Bill  by  the  Select  Committee  for  Safety  and
Constitutional Affairs was a further consolidation of the desire to  produce
legislation that would redound to the best practice  of  our  constitutional
democracy. The select committee used it as  a  guide  in  dealing  with  all
expert opinions on the basis of our Constitution and  from  the  perspective
of international humanitarian law. The committee also proposed the  adoption
of  a  number  of  amendments,  which  would  bring  about  corrections  and
improvements in the text of the Bill and which are not of a policy nature.

The processes I have referred to are the bedrock of a working democracy  and
should be entrenched in our legislative system. Piloting  the  Bill  through
this House at the end of the long road behind us speaks to  the  methodology
of  lawmaking  that  we  have  developed,  where   people   from   different
backgrounds, politically, socially and economically, bring  independent  and
different perspectives into the process of legislation.

Over a period of more than a year, Parliament  has  adopted  instruments  to
comply with our international obligations, but the Republic has not  acceded
to or  ratified  the  Maritime  Navigation  Convention,  the  Protection  of
Nuclear Material and the convention leading to fixed platforms.
The  Bill  under  review  today  paves  the  way  to  ratifying  the   three
conventions, and  will  put  in  place  the  final  building  block  in  the
legislative framework of the Republic to  combat  terrorism  internationally
as well as within our borders.

The Bill refers, also, to all offences  regarding  international  terrorism,
in keeping with the relevant conventions, as well as the general offence  of
terrorism. It provides for criminal and civil asset  forfeiture  in  respect
of  specified  offences,   the   extra-territorial   jurisdiction   required
specifically  by  the  terrorist  bombing  conventions,  the  African  Union
Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism  and  the  Terrorist
Financing  Convention.  It  also  provides  for  offences  relating  to  the
financing of terrorist activities, a wider  provision  allowing  search  and
seizure and cordoning off to prevent and investigate terrorist activities.

The President is authorised  to  publish,  in  the  Gazette,  the  names  of
individuals and institutions connected to terrorist and related  activities,
as identified by the United  Nations  Security  Council,  and  provides  for
parliamentary oversight in this regard. Investigative procedures similar  to
those prescribed in the Prevention of Organised Crime Act are  provided  for
in the Bill, in order to investigate terrorist and related activities.

It should be noted that the Bill is an  omnibus  in  that  it  also  effects
amendments to legislation, such as the Financial  Intelligence  Centre  Act,
which  prescribes  the  reporting  of  transactions  relating  to  terrorist
activities; the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, which provides for  civil
forfeiture in respect of property  relating  to  terrorist  activities;  the
Extradition Act, which does away with the political exception in respect  of
terrorist activities; the Nuclear Energy Act, which creates the  offence  of
the criminal use of nuclear materials; the Non-Proliferation of  Weapons  of
Mass Destruction Act, to provide for an offence relating to weapons of  mass
destruction;  the  Criminal  Law  Amendment  Act  of  1997,  for  prescribed
sentences,  and  the  interception   legislation,   to   provide   for   the
interception of communications relating to the most serious offences in  the
Bill.

Furthermore, the Bill criminalises hoaxes and provides for an order  by  the
court for  the  payment  of  fruitless  expenses  for  relevant  operational
action.

Allow me to emphasise, therefore, that all prosecution may be instituted  in
terms of the  Bill,  without  the  written  authorisation  of  the  National
Director of Public Prosecutions. The Bill makes it obligatory  on  the  part
of the National Director of Public Prosecutions  to  report  to  the  United
Nations and other international institutions on prosecutions or  refusal  to
prosecute civil, aviation and maritime navigation crimes.

Provision is also made for adequate penalties to  suit  the  seriousness  of
the offences in question. The Bill also provides for  transitional  measures
to ensure the continuity of existing terrorist trials.
I move,  therefore,  that  the  Council  adopt  the  report  of  the  select
committee on the Protection of Constitutional  Democracy  Against  Terrorist
and Related Activities Bill, 2003. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you very much, hon  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister  and
colleagues, since our country became a legitimate member  of  the  community
of nations in 1994, it had to commit itself to obligations of  international
instruments, dealing amongst others with terrorist and  related  activities.
We have already become party to 13 such instruments of the  United  Nations.
These instruments bind all member states of the United Nations, as  Security
Council Resolution 1373 of 2001 ratified these instruments.

There are three remaining instruments that we still have  to  ratify.  After
ratification of those three instruments, and the passing of  this  Bill,  we
could indeed say that  the  legal  framework  to  deal  with  terrorist  and
related activities is in place in this country.

We are dealing here with a crucial domestic law which, on the one  hand,  is
informed by our experiences and needs while, on the other, has to  pass  the
acid test of a constitutional democracy and its international obligations.

The true nature of a state, it can be argued, is  mainly  portrayed  by  its
legislation on serious and sensitive matters like this one  we  are  dealing
with. There are some countries, for instance, who  would  like  to  make  us
believe that they are models of democracy, but  their  legislation  on  such
matters are draconian and, therefore, serve to  narrow  their  frontiers  of
freedom. We  therefore  need  to  commend  the  drafters,  as  well  as  our
colleagues, for successfully dealing with this hurdle and  particularly  how
they avoided the pitfall of resorting to a narrow  definition  of  the  term
``terrorism''. Therefore, in this Bill we refer to ``terrorist  and  related
activities''.

The Bill sets out further offences  which,  if  committed,  will  constitute
terrorist and related activities. The hon  Minister  has  already  indicated
these offences. Penalties for these crimes are accordingly  severe.  We  are
talking here of prison terms ranging from five to  fifteen  years  or  fines
ranging from R250 000 to R100 million.

Since the act of terrorism and associated activities are  serious  offences,
checks and balances are in place to ensure that those who are  convicted  of
these heinous crimes are treated fairly in terms of  the  law.  Notification
by the President of certain entities that are in conflict of  Chapter  7  of
the Charter of the United Nations is one  of  those  checks.  The  President
does so by  way  of  a  proclamation.  Such  a  proclamation  is  tabled  in
Parliament for consideration and decision.

As I have stated earlier on, we  are  dealing  here  with  a  domestic  law,
informed by international instruments, to  fight  and  convict  the  heinous
crime of terrorism. But I could not help myself when looking  at  the  short
long title of the Bill, and it refers only  to  protection.  I  am  informed
that many of these instruments I have  referred  to  are  contained  in  our
initiative  in  Nepad,  and  Nepad  has  more  to  do  with  promoting  good
governance, democracy and transparency. And  therefore,  as  the  ANC,  ever
since and even during the times of the armed struggle, we  have  been  known
for having some special place for those  countries  who  are  not  really  a
democracy. And  therefore  one  would  have  liked  to  see  here  not  only
protection, but promotion  of  a  constitutional  democracy  in  the  entire
world.

We, as the ANC, wholeheartedly support this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter,  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Regshervormingskommissie
het op versoek van die Minister vir Veiligheid en Sekuriteit  ons  wetgewing
ten opsigte  van  terrorisme  volledig  in  heroÃ«nskou  geneem  en  'n  baie
volledige en omvattende verslag uitgebring.

Uit diÃ© verslag het geblyk dat daar  behoefte  was  aan  nuwe  wetgewing  om
effektief te handel met die  voorkoming,  die  ondersoek  en  bekamping  van
terroristiese  en  aanverwante   aktiwiteite,   beide   van   nasionale   en
internasionale aard en karakter.

Ek dink dit is ook gepas dat ons in hierdie stadium hulde bring aan  daardie
regsgeleerdes  wat  so  'n  omvattende  studie  gedoen  het,  wat  op  beide
nasionale en internasionale vlak na die  hele  situasie  gekyk  het  en  met
werklik goeie aanbevelings vorendag gekom het, waaruit  hierdie  wetsontwerp
dan voortgespruit het.

Soos die  Minister  aangedui  het,  het  Suid-Afrika  se  internasionale  en
streeksverpligtinge toegeneem as gevolg van die  internasionale  instrumente
met betrekking tot terroristiese en  aanverwante  aktiwiteite,  waarvan  ons
die meeste reeds geratifiseer het. Maar, soos aangedui  deur  die  Minister,
is daar sommige wat ons nog moet ratifiseer  om  die  prentjie  te  voltooi.
Maar in die besonder is daar ook diÃ© resolusies van die Veiligheidsraad  van
die Verenigde Nasies wat spesifieke wetgewing om terroristiese  bedrywighede
te bekamp, noodsaak, sodat daar voorsiening gemaak kan  word  vir  maatreÃ«ls
ten  opsigte  van  jurisdiksie,  die  bekamping  van  die  finansiering  van
terrorisme, wat 'n baie groot en komplekse probleem is, en die  daarstelling
van spesifieke misdrywe. Ons sal  vonnisse  moet  daarstel,  wat,  soos  die
vorige  agb  spreker  aangedui  het,  die  ernstige  aard  van  diÃ©  misdade
weerspieÃ«l en in  sommige  gevalle  selfs  lewenslange  gevangenisstraf  vir
sekere van die misdade daarstel.

Hierdie wetsontwerp sal Suid-Afrika nou in staat stel om sy verpligtinge  na
te kom as 'n belangrike  globale  rolspeler  op  die  wÃªreldtoneel.  Hierdie
wetsontwerp sal ook as 'n afskrikmiddel  kan  dien  vir  enige  persoon  wat
daaraan sou dink om hom  of  haar  hier  in  Suid-Afrika  aan  terroristiese
bedrywighede skuldig te maak of om selfs te simpatiseer met terroriste.  Dit
sou ook 'n effektiewe instrument in die hande van ons polisie  en  ons  hele
strafregstelsel daarstel om ons jong demokrasie effektief te beskerm.

Ek wil ook graag tydens hierdie geleentheid hulde  bring  aan  ons  polisie,
ons veiligheidsmagte, maar ook ons intelligensiepersoneel, wat soms  dag  en
nag werk om seker te maak dat ons veilig is. Wanneer ons in  die  aand  gaan
slaap, dan opereer hulle onder soms  baie  gevaarlike  omstandighede  en  ek
dink dat hulle nie genoegsaam ons dank  en  hulde  kry  vir  daardie  uiters
belangrike werk wat hulle vir ons doen nie.

Ons is 'n vreedsame nasie wat, soos dit ook in ons Grondwet uitgespel  word,
wÃªreldvrede nastreef en in vrede wil leef met al  ons  bure  en  alle  ander
nasies. Maar die prys van vryheid, van vrede,  soos  daar  al  gesÃª  is,  is
ewigdurende waaksaamheid. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, at the request of the Minister for Safety  and
Security the South African Law Reform Commission revised our legislation  on
terrorism fully and published a very complete and comprehensive report.

From this report it became clear that there was a need for  new  legislation
to deal effectively with the  prevention,  investigation  and  combating  of
terrorist and related activities,  of  national  as  well  as  international
nature and character.

I think it is also appropriate for us to pay tribute at this stage to  those
lawyers who undertook such a comprehensive study, who looked  at  the  whole
situation at national as well as international level and came  forward  with
really good recommendations, from which this Bill then originated.

As  the  Minister  indicated,  South  Africa's  international  and  regional
obligations have increased as a  result  of  the  international  instruments
with regard to terrorist and related  activities,  most  of  which  we  have
already ratified. But, as indicated by  the  Minister,  there  are  some  we
still have to ratify to complete the picture. But, in particular, there  are
also those resolutions of the Security Council of the United  Nations  which
necessitate specific legislation to  combat  terrorist  activities  so  that
provision can  be  made  for  measures  with  regard  to  jurisdiction,  the
combating of the financing of terrorism, which is a very large  and  complex
problem, and the establishment  of  specific  offences.  We  shall  have  to
introduce sentences which, as the previous speaker  has  indicated,  reflect
the serious nature of these crimes and in some  cases  even  introduce  life
imprisonment for some of the crimes.

This Bill will now enable South Africa  to  fulfil  its  obligations  as  an
important global role-player on the world scene. This Bill  could  also  act
as deterrent to anyone considering committing  terrorist acts here in  South
Africa or  even  sympathising  with  terrorists.  It  will  also  create  an
effective instrument in the hands of our  police  and  our  entire  criminal
justice system to protect our young democracy effectively.

On this occasion I would also  like  to  pay  tribute  to  our  police,  our
security forces, but also to our intelligence personnel who  sometimes  work
night and day to ensure that we are safe. When we go to bed at  night,  they
operate under circumstances which are sometimes very dangerous,  and  in  my
opinion they do  not  receive  adequate  thanks  and  recognition  for  this
extremely important work they do for us.

We are a peaceful nation, as  is  also  spelled  out  in  our  Constitution,
striving towards world peace and wanting to  live  in  peace  with  all  our
neighbours and all other nations. But the price of  freedom,  of  peace,  as
has been said before, is eternal vigilance.]

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

En dit is my hoop dat hierdie wetgewing ons in staat sal  stel  om  te  alle
tye daardie waaksaamheid daar te hÃª, sodat ons kan weet  -  en  dat  enigeen
kan weet wat enigsins sou dink om in ons land die  dinge  te  doen  wat  ons
gesien het reeds in soveel dele van die wÃªreld gebeur - dat alhoewel ons  'n
vreedsame nasie is, ons effektief sal optree teen enige een wat  ons  staat,
ons veiligheid en ons  demokrasie  bedreig.  Ek  dank  u.  Ons  steun  graag
hierdie  wetgewing.  [Applous.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[And it is my hope that  this  legislation  will  enable  us  to  have  that
vigilance in place at all times so that we can know -  and  so  that  anyone
who would even remotely consider doing in our country those things  we  have
already seen happening in so many  parts  of  the  world  can  know  -  that
although we are a peaceful nation, we will act  effectively  against  anyone
who threatens our state, our safety and our democracy.

I thank  you.  It  is  a  pleasure  for  us  to  support  this  legislation.
[Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the challenge in this piece  of  legislation  was
to be, on the one hand, effective in the fight  against  terrorism  and,  on
the other hand, to preserve our constitutional values  such  as  freedom  of
speech, freedom of association and the associated freedoms. This is  not  an
easy task. I would like to quote Jody Kollapan who, I  think,  captures  the
task we were faced with in drawing up this piece of  legislation.  He  says:
"The promotion and protection of human rights is  central  to  an  effective
strategy  to  counter  terrorism."  Inherent  in  this  statement  are   two
important and interrelated dimensions: Firstly,  the  need  to  ensure  that
measures designed to combat  terrorism  do  not  impermissibly  limit  human
rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  and,  secondly,  the  recognition   that
terrorism puts under threat the full enjoyment of civil liberties and  human
rights. I think we needed to bear that in mind and I think we  did  so  when
we drew up and considered this piece of legislation.

I wish to refer to another phenomenon about this piece of legislation.  With
regard  to  this  piece  of  legislation,  I  received  the  most   personal
communications to myself as a lawmaker, lobbying me to either do this or  do
that, and it makes me proud as a South African citizen  and  a  lawmaker  in
this House, that our citizens  actually  take  to  heart  the  virtue  of  a
participatory  democracy  and  actually  come  and  quote  sections  of  the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights and say there is a  danger  of  this  or
there is a danger of that and these lobbyists, I am  afraid,  do  fall  into
different categories. There are those who perhaps saw  the  first  draft  of
the Bill and thought that we in Parliament, through the portfolio  committee
and the select committee, had not listened to a single submission,  had  not
changed a single thing and that the Bill was as it was first published.  Now
what I say to  these  people,  not  to  discourage  them,  but  to  be  more
involved,  is  that  there  are  resources  you  could  use.   We   have   a
parliamentary website and the parliamentary monitoring  group  would  afford
you with summaries of all the debates and the changes  that  take  place  as
they develop, because I think, for our democracy to  really  take  root,  it
needs to be owned by the people and they must feel that  they  can  actually
lobby us and convince us of their point of view. And the reason  I  take  my
time to actually mention and laud these people  is  because  what  they  are
doing is taking the democratic approach to changing the law.

This Act is designed to deal with those  people  who  refuse  to  deal  with
democracy and those people who have no respect for democracy. We need to  be
pragmatic. We also need to be sensible, and this is where the  hon  Minister
will have a difficult task  in  applying  this  law,  bearing  in  mind  our
constitutional virtues, because it must be applied. I am  sure  it  will  be
applied  with  those  constitutional  virtues  in  the  forefront   of   any
application of this Act.

There were others who were  more  sophisticated  in  lobbying  us,  who  did
follow the debate, but then again also did not keep  themselves  abreast  of
parliamentary procedure. For instance, I am sure that  other  colleagues  of
mine in the committee received representations this  morning  and,  frankly,
this is simply too late. The committee has voted on this issue. Although  we
read them to show that we  take  these  things  seriously,  we  can  not  do
anything about it now. I must say that  under  the  leadership  of  the  hon
Kgoshi  Mokoena,  the  chairperson  of  the  select  committee,  we  allowed
representations in the committee up to the very last moment and we  will  do
so wherever possible. We will always accommodate, we  may  not  be  able  to
hear oral evidence, but we will always allow persons to present,  especially
if they are written, submissions and they are given timeously.
Regarding some of the amendments that were made at the last  minute,  I  was
unable to attend  the  last  meeting  and  I  have  reservations  about  one
specifically in section 1(3) where the word ``lawful'' was removed. It  does
not affect the fact that my party and I still support the Bill, but  I  just
need to express my reservations in that regard.

It remains only for me to  say  that  there  are  difficulties.  There  will
always be challenges in this  form  of  legislation  and  I  feel  the  main
challenge will obviously be in  its  application.  The  Democratic  Alliance
supports this legislation. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Thank you, Chair. I also join my colleagues  in  commending
the draft. This Bill, strongly supported by the ANC since its inception,  is
a  product  of  long  deliberation  with  inputs  from  a  wide   range   of
stakeholders. The result is a Bill that will not  only  pass  constitutional
muster, but one which meets South Africa's national security needs  and  our
international obligations  under  the  UN  treaties  and  protocols  on  the
combating of terrorism that the country is party to.

September 11, 2001 marked a day in world history  that  will  be  remembered
for one of the most chilling acts  of  terror  in  the  21st  century.  Many
nations lost their citizens alongside the more than
5 000 US citizens. South Africa lost one citizen, Mr  Nick  Rowe.  Terrorist
attacks have threatened the safety and security of  ordinary  South  African
citizens, such as women and children, within the borders of our country.  In
July 2001, the Institute for Security Studies  summarised  the  threat  that
terrorist acts held for South Africans as followed:


  After mid-1996 the motive for some  acts  of  violence  in  the  form  of
  bombings, drive-by shootings and assassinations changed. It would  appear
  that the violence was no longer solely committed by  gangs  battling  for
  territory and markets, or by vigilantes in their  attempts  to  eliminate
  suspected drug dealers. This new violence sought to create a  climate  of
  fear and terror among the citizens of Cape  Town.  Moreover,  after  mid-
  1998, bomb attacks and assassinations occurred  not  only  in  the  gang-
  ravaged areas of the Cape Flats but also in the city centre  and  tourist
  destinations of Cape Town itself.  The  violence  increasingly  began  to
  target the state in the form of police stations, courts and personnel  of
  the justice system, as well as popular tourist and  entertainment  areas,
  restaurants and Cape Town International Airport.

Compared to the criminally motivated crime and  violence  in  South  Africa,
these acts of terrorism exacted, mercifully,  few  victims.  The  two  dozen
bomb blasts that occurred in Cape Town between mid-1998 and the end  of  the
year 2000 caused five  fatalities,  of  which  two  involved  the  suspected
bombers themselves and about 120 injuries.

The impact of terrorism should, however, not be measured  in  terms  of  its
actual victims. Terrorism seeks to achieve precisely what the term  implies:
terror. With the right publicity, one bomb brutally  mutilating  an  unlucky
restaurant patron instils more fear and insecurity  in  the  general  public
than the 70 murders recorded on an average day.

More recently, in 2002, there were two more acts of  domestic  terrorism  in
South Africa. A series of bombings in Soweto in late October  of  that  year
killed one and wounded another,  and  in  mid-November  2002,  a  pipe  bomb
exploded at the Serious Violent Crimes Police Unit  in  Cape  Town,  but  no
injuries occurred.

Apart from this overwhelming evidence  that  South  Africa  faces  terrorist
threats, albeit in varying degrees  and  from  various  quarters,  the  far-
reaching impact of these terrorist threats is yet another reason  why  South
Africa should embrace this Bill. The  Institute  for  Security  Studies,  in
their July 2001 study, summarised some of the  potential  and  real  threats
that terrorism holds apart from severely eroding the safety and security  of
our people as follows:


  In an interconnected world, pictures of  terrorists  are  flashed  across
  television  screens  across  the  globe.   This   detrimentally   affects
  investors' confidence in the victimised country, something  a  developing
  country such as South Africa can ill afford. Terrorist acts can also have
  a significant impact on tourism, a lucrative industry for many developing
  countries. Cape Town is South Africa's premier  tourist  destination  for
  hard currency visitors from Western Europe and North America. The tourist
  market is sensitive, and indications of terrorist activities in a country
  quickly lead to cancellations. In Cape  Town's  case,  this  has  serious
  repercussions  for  the  local  economy  and  employment  levels.  It  is
  estimated that one job is created for every eight  foreign  tourists  who
  spend their money in the country.

During the past 10 years of democracy, the  ANC-led  Government  dealt  with
the spectre of terrorism, predominantly in  three  respects,  in  the  areas
highlighted above: urban terrorism, right-wing terrorism  and  international
terrorism. The  adoption  of  this  Bill  forms  an  essential  part  of  an
integrated and comprehensive approach  to  combating  terrorism  within  our
borders.

The Government of South Africa was  not  pressurised  by  the  international
powers, as some would like to believe, into  adopting  a  comprehensive  and
thorough approach to the  combating  of  terrorist  acts.  Neither  did  the
Government go about this process with undue  haste.  On  the  contrary,  the
Bill that is before us today is  a  result  of  more  than  seven  years  of
thorough investigation and deliberation. The first response from  Government
was, in November 1995, to refer the review and possible  rationalisation  of
the security legislation in South Africa to the  South  African  Law  Reform
Commission for consideration and report.

The South African Law Reform Commission,  on  request  of  the  Minister  of
Safety and Security, reviewed the Republic's law in  respect  of  terrorism.
The report of the commission indicated  the  need  for  new  legislation  to
effectively  deal  with  the  prevention,  investigation  and  combating  of
terrorism.   International   and   regional   obligations    arising    from
international instruments relating to terrorist and related  activities  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Speaking  in
this House, a while back, I reminded hon members about  the  functions  that
we have, which will  help  us  in  our  interactions  with  our  people,  to
indicate to them the instruments that are available to  all  South  Africans
from all walks of life,  which  are  pointers  towards  a  thorough  growing
democracy, which we are building. This Bill is one of  the  building  blocks
that are required to ensure that we consolidate our democracy.

I was doing this because it is absolutely necessary  that  we  indicate  the
benefits that our democratic dispensation has brought to all of our  people.
Often, in my work, there are questions that people  raise,  that  relate  to
things that ought to be known by many of them, in regard to how  the  police
work.

I have said that, if you look at  the  entire  spectrum  of  our  democratic
situation in South Africa, you will  find  that  the  building  blocks  that
underpin that democracy will always ensure  that  people  can  use  them  as
springboards for a better life, because with each piece of legislation  that
we have, you will find that there are concomitant structures  and  processes
that ensure that, in the event that  there  is  failure  in  terms  of  that
legislation, there will be ways in which people  can  be  lifted  up  to  be
assisted.

A case in point is when people  complain  to  me,  for  instance,  that  the
police are not responding to their cries  either  timeously  or,  at  times,
completely ignore those cries for help. But  I  say  to  them,  we  have  an
instrument that is available to the people  to  use,  to  ensure  that  that
situation does not occur, and that instrument, I normally indicate,  is  the
Secretariat for Safety and Security, because those people are  charged  with
the responsibility to monitor and ensure that the members of the  SA  Police
Service implement the laws that we have, relevant to their own function.
When there are situations where police action results in injuries  that  are
sustained by people, I say, even with regard  to  that,  that  we  have  the
Independent Complaints Directorate that monitors such situations. In  regard
to this particular matter that we are dealing with today, there are so  many
levels which people can appeal to in the event that there is a violation  of
the principles that underpin that very democracy.

The first thing that people ought to be able to do, in the event  that  they
believe that there has been a violation of their own human rights, in  terms
of this particular Bill, is to have recourse to  our  Constitution.  Section
35 makes  it  abundantly  clear  what  happens  when  any  person  has  been
detained. There are rights that  people  who  are  suspects,  even  at  that
level, enjoy. You should use the Constitution.

There are other instruments that people can use to ensure  that  there  will
not be any time in South Africa, for as long as  we  have  the  Constitution
that we have, where people will  use  Bills  like  this  particular  one  to
undermine human rights  in  South  Africa.  As  a  country  collectively,  I
believe, we are all committed to never ever repeating the  mistakes  of  the
past, not only as Government, but our population as  a  whole,  particularly
because the greater majority of our people are people who  are  peace-loving
and law-abiding.

I do want to join all of you who have spoken so favourably  about  the  Bill
here and, like the hon Mr Lever, also extend appreciation to all the  people
who participated in bringing out a Bill of this  nature,  which  is  a  very
difficult piece of legislation,  given,  particularly,  our  past  in  South
Africa. The way in which people sat down to  discuss  this  particular  Bill
has been highly impressive and, indeed, the interventions  and  interactions
that have been happening around  this  particular  Bill  indicate  that  our
democracy is being consolidated.

This Bill also allows for people across the board, not only  to  talk  about
our situation here in South Africa, but to also look at  what  is  happening
internationally. This means that through the discussion of  this  Bill,  the
alertness of our people regarding international events was also raised  and,
therefore, their level of understanding of what is  happening  globally  was
highly enhanced.

I wish to thank everybody, therefore, who participated in  formulating  this
Bill, all those who provided legal  expertise,  members  of  Parliament  and
members of the various committees  of  Parliament  who  contributed  to  the
formulation of a Bill on a subject as  difficult  as  terrorism.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I shall now put  the
question.  The  question  is  that  the  Bill,  subject  to   the   proposed
amendments, be agreed to. Rule 63 allows political parties  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they wish to  do  so.  Is  there  any
party wishing to make a declaration of vote?  There  is  none.  We  proceed,
therefore, to voting. Those in favour say ``Aye''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye!

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Those against, say ``No''.

HON MEMBERS: No!

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The ``Ayes'' have it.

The majority of members voted in  favour.  I  therefore  declare  the  Bill,
subject to the proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with section  75
of the Constitution. [Applause.]

             PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF CORRUPT ACTIVITIES BILL

                           (Consideration of Bill)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson
and hon  members,  the  South  African  Government  is  acutely  aware  that
corruption undermines the basic  principles  and  values  enshrined  in  our
Constitution. If unchecked, corruption has the potential to negate the  many
hard-won gains that our country has made over the past 10  years  since  the
advent of our democracy in 1994. Corruption is an impediment to  social  and
economic  development,  but  its  worst  threat  is  that  it  impacts  most
adversely on the poor and marginalised. This is as true for our  country  as
it is anywhere else in the world.

It is for these  reasons  that  the  Prevention  and  Combating  of  Corrupt
Activities Bill comes before this House  for  consideration.  The  Bill,  if
passed, will replace the Corruption Act of 1992  and  this  new  legislation
represents Government's efforts to articulate a  broad  strategy  to  combat
corruption at all levels of our society.

The new legislation complements the rigorous array  of  anticorruption  laws
that already feature on our Statute Book. I am, of course, referring to  the
legislative instruments that include the Public Finance Management Act,  the
Promotion of Access to Information Act and the Protected Disclosures Act.

The Bill seeks to codify the offences of corruption and bribery and it  will
extend in its application from the  offices  of  corrupt  officials  to  the
equally insidious corrupt activities that can and do occur in the  corporate
boardrooms of the private sector. The legislation also deals with  the  role
of private capital as a source of public  corruption  and  makes  the  point
that it is as much the corruptor as the corrupted that deserve punishment.

The new legislation makes provision for the  protection  of  witnesses  from
undue influence and places  a  duty  on  individuals  holding  positions  of
authority  to  report  corrupt  activity.  This  provision,  in  particular,
ensures that senior management in Government, parastatals  and  the  private
sector can and will blow the whistle on graft.  Failure  to  report  corrupt
activities carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.

In  response  to  the  scourge  of  corruption,  SADC  heads  of  state  and
Government adopted  the  Southern  African  Development  Community  Protocol
Against Corruption on 14 August 2001 at their Summit in Malawi. All 14  SADC
heads  of  state  and  Government  signed  the  protocol  and  in  so  doing
demonstrated a clear political and regional  commitment  to  addressing  the
problem of corruption and related corrupt activities.

Attempting to realise the objectives of the  protocol  within  the  shortest
possible timeframe, the Justice department sought to do  the  following  two
things: Firstly, to identify shortcomings in our anticorruption  legislation
and to identify the legislative  and  institutional  steps  that  should  be
taken to comply with the provisions of the protocol. Secondly,  to  identify
and recommend steps that should be  taken  to  harmonise  corruption-related
legislation within the SADC region.

I am proud to say that South Africa has, within two years  of  the  adoption
of the protocol, succeeded in drafting, accepting and approving  legislation
that complies with the protocol's objectives. In some  instances,  the  Bill
goes well beyond what is required by the protocol. With the passage of  this
Act, South Africa will have an innovative  piece  of  legislation  that  has
real teeth.

With the assistance of the relevant select and portfolio committees, we  now
have a product that is  consistent  with  international  best  practice  and
which is at the same time context specific, in both  domestic  and  regional
terms.

Without going into too much detail, I wish to refer to the following  unique
provisions: Clause 10 replaces the common law crime of bribery. This  clause
prohibits both the receipt and offering of unauthorised gratification by  or
to a person within an employment relationship. Whereas the common law  crime
of bribery applies only to persons in the  public  sector,  the  offence  in
clause 10 covers employment relationships in the private sector.

In terms of clause 17(1), any public officer is guilty of an offence  if  he
or she acquires or holds a private interest in any  contract,  agreement  or
investment emanating from or connected with the public body in which  he  or
she is employed or which is made  on  account  of  that  public  body.  This
offence does not apply, amongst others, to a public officer who acquires  or
holds  such  interest  as  a  shareholder  of  a  listed  company  or  whose
conditions of employment do not  prohibit  him  or  her  from  acquiring  or
holding such an interest.

Clause  23  allows  the  National  Director  of   Public   Prosecutions   to
investigate the  possession  of  property  disproportionate  to  a  person's
present or past known sources of income or assets.

Chapter 6 of the Bill establishes a register for tender defaulters and  this
register will reside in the office of the National Treasury.

Clause 34 creates a duty to report certain  corrupt  transactions.  However,
it is important to note that this duty only applies  to  persons  holding  a
position of authority as defined in the Bill. The duty  only  applies  where
such a person knows or ought reasonably to  have  known  or  suspected  that
certain serious offences have been committed and where the offence  involves
an amount of R100 000 or more.

Clearly, these frameworks reflect a real political  will  by  Government  to
change the approach to combating and preventing corruption. It is  important
to remember that an appropriate anticorruption strategy, sound  and  fitting
legislation and the enforcement of the laws that pertain are not in  and  of
themselves the entire solution  to  the  problem.  Left  unchecked,  corrupt
practices can easily become a bad habit and tend  to  become  accepted  very
easily as the norm.

People have to be alerted to  the  risk  that  the  presence  of  corruption
represents to themselves, their communities and their  future.  We  need  to
change society's view of corruption and instil in them  the  knowledge  that
they can do something constructive about putting a stop to it.

One thing is certain, we can have the best laws in the world  and  even  the
finest enforcement capacity  available,  but  without  the  support  of  the
community and its desire to be  a  willing  partner  in  the  fight  against
corruption, we all face a downhill  slide  into  nowhere.  People  from  all
walks of life - business executives, consumers and  consumer  organisations,
bureaucrats and shop floor stewards - will  make  this  law  work.  We  must
instil in our national community an unequivocal intolerance  for  corruption
practices and create a  culture  and  expectation  of  clean  corporate  and
public sector practice.

We should remember that corruption is not the sole preserve of  our  country
nor that of  the  African  continent.  With  the  advent  of  globalisation,
international borders have simply become less distinct and this  plight  has
become  a  concern  for  the  entire  international  community.  Neither  is
corruption limited to any  specific  sector.  It  preys  on  government  and
business on a wide front and finds its home in both the formal and  informal
sectors. It is a reality in  industrially  sophisticated  economies  and  in
developed and developing economies.

Corruption, too, is fairly indiscriminate about the status  or  standing  of
its victims, the hapless shelter-seeker who is cheated out of  her  rightful
place on the housing queue for a mere R50, or the  boardroom  executive  who
is  taken  for  a  ride  on  a  get-richer-quick   scam   involving   public
procurement.

Generally, corruption can be described as the  misuse  or  abuse  of  power,
office and/or authority.  Its  practice  is  undertaken  for  gain  and  its
seedbeds are located in the private, public and informal sectors.  It  takes
many forms and can be described in a variety  of  familiar  terms,  such  as
bribery, embezzlement, theft, fraud,  extortion,  intimidation,  favouritism
and/or clientelism.

Corruption's nature is fairly unspecific and there is no way  to  button  it
down neatly and concisely. It manifests itself in a wide range of types  and
formats, but  its  intent  is  clear,  its  purpose  is  to  gain  advantage
nefariously and unfairly. Definitions of corruption  vary  from  country  to
country and even from region to  region  in  accordance  with  a  myriad  of
factors, including social, cultural and legal variables.

Corruption hampers national, economic,  social  and  political  progress  in
developed and developing economies.  It  has  a  consequence,  and  that  is
frustration  in  hardworking  and  honest  citizens  who  eventually  become
distrustful of  decision-makers.  It  impacts  negatively  on  productivity,
undermines administrative efficiency and erodes confidence  in  the  social,
political and economic order. It  is  especially  disruptive  in  developing
economies where human and economic development programmes are  essential  to
mitigating  the  effects  of  poverty,  economic   alienation   and   social
marginalisation.

Money and resource flows  are  effectively  reserved  away  from  the  poor,
vulnerable and needy. Instead, they find their inappropriate destination  in
the hands of the powerful  and  dominant.  Need  simply  falls  out  of  the
equation and greed looms over all else. These reversals  lead  to  political
and  economic  instability,  compromised  infrastructure  provision  and  an
abrogation of services such as education, welfare and  health.  The  greater
the corruption, the greater the negative impact on the general  standard  of
living.

In the context of the African subcontinent,  corruption  and  organised  and
syndicated crime undermine the  regional  capacity  to  reduce  poverty  and
stimulate economic growth. Organised crime and corruption make it  difficult
to  attain  satisfactory  levels  of  sustainable  human  development.  They
undermine the capacity to protect human rights and render  sound  governance
practice based on ethical and professional conduct. Corruption corrodes  the
values that underwrite an  adherence  to  the  rule  of  law  and  the  fair
administration of justice.

It is for these  reasons  that  Nepad  actively  promotes  the  need  for  a
collective  effort  to  achieve  accountable  and  transparent   governance.
Counter measures against corruption and crime are not local issues  anymore,
they are regional and international imperatives.
In conclusion I wish to thank  the  members  of  the  portfolio  and  select
committees  for  their  hard  work.  They   have,   after   many   days   of
deliberations,  produced  an  excellent  product  which  I  am   sure   will
strengthen  the  criminal  justice  system  in  preventing   and   combating
corruption and related nefarious activities.

Thanks must also  go  to  the  departmental  officials  that  supported  the
committees during their deliberations. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, in discussing the topic of  corruption,  I  think
it is fair to say that we need not convince anybody in  this  House  of  the
necessity to combat corruption. The Democratic Alliance takes the  combating
of corruption extremely seriously - in fact, in  the  National  Assembly  we
proposed no less than three Private  Members'  Bills  aimed  at  eradicating
corruption.

As is the hon Deputy Minister's habit in this House,  she  has  given  us  a
fully comprehensive summation of the  entire  Act.  There  are  one  or  two
little points which I think I can draw out, and which I  did  not  hear  the
hon Deputy Minister mention. If she did mention them, I apologise.

There are a number of innovations in the Act. It  is  a  comprehensive  Act,
and the one innovation which  I  think  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  did  not
mention is contained in Chapter 6  and  relates  to  a  register  of  tender
defaulters. This is a very important innovation. As the hon Deputy  Minister
said, corruption undermines our  capacity  for  social  development,  and  I
think particularly in the field of corruption  where  tenders  are  involved
this is particularly true. So I  just  wish  to  emphasise  that  particular
point.

I also wish to re-emphasise that  this  is  an  all-embracing  Bill,  and  I
simply hope, and it is the hope of my party, that the Department of  Justice
will put enough resources into effectively implementing this  Bill  so  that
we can, in fact, eradicate corruption from  our  society.  The  DA  supports
this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, voordat ek dit weer per abuis  nalaat,  wil  ek
graag begin deur adv Gerhard Nel, en almal wat hom bygestaan  het,  baie  te
bedank  vir  hulle  harde  en  uitstekende  werk  ten  opsigte  van  hierdie
wetsontwerp. Dan ook ene dr Jakobs vir sy bekwame en  uitstekende  werk  ten
opsigte van die wetsontwerp wat ons nou-nou gedebatteer het.

Sedert die aanvaarding van die huidige antikorrupsiewet, Wet  94  van  1992,
en dit op ons Wetboek geplaas is, is verskeie  voorstelle  ontvang  vir  die
wysiging van hierdie wetgewing. In plaas daarvan om  die  huidige  wetgewing
net te amendeer, gee hierdie wetsontwerp effek aan  die  voorstelle  vir  'n
volledige hersiening van ons antikorrupsie wetgewing en strategie.

Hierdie wetsontwerp volg die neiging van moderne  internasionale  wetgewing,
naamlik  die  ontbondeling  van  korrupsie,  ingevolge   waarvan   verskeie,
spesifieke, korruptiewe aksies en praktyke gedefinieer en verbied  word,  bo
en behalwe die algemene misdaad van korrupsie wat van toepassing is op  alle
persone in die openbare of privaatsektor.

Die vorige spreker, agb lid Lever, het verwys na die een  geval  van  so  'n
spesifieke korruptiewe aksie of aktiwiteit  wat  nou  verbied  word,  en  'n
spesifieke misdaad gemaak word. Daar is egter verskeie  daarvan  in  hierdie
wetgewing, en ek dink dit is belangrik om net kortliks te verwys na  hierdie
verskillende spesifieke misdrywe wat nou geskep  word,  bo  en  behalwe  die
algemene misdryf van korrupsie.

Daar is die spesifieke misdryf ten opsigte van  openbare  beamptes.  Dan  is
daar een spesifiek ten opsigte van oorsese openbare beamptes. Dan  natuurlik
is daar een wat spesifiek ag slaan op aktiwiteite van agente.  Dan  is  daar
'n ander een wat ek dink tog belangrik is vir ons almal, ook  as  wetgewers,
om van kennis te neem, en dit tog net 'n bietjie  na  te  lees  om  te  sien
spesifiek wat dit sÃª, want soos u weet is onkunde van die  reg  nooit  enige
verweer nie. En daar is die  baie  spesifieke  klousule  7  wat  handel  met
korruptiewe aktiwiteite ten opsigte van lede van wetgewers. En ek  dink  dit
is belangrik dat 'n mens jouself  op  hoogte  bring  van  presies  wat  daar
staan.

Daar is ook een ten opsigte spesifiek van regsprekende beamptes ten  opsigte
van die vervolgingsgesag, die "prosecuting authority" in ons  land.  Dan  is
daar baie spesifiek ook een ten opsigte  van  die  werknemerverhouding,  die
"employment relationship"  soos  dit  daar  gestel  word,  ten  opsigte  van
getuies en bewysmateriaal in sekere verrigtinge.

Dan is daar ook een wat handel met spesifieke aktiwiteite  ten  opsigte  van
kontrakte. En dan natuurlik  die  een  waarna  verwys  is  deur  die  vorige
spreker, die kwessie van tenders. Maar dan is daar  ook  een  wat  spesifiek
slaan op "auctions" ten opsigte van die hele situasie van afslaers  en  waar
daar 'n bod toegeslaan sou word op 'n persoon op 'n korruptiewe manier.  Ook
sportaktiwiteite  en  die  hele  kwessie  van  waar  ons  te  doen  het  met
dobbelaangeleenthede. U sien dus dit  is  baie  belangrik  dat  daar  na  al
hierdie aspekte gekyk word.

Ek wil tog net aanhaal, ten opsigte van hierdie wetgewing, dÃ­t wat  ek  dink
dit werklikwaar mooi saamvat, en adv Gerhard Nel het daarna  verwys  toe  hy
ons as komitee toegespreek het. Dit is 'n aanhaling uit wat mnr  Hennie  van
Vuuren van die Institute for  Security  Studies  in  Desember  verlede  jaar
geskryf het.

Ek haal dit graag soos volg aan:


  The committee that  drafted  the  Prevention  and  Combating  of  Corrupt
  Activities Act has at last given South Africa a piece of legislation that
  has both the teeth and the hallmark  of  innovation  required  to  combat
  graft. The Act which is based on  international  good  practice,  and  is
  being used by the UK House of Commons as a model law  on  which  its  new
  corruption legislation will be  based,  is  one  of  the  last  and  most
  important pieces in South Africa's anti-corruption armoury. It is said to
  work hand in glove  with  legislative  instruments  such  as  the  Public
  Finance Management Act, the Promotion of Access to  Information  Act  and
  the Protected Disclosures Act. Once it is passed by the National  Council
  Of Provinces, as expected in the new year ...

... as we are doing now, and now the important piece -

  ... it will force a mindset shift for both public and private officials.


Ek glo werklik dat hierdie wetgewing daarin  sal  slaag  om  Suid-Afrikaners
daartoe te dwing om opnuut te kyk na alles waarmee hulle besig is, beide  in
die staatsbestel maar ook in die privaatsektor. Dit is  belangrik  dat  alle
Suid-Afrikaners op hoogte gebring word  van  hierdie  wetgewing,  sodat  ons
hierdie kanker wat aan die hart van ons demokrasie knaag finaal die  nekslag
kan  toedien.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, before I  forget  yet  again  by  accident,  I
would like to start by thanking Adv Gerhard Nel and  everyone  who  assisted
him for their hard  and  excellent  work  in  respect  of  this  Bill.  This
includes one Dr Jakobs for his competent and excellent work  in  respect  of
the Bill that we have just debated.

Since the current anticorruption legislation,  Act  94  of  1992,  had  been
passed and placed on the Statute Book, a number of proposals  were  received
regarding amendments to this  legislation.  Instead  of  just  amending  the
current legislation, this Bill gives effect to the proposals for a  complete
review of our anticorruption legislation and strategy.

This Bill follows the trend of modern international legislation, namely  the
unbundling of corruption, according to  which  various  specific  corruptive
actions and practices are defined and prohibited, over and above the  common
crime of graft that is applicable to all persons in the  public  or  private
sector.

The previous speaker, hon member Lever, referred to one instance of  such  a
specific corruptive action that is  now  prohibited  and  has  been  made  a
specific crime. But there are several of them  in  this  legislation  and  I
think it is important to refer briefly  to  these  various  specific  crimes
that are now being created, over and above the common crime of graft.

There is the specific crime in respect of public officials.  Then  there  is
one relating specifically to public officials abroad. Of course, then  there
is one that concerns the activities of agents. Then  there  is  another  one
which I do believe to be of importance to us  all,  also  as  lawmakers,  to
take note of and to read up about in order to see exactly  what  it  is  all
about, for we all know that ignorance of the law is no defence. And then  we
have the very specific clause 7, which deals with the corruptive actions  in
respect of members of the legislature. I believe it is important for  us  to
inform ourselves in respect of exactly what has been written there.

There is also one that concerns officials of the  judiciary  in  respect  of
the prosecuting authority of our country. We also have  one  regarding  very
specifically  the  employment  relationship  in  respect  of  witnesses  and
documentary evidence in certain procedures.

Another one deals with specific actions regarding contracts.  And  then,  of
course, the one referred to by the previous speaker as regards the issue  of
tenders. But there is also one in connection with  auctions  and  the  whole
situation regarding the corruptive way in which an auctioneer can set  up  a
bid for a person. Sport activities also feature, as well as the whole  issue
of gambling. So you see, it is important  that  we  look  at  all  of  these
aspects.

There is something I want to quote  in  respect  of  this  legislation  that
really sums it all up nicely, and Dr Gerhard Nel referred to  this  when  he
addressed our committee. It is a quote from something which  Mr  Hennie  van
Vuuren of the Institute for Security  Studies  wrote  in  December  of  last
year.
I would like to quote this, as follows:


  The committee that  drafted  the  Prevention  and  Combating  of  Corrupt
  Activities Act has at last given South Africa a piece of legislation that
  has both the teeth and the hallmark  of  innovation  required  to  combat
  graft. The Act which is based on  international  good  practice,  and  is
  being used by the UK House of Commons as a model law  on  which  its  new
  corruption legislation will be  based,  is  one  of  the  last  and  most
  important pieces in South Africa's anti-corruption armoury. It is said to
  work hand in glove  with  legislative  instruments  such  as  the  Public
  Finance Management Act, the Promotion of Access to  Information  Act  and
  the Protected Disclosures Act. Once it is passed by the National  Council
  Of Provinces, as expected in the new year ...

... as we are doing now, and now the important piece -


  ... it will force a mindset shift for both public and private officials.
I really believe  that  this  legislation  will  succeed  in  forcing  South
Africans to take another look at the things they are involved  in,  both  in
the public and the private sector. It is important that all  South  Africans
are brought up to date  with  this  legislation,  so  that  we  can  finally
eradicate this cancer that is gnawing at  the  heart  of  our  democracy.  I
thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chair, I think I will just add to what the  Minister  said.
You know, it is very difficult to speak after the  Deputy  Minister  because
most of the time, like Mr Lever said, she is detailed. She  wants  everybody
to understand what is contained in the legislation that is presented  before
this House. I'm not going to spoil her good work.

Regarding the Bill that we are presenting before  you  and  your  honourable
House, when we had a discussion in the committee we all agreed that  it  was
necessary  for  this  House  and  for  everybody  to  adopt  this  piece  of
legislation in order to prevent smart people from  doing  unethical  things.
That's what we are agreed upon. We also agreed that  when  smart  people  do
unethical things, those things affect those who are very poor and we  cannot
accept that kind of situation. We also agreed that it is not  the  knowledge
of members of Parliament but that  it  is  public  knowledge  and  everybody
knows that a lot of unethical and illegal practices are  happening  both  in
the private and public sectors.

We have witnessed, for many years, behaviour which is not acceptable. If  we
may cite an example, in countries like the US, people  who  are  responsible
for big companies, not small companies - some CEOs, etc  -  were  fired  and
some were investigated for doing unethical things. One  wonders  why  people
who are in big companies and people who have a lot of money engage  in  such
activities. Here we are talking about millionaires  many  times  over  being
involved in these things.

What is the situation? What is really happening? Regarding the situation  in
our country, I think the Deputy Minister did indicate  to  us  earlier  that
this legislation is not a new thing. We are not  suggesting  to  this  House
that it must pass new legislation. We  had  a  number  of  other  pieces  of
legislation such as the corruption Act of 2000 and so forth.

What we are now trying to do is to bring together all these things into  one
in order to make sure that we deal with this corruption once  and  for  all.
We don't just want to combat corruption, we also want to prevent it to  make
sure that corruption does not take  place  at  any  level,  whether  in  the
private or public sector, or whether you are just a man in  the  street,  it
doesn't matter. We want to make sure that this corruption does not happen.

I said to you that I don't want  to  spoil  what  the  Deputy  Minister  had
alluded to earlier. On behalf of the committee - because I was requested  by
the acting chairperson to do exactly what I'm doing now - I  would  like  to
thank the department, members of the committee and  members  of  the  public
who participated in these deliberations for assisting us so  that  we  could
come up with this nice  piece  of  legislation.  We  therefore  suggest  and
request that we should adopt the Bill before you. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chair,  I
think we are all agreed that this is  actually  quite  a  special  piece  of
legislation. The hon Lever's mention of the register for tender  defaulters,
for instance, is a really innovative way  of  approaching  this  problem.  I
think that it is something that makes one  feel  very  good  about  being  a
South African if our legislation sets trends,  and  maybe  even  raises  the
standards of expectation and performance. This is probably  a  demonstration
of how Parliament works when it works at its best. It gets legislation  that
has been well-researched, well thought through, and  makes  it  even  better
through deliberation and  consultation.  I  think  this  is  how  Parliament
really shows its mettle and it's a proud day for us.

Mr Matthee demonstrated in his input just through the mention of  sport  how
corruption affects every aspect of our lives. I remember my son's face  when
he heard about Hansie CronjÃ©. He had a huge poster on his  wall.  He  pulled
it down and actually couldn't bring himself to tear it up because  his  hero
had shown himself to be tainted. He folded it into a tiny little square  and
stuck it under a box in his cupboard.

I really thought that the power of example is enormous. Perhaps one  of  the
important  things  about  this  Bill  is  that,  obviously,  it  provides  a
response. But one of the things we  should  be  doing  is  to  promote  good
practice as a normal and standard thing all the time. To  fight  it  is  one
thing but we have to create an expectation in our children  -  and  I  guess
this starts in the home - that they should be proud to be an  asset  to  any
kind of business deal or Government business deal, but that  probity  is  of
absolute primary consideration. I think we have to  raise  our  children  in
such a way that it becomes the norm, so that they expect it  when  they  get
Government service, and so that people who are poor  are  not  paralysed  by
confusion very often.

I was doing door-to-door registrations and that's  why  I  mentioned  people
who were bumped off the housing list. They just disappeared off the  housing
list and they were confused; they didn't know why. What  happened  was  that
someone paid R50 to move up the housing list, and they just moved  down.  So
we need to put in place structures for ourselves to  make  sure  that  those
housing lists are monitored, and that public officials perform  in  the  way
that we expect. It's about the culture of creating a way  of  life  that  is
conducive to development. I'm also so proud that this legislation  is  being
used by the House of Commons as a model for their anticorruption Bill.  It's
a real feather in our cap.

Mr  Maloyi  expressed  the  very  real  issue   around   the   international
implications  when  billions  of  rands  have  an  impact  on  transfrontier
communities, and how  very  often  when  we  pursue  corrupt  officials,  we
imprison or prosecute the one who has accepted a R100 bribe, but  never  the
person who is far more affluent and is the one paying the bribe.  This  Bill
changes that whole equation. They can and will get caught.

I think the attorney-general in Lesotho should be praised for  the  work  he
did under enormous pressure regarding the international  companies  who  had
become involved in corrupt practices. Even when his life was threatened,  he
persisted. I have known him for five years now. The prosecutions  have  gone
through recently and he has really made a point with these prosecutions.

I guess that sums it up. We are all in agreement. It's an individual  issue.
It's about creating, expecting and upholding a standard of  the  way  we  do
business with one another, with corporate business and with Government.

I'm proud that this legislation has been so well-scrutinised by  the  House.
Once again, thank you to the officials who put  so  much  effort  into  this
legislation. It is a good day for South Africa, for this Parliament and  for
the NCOP in particular. We  have  produced  a  fine  piece  of  legislation.
[Applause.]

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

House adjourned at 15:17.

TABLINGS

National Council of Provinces

1.    The Chairperson


     Eleventh Report of the Working Group on the African Union (AU):


     Following on its Tenth Report, adopted by  the  House  on  26  November
     2003, the Working Group would like to report as follows:


     (1)    Submission of names of PAP Members to AU Commission


         The Working Group in its Tenth Report recommended  that  5  Members
         be elected to represent Parliament in the  Pan  African  Parliament
         (PAP), in terms of Article 4(2)  of  the  Protocol  which  provides
         that each Member State shall be  represented  in  the  Pan  African
         Parliament by 5 Parliamentarians, at least one of whom shall  be  a
         woman.


         On 26 November 2003, the following Members were  elected:  Dr  F  N
         Ginwala, Ms M A A Njobe, Mr M J Mahlangu, Dr  B  L  Geldenhuys  and
         Prof H Ngubane  and  the  names  have  been  submitted  to  the  AU
         Commission.


         The AU Commission has indicated that it has now received the  names
         of the Members from 23 Parliaments. As some had  not  provided  all
         the required information (gender and  political  affiliation),  the
         Commission will  be  sending  a  further  communication  requesting
         standardised  formats  for  required  information,  including   the
         language preference of each Member and  whether  each  Member  will
         take an oath or make a solemn declaration.


     (2)    Arrangements for the Inaugural Session and the First Session


         (a)     Date and programme


              The date for the Inaugural Session has been set as  18  March
              2004 in Addis Ababa. The Inaugural Session will  be  preceded
              by regional meetings which are scheduled for  17  March  2004
              and followed by the First Session of the PAP from  19  to  20
              March 2004. The Steering Committee at its meeting held on  13
              and 14 February  2004  adopted  a  draft  programme  for  the
              Inaugural Session for consideration by the Chairperson of the
              AU, President J Chissano. It  also  agreed  a  programme  for
              adoption by the First Session of the PAP.


         (b)     Oath of Office


              The Steering Committee has  agreed  the  Oath  of  Office  or
              Affirmation for Members and for Presiding Officers,  in  each
              of the 4 official languages of the AU.


         (c)     Observers


              In addition to the 5 Members, each Member Parliament may send
              3 observers to attend the Inaugural Session. The Speaker will
              submit names of observers to the Chief Whips.
         (d)     Secondment of Staff


              The Commission will be writing to  Members  of  the  Steering
              Committee and the African Foreign Missions in Addis Ababa  to
              request them to second staff.


     (3)    Rules for the Inaugural Session


       Article 11 (8) of the Protocol empowers the PAP to adopt its Rules of
         Procedure.


       The Steering Committee has adopted Draft Rules  for  the  PAP.  These
         Rules will be considered and adopted at the First Session.


     (4)    Nomination and election of the President of the PAP


       In terms of the Article 12 (2) of the Protocol, the PAP will  at  its
         first sitting, elect from among its Members and in accordance  with
         its  Rules  of  Procedure,  a  President  and  4  Vice   Presidents
         representing the regions of Africa. According to the Protocol,  the
         election of the President will  take  place  during  the  Inaugural
         Session and  be  presided  over  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  AU.
         National   Parliaments   may    nominate    candidates.    Regional
         consultations will be held to nominate a candidate from the  region
         from  amongst  the  nominations  from  National  Parliaments.   The
         election will be by secret ballot of all Members.


     (5)    Nomination and election of the Vice Presidents


       The Draft Rules provide that the  region  from  which  the  President
         comes is excluded from the ballot for Vice Presidents. Each of  the
         4 remaining regions will nominate two candidates  per  region,  one
         of whom must be a woman.


       Each ballot paper will have two sections: Section 1 for the nominated
         women candidates exclusively and Section 2 for all  candidates.  In
         Section 1 of the ballot, the names of the women candidates will  be
         listed in alphabetical order indicating their respective regions.


       Each delegate must vote for one woman on  Section  1  of  the  ballot
         paper. Ballot papers which do not indicate a valid vote on  Section
         1 will be  disqualified.  Each  delegate  may  also  vote  for  one
         candidate from each of the regions  on  Section  2  of  the  ballot
         paper. Section 2 will be counted first. Should there  be  no  woman
         candidate amongst the top 4 votes, the woman with the highest  vote
         from Section 1 of the ballot paper will replace the candidate  from
         the corresponding region in Section 2 of the ballot.


       Section 1  of  the  ballot  will  only  be  considered  if  no  women
         candidates are voted as one of the Vice Presidents in Section 2  of
         the ballot. The election will be  by  simple  majority  of  Members
         present and voting.


     (6)    Rules of Debate


       A minimum set of Rules of Debate has also been agreed to.


     (7)    Establishment of committees


       Article 12(13) of the Protocol provides that the  PAP  may  establish
         such committees, as it deems fit, for the proper discharge  of  its
         functions and in accordance with its Rules of Procedure.


       According to the Draft Rules, the Bureau will constitute the Business
         Committee of the PAP. At its first session, the PAP will  establish
         the following ad hoc Committees:


         (a)     Rules Committee
         (b)     Budget Committee
         (c)     Credentials Committee


         These ad hoc Committees will be composed of 3  representatives  per
         region and will be appointed by the House.


     (8)    Reporting Mechanisms


       The Working Group has previously highlighted the need for  Parliament
         to consider how the five Members of the PAP will report.


2.    The Working Group recommends:


       That the next Parliament prioritises the establishment of a committee
         to process and deal with issues emanating from the African Union.

1.    Report of the  Select  Committee  on  Social  Services  on  the  South
     African Social Security Agency Bill [B 51B - 2003] (National Assembly -
     sec 76), dated 23 February 2004:


         The Select Committee on  Social  Services,  having  considered  the
         subject of the South African Social Security Agency Bill [B  51B  -
         2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), referred  to  it,  reports  the
         Bill with amendments [B 51C - 2003].


         The Committee further reports as follows:


         Need to Amend Transitional Provisions


         In discussion of amendments to the  Social  Security  Agency  Bill,
         the Select Committee noted  that  additional  amendments  to  these
         Bills would need to be considered early  in  the  next  Parliament.
         These amendments are necessitated by  two  developments  since  the
         bills were introduced.


         First,  the  National  Assembly  made  changes  to  the  governance
         arrangements    to    provide    statutory    responsibility    for
         administration of social  assistance  to  the  Agency.  While  this
         strengthens the governance model, it changed key  elements  related
         to the transition.


         Secondly, the High Court ruled in the case of Mashavha  versus  the
         President and Minister of Social Development  that  the  assignment
         of administration to the provinces is invalid and  that  Government
         must  correct  the  defect  by  1   April   2004.    Although   the
         Constitutional  Court  must  still  consider  the  order  during  a
         hearing on 26 February 2004, if they confirm the High  Court  order
         then Government will be left with neither a valid legal  basis  for
         provincial  administration  of  grants  nor  national  capacity  to
         deliver grants.
         The current Bills do not provide  for  the  continued  delivery  of
         social assistance by Provinces in  the  interim  period  while  the
         Agency is being established and national  government  is  ready  to
         take over administration and delivery. This  transfer  to  National
         will presumably be on a Province-by-Province basis phased  in  over
         several years.


         The Select Committee  therefore  advises  that  amendments  to  the
         transitional provisions be  considered  urgently  by  the  incoming
         Parliament.

2.    Report of the Select  Committee  on  Social  Services  on  the  Social
     Assistance Bill [B 57B - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76),  dated  23
     February 2004:


         The Select Committee on  Social  Services,  having  considered  the
         subject of the Social Assistance Bill  [B  57B  -  2003]  (National
         Assembly  -  sec  76),  referred  to  it,  reports  the  Bill  with
         amendments [B 57C - 2003].


         The Committee further reports as follows:


         Definition and Eligibility Matters to be  Resolved  in  the  Social
         Assistance Bill


         The Select Committee noted that further consideration in  the  next
         Parliament should be given to the definition of "care  dependency",
         eligibility requirements for care dependency and the definition  of
         "social assistance" in the Social Assistance Bill, 2003.


         With regard to the  definition  of  "care  dependency",  there  are
         inconsistencies  between  sections  1  and  7.   With   regard   to
         eligibility  requirements  the  language  in  the  Bill  introduces
         significant policy changes that need  to  be  fully  considered  by
         Government.  Lastly,  the  definition  of  "social  assistance"  in
         section 1 is inconsistent with the definition  of  "social  grants"
         in the same section.
