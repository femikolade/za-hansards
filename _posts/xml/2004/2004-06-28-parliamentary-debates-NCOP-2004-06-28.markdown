ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  at  the  next  sitting
day of the Council I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the Ekurhuleni Metro is in the process of finding a suitable site  on
       which a R600 million hospital is to be built to serve  the  residents
       of Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus (Kathorus);
  (2) the decision to build a new facility was taken due to the Natalspruit
       Hospital being situated in an area riddled with sinkholes, where  the
       ground is gradually subsiding owing to underground soil  erosion  and
       failed attempts to stabilise the hospital foundation;


  (3) although this is a decision worth applauding, there is great  concern
       that the new facility could  be  built  in  an  area  that  would  be
       inaccessible to the poor, hence causing more problems for  those  who
       do not have money to spend on transportation costs; and


  (4) it is important for this facility to be built in an area  that  would
       make it neutrally accessible to all the people of Thokoza,  Vosloorus
       and Katlehong.

Mnr A WATSON: Agb Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat  die  DA  met  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met kommer kennis neem van die gerapporteerde pogings  van  die  Nuwe
       Nasional Party om weer eens 'n groot donasie te bekom in ruil vir die
       toekenning van sekere ontwikkelingsregte in Stellenbosch; en


  (2) sulke dade of pogings tot misbruik van magte onomwonde verwerp.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting day of the Council I will move on behalf of the DA:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the reported attempts by the New National Party to
       yet again obtain a big donation in exchange  for  the  allocation  of
       certain development rights in Stellenbosch; and


  (2) unequivocally rejects such actions or attempts to abuse power.]

   CONGRATULATIONS TO COACH JAKE WHITE AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMIT ON SPRINGBOK
                           INTERNATIONAL TEST WINS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU:  Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Springboks successfully completed their hat  trick  of
       international test wins, culminating in a devastating,  comprehensive
       defeat of Wales  by  53-18  last  Saturday,  26  June  2004,  thereby
       signalling the resuscitation of SA rugby of the halcyon days of yore;


  (2) congratulates coach Jake White and captain John Smit for their team's
       meritorious performances and expresses the hope that the  Springboks'
       impending expedition down under next Monday for the tri-nations  tour
       in their quest for  equally  satisfying  victories  against  the  All
       Blacks and the Wallabies will be crowned with success;

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

    CONGRATULATIONS TO SARS COMMISSIONER PRAVIN GORDHAN ON RE-ELECTION AS
          CHAIRPERSON OF COUNCIL FOR THE WORLD CUSTOMS ORGANISATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Council for the World Customs  Organisation  held  its
       104th session at the weekend in Brussels, Belgium;


  (2) further notes, with delight, that  SA  Revenue  Service  Commissioner
       Pravin Gordhan was  unanimously  re-elected  as  Chairperson  of  the
       Council for the World Customs  Organisation  for  a  historic  fourth
       time; and


  (3) extends its congratulations to Mr Gordhan and  acknowledges  that  he
       will execute his duties with distinction.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ANC ON ITS VICTORY IN RECENT BY-ELECTIONS IN THE
                                EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B N DLULANE: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the decisive victory of the ANC in the recent  by-elections  in
       wards 4, 18, 19 and 30 of the KSD Municipality in the Eastern Cape;


  (2) believes the results constitute a complete rejection of the  policies
       of organisations such as the UDM whose control of  these  wards  have
       not translated into any meaningful improvement in the quality of life
       of people living in this municipality;


  (3)  further  believes  the  ANC's  victory  is  an  affirmation  of  the
       confidence people have  in  the  ability  of  the  ANC  as  the  only
       organisation that can ensure access to affordable  services  for  the
       people in the KSD Municipality; and


  (4) congratulates the ANC on its victory.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

Vote No 10 - Public Service and Administration:

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson,  hon  members
and delegates, three days ago members of the executive arm of Government  of
all three spheres of government met at a special workshop in Pretoria.  This
was an occasion for  us  as  government  practitioners  to  reflect  on  our
institutional circumstances, and to orchestrate intersphere  synergies  that
are favourable to the realisation of a high-growth economic trajectory.

As members and delegates will recall, apartheid exclusionary  policies  were
based on the employment of the  trope  of  South  Africa  as  a  country  of
nations, each with the possibility of  developing  along  its  own  separate
lines. The  ideology  of  politico-economic  exclusion  and  domination  was
entrenched through a racially based tricameral  parliament;  ten  Bantustans
with feeble legislative and executive powers and functions; four  provincial
administrative  entities;  and  a  racially  segregated  system   of   local
government.

The sinister legacy of that government system and its policies  continue  to
define the social, political and economic challenges  of  present-day  South
Africa.  As  we  speak,  an  intolerably  high  number  of  people  live  in
households  that  are  not  electrified;   households   that   are   without
sanitation; households that  are  without  clean  drinkable  water,  or  are
unable to access  services  for  refuse  removal.  Millions  of  people  are
without jobs and many able-bodied citizens have been reduced  to  recipients
of social grants.

We came into government in 1994 inspired by a vision that assigns to  public
institutions and policy the role of mobilising  the  economic  resources  of
our country towards the betterment of the lives of all our people.  In  1996
Parliament  codified  this  our  vision  through  the   enactment   of   the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The  Constitution  establishes
three distinctive, interdependent and interrelated spheres of government.
Drawing from the reservoir of our ten years of experience we should be  able
at least to present some tentative perspectives on the best possible way  of
organising ourselves, in order to be equal to the tasks that our entry  into
the second decade of freedom  entails.  The  experience  of  ten  years  has
produced a balance sheet, which  is  at  once  a  source  of  pride  to  our
Government and a source of optimism to millions of South Africans,  who  for
decades were condemned to a life bereft of hope.

Whereas in 1994 only 2,6 million people were benefiting from various  social
grants, by 2003 the number  of  citizens  covered  by  our  social  net  had
increased to 6,8 million. In 1996, 60%  of  the  households  had  access  to
clean water. By 2001 the number of households with  access  to  clean  water
had risen to 85%. In 1996, 32% of households  had  electricity  connections.
By 2001 the coverage of electricity connections had been extended to 70%  of
our country's households. And, whereas in 1994 only 49%  of  households  had
access to sanitation, by 2001  the  number  of  households  with  access  to
sanitation had risen to 63%.

On  the  basis  of  the  foregoing  experience  we  understand  that  social
consensus,  to  which  Government  must  be  responsive,  is  mandating   an
improvement in the performance of the state. The state is being called  upon
to increase its own capacity for poverty alleviation  and  reinforcement  of
national  pride.  This  goal  can   only   be   achieved   through   focused
implementation of policy, better integration and  alignment  across  spheres
of Government, and improved contact between Government and the people.

Quite clearly  we  need  an  intergovernmental  relations  framework,  which
provides for greater opportunity to give practical effect to the government-
wide programme of action. It must allow our three spheres of government  the
possibility to function more and more as an integrated  and  coherent  unit.
The synergies we call for must be  manifested  in  the  areas  of  strategic
planning, budgeting and implementation of Government  policy.  In  practical
terms, all three spheres  of  government  must  be  single-minded  in  their
pursuit of the goals of the moment.

They must work together to ensure an improvement in the provision  of  basic
services to our people, and to ensure a proper alignment between the  policy
on free basic services and our  policy  on  indigence.  They  must  together
facilitate the provision of social grants to deserving citizens.  They  must
make it possible for line-function departments, which are charged  with  the
responsibility of providing electricity and  clean  water,  to  realise  the
agreed targets.

The plans of all the entities that comprise our spheres of  government  must
indicate how they are all going to contribute to the task of providing  more
than 300 000 households with basic sanitation during the  current  financial
year. What I have just outlined are  the  immediate  short-term  steps  that
need to be undertaken. In the medium  to  long  term  we  have  to  craft  a
framework that effectively  responds  to  the  report  of  the  Presidential
Review Commission, which was released in February 1998.

The report concluded that improved  information  flows  between  and  within
sectors  in  all  spheres  of  government  is  a  matter   of   considerable
importance. It also stated that intergovernmental  relations  between  local
government  and  the  other  two  spheres  is  weak  and  will  need  to  be
strengthened. It observed that there is a strong need  for  the  development
of a co-ordinating mechanism  at  national  level,  and  that  there  is  no
institution assigned with responsibility  for  overall  planning  at  either
national or provincial level. This will need to be addressed.
Subsequent to the release of the Commission's report,  Government  conducted
an intergovernmental relations audit, which  reached  many  conclusions  and
made a number of recommendations. The audit report was released at  the  end
of 1999. Among other things, the report noted  that  there  was  a  lack  of
interaction between local,  provincial  and  national  governments  as  they
strategise for growth and development.

Municipalities do not interact with  provincial  government  in  formulating
integrated development plans, and likewise, provincial budgets are  compiled
without reference to local plans. The report said that there is  a  need  to
develop the capacity of organised local government  and  to  facilitate  the
interaction between municipalities, provincial and national governments.  It
also  urged  provincial  government  to  budget   for   municipal   support,
monitoring and intervention.

By the end of the first term of democratic government the  intergovernmental
relations system was clearly very young and  it  lacked  coherence  in  many
areas. However, with the establishment of the new  local  government  system
at the end of 2000 it became possible to conceive of  the  intergovernmental
relations system more holistically, and to focus on areas  that  are  crying
out for refinement.

As honourable  members  are  aware,  we  have  Minmecs,  which  function  as
sectoral forums to co-ordinate work in areas  of  concurrent  responsibility
between national and provincial  spheres.  The  other  two  structures,  the
Budget Council and the Budget Forum,  provide  opportunities  for  provinces
and municipalities to work with national Government on budgetary and  fiscal
policy matters.

In addition to these, we established the President's  Co-ordinating  Council
in October 1999. The PCC is there for the purpose of enhancing  the  ability
of the provincial executive councils and the South African Local  Government
Association to impact on the elaboration of national priorities.

The above-mentioned experiments have resulted in  marked  improvements  with
regard to the promotion of  intersphere  dialogue  and  co-ordination.  They
enabled us to forge delivery-oriented partnerships around  initiatives  such
as the Integrated Sustainable Rural  Development  Programme  and  the  Urban
Renewal Programme. These experiences bear on future lessons to be  taken  on
board as we implement the Extended Public Works Programme and the  Municipal
Infrastructure Grant for which the respective amounts  of  R45  billion  and
R15, 6 billion have been allocated.

It is our intention to put before this House and the National  Assembly  the
Intergovernmental Relations Framework Bill. The Bill will serve in the  next
session of the House. We  look  forward  to  insightful  contributions  from
members and delegates. The Bill is meant to take us to  the  next  stage  in
the learning curve. Above  all,  it  is  meant  to  improve  our  collective
capacity for serving our country and our people. We look forward to your co-
operation. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Hon  Chairperson,
hon members, delegates and community members who have joined us  here  today
as part of the audience to this august House, as  stated  by  my  colleague,
Minister Mufamadi, South Africa  is  indeed  a  diverse  country  with  many
differences, including regional ones. However, we have a shared  reality  of
those who are comfortable and self-sufficient, and those who  are  indigent,
and largely dependent on the state for social services and  assistance  with
survival.

Ours is the reality of two economies, and the challenge  facing  us  at  the
beginning of our second decade  of  democratic  governance  is  to  use  the
machinery of the state to bridge  the  divide  between  them.  We  must  not
accept that poverty is the permanent fate of some, and prosperity  the  fate
of others. Nor should we think  that  the  two  economies  are  a  permanent
feature of our society. We should  rather  understand  the  current  context
from a historical perspective and recognise that it can be changed.

The African writer and intellectual, Ben Okri, reminds us that  we,  at  the
start of the 21st Century, need to take action to create a new world:


  Will you be at the harvest,
  Among the gatherers of new fruits?
  Then you must begin today to remake
  Your mental and spiritual world,
  And join the warriors and celebrants
  Of freedom, realisers of great dreams.

My Ministry is responsible for creating policy frameworks for the  whole  of
the public service regarding the transformation of the human  resources  and
organisational aspects  of  this  massive  organisation.  It  comprises  the
Department  for  Public  Service  and  Administration,  the  South   African
Management Development Institute, the State  Information  Technology  Agency
and the Centre for Public Service Innovation, which provide  the  frameworks
and policy  platforms  that  line  departments  need  to  succeed  in  their
programmes.

The Public Service Commission which reports to Parliament, and whose  budget
vote is appropriated via this Ministry,  monitors  and  evaluates  practices
and  promotes  professional  ethics  in  the  Public  Service.   The   close
relationship with Parliament serves as an important democratic check of  the
legislature over the executive branch of government.

The electorate has given us a strong mandate during the  last  election  for
the policy agenda of the ANC to prevail in all provinces. In  this  way,  we
can ensure the absolute unity of vision and commitment to our  developmental
goals.

We noted in the respective state of the province addresses by  premiers  the
recognition granted to the kinds of initiatives  that  we  drive  from  this
portfolio, and how they indicated that they have put  in  place  initiatives
and mechanisms to take forward the required priorities and issues.

Our premiers understand the centrality of the  capacity  and  capability  of
our human as well as organisational resources. They understand the need  for
us to have a longer-term perspective on improving public sector  employment,
through initiatives such as Premier Molewa's introduction of Public  Service
bursary schemes. They  recognise  the  need  for  diversity  management  and
affirmative action through the involvement of women  in  policy  formulation
such as Premier Shilowa's women dialogue meetings and the  establishment  of
gender units in all departments and all local governments in  KwaZulu-Natal.
Premier Rasool, among others,  has  flagged  the  very  important  issue  of
better  integration  between  government  departments   and   also   between
parastatals, nongovernmental organisations, communities and businesses.  Our
premiers understand the importance of ICT  and  anticorruption  in  ensuring
that we make the best  of  our  public  resources  in  order  to  fast-track
improvement of life for our people.

The past ten years have been devoted to creating a public service  framework
that has addressed the apartheid legacy while creating a  platform  for  the
future. The next phase of the public sector  transformation  will  make  the
People's Contract a reality.

We have six broad-based priority areas in the coming few  years.  The  first
is to ensure that administrative practices are in line  with  the  drive  to
create a developmental state and that Batho Pele is wholeheartedly  embraced
as the integrating organisational  culture  for  the  whole  of  the  public
service. Secondly, we are focusing on the development and management of  our
human  resources.  Thirdly,  we  are  looking   at   improving   governance,
leadership and management; and fourthly, revisiting  the  macro-organisation
of the state to ensure  that  integration  and  co-ordination  are  enabled,
addressing the need  for  a  single  public  service  and  streamlining  the
activities of diverse state owned entities.

In terms of the last two areas, we  are  looking  at  preparing  for  better
policy implementation by, amongst other things,  building  our  capacity  to
support and intervene where needed and removing unnecessary red  tape  where
possible and finally, strengthening monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  so
that decision-making is evidence-based rather than drawing on assumptions.

Creating an effective and professional Public Service requires  a  focus  on
both management and administration.  Public  management  involves  mastering
the art of governance,  including  giving  meaning  to  principles  such  as
effectiveness,   efficiency,   transparency   and   accountability,    while
administration is about the day-to-day  systems  and  procedures  that  make
governance  work  so  that  institutions  and  resources   are   effectively
utilised. Batho Pele is the  Public  Service's  improvement  programme,  and
over the coming  year  it  will  be  expanded  and  made  more  visible  and
effective. We will see visits, spot checks and  inspections  being  used  to
assess general compliance with Batho Pele requirements.

The Public Service Human Resource Development Strategy is now in  place  and
workshops have been held to communicate it and help departments  to  develop
their own strategies. Cabinet has  approved  proposals  to  institutionalise
and strengthen  internships  and  learnerships  in  the  Public  Service  as
vehicles to fight unemployment and to develop skills  targeting  the  youth,
school leavers and unemployed graduates. An amount of R106 million has  been
made available to the Public Service Seta from the National Skills Fund  for
this exciting project, which will form a major component  of  its  work  for
the coming year. We are committed to ensuring that the Public  Service  Seta
functions better, and we are going to use the next three months  to  put  in
place  a  turnaround  strategy   which   will   review   the   institutional
arrangements as they stand. There are a  number  of  other  areas  that  one
could refer to on skills development but there is no enough time today.

In terms of  partners  in  building  Public  Service  skills,  an  important
component  of  building  professionalism  in  the  Public  Service  is   the
maintenance of sound relations between the state as employer and the  people
who work for it. We are at the moment involved in  a  collective  bargaining
process. I'm not going to talk  about  percentage  increases  and  what  the
outcome will be because we  have  put  in  place  that  institution  and  we
negotiate within  that  institution,  and  not  elsewhere.  However,  a  new
multiterm agreement needs to be negotiated, while restructuring will  remain
a priority area.

Macro benefits such as a housing and medical aid as well  as  the  issue  of
the determination and retention  of  scarce  skills  will  be  high  on  the
collective bargaining  agenda.  Assistance  and  advice  to  departments  on
labour relations matters, as well the handling of disputes  that  impact  on
national  human  resources  and  labour  relations  policies   or   national
agreements, will remain a focus area. It is also envisaged that  the  labour
relations framework for the Public Service will be  implemented  during  the
course of this financial year.

We will strongly rely on  the  leadership  in  labour  unions  and  employee
organisations to assist with promoting  the  change  in  the  organisational
culture that we seek to bring about in the Public Service and the  promotion
of the developmental agenda, as outlined in the political programme  of  the
ANC, the majority party  in  this  Government  and  Parliament.  Encouraging
commitments in this regard is forthcoming from the labour leadership.

Corruption  is  recognised  globally  as  a  major  threat  to   sustainable
development. Provinces are playing a crucial role in  fighting  the  corrupt
behaviour of officials. During the weekend we saw the  success  achieved  by
the health MEC from the Gauteng province  who  announced  the  dismissal  of
government officials who were found guilty of theft  of  state  property  in
the health system. In November a national  anticorruption  forum  will  take
place. It will include a diverse range of stakeholders. The  Public  Service
Commission will lead this multisectoral task team. The forum secretariat  is
arranging this summit.

The hon Minister Mufamadi referred to the issue of integration in much  more
detail, but I just want to emphasise that currently the  Public  Service  in
South Africa comprises national  and  provincial  government.  It  does  not
include the local government spheres and public  entities.  We  have  agreed
that a single Public Service  should  be  created,  encompassing  all  three
levels of government. A comprehensive review of public entities should  take
place in order to maximise integration. An overarching regulatory  framework
for public entities will be developed in  line  with  the  findings  of  the
project that we are working on. It will be completed by the end of July.  We
trust that these findings will also result  in  improvements  at  provincial
and local levels.

The Batho Pele e-gateway provides comprehensive information on  Government's
services, from a single portal that can be found at the  Government  website
which is www.services.gov.za. I would encourage all  members  and  delegates
of this Council to visit that website. The President in his response to  his
Budget Vote urged members to answer the questionnaire that appears  on  this
site. I am sure all members are proficient in their ICT skills and  will  be
able  to  do  so.  Access  to  the  portal  will  be  possible  at  selected
multipurpose community centres and at Post Office Internet terminals.

We have, for the purposes of  the  launch  at  the  end  of  July,  made  it
accessible across eight of the nine  provinces  at  specific  MPCC  centres.
Sixteen new MPCCs will be launched at the end of this year, and a plan  will
be finalised to have at least one of these in  each  of  our  284  municipal
areas.

By the end of this year the first community development workers  would  have
completed  their  initial  training.  They  will  then  be  working  in  the
jurisdiction of various local  authorities,  while  being  employed  by  the
respective provincial governments. These community development  workers  are
Public Service employees of a new type. They are tasked with  serving  as  a
catalyst and bringing services into communities while also  releasing  those
energies and resources that are found in communities.

These new public servants will contribute towards integration by helping  to
align development initiatives with local plans and processes.  However,  the
institutional arrangements for managing these human  resources  are  complex
and are bound to lead to some  initial  problems.  We  will  rely  on  role-
players, such as members  of  Parliament,  to  assist  in  facilitating  the
smooth institutionalisation of these  workers,  and  to  form  part  of  the
learning network and action research team that  we  intend  creating  around
the implementation of the community development workers.

In my last Budget Vote I spoke about  the  initiative,  "From  Red  Tape  to
Smart Tape", which is about  easing  the  administrative  burden  of  Public
Service delivery. We have launched a red tape challenge, and in the  process
we hope to put red tape at the centre of the Public  Service  discourse  and
attention. The first challenge ends at the end of July,  after  which  point
the  most  innovative  and  effective  solutions  will   be   selected   for
recognition and implementation.

In terms of special interventions, members  may  recall  and  be  very  much
aware of the Eastern Cape intervention. The President  and  the  Premier  of
the Eastern Cape commissioned this late in 2002. The Premier's  Office,  the
provincial treasury, the Department of  Public  Service  and  Administration
and the Public Service Commission managed this intervention by  deploying  a
multiskilled  and  multidepartmental  team  with  the  co-operation  of  the
Eastern Cape. Today I  want  to  announce  that  we  have,  in  great  part,
implemented the turnaround plans developed in the first half of last year.

In  consultation  with  Premier  Balindlela,  we   have   also   established
arrangements that will ensure ownership and sustainability to  complete  the
implementation. We have also identified  additional  activities  to  support
these processes and arrangements.  A  monitoring  mechanism  has  also  been
established in the office  of  the  Premier,  with  representatives  of  the
relevant  national  departments  participating.  We  will  be   creating   a
dedicated capacity in my portfolio to attend to  the  increase  in  requests
for assistance with the implementation of  our  policy  frameworks,  and  to
improve on Public Service delivery. We will be  working  very  closely  with
Minister Mufamadi on this initiative. The President  also  alluded  to  this
matter.

We see this as a very important role for ourselves with regard  to  national
and provincial administration. We  also  trust  that  stronger  capacity  at
provincial level will result in ensuring that  the  constitutional  role  of
providing support to local authorities, where required, will be fulfilled.

In terms of innovation and strategies for  learning  and  growing,  we  have
observed that our provinces are very  strong  at  solving  problems  and  at
implementing  innovative  solutions.  This  has   also   been   acknowledged
internationally by the United  Nations  and  the  Commonwealth  through  the
shortlisting of various initiatives. We have seen the programmes rolled  out
in provinces. I will  not  go  into  those  examples  today,  but  they  are
available in more detail in the input that I am delivering.

I  further  wish  to  stress  the  importance  of  accurate   and   reliable
information in improving  performance.  The  President  made  the  call  for
monitoring and evaluation to be treated as  a  national  priority.  We  have
noted that several of our provincial Premiers have chosen to highlight  this
aspect during their respective state of the  province  addresses  that  they
delivered since April.

A Government-wide framework  should  comprise  a  number  of  differentiated
systems, brought together in an integrated analysis centre, which  are  able
to give meaning to a limited number of defined  focus  inputs.  This  system
will rely on  complete  integration  and  seamless  functioning  across  the
traditional divides of the spheres of government. We believe  that  such  an
integrated system will  facilitate  learning,  performance  improvement  and
accountability.

The  thread  needed  to  link  the  many  elements  of  the  Public  Service
management framework is  that  of  performance  management.  While  a  basic
policy and implementation framework is already in place,  it  is  not  being
implemented with the necessary rigour. Departments have had the  opportunity
to implement and apply the performance management and development system  at
senior management level for just over two years now. Unfortunately we  still
get feedback from many departments and various provinces where  this  system
is still not implemented at the  management  level.  Over  the  coming  year
performance management practices will  be  promoted,  and  we  will  provide
various  kinds  of  support  to  ensure  that  that   policy   gets   better
implemented.

In conclusion, I would like to state that as  a  proud  member  of  the  ANC
Government it is important  to  take  forward  the  clear  mandate  we  have
received earlier this  year.  This  mandate  is  captured  in  the  People's
Contract. The programmes that have been presented to this House in the 2004-
05 Budget Vote directly address this People's Contract.

I would like to express my gratitude to the Chairperson and members  of  the
Select  Committee  on  Local  Government  and  Public  Service   for   their
consistent support and dedication. It is welcomed that  this  committee  has
already started to assert itself much more strongly,  especially  since  our
work programme has a significant provincial aspect to it.

I would also like to thank the Chairperson of the Public Service  Commission
and all commissioners, the directors-general and  chief  executive  officers
of the institutions in my portfolio. I would like to announce  to  the  NCOP
that Professor Richard Levin has been appointed as Director-General for  the
Department of Public Service  and  Administration.  I  would  also  like  to
extend a special word of thanks to Mr Alvin Phumudzo Rapea  for  carrying  a
heavy burden whilst acting as director-general of this  department  over  an
extended  period.  This  happened  when  a  significant  component  of   the
department, including the former DG, were deployed to the Eastern Cape.

I want to thank the various boards that have served under me.  I  also  wish
to state that without these officials the department and institutions  would
not have performed as they did. So they should take a bow, but  work  harder
as well. We can see that the pressure is on.

It would be remiss of me if I did not thank my  family:  my  husband,  Jabu,
for his commitment and camaraderie; Nothando, Themba and Solomzi  for  their
love, support and their critique of our work - and  they  are  the  greatest
critics. I also  wish  to  thank  my  mother  and  mother-in-law  for  their
understanding and support.

The challenge remains that the building of the  necessary  ethos  and  value
systems amongst our public servants, and across all  of  our  public  sector
organisations continues. I have quoted Ben  Okri  earlier,  and  I  want  to
conclude again with his words:


  You can't remake the world without remaking yourself. Each new era begins
  within. It is an inward event with unsuspected possibilities.  For  inner
  liberation, we could use it to turn on our inward lights. We could use it
  to use even the dark and negative things positively. We could use the new
  era to clean our eyes to see ourselves more clearly. Only free people can
  make a free world.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, we had a gentleperson's agreement between  myself
and the programming Whip, including the Ministers, that I am  going  to  get
the remnants of their time. This means that what you see in front of you  as
the time given to me to address the House is not accurate.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  has  not  been
communicated to me.

Mr S SHICEKA: Hon Deputy  Chairperson,  Ministers,  Deputy  Minister,  MECs,
special delegates and colleagues, the committee undertook  a  budget  review
of the Votes of the Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  the
Department of Public Service  and  Administration,  SAMDI  as  well  as  the
Public  Service  Commission.  We  also  engaged  the   National   House   of
Traditional Leaders, the State Information Technology Agency  and  Municipal
Demarcation Board.

The responsibility of the governance and administration cluster  is  not  to
put mortar and bricks on the ground, but to  build  structures  and  develop
systems of a developmental state. They should be combat-ready to  decisively
deliver services aimed at creating a better life for  all  our  people.  The
structures must be aligned and be able to talk to one another, and  build  a
culture of respect within the Public Service  that  views  its  citizens  as
employers and bosses.

Allow me briefly to look at where we come from; where we are  and  therefore
where we want to be.  The  most  significant  achievement  in  the  area  of
transformation since 1994 has been the dismantling of  the  apartheid  state
and all its remnants and  laying  the  foundation  for  the  creation  of  a
nonsexist, nonracial, democratic and developmental state. This  process  has
seen  the  shift  from  over  1  200  racially  based  municipalities,  four
administrations  and  10  Bantustans  into  an  ultimately  strong   central
government, nine provinces and 284  democratically  elected  municipalities.
This revolutionary change was made possible by the quest and the  commitment
of our people to elect  leaders  of  their  choice  in  the  three  previous
national and provincial elections, as well  as  the  2000  local  government
elections.

In the past 10 years the intergovernmental relations and  the  co-ordination
of the different spheres of government have surely  and  steadily  improved.
National and provincial  spheres  of  government  are  increasingly  working
together in  a  collaborative  and  co-ordinatory  manner  on  key  national
priority programmes, such as development planning, provision of  free  basic
services, municipal  infrastructure,  municipal  investment,  urban  renewal
programmes and integrated sustainable rural development.

The Budget for the 2004-2005 financial year and  the  medium-term  has  been
informed by the anticipated electoral  victory.  Priorities  and  programmes
have been aligned to Government's broad strategic  outlook,  which  includes
building a people's contract that would unite South Africans in  efforts  to
create  jobs,  fight  poverty,  reinforce  national   pride,   improve   the
performance of the state  through  focused  implementation,  achieve  better
integration and alignment across  all  spheres  of  government  as  well  as
direct contact with our  people,  to  address  the  consequences  of  social
transition - including interventions to address the  two-economies  paradigm
- and focus on the national spatial development perspective,  improving  the
regional  involvement  and  Nepad,   including   intervention   to   restore
sociopolitical normality and achieving high growth in SADC.

The rationalisation of infrastructure grants and  programmes  by  Government
departments  into  municipal  infrastructure  grants  is  commended  by  the
committee. We believe that this flagship programme will contribute to  major
efforts that are directed towards job creation and  poverty  alleviation  in
our country. As indicated by the  President,  the  focus  of  infrastructure
will be in the 21 development nodes in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  The
expected benefits of this programme will  be  to  improve  access  to  basic
services, especially for the poorest  of  the  poor,  creating  an  enabling
environment for local economic development and expanding  opportunities  for
job creation in collaboration with  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.  The
programme of providing free basic services co-ordinated  by  the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government is supported by the committee.

However, a system of targeting the poorest  of  the  poor  sections  of  our
community  needs  to  be  developed  without  creating  another   layer   of
bureaucracy in the administration.  In  some  major  cities  and  towns  the
billing system is a major nightmare as it  eats  into  the  pockets  of  our
people, both rich and poor, black and white, based in suburbs, townships  or
hostels. A strategic intervention is required urgently in this matter.  This
process of participatory budgeting was modelled on the experiences of  Porto
Alegre province in  Brazil  and  Kerala  province  in  India  -  the  latter
province is one of two in India governed by the communists for  many  years.
This process is finding an expression in one of the clauses of  the  Freedom
Charter that says, "the people shall govern."

How do we concretely ensure that these instruments that have  the  potential
of being a people's assembly are utilised and  inspire  all  people  in  our
country from all walks of life, the able and disabled, from urban  to  rural
areas, hostels, informal, townships and suburbs from all  cities  and  towns
of  our  country?  The  people  must  know  wherever  they  are  that  every
particular year and at any time they will  be  engaged  in  a  participatory
budgetary process, which is commonly known as the IDP. We must  find  a  way
for first  and  foremost  all  public  representatives  from  all  political
persuasions to participate in  this  process  of  a  people's  participatory
budgeting process. Surely this can be one of the things  that  unites  us  a
nation. All public servants, including employees of  municipalities,  should
also join hands. Ward committees need to be elected at a particular time  of
the year in all communities across the length and breadth  of  our  country.
The duration of these committees in terms of their office also needs  to  be
agreed upon. After elections these committees have to be trained,  based  on
a manual dealing with their duties. Resources for the proper functioning  of
these organs of people's power need to be investigated.

The first years of the democratic state were about  the  introduction  of  a
new constitutional and  legislative  framework.  The  new  Constitution  was
adopted in 1996, and  over  789  laws  have  been  passed  since  1994.  The
Government has also been able to successfully integrate the public  services
of the various Bantustans and the central Government's Department of  Public
Service and Administration  into  a  coherent  single  Public  Service.  The
democratic Government has been able  to  transform  the  Public  Service  to
reflect the people of South Africa. African people  now  constitute  72%  of
the Public Service and Government is focusing on increasing  the  number  of
women and people with  disabilities  in  senior  positions.  Government  has
introduced senior management service to improve the  conditions  of  service
for senior personnel.  This  is  also  aimed  at  retaining  and  attracting
skilled personnel in the  Public  Service.  Although  the  skills  level  of
employees in central government has stabilised there is an urgent  need  and
a bigger challenge in addressing skills shortage  at  the  local  government
level.

The development of an integrated regulatory framework  for  all  spheres  of
government and public entities, which forms part  of  a  broader  Government
modernisation programme, is supported  by  the  committee.  This  regulatory
programme that seeks to  improve  the  alignment  of  relevant  legislation,
government   arrangements,   planning   and    budgeting,    accountability,
performance management, remuneration and procurement in different  parts  of
the Public Service to improve and maximise the impact of  interventions  for
development are also commended.

The introduction of the integrated service delivery mechanisms as  community
development  workers,  e-government  gateway  and   multipurpose   community
centres will go a long way in improving service delivery, but  will  require
greater flexibility in the way that the structures of  government  currently
operate. Therefore the work that has been started to create a single  Public
Service is  a  major  challenge  as  obstacles  of  different  salaries  and
benefits in different municipalities  are  a  reality.  However,  a  unified
Public Service would enable similar service delivery.
In his state of the nation address president Thabo Mbeki stated:


  To improve public access to departmental services within  two  months  we
  will launch the Batho Pele gateway portal, which will provide streamlined
  government services on-line.

The purpose of  this  gateway  portal  is  to  create  a  single  source  of
information on government services, organised according to  citizens'  needs
rather than structures of government. The portal is  available  to  citizens
through the website. The committee appreciates the fact that  citizens  will
be able to  be  assisted  by  specially  trained  personnel  in  nine  MPCCs
selected for the first phase of implementation of this  gateway  portal  and
55 points of access at postal facilities. The committee  view  is  that  the
gateway will help  in  reducing  the  disparities  that  exist  between  the
empowered and the disempowered, the first and  second  economies.  Therefore
this gateway will ensure that ordinary citizens will  be  able  to  interact
with Government.

The State Information Technology Agency  plays  an  important  role  in  the
management of IT systems within the Public  Service  and  is  attempting  to
ensure a general return of investment in IT expenditure for both  Government
departments and ultimately citizens - those  things  that  we  believe  have
been increased. However, the  major  challenge  is  that  you  must  lead  a
campaign that will ensure that all Government departments from  all  spheres
utilise this resource, as it will ensure that the benefits  are  accrued  in
the economies of state. We know the capacity of Sita will be developed  over
time, in order to build and handle this mammoth task. At a  strategic  level
there is a department that does not refuse to work  with  Sita,  but  at  an
operational  level  this  department  is  creating  problems.   Historically
certain outside suppliers provided services and the relationship has  become
entrenched and therefore they are difficult to change. The  committee  noted
that Sita has a sensitive relationship with this department because this  it
was a founder member of Sita and we believe that the  situation  has  to  be
changed as things cannot continue as normal.

The committee views the objective of Batho  Pele  as  noble  and  with  good
intentions and as a programme that is aimed at building  a  stronger  Public
Service  culture  among  all  public  servants.  People  who   will   ensure
Government's honour and are able to ensure that they respect the  people  of
this country, view them seriously. They should take the citizens  as  people
who are bosses and who are owners of the  state.  Therefore,  they  must  be
treated as such.

The implementation of the Batho Pele principles is a form  of  induction  of
employees of the state and the inculcation of the  culture  and  ethos  that
says, "We belong, we care and we serve". It takes its cue from the state  of
the nation address, which emphasises the fact that there is a  policy  shift
from policy-making to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

In September the NCOP will be engaged in a  provincial  week,  during  which
members go back to their respective provinces  and  conduct  some  oversight
work. The focus will be on local government. A questionnaire that  asks  the
right questions for the right answers is being developed.  A  database  will
be worked on during this process. This database will be the  basis  for  our
oversight work in the next five years. It  will  give  the  leaders  of  our
country a clear picture of the  status  of  municipalities  in  relation  to
their  viability  and  also  their  readiness  to  meet  the  challenges  of
delivering services; creating a conducive  environment  for  local  economic
development linked to the Expanded Public Works Programme;  a  participatory
budgeting process; billing systems; developmental  nodes;  ward  committees;
and training community development workers. Therefore,  the  committee  will
visit all provinces in order to engage on this database.

The committee will build relationships and partnerships with all  provincial
and  local  government  counterparts  in  order  to  enhance  our  oversight
capacity. Quarterly meetings will be called by  this  committee  with  their
provincial and local government counterparts in  order  to  ensure  that  we
develop a common  understanding  so  that  we  are  able  to  discharge  our
responsibilities with commitment and dedication. This committee is not  only
intending to work hard but to work smarter. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Thank you, Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,
Deputy  Minister,  colleagues  in  the  NCOP,  our  provincial  growth   and
development plan, amongst other things,  highlights  job  creation,  poverty
alleviation  and  public  sector   transformation.   In   pursuit   of   the
transformation of  local  governance,  the  department  will  focus  on  the
following key strategic objectives: the finalisation  of  the  stabilisation
phase, continuing with  the  consolidation  phase,  strengthening  municipal
capacity, good  governance,  emergency  services  and  disaster  management,
integrated sustainable development and the facilitation of the provision  of
sustainable municipal infrastructure. In this regard, we have developed  two
strategies that are linked to each other. The first one  is  the  short-term
strategy and the second one is  the  medium-term  strategy.  The  short-term
strategy, which is a turnaround one is focusing particularly on  six  areas:
poor revenue and  financial  management,  establishment-related  weaknesses,
unintended consequences of wall-to-wall municipalities,  resource  migration
from small municipalities,  poor  institutional  and  systems  capacity  and
noncompliance with legality.

With regard to the medium-term strategy, it  is  premised  on  the  need  to
transform  municipalities  further  and  we  have  developed  a  model   for
developmental  municipalities   in   this   regard,   with   the   following
developmental areas: sustainable service delivery,  social  development  and
community  empowerment.   I  must  mention  in  this  regard  the  issue  of
community development workers. We have commissioned eight  of  them  in  our
province and lot of work is being done, and  we  hope  that  there  will  be
great progress in this regard. Lastly,  we  have  sustainable  environmental
management, infrastructure development and economic development.

In order to promote  sound  relations  between  governance  and  traditional
leadership  institutions,  the   department   will   promulgate   provincial
legislation on traditional leadership  and  governance  during  the  current
financial year. We intend doing  this  before  the  end  of  September.  The
development of this policy and legislation  is  done  through  collaboration
between the House of Traditional Leaders and the department, with  the  full
involvement of the regional authorities and kingdoms in the province.

We have already commenced with a process towards the  House  of  Traditional
Leaders as well as Traditional Council Offices. This is part of the  process
of restoring the dignity, image and  integrity  of  traditional  leadership.
Institutional and  administrative  capacity-building  will  be  provided  to
traditional leaders so that they have a better understanding  of  Government
policies and programmes.

With  regard  to  free  basic  services  in  the  province,   we   have   45
municipalities of which 38 are local or category B  municipalities.  Out  of
these 45 municipalities, 37 have free water supply, 25 have electricity,  21
have sanitation and 19 have refuse removal services. I must  add  that  this
reflects the backlogs of apartheid. We have done a great  deal  with  regard
to free water supply, as well as electricity, as  a  country  but  there  is
still a lot of work  to  be  done  with  regard  to  sanitation  and  refuse
removal.  There  might  be  a  distortion  now,  even  a  great   distortion
concerning refuse removal, because even when we talk  of  19  municipalities
this refers to towns rather than rural areas. Therefore,  there  is  a  huge
backlog in this regard.  With regard to the waterborne sewerage  system,  we
have a backlog of about 64 000 households. We have budgeted an amount  of  R
38 million this year to reduce this backlog, an increase of R18  million  on
last year's amount. Thank you. We support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Ms M M A NYAMA (Limpopo):  Chairperson  of  this  sitting  of  the  National
Council of Provinces, hon members,  our  honoured  ministers,  distinguished
guests and comrades, I'm truly humbled to  stand  here  this  afternoon  and
highlight the  challenges  and  progress  made  in  our  province  over  the
previous financial year in executing our mandate to capacitate, support  and
empower our municipalities. You will pardon my voice, hon Chairperson,  I've
just had very bad flu.

The transformation of our municipalities  is  plagued  by  many  challenges,
such as the inability of some municipalities to transcend the  establishment
phase and progress towards  the  consolidation  and  sustainability  stages;
declining, or lack of, revenue generation; the slow pace in delivering  free
basic services to the poor; a limited capacity to implement or monitor  vast
capital projects; as well as some  municipalities  which  do  not  have  the
human resources with the required skills  equal  to  the  tasks  confronting
them as the most accessible and  direct  level  of  governance  and  service
delivery.

I need to indicate, nonetheless, that 96% of our  municipalities  have  gone
through  the  establishment  phase  and  are  seized  by  the  challenge  of
consolidating and  sustaining  their  existence  and  building  capacity  to
deliver services to residents. There is slow progress,  largely  because  of
limited administrative and managerial capacity and the  inability  to  carry
the  costs  of  their  operations  and  service  delivery  imperatives.  The
national Government is requested to intervene in this regard.
The consolidation of the previously scattered grants will create  remarkable
opportunities for municipalities to better tackle  the  colossal  challenges
of meeting the needs of our  communities,  particularly  those  situated  in
rural  landscapes,   such   as   the   Limpopo   province.   The   municipal
infrastructure grant should take into  consideration  the  fact  that  rural
municipalities are naturally  without  enormous  opportunities  to  generate
revenue which is sufficient to cover operational expenses and the  provision
of services. Therefore, many municipalities depend on  the  grant  from  the
National Treasury and donations.

Our challenge as a province  is  to  embark  on  a  critical  audit  of  the
capacities, limitations and strengths of  our  municipalities  in  order  to
properly define a precise intervention  model  that  would  respond  to  the
peculiar problems of our municipalities. In this context  our  province  has
entered into an agreement with the Development Bank of Southern  Africa  for
it to undertake this audit.

The President made the call that all spheres of government must ensure  that
their  programmes  expand  employment  opportunities  for  our  people   and
cultivate their skills to enable them  to  be  active  participants  in  the
economy.
As the department of housing in the province, we have  identified  the  need
to recapitulate existing co-operatives in order to  uplift  local  economies
and ensure cohesion in the projects carried out by  various  programmes.  In
this  connection,  we  will  strive  to  integrate  all  efforts  of   other
departments into the IDPs of the municipalities in which those projects  are
initiated.

The lack of revenue generation is caused by the fact that most  people  from
whom we need payment of services are unemployed and  impoverished.  We  must
find creative ways to promote and implement sustainable projects.

The process of establishing  towns  in  Aganang  and  Fetakgomo  is  in  the
pipeline. We have already  secured  land  and  tribal  resolutions  in  this
regard. Furthermore, Pagetown will be formalised. For these  laudable  goals
to be realised, there  should  be  an  injection  of  a  massive  amount  of
resources.

Our Government pledged itself to provide basic free water to our  people  in
order to  mitigate  their  hard  social  and  economic  conditions.  In  our
province most district municipalities are water service authorities, yet  it
is the local municipalities that  are,  in  fact,  providing  water  to  the
communities.

According to statistics provided by the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry,  21  municipalities  are  providing  free  basic  water  to  their
communities,  thus  benefiting  45%  of  our  provincial  population.   This
progress is not easy to quantify in monetary terms, because  standpipes  and
water tankers are utilised in the rural communities unlike in  urban  areas.
Yet there is still a huge concern around water provision in many of the  dry
villages in the province.

As regards free basic electricity, all municipalities in the  province  have
entered  into  funding  agreements  with  Eskom  for  the  supply  of   grid
electricity to our people. Thirteen municipalities are already  reaping  the
fruits. On the other  hand,  four  municipalities  have  agreed  with  Solar
Vision to provide nongrid  electricity  to  residents.  In  spite  of  these
efforts there is a huge backlog regarding the electrification  of  our  dark
rural areas.

This House meets days prior  to  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Act coming into operation. This new piece  of  legislation  seeks
to  introduce  new   efforts   of   accountability   and   transparency   in
municipalities. It is our responsibility to guarantee  the  success  of  the
implementation of this  legislation.  In  this  context  we'll  roll  out  a
training programme for municipal  staff  and  councillors  and  also  deploy
competent public servants to ensure compliance with the legislation.

We have a provincial capacity-building strategy whose purpose is to  respond
to  the  mammoth  challenges  facing  our  municipalities.  The  traditional
affairs matters, which were previously with this department, are  now  being
shifted to the office of the premier. We are in  the  process  of  referring
funds and staff accordingly. There is still the challenge of the payment  of
indunas from former Lebowa in order to bring about equity. We are  appealing
to  this  House  and  the  National  Assembly  to  ensure  that  funds   are
appropriately channelled to ensure a stronger local government and a  really
better life for all our people in local areas. Ndiyakhensa. [I  thank  you.]
[Applause.]

Mnr J W LE ROUX: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister, LUR'e en kollegas,  die  feit
dat  ons  as  Suid-Afrikaners  'n  ware  demokrasie  hier  kon   vestig   is
merkwaardig, en ek glo dat ons almal baie trots  is  op  hierdie  prestasie.
Die bekamping van armoede is sekerlik ons volgende groot uitdaging,  en  ons
sal slegs slaag as ons almal saamwerk as 'n span, naamlik eerste-,  tweede-,
derdevlakregering en die privaatsektor.

Die kern van die vraagstuk is die feit dat ons ekonomie teen  tussen  2%  en
3% per jaar groei en ons benodig  'n  groei  koers  van  tussen  5%  en  6%.
Aangesien ons bevolkingsaanwas ook iewers  tussen  2%  en  3%  is,  kan  die
armoedeprobleem nie opgelos word as die ekonomiese aktiwiteite nie  drasties
toeneem nie. In baie gebiede in ons  land  is  die  werkloosheidsyfer  reeds
40%, en die werklose mense van ons land  is  vasgevang  in  'n  spiraal  van
armoede. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister,  MECs  and  colleagues,  the
fact that we as South Africans were able to establish a true democracy  here
is remarkable, and I believe we are all very proud of this achievement.  The
fight against poverty is surely our next major challenge, and we  will  only
succeed if all of us work together as a team, namely the first,  second  and
third tiers of government and the private sector.

The core of the matter is the fact that our economy is  growing  between  by
2% and 3% per year, and we need growth of 5% to  6%.  Since  our  population
growth is also somewhere between 2% and 3%, the poverty  problem  cannot  be
solved unless economic activity increases drastically. In  many  regions  of
our country the unemployment figure has reached 40%, and the  unemployed  in
our country are locked in a spiral of poverty. ]

The massive injection of funds to create jobs and to provide basic  services
and infrastructure, together with the Expanded Public Works Programme,  will
certainly help our poor and unemployed citizens.  It  is  now  up  to  local
government to use this major stimulus to secure a  better  future  for  all,
but especially for the poor. The safety net is now much wider and  the  very
poor people will certainly benefit. It is clear that the Government  favours
the public sector  as  the  driving  force  for  job  and  wealth  creation.
However, the DA prefers the private sector to be the main agent for job  and
wealth creation.

Ek kwoteer die DA-leier: "Die staat se rol moet soveel wees as wat nodig  is
en die privaat inisiatief soveel as  wat  moontlik  is."  Hierdie  liberaal-
demokratiese stelsel het homself wêreldwyd bewys as  die  beste  stelsel  om
die breë gemeenskap die grootste ekonomiese voordeel te  gee.  Die  rol  wat
plaaslike bestuur moet speel in die bekamping van armoede  en  dienslewering
kom nou skerp onder die vergrootglas.

Beleggers  en  entrepreneurs  is  deurlopend  besig  om   die   verskillende
beleggingsopsies te ondersoek. Die entrepreneur se besluit word tot 'n  baie
groot mate beïnvloed deur die optrede van plaaslike rade en amptenare.

Dwarsoor die land, en veral in  die  Oos-Kaap,  is  dit  duidelik  dat  waar
plaaslike bestuur en amptenare effektief funksioneer,  die  vinnigste  groei
plaasvind.  'n  Goeie  voorbeeld  van  effektiewe  raadsbesluite  is  Graaff
Reinet.  Hierdie  raad  het  lank  gelede  die   potensiaal   van   toerisme
geïdentifiseer en met behulp van die privaatsektor en entrepreneurs soos  Dr
Rupert is die dorp effektief bestuur en bemark.  Die  historiese  geboue  is
gerestoreer, inheemse lanings bome is langs strate geplant,  daarby  is  hoë
gehalte akkommodasie beskikbaar gestel en talle interessanthede is  tot  die
beskikking van die  besoekers  daargestel.  Huidiglik  stroom  besoekers  na
Graaff Reinet en floreer die dorp.

In  teenstelling  hiermee  is  daar  talle  stede  en  dorpe  met  dieselfde
potensiaal maar verval in armoede  en  agteruitgang.  Uitenhage  is  ook  'n
voorbeeld   van   waar   amptenare,   raadslede   en    die    privaatsektor
vervaardigingsreuse soos Volkswagen en Goodyear beïnvloed het  om  hul  daar
te vestig. Almal wat hierdie gebied ken, sal  weet  dat  die  vestiging  van
Volkswagen byvoorbeeld die hele gemeenskap oor dekades bevoordeel het.

Die Nelson Mandela Metropool is ook 'n voorbeeld van waar 'n  raad  ingestel
is vir dienslewering en die opgradering van  infrastruktuur,  sowel  as  die
verfraaiing van die hele metropool.  Die  vestiging  van  die  reuse  Coega-
haweprojek is  'n  baie  goeie  voorbeeld  van  waar  die  staat,  plaaslike
owerheid en die privaatsektor saamwerk  om  groot  voorspoed  te  skep.  Die
kiesers kry volgende jaar die geleentheid om weer raadslede te kies, en  dit
sal verstandig wees om raadslede te kies  met  die  regte  ingesteldheid  en
visie. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I quote the DA leader: "The role of the  state  must  be  as  great  as  is
necessary, and private initiative as great as  is  possible".  This  liberal
democratic system has proved to be the best system worldwide  to  bring  the
greatest economical advantage to society  at  large.  The  role  that  local
government must play in the fight against poverty and  in  service  delivery
now comes into sharp focus.

Investors and entrepreneurs are constantly investigating various  investment
options. The decision  of  the  entrepreneur  is  to  a  very  great  extent
influenced by the conduct of local councils and officials.

Throughout the country, and especially in the  Eastern  Cape,  it  is  clear
that wherever local government and officials function efficiently, the  most
rapid  growth  occurs.  A  good  example  of  a  council  taking   effective
decisions, is Graaff  Reinet.  This  council  recognised  the  potential  of
tourism  long  ago,  and  with  the  help  of  the  private  sector  and  of
entrepreneurs like Dr  Rupert,  the  town  has  been  managed  and  marketed
efficiently. Historical buildings were restored, lanes of  indigenous  trees
were  planted  along  the  streets,  and  at  the  same  time   high-quality
accommodation  was  provided,  and  numerous  interesting  sites  were  made
available to visitors. Today visitors stream to Graaff Reinet and  the  town
is flourishing.

In contrast, many cities and villages with the same potential are  mired  in
poverty and degeneration. Uitenhage is  another  example  of  a  town  where
officials,  councillors  and  the  private  sector  persuaded  manufacturing
giants like Volkswagen and Goodyear to establish plants there.  Anybody  who
knows this area will tell you  that,  for  instance,  the  establishment  of
Volkswagen benefited the whole community over decades.

The Nelson Mandela Metropole is another example of a  council  dedicated  to
service delivery and to upgrading infrastructure, as well as to  beautifying
the whole metropole. The establishment of the giant  Coega  harbour  project
is a very good example of how the state, local government  and  the  private
sector can co-operate to generate great prosperity.  Next  year  the  voters
once again have the opportunity to elect councillors, and it  will  be  wise
to elect councillors with the  right  attitude  and  vision.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon MECs, special delegates  and
hon members of the House, foremost I want to  congratulate  the  hon  Sydney
Mufamadi and the hon Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi on  their  reappointments  as
Ministers and the  hon  Nomatyala  Hangana  on  her  appointment  as  Deputy
Minister. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome back one  of
our sparkling roses who served with us in the previous parliament,  the  hon
Dorothy Mahlangu. Welcome back, hon Mahlangu. I  wish  them  all  successful
terms of office.

Attitudes in South Africa are changing. You  could  see  this  in  the  past
election results. The people of  South  Africa  have  confidence  that  this
Government is here to change things for the better. We South  Africans  have
to change and move with the times and also look at the requirements  of  the
electorate. There are charters out there, and certain percentages  that  are
expected around transformation and service delivery in their broader  sense,
which  will  affect  all  state  departments,  provincial  governments   and
municipalities. We find ourselves in an era in which change arrives  without
warning and is of such a  nature  that  it  can,  with  debilitating  speed,
threaten the very foundation of service delivery and the  people's  contract
for a better South Africa.

It was the astute and the wise who  recognised  this  and  began  to  adapt,
change and work with the new, rather than strive to  preserve  and  entrench
the past. For me, if I can help to make changes in favour  of  and  also  in
line with the new dispensation, I would feel very proud  -  and  could  look
back and say that that was what I was able to do and  what  I  was  able  to
achieve as a  South  African  who  was  part  of  making  those  significant
changes. The NNP supports the Budget Votes. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs P M HOLLANDER: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister Geraldine  Fraser-Moleketi,
hon Sidney Mufamadi, hon MECs, hon members, special  delegates,  ladies  and
gentlemen, the ANC on 8 January in its statement for 2004 has declared  this
the year of  the  renewal  of  its  democratic  mandate  and,  therefore,  a
people's contract to create work and fight poverty. Gone are the  days  when
we were disintegrated into different communities in the city of  Cape  Town.
If you smiled  at  someone  of  the  opposite  race,  you  were  jailed  for
contravening the Immorality Act. Where you lived - and it was not  only  the
community of District Six that was removed - and amongst other  races,  that
area was called a black spot, and this black spot was  mixed  with  a  white
spot and they declared Woodstock as a grey spot; but we  are  still  all  of
the same colour today.

Schools and libraries had separate funding and that all formed part  of  the
development of the Western Cape. There were job reservation,  separate  post
offices, bridges, walls and separate schools. I taught in the city and  when
we marched to Parliament we  were  branded  and  beaten  up  by  the  Ossewa
Brandwag and the police.  This  Parliament  was  closed  to  all  races  but
whites. We were whipped into submission by the  Torch  Commando.  There  was
bus apartheid, and  mothers  and  grannies  had  to  go  upstairs  in  train
apartheid, and when we boarded the trains they blocked us  up  at  Woodstock
station. Therefore, I welcome the ANC to the Western Cape and  with  them  a
people's contract to create work and to fight poverty.

The Public Service and Administration Budget Vote receives  more  restrained
increases to its base line with adjustments of R15 million. This  is  mainly
tied to the need for increased internal capacity  to  strengthen  provincial
intervention measures, for instance, the  initiative  in  the  Eastern  Cape
during 2003-2004.  In  2003  a  new  programme,  International  and  African
Affairs, was added to accommodate the work  emanating  from  South  Africa's
amplified role in Africa and the international arena.

Information technology falls under programme three of  the  department.  The
aim of the programme is to ensure the effective use of  information  and  IT
in Government, facilitate the use of IT for the modernisation of  Government
and  the  establishment  of  e-Government  practices  within  an  acceptable
information security environment. The measurable objective of the  programme
is to improve access to government services by  providing  a  single  24  IT
Window in a steady and efficient manner.  It  is  important  to  manage  the
development of IT since it has the potential to  decrease  the  gap  between
the first and second economy by empowering those in the second  economy  who
are without the necessary infrastructure to utilise IT services  and  access
critical government  information.  Various  objects  are  being  implemented
under Programme 3  to  realise  improved  service  delivery  and  modernised
Government. This is consistent with the ethos of Batho Pele, which puts  all
citizens first through service delivery  excellence.  The  policy  aimed  at
transforming  service  delivery  through  the  introduction  of  eight   key
principles was first announced in 1997.

The Batho Pele Gateway Project will be a major focus for the  Department  of
Public Service and Administration over the next ten years. In his  state  of
the nation address of 21 May 2004, President Thabo Mbeki announced that  the
Batho Pele  gateway  would  be  launched  within  two  months.  The  project
consists of five phases  and  aims  to  bring  Government's  information  to
citizens wherever they are. This information will be available  24  hours  a
day, seven days a week.

Phase one of the Gateway Project involves the establishment  of  the  portal
for information on Government services and making it available  to  citizens
online, as well as through various access channels such as the  multipurpose
community centres and the Post Office public  information  terminals.  Phase
one of the Batho Pele Gateway has now been developed. Phase two  will  allow
citizens to access and conduct Government service transactions  online,  for
instance, completing an application for a passport  or  identity  documents.
This will provide citizens with a  one-stop  access  point  for  all  public
information and services. Linked to the Gateway Project is  the  development
of access platforms, which will enable users with  no  Internet  access,  to
access  such  electronic  services.  Existing  initiatives   such   as   the
multipurpose community centres will be utilised for these purposes.

The challenges, however, are weaknesses that include poor senior  management
involvement in the  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  principles
driving Batho Pele, and lack of public involvement  in  the  enforcement  of
these principles. However, the good news  is  that  in  August  the  Cabinet
approved the roll-out of community development workers with  the  broad  aim
of bridging  the  gap  between  Government  services  and  the  people.  The
community development workers are citizens trained in  Government  processes
such as social grant  applications,  applications  for  birth  certificates,
identity documents, and so forth.

On 1 October the South African Management Institute began  rolling  out  the
training for community development workers. In  terms  of  recruitment,  the
minimum requirement for these people is Grade 12  or  the  equivalent  prior
learning. In his state of the nation address alluded to  earlier,  President
Mbeki announced that the community development workers would be deployed  in
the 21 nodal points by the end of 2004. Gauteng will be the  first  province
to deploy a group of these 40 community development workers.  The  provinces
of Limpopo, the Eastern Cape and North West will follow.

Learnerships have been  established  for  these  people  and  following  the
completion of a one-year learnership, community  development  workers  would
be eligible to apply for permanent posts within the  provincial  departments
and establishments responsible for local government.  Community  development
workers are recruited from every ward within provinces. A further intake  of
learners will commence once the  successful  community  development  workers
have been placed.

The deployment of community development workers is  intended  to  contribute
to improving service delivery by taking services directly to the  poor,  but
is also intended to assist the poor to  develop  the  capacity  to  organise
themselves in participating in  decision-making.  The  challenges  here,  in
this regard, include the lack of funding within  provincial  departments  as
well as the capacity challenges of the local government sector and  training
authority, Seta. However, these challenges need  to  be  balanced  with  the
shortage of skills in the Public Service  and  rural  areas  in  particular.
Skills  development  is  a  critical  priority  for  the   Public   Service,
especially since skilled and  experienced  personnel  developed  since  1994
have been lost to the private sector.
The DPSA was involved in a major intersectorial initiative in the  2003-2004
financial year. Following the Public  Service  Job  Summit  in  January,  an
agreement on the transformation and restructuring  of  the  Public  Service,
which has come to be known as Resolution 7, concluded the  restructuring  of
the Public Service. The broad aim of the restructuring process is  to  match
the skills needs of departments with the human resources  available  in  the
Public Service. This would enable  more  effective  end  efficiency  service
delivery.

In certain cases this may mean redeployment of staff  or  identifying  staff
in excess. Excess  staff  members  are  offered  training  opportunities  to
facilitate their redeployment in the Public Service. This  restructuring  is
now in the phase of practical implementation. The resolution itself came  to
an end on 12 September 2003. The restructuring programme  is  now  in  phase
two, placing excess employees who are not accommodated for redeployment.  On
12 September, employees were identified as redundant. They  were  placed  in
the  special  programme  and  given  assignments.  Resolution   7   requires
departments to determine an organised structure  in  line  with  the  skills
needed to employees to posts where that was possible, to fill vacancies  and
deploy those employees who are in  excess.  Where  such  deployment  is  not
possible, employees may receive training to facilitate such deployment.

Resolution 7 does not aim to render Government employees redundant  although
it is perceived  as  such.  Instead  it  recognises  that  service  delivery
demands and the available  capacity  do  not  always  match  in  the  public
sector. Trade unions are engaged with the state in a process to ensure  that
those employees who are declared excessive  in  one  department  could  find
opportunities in  other  departments  through  the  use  of  a  redeployment
database. Employees who are not successfully redeployed  are  also  eligible
for a severance package, as are some of staff who are unwilling to join  the
special programme.

The impact that provinces now have on the implementation of national  policy
is  substantial,  since  large  allocations  of  funds  are  transferred  to
provinces from the national fiscus and leave to them the  responsibility  of
allocating the resources to the various portfolios  of  Government.  At  the
same time, South Africa's historical legacy of a  lack  of  development  has
resulted in significant differences between  provinces  in  terms  of  their
capacity. As a result, the performance  of  provinces  reflects  unevenness,
with some provinces  doing  exceptionally  well  and  achieving  development
targets while others struggle to achieve the basic level of operational  and
administrative efficiency.

Given such disparities, the integrated provincial support programme, one  of
Government's key capacity-building programmes, is  of  critical  importance.
The IPSP is a multiyear strategic programme  of  the  Department  of  Public
Service and Administration to support  targeted  provincial  governments  to
achieve and sustain poverty alleviation, the effective  rendering  of  basic
services and good governance  with  the  implementation  of  the  respective
provincial growth and development strategy. This partnership with  provinces
is aimed at improving service delivery by assisting with the  implementation
of projects that will facilitate provincial growth.

The focus of the PGDS directs the transformation of the  Public  Service  in
the  provinces  towards  socioeconomic  development  and   growth.   A   key
requirement of the IPSP is that all projects  initiated  by  provinces  with
IPSP funding must have been identified within the  strategic  scope  of  the
PGDS. In this way the ANC Government will  create  a  people's  contract  to
create work and fight poverty. In conclusion,  I  would  like  to  tell  Mrs
Robinson of the DA that  it  was  not  only  the  National  Party  that  was
responsible for apartheid or separate development here in South Africa,  but
it was also the old Progressive Party which is  now  today  called  the  DA.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C A T SMITH (Noord-Kaap):  Agb  Voorsitter,  agb  Minister  Mufamadi  en
Minister  Fraser-Moleketi,  agb  Adjunkminister  Hangana,   lede   van   die
uitvoerende rade van provinsies, spesiale afgevaardigdes, lede  van  hierdie
agbare Huis, dames en here, laat my ook toe om die agb  Ministers  geluk  te
wens met hul herverkiesing en aanstelling en dit is die gebed van  ons  hart
dat die Allerhoogste hulle ook ryklik sal seën in hul  werksaamhede  in  die
onderskeie portefeuljes waarin hulle hulle bevind.

Agb Voorsitter, plaaslike regering is die sfeer van regering naaste aan  die
mense.  As  ons  daarin  slaag  om  suksesvol  hierdie  land  op   plaaslike
regeringsvlak te transformeer vanaf apartheid tot demokrasie,  sal  ons  die
lewensomstandighede van ons mense op grondvlak verander. Ek  is  baie  trots
daarop om ons ook met nasionale en provinsiale beleid te assosieer  wat  ook
erkenning  op  internasionale  gebied  kry,  as  gevolg  van  die  kwaliteit
daarvan.

As  ons  egter  nie  daarin  gaan  slaag  om  as  plaaslike  regerings   die
kompleksiteit en probleme waarmee  ons  worstel  in  terme  van  armoede  op
grondvlak die hoof te bied nie, sal hierdie demokrasie nie die  ware  kleure
hê wat hy behoort te hê vir die mense  van  hierdie  land  nie.  In  hierdie
opsig probeer ons dus vir die Huis die belangrikheid van plaaslike  regering
stel.

Die vordering wat tot  dusver  oor  die  afgelope  10  jaar  gemaak  is,  is
prysenswaardig en ons wil vir minister Mufamadi gelukwens met die  besondere
rol en leierskap wat hy getoon het ook tot waar ons  vandag  is.  Mense  wat
nie die ontwikkeling op plaaslike vlak oor die 10 jaar in hierdie  land  kan
sien nie, is òf blind òf loop met toe oë rond, òf is besig om hardkoppig  en
arrogant vas te klou aan die verlede met skynwaarheid om  alles  te  probeer
opponeer.

Ek wil  graag  ook  vir  die  agb  Minister  gelukwens  met  sy  suksesvolle
onderhandelings  met  die  Minister  van  Finansies,  in  die  sin  dat  die
"equitable share" en die "municipal infrastructure grant"  verhoog  is.  Dit
sal beslis 'n groot bydrae lewer tot werkskepping en die verligting van  die
armoede wat ons daar ervaar. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C A T SMITH (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister Mufamadi  and
Minister Fraser-Moleketi,  hon  Deputy  Minister  Hangana,  members  of  the
executive  councils  of  provinces,  special  delegates,  members  of   this
honourable House, ladies and gentlemen, allow me also  to  congratulate  the
hon Ministers on their re-election and appointment, and it is the prayer  of
our hearts that the Almighty will richly bless them in  their  work  in  the
respective portfolios in which they find themselves.

Hon Chairperson, local government is the sphere  of  government  closest  to
the people. If we succeed  in  successfully  transforming  this  country  at
local government level from apartheid  to  democracy,  we  will  change  the
living conditions of our people at grass-roots level. I  am  very  proud  to
associate us with national and provincial policy that is  also  acknowledged
internationally as a result of its quality.

If, however, as local governments  we  do  not  succeed  in  overcoming  the
complications and problems we are wrestling with  in  terms  of  poverty  at
grass-roots level, this democracy will not have the true colours  it  should
have for the people of this country. In this manner we are therefore  trying
to show the House the importance of local government.

The progress made up to now over the past 10 years is laudable and  here  we
want to congratulate Minister  Mufamadi  for  the  particular  role  he  has
played and the leadership that he has displayed, also up  to  where  we  are
today. People who cannot see the development at local level in this  country
over the past 10 years are either blind or walking around  with  their  eyes
shut, or are stubbornly and arrogantly clinging to the supposed truths  past
to try to oppose everything.

I also want to congratulate the hon Minister on his successful  negotiations
with the Minister of Finance, in the sense that the equitable share and  the
municipal infrastructure grants have  been  increased.  It  will  definitely
greatly contribute to job creation and the alleviation of the  poverty  that
we are experiencing there.]
Our  democratic   Government's   task   is   to   overcome   conditions   of
underdevelopment through the four priority areas of the RDP, namely  meeting
basic needs, developing our human resources, building the economy,  and  the
democratisation of state and society. We have to pay priority  attention  to
the tactical requirements for good governance and  provide  basic  services.
Our goal is to ensure that our  people  benefit  through  the  provision  of
clean water, and have access to basic sanitation.

The success of our investment in basic infrastructure  will  enable  greater
gains to be made in the roll-out of the free basic services programme.  This
programme is pivotal  in  extending  the  social  safety  net  to  the  most
vulnerable in our communities. We must direct our sources towards  the  goal
of creating  employment  opportunities  through  the  extension  of  labour-
intensive infrastructure development programmes.

Through more realistic, integrated development  plans,  municipalities  must
develop local  socioeconomic  profiles  which  would  help  the  public  and
private sector to take decisions  that  are  mutually  beneficial.  We  must
encourage municipalities to designate rural development  and  urban  renewal
nodes and to make use of these mechanisms in order to  influence  investment
within small-scale segments of the  economy.  The  stimulation  of  economic
activity in these areas, however small, will touch  in  very  positive  ways
the lives of those of our people who are confined to the positions that  are
marginal to our economy.

The Northern Cape wants to raise a few special issues for the  attention  of
the Minister: the strengthening of the financial base of  local  government;
collaboration with the department of transport and roads to assist  district
municipalities in the upgrading and maintenance of access roads;  conducting
a  community  awareness  programme  on  the  establishment,   capacity   and
monitoring of ward committees; and, in consultation with the  department  of
agriculture and land reform, the  determination  of  reasonable  prices  for
commonage land.

Please, Minister, help us see to  it  that  national/provincial  departments
pay their municipal commitments to local  government  timeously  and  expand
the   disaster   management   programme   to   improve   the   capacity   of
municipalities. Please, embark on a national awareness  campaign  to  market
municipal by-laws. We, once again, just want to bring to  the  attention  of
the Minister the difficulties that we  experience  at  provincial  level  in
terms   of   the   cross-border   municipalities.   Please,   assist   local
municipalities with debt-collection policies and interact with  the  IEC  to
ensure that the preparations for  the  local  government  elections  are  on
track. The Northern Cape supports this Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  M  FRANSMAN  (Western  Cape):  Chairperson,  Ministers  and  the  Deputy
Minister, let me first of all indicate that  the  Western  Cape  is  finally
also on a progressive course, that on 14 April the people clearly  came  out
in support of the movement and,  therefore,  10  years  into  our  democracy
obviously we have to find the necessary  processes  to  streamline  our  own
actions  in  order  for  us  to  move  beyond  the  issue  of  strategy   to
implementation.

In this particular budget the direction  and  tone  that  the  Minister  has
given, rightfully, over the last few months, have been under the  microscope
of the national Cabinet, aimed at  finding  the  kind  of  local  governance
fitting the image developed from those things the peoples  of  South  Africa
told the leadership they wanted from Government in the  tenth  year  of  the
democracy.
The processes leading to the  budget  statement  under  consideration  today
were best captured by a gentleman by the name of Bernard Edmonds who said:


  To dream anything that you want to dream, that is the beauty of the human
  mind. To do anything that you want to do, that is  the  strength  of  the
  human will. To trust yourself, to test your limits, that is  the  courage
  to succeed.

Over the dark days of  our  country's  history  we  have  been  carried  and
propelled by a dream to arrive  at  a  point  when  South  Africa  would  be
democratic, providing opportunities for all, and attentive to the  needs  of
those to whom the atrocities of the past have proved paralysing to  a  point
of despair.

In 1994, I believe, we arrived in that South Africa. In 1997  we  began  the
surgical work of unblocking the service delivery pipelines to  local  level,
assisted by census data and other valuable planning information sources.  In
2000 we finally unveiled the model of local  governance  designed  to  cater
for all, wherever people find themselves, and we  will  be  in  the  process
beyond 2005.
The dream of a better life took shape in the challenge we have  been  issued
with in 1994, a challenge which we have  been  working  in  earnest  towards
achieving with great  leadership.  Here  I  want  to  quote  what  both  the
President and Mr Mufamadi said:


  (We must) make  local  government  more  dependable  as  an  enabler  for
  provincial and national departments  to  realise  their  development  and
  delivery targets.

Well aware of the fiscal limitations in realising the dreams of our  people,
nonetheless we are not restrained or daunted in coming across as  determined
partners in a contract to find these lasting solutions. In the Western  Cape
we have identified the MIG and other programmes as valuable in dealing  with
the job creation question, as well as poverty reduction.

During  the  President's  budget  address  in  the  National  Assembly,   he
remarked:


  We must achieve greater progress with regard to the  integration  of  our
  system of governance, achieving seamless  co-operation  both  within  and
  among all spheres of government.

From the President's remarks it is clear that our foremost  challenge  would
be to put in place and encourage the  kind  of  governance  that  will  feed
delivery of services to the poorest of the poor and in the Western Cape.  We
have already started to get the ball rolling, signalling  to  municipalities
that, as Premier Rasool has put it, there need to be "no  more  turf  wars",
and that we  are  "declaring  a  truce  unconditionally"  for  the  sake  of
progress and the millions of people in  need  of  effective  delivery  of  a
range of Government services and in response to the policy direction above.

We have decided to respond in  the  following  ways,  firstly,  by  doing  a
skills audit in municipalities to identify the type of  weaknesses  at  that
level and then to put in place appropriate  training  opportunities  and  to
extend it to senior and middle management and specifically target  women  in
local  government.  There  is  definitely  a  glaring   absence   of   women
empowerment, not politically, but in  management  structures  at  the  local
government level.

Secondly,  the  developmental  governance  is  demanding  a   deepening   of
democracy and a culture of stakeholder engagement.   Therefore,  we  welcome
the roll-out and  a  very  particular  focus  on  ward-based  structures  in
municipalities. However, I want to link the ward committees process and  the
community development workers approach into the question of  identifying  an
institutional mechanism to deal with the  issues  that  people  raise  at  a
management  level  in  municipalities.  In  the   Western   Cape   we   will
particularly focus on that.

We have also decided to follow  a  consultative  partnership  approach  with
Weclogo in the Western Cape on the most appropriate  manner  to  revise  and
implement a strategy that will ensure sound and co-operative governance.

Municipalities  are  charged  as  co-ordinators  of  social   and   economic
investment  to  address  the  geographic  poverty  implications  of   former
apartheid planning. Therefore, the  Integrated  Services  Rural  Development
Plan, as well as the Urban Renewal Programme, did show us the  potential  to
target  the  poor.  In  the  Western  Cape  we  have  identified  particular
weaknesses around it  that  influence  intersphere  processes.  We  will  be
holding a funding conference in order to bring  private  capital  investment
to the table.

We also welcome the  announcement  regarding  the  roll-out  of  free  basic
services, but with a particular focus on access to sanitation services.  The
challenge in the Western Cape relates to approximately  30  000  households,
and I am proud to inform the Minister that 25 out of the  30  municipalities
in the Western Cape indicated that they would provide  over  and  above  the
free basic water and electricity. They  will  also  now  supply  free  basic
sanitation and refuse removal to indigent households in the  communities  as
of 1 July.

Whilst addressing the challenges of ensuring an adequate social  safety  net
and the conditions of the poor, we have unfortunately also seen the  ravages
of fires and  flooding  in  our  informal  settlements.  Therefore,  in  the
portfolio of housing we have developed a particular approach that says  that
we will be looking at our disaster mitigation and management  strategy  over
the next 100 days, and obviously roll out that  programme,  especially  over
winter.

On 21 June we met all the councillors in the  Western  Cape,  including  the
mayors, deputy mayors and municipal  managers,  and  there  we  collectively
agreed on the alignment of IDPs with  provincial  GDS;  the  issue  of  ward
committee roll - out; maximising benefits from the  Mig  programmes  in  the
context of job creation and poverty reduction; information  around  the  IGR
imperatives, as well as to develop  policies  to  address  concerns  of  the
indigent, and working towards making the Western Cape a home for all.

Already it is clear from the speed that you, as the Minister,  convened  the
team to work on the IGR strategy, that there  is  urgency  on  this  matter.
Government departments must co-operate vertically and horizontally  to  give
effect to what you aspire to. I have, with the support of  all  role-players
in the province, now put in place an implementation plan to  deal  with  the
issues of the IGR roll-out strategy; even whilst there  is  no  legislation,
to put in place a process of piloting.

Lastly I want to mention the issue of bureaucracy, ie  the  streamlining  of
some of our processes. I have identified three  areas  around  the  problems
relating to official bureaucracy. Firstly, there is a lack of  organisation;
secondly, there is a lack of inner  motivation;  and,  thirdly,  a  lack  of
technical knowledge. The academy  that  you  have  spoken  about  will  most
probably be able to deal with that as a critical  issue.  Therefore,  whilst
we are looking at all the plans and the processes in  the  Western  Cape,  a
strategic focus will be the reorientation of  our  public  servants  in  the
context of service delivery.

Therefore, my  participation  in  this  debate  sought  to  do  two  things,
firstly, to support not only the proposed budget, but also to inform  policy
tone and direction, and lastly to pledge the  Western  Cape's  support;  not
only to support this strategy and vision,  but  to  respond  by  putting  in
place a practical programme  of  action.  Therefore,  we  are  committed  to
bringing about developmental local governance and a better life for all  our
people in the Western Cape. [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Madam Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, today I  want
to dedicate my address to a plea  for  better  empowerment  of  rural  local
government councillors. The Minister has already referred to the  fact  that
when we engaged in the process of writing the new Constitution in 1994,  one
of the paramount  points  of  departure  in  regard  to  governance  was  to
establish three spheres of government and to do  away,  once  and  for  all,
with lowering certain spheres to tiers or levels of government.

Chapter 7 of the Constitution  clearly  establishes  municipalities  as  the
local sphere of government, and whilst provision is made for provincial  and
national oversight, and even intervention at  times,  the  status  of  local
government as a full-fledged sphere of government is beyond argument.

I've been privileged to serve in the local government for  the  past  three-
and-a-half years, and I can testify  that  we  are  blessed  with  dedicated
councillors across the country. The  problem  is  that  the  empowerment  of
councillors, particularly in the smaller municipalities, has not  kept  pace
with their status as representatives in the local sphere of  government  and
they are consequently unable to execute  their  tasks  fully.  The  Minister
should presently be in the process of revising the upper limits of  salaries
and allowances of councillors, as he does annually, for implementation by  1
July, and today  I  want  to  appeal  to  him  to  reconsider  some  of  the
categories as determined in the relevant schedule.

Let me explain: In a grade 1 municipality  the  maximum  salary  and  travel
allowance of a councillor is currently only R1 506 per  month,  compared  to
the equivalent of nearly R14 000 per month for a  grade  6  councillor.  The
difference becomes more tolerable as the grades move up, but the salary  and
allowance in a grade 6 municipality is still equal to 197% of  that  of  the
next grade down, in other words, grade 5. I believe that the  problem  could
be addressed by readjusting  the  formulae  applied  to  determine  grading,
which relate to property rate income and the number of registered voters  in
a municipality.

This  makes  sense  in  determining  the  size  of   a   municipality   and,
consequently, also has a direct relation to the reduction of the  number  of
wards, but it certainly does not reduce the workload  of  a  councillor.  On
the contrary, the work of a rural councillor  is  much  more  involved  than
that of a councillor in a large municipality. The city councillor  virtually
falls out of bed into his or her  ward,  whereas  rural  councillors  travel
many miles to service their voters and in some cases more  than  150  km  to
attend council meetings alone.

I'm well aware of the choice that can be made and exercised in  terms  of  a
rate per kilometre, but the Minister must remember that it only  applies  to
official business and travel, and not to the  main  task  of  servicing  the
communities. How can we expect a councillor in a  grade  1  municipality  to
buy and maintain a vehicle on a travel allowance  of  only  R300  per  month
whilst a metropolitan councillor ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  could  you  take
your seat, please.

Mr H T SOGONI:  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order,  the  member  is  not
discussing the principles of delivery that we are talking about here. He  is
in a bargaining chamber for councillors.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I  will  make  a  ruling  at  a
later stage on this point of order, but you may proceed, hon member.

Mr A WATSON: Well done, Chair - you have both wasted my time. [Laughter.]  I
said that the Minister must  remember  that  it  only  applies  to  official
business and not to the main task of servicing the  community.  How  can  we
expect a councillor in a grade 1 municipality to buy and maintain a  vehicle
on a travel  allowance  of  only  R300  per  month,  whilst  a  metropolitan
councillor, who rarely  has  to  move  more  than  a  few  city  blocks,  is
allocated R2 700 per month? We must also understand, Mr Chair, that in  most
instances  rural  councillors  have  no  other  income  and  consider  their
appointments as full time.

The  rural  communities  also  look  at  councillors  as  not   only   their
representatives, but also as their leaders and, at times,  as  a  source  of
financial assistance. We need to attract and  keep  quality  councillors  in
order to build sustainable local government, and we therefore  also  have  a
duty to ensure proper empowerment of the incumbents.

I have not even touched on a further point  of  empowerment  in  the  actual
work environment, but looking after the personal circumstances  would  be  a
good start. I thank you. [Applause.]

Cllr M D DIKOKO: Hon Chair, Deputy Chair  of  the  NCOP,  in  absentia,  hon
Minister for Provincial and Local Government, as well as  the  Minister  for
the Public Service and Administration, including  the  Deputy  Minister  for
Provincial and local Government, hon members and special  delegates,  ladies
and gentlemen, firstly, I bring greetings from our father who art  in  local
government - Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa - to the Council this afternoon.

The state of the nation address by  the  President  of  our  country,  Thabo
Mbeki, just over a month  ago  on  21  May,  placed  the  responsibility  of
service delivery squarely on  the  shoulders  of  municipalities.  President
Mbeki outlined a programme of action complete with timeframes  and  priority
areas. The programme tasks municipalities to  deliver  basic  sanitation  to
about 300 000 households by the end of the 2004-05 financial year and  clean
water and sanitation  to  all  schools  within  the  same  period;  and   by
December this year, we are supposed to deliver clean, potable water  to  the
10th million South African  since  1994.  Of  course,  we  have  to  deliver
numerous  other  infrastructural  projects,  such  as  housing,  roads   and
electricity.

With  challenges  around  indigent  policies,  meter  installation,   proper
billing  systems,  debt  collection  and  municipal  arrears,  the   biggest
question on the minds of many is whether municipalities  have  the  capacity
to  manage  resources  efficiently  and  effectively  to  deliver   on   the
instruction of the President. This question is especially pertinent as  both
the provincial departments and municipalities  are  currently  busy  tabling
their budgets. Because the Government has made an explicit commitment  to  a
decade   of   a   people-centred   Government   and   service    excellence,
municipalities simply have to deliver.

I am proud to inform this House that the SA  Local  Government  Association,
that is Salga, is putting mechanisms in place to empower  municipalities  in
the area of the best practice, as initiated by the  Ministry  of  Provincial
and Local Government. More  specifically,  Salga  runs  week-long  financial
workshops in all provinces, focusing on financial challenges, pressures  and
complexities within the local government sector. It brings  together  fiscal
elements of the developmental local government and deals in depth  with  the
funding of the provision of municipal services. All  these  efforts  confirm
that local government has transformed, and that now we are putting in  place
mechanisms to ensure best  practices  in  financial  management  within  the
sector.

The 2004 Budget consolidates 10 years  of  major  transformation  challenges
and achievements in our economy.  It  also  reflects  the  continued  fiscal
discipline against  a  fairly  stagnating  global  economy,  notwithstanding
recent indications of recovery. Over the past 10 years Government  has  made
significant achievements, mainly in reducing poverty, through the  provision
of basic services to  an  increasing  number  of  South  Africans  who  were
previously  marginalized,  and  by  so  doing  narrowing  inequalities   and
vulnerability. To this end, the following is observed from the 2004 Budget.

The total Budget for 2004  was  significantly  affected  by  the  less-than-
anticipated revenue collected nationally, which was  signalled  also  during
the medium-term process in 2003. While R63 billion was  added  to  the  2002
budget over three years, only R44,5 billion has been added,  focused  mainly
on Public Service delivery programmes. Local government  received  14,5%  of
the total budget for 2004. About R2,2 billion from 2004-05 to  2006-07  will
be channelled to  municipalities  for  water,  sanitation,  electricity  and
refuse removal according to the equitable share. Almost  R1,7  billion  will
be channelled to municipalities towards infrastructure development.
Growth has increased to 3% between 1994 and 2003. This  compares  favourably
with the 1% growth posted prior  to  a  democratic  South  Africa,  that  is
between 1984 and 1993. Inflation has been stable, and continues  to  decline
as a result of further appreciation of the  Rand,  and  is  now  within  the
monetary policy target of between 3% and 6%.

Government has managed to bring down debt service costs as a  percentage  of
GDP,  freeing  additional  resources  for  socioeconomic  development.   The
financial account net inflows have increased to R169, R6  billion  over  the
past 10 years. There has been an increase in infrastructure investment  from
16% to 25% of GDP over the past 10 years. An additional  R3,2  billion  will
flow  to  municipalities  and  provinces  for  the  Expanded  Public   Works
Programme and infrastructure.

About R6 billion is targeted for  Black  Economic  Empowerment  initiatives.
Social welfare to provinces has increased significantly to a total of  R19,6
billion,  to  cater  for  social  grants,  schools,  hospitals  and   clinic
services. Also significant in the 2004 Budget is the  elimination  of  stamp
duty on mortgage loans and an increase in the threshold on transfer duty  on
property transactions up to R150 000.
Health and  Education  received  the  largest  portion  of  the  Budget.  An
allocation  of  About  R300  million  for  this  financial  year   is   also
appreciated. Unlike the previous year, where there was R13 billion  provided
as relief on personal income tax, we note that  only  R4  billion  could  be
accommodated this year. This should, however, be viewed against the  10-year
achievement of R73 billion in tax relief.

The downsides  to  the  budget  are  noted,  that  job  creation  remains  a
challenge, for instance.  However,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  Expanded
Public Works Programme will begin to address job  formation,  including  the
employment of the community development workers. There has  been  a  decline
in the manufacturing industry, mainly as  a  result  of  the  stronger  rand
since the past year to date.

To enable Salga to objectively review the  2004  Budget  as  it  relates  to
municipalities, an analysis on the division of revenue to  local  government
was  undertaken.  The  analyses  were  performed  on  the  equitable   share
allocations  at  micro  level,  and  on  the  equitable  share  formula  and
conditional grants. Data  for  this  report  has  been  extracted  from  the
Division of Revenue Act, Act 7 of 2003, as well as the Division  of  Revenue
Bill of 2004, including the Budget Reviews of 2001-04,  notwithstanding  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review of 2001-03.

The key findings on the analysis are listed as follow:  There  are  numerous
and large changes between the local government equitable share, and this  is
stated in the Division of Revenue Act of 2003 and the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill of 2004. There is no obvious trend with regard to  the  above  changes.
Some municipalities have seen the equitable  share  increase,  while  others
have seen theirs decrease. The census data does not appear to impact on  the
size of the  equitable  share  to  individual  municipalities.  The  larger,
wealthier metros have also seen their equitable share allocations  increase,
whilst this is not the case for the less-wealthy metros.

There is a significant number of nodal municipalities receiving less in  the
Division of Revenue Act of this year than gazetted last year. In total,  the
equitable share shown in the division of revenue for the  2005  budget  year
is less than the amount shown on the  2003  budget  for  about  104  of  our
category B municipalities. There are insufficient data  sets  to  perform  a
meaningful analysis of trends in either the equitable share  or  conditional
grants. This is owing, in part, to the manner in  which  these  grants  have
continually evolved since their introduction.

The conditional grant system has  been  rationalised  and  restructured  for
this coming financial year.  The  conditional  grants  to  local  government
increased from approximately R5 billion, in  the  last  financial  year,  to
R6,7 billion in the 2006-07 financial year. This is an increase of 11%  over
the medium term. The infrastructure  grant  from  the  bulk  of  conditional
grants has increased from R4,1 billion to nearly R6 billion over the  medium
term.

In  2003-04  the  Consolidated  Municipal  Infrastructure   Programme,   the
Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme  and  the  Urban  Transport   Fund
together amounted to  only  R2,64  billion.  But  this  financial  year  the
municipal  infrastructure  grant,  which  will  be  replacing  these  three,
amounts to R4,5 billion, which is appreciated.

Capacity-building grants  will  be  capped  at  R750  million  from  2005-06
onwards. A  commonality  between  the  equitable  share  and  the  municipal
infrastructure grant is that an individual municipality receives a share  of
funding as a proportion of the  allocation  to  all  municipalities,  rather
than their allocations being viewed or looked at  as  needs-based.  The  MIG
introduces  ...  Perhaps,  for  the  sake  of  time  I   should   say   that
notwithstanding all these challenges ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I'm afraid your  time  has
expired.

Cllr M D DIKOKO: Well, Chair, maybe if you allow me 45 seconds,  I  will  be
able to say that Salga will continue to ... [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Hon  Chairperson,
Ministers, members and special delegates, ladies and gentlemen,  decades  of
apartheid colonial rule penetrated the most basic and elementary aspects  of
our lives and sought, as its primary  objective,  to  socially  and  morally
oppress and divide the majority in our nation. Both social status and  human
dignity were judged in terms of white and black.

The apartheid regime's policies of exclusion separated us  from  each  other
and defined the majority as second class residents, fit only  to  serve  and
provide labour to a small racial minority. These same exclusionary  policies
separated us into racially distinct places  of  residence,  worship,  school
and leisure. Our cultural, religious and linguistic  differences  were  used
against us to reinforce this exclusionary logic.

In 1994 this country  embarked  on  a  new  journey  of  reconstructing  and
reweaving the  rich,  social,  human  fabric  and  tapestry  of  our  broken
society. The majority of our people voted for a new society based on  values
such as nonracialism, nonsexism, equality and  human  dignity  in  a  single
united South Africa.  In  1994  this  newly  elected  democratic  Government
started the process of building one  inclusive  South  African  nation.  Our
commitment to nation-building was captured in the supreme law  of  the  land
in 1996, whose founding provisions clearly outlined a new value  base.  This
was further enshrined in the Bill of Rights  that  affirmed  the  democratic
values of human dignity, equality and freedom.

Freedom of expression and the recognition of 11  official  languages  became
two of the many defining  features  that  separated  us  from  the  previous
apartheid regime. We went further in our Constitution to define the role  of
the state as being that of respecting, protecting, promoting and  fulfilling
the rights outlined. This was further complemented by making provisions  for
the establishment of various independent state institutions  whose  role  it
was to strengthen our constitutional democracy.

On matters specifically pertaining to nation-building and  social  cohesion,
we provided for the  establishment  of  the  Human  Rights  Commission,  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities and the Commission on Gender  Equality.


The nine provinces are an indivisible part of the Republic of South  Africa.
Provinces have an indispensable role and responsibility in  contributing  to
matters  of  nation-building  and  social  cohesion,  as  outlined  in   the
Constitution. Provinces have legislative and  executive  powers  within  the
concurrent functions in schedule 4, and exclusive functions  in  schedule  5
of the Constitution. What this means in practice is  that  provinces  mainly
administer social services functions, that is education, social  grants  and
health. An  analysis  of  expenditure  trends  since  1994  shows  that  the
provincial sphere continues to play a valuable role in  addressing  some  of
the material conditions that give rise to  social  fragmentation  and  moral
decline in our communities.

Firstly, more than 50%  of  the  national  annual  Budget  is  allocated  to
provinces, and of this amount more  than  80%  is  allocated  between  three
sectors, that is health, education and social grants. Secondly, if  we  look
at provincial expenditure for the fourth quarter  of  2003-04,  we  can  see
that from a budget of R171,1 billion, provinces had  spent  R170,1  billion.
Capital spending in the nine  provinces  was  R17,4  billion  of  the  total
adjusted budget of R19,2 billion. The highest share of capital spending  was
in the public works, roads and transport departments.

Education expenditure for the fourth quarter totalled R59,8 billion,  social
development  R42,2  billion,  and  health  R37,1  billion.  Overall   social
services, that is education, health, and social development spent  81,7%  of
total provincial spending.

This brief analysis demonstrates  the  important  role  that  provinces  are
playing in contributing to the social and human  capital  wellbeing  of  our
people.  Inadequate  schools  and  education  infrastructure,  poor   social
amenities, a lack of basic  health  care  facilities,  and  the  absence  of
social grants to the most vulnerable all undermine the  basis  for  national
pride and social cohesion.

This role of provinces must be located in our  system  of  intergovernmental
fiscal relations. The Constitution gives provinces very limited own revenue-
raising powers. It  is  for  this  reason  that  provinces  rely  mainly  on
national transfers. In 2002-03 over 96% of provincial  revenue  was  derived
from national transfers. Provincial own revenue is thus  just  under  4%  of
their own budgets.

Expenditure analysis trends within the provincial sphere, undertaken by  the
National Treasury over recent years, speak to a number of  positive  trends.
Key amongst these has been the ability of provinces to  improve  expenditure
management. This has resulted in strong real spending of 7,5% in  provincial
budgets in 2003-04. This will allow  provinces  to  expand  and  consolidate
existing programmes in key areas of social development in 2004 and beyond.

As a country we have been proud to be able to demonstrate the  expansion  of
our social safety net and social grant programmes to the most vulnerable  in
our country since 1994. Expenditure on social grants with the direct aid  of
provinces, since 1994 to 2003, has  increased  from  R10  billion  to  R34,8
billion. The historical reasons for this expenditure pattern are well  known
to us. However, as we move into  the  next  decade  we  will  need  to  find
innovative ways of adopting a more sustainable allocative spending  pattern.
This speaks to addressing the fundamental duality in  our  economy  and  the
role that provinces will need to play in this  regard.  We  will  return  to
this matter on a later occasion.

In  2003  this  House  supported  the  enactment   of   national   framework
legislation on the institution of traditional leadership.  Since  the  birth
of our new democracy in 1994, this piece  of  legislation  is  probably  the
single most important law to affirm the  relevance  of  the  institution  of
traditional  leadership  in  the  reconstruction  and  development  of  this
country.

In the  preamble  to  this  legislation  we  recommitted  ourselves  to  the
following democratic values, and these included: democratic  governance  and
the values of an open society; and gender equality  within  the  institution
of traditional leadership. We affirmed the role of this institution  in  our
system of governance across all three spheres of government  and  entrenched
a number of provisions that seek to give greater clarity in this regard.  We
made  provision  for  the  establishment  of  local  Houses  of  Traditional
Leadership, traditional councils and also a National  Commission  on  Claims
and Disputes. The House has just heard from the MEC from  the  Eastern  Cape
on the progress already made in this regard.

We are well aware that this institution performed  a  crucial  role  in  the
promotion of ubuntu and communal values in our rural communities. This  role
was brutally eroded  and  distorted  through  many  years  of  colonial  and
apartheid rule. As we enter the second decade of freedom  in  this  country,
we expect this institution of traditional leadership to  support  Government
in giving full effect to the democratic values of  nonracialism,  nonsexism,
equality and human dignity of our Constitution, as well as  the  spirit  and
provisions outlined in the national framework legislation.

National and provincial government will continue to support the  institution
in its role as the custodian of culture and tradition  in  our  communities.
We will also work with this institution as a partner with  local  government
to facilitate delivery and implementation of priority programmes, and  fight
poverty, unemployment, marginalisation  and  HIV/Aids.  Traditional  leaders
will have an important role in the campaign for moral regeneration and  will
need to place special emphasis on matters such as  crime,  child  and  women
abuse.

The Department of Provincial and Local Government  will  work  closely  with
provinces  to  ensure  that  they  provide  appropriate  support   to   this
institution of  traditional  leadership,  especially  as  they  prepare  and
finalise provincial-specific legislation on this institution by early  2005.


In May 2004 the President outlined the key priorities  for  the  country  in
2004 and beyond. We will expect the institution of  traditional  leadership,
as it is constituted across all  levels  of  Government  and  in  our  local
communities, to clearly define their supporting  role  in  facilitating  the
implementation of these commitments. Key programmes that will require  their
active  participation  will  include  the   Integrated   Sustainable   Rural
Development Programme, the Expanded Public Works  Programme,  the  municipal
infrastructure grant and various social development  programmes  and  social
grant campaigns.

In 2003 we enacted legislation  that  made  it  possible  to  establish  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities.  This  commission  will  also  play  a
unique role in strengthening the social fabric of  our  society.  Under  the
apartheid regime our wealthy reservoir of  culture,  religion  and  language
was used as instruments of division, segmentation  and  discrimination.  The
fragmentation of our society was based on racist and colonialist notions  of
social status and class.

Today, with the establishment and support of this commission, we aim  to  do
exactly the opposite. Our rich diversity in culture, religion  and  language
must be used to build  a  single,  united  and  socially  transformed  South
African nation. The mission of the commission  is  to  promote  and  develop
peace, friendship, humanity, tolerance and national  unity  among  cultural,
religious and linguistic communities. Since 1994 all  communities  are  free
under the law to enjoy their culture, practise their religion  and  use  the
language of their choice.

We  are  pleased  to  report  satisfactory  progress  in  the  work  of  the
commission since its  announcement  by  the  President  in  September  2003.
Eighteen commissioners were appointed by the President with Dr Mongezi  Guma
as  Chairperson  and  Mrs  Marlene  Bethlehem  as  Deputy  Chairperson.  The
commission was formally  inaugurated  by  Judge  President  B  Ngoepe  on  2
December 2003 in Pretoria.

This commission has already convened its first  strategic  planning  session
and has  identified  critical  work  areas  or  thrusts  on  which  it  will
concentrate. These include public  education  and  information;  undertaking
investigation and assisting  with  dispute  resolution;  undertaking  policy
research;  facilitating  the  establishment  of  community   councils;   and
convening its first  national  consultative  conference  by  December  2004.
Lastly, we will regularly keep this House  informed  of  the  valuable  work
that will be undertaken by this commission. The ministry and the  department
will provide ongoing and appropriate support to the work of the  commission.

The task of nation-building and mending the social  fabric  of  our  society
will require active intervention and support from the state and its  various
associated institutions of governance.  Today  we  have  outlined  the  very
important roles and functions  that  will  need  to  be  undertaken  by  our
provinces,  the  institution  of  traditional  leadership  and   the   newly
established Commission for the Promotion and Protection  of  the  Rights  of
Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call upon the hon Ms M  P
Themba. I am informed that she will speak on behalf of  the  MEC  for  local
government and housing in Mpumalanga.

Ms M P THEMBA: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
Government, hon Minister for the  Public  Service  and  Administration,  hon
Deputy Minister, it is a privilege for me to present  to  you  a  speech  on
behalf of Mr  J  L  Mahlangu,  MEC  for  local  government  and  housing  in
Mpumalanga. He is unable to be here because  he  is  presenting  his  budget
speech in the province today.

On 14 April 2004 the citizens of  South  Africa  clearly  articulated  their
wishes on who should lead in South Africa. They gave the  ruling  party  the
mandate to proceed to deliver on the people's contract to  create  jobs  and
meet the basic needs of the people. All of us in  the  department  of  local
government and housing in Mpumalanga intend to do just that. On 3  May  2004
the hon Premier, T S P Makwetla,  announced  a  new  department  called  the
department  of  local  government  and  housing.  On   9   June   2004   the
administrative arm  of  traditional  affairs  was  also  added  to  the  new
department. The  overall  challenge  is  developing  a  common  departmental
culture and work ethic from  the  newly  merged  three  units.  We  need  to
provide the necessary resources, staffing and capacity-building for the  new
incumbents.  These  programmes  will  include  the  implementation  of   the
learnership programme  in  the  department,  as  well  as  facilitating  the
orientation and adjustment of the community development workers.

The merger of the three components led  to  the  creation  of  a  formidable
structure that will inclusively build on all the  people  of  the  province.
Both local and  national  Government  will  jointly,  with  the  department,
creatively respond to the basic needs of the people in a manner that  builds
on our cultural diverse heritage and rich value base. The  addition  of  the
traditional affairs administration follows closely on  the  signing  of  the
Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, No  41  of  2003.  This
Act suggests that we need  equivalent  provincial  legislation.  Significant
guidance provided  by  this  Act  is  a  judicial  structure  to  deal  with
succession disputes and other disputes. Legal task teams are  preparing  for
the necessary legislation. The local government  transformation  process  is
nationally driven. The process comprises 15 strategic interventions.  It  is
a systematic and phased process, which commenced  in  2000.  The  Mpumalanga
province actively participated in this process.

Our province's performance in this  process  demonstrates  a  commitment  to
development and growth. A  sound  foundation  has  been  laid  and  building
blocks are in place. We are taking a cue from the spirit  of  intentions  in
the Intergovernmental  Relations  Bill  and  framework.  The  province  will
utilise the national guidelines to  developmentally  build  sound  relations
within the various spheres of Government. This is a concerted  action  aimed
at proactively building a strong local government sphere and  enhancing  its
status to deliver  services  within  a  stable,  well  managed  co-operative
government framework; strengthening  the  existing  base  of  structures  to
achieve  sound  and  financially  viable  local  government  with  a  stable
administrative and institutional information technology  systems;  improving
accelerating and extending the initiatives rolled out by free basic  service
delivery and local economic development; and deepening local  democracy  and
accountability to ensure the capacitating of ward committees.  To  this  end
workshops have been initiated to build the capacity of ward committees.  The
community development workers will add value to this process.

The recent  negative  publicity  at  local  and  district  municipal  levels
demonstrates a need to establish a  strong  provincial  development  support
structure for municipalities. The  Minmec  system,  the  Municipalities  and
MECs' Forum will be utilised as a method or vehicle pertinently  to  provide
leadership and policy information sharing, thereby  providing  direction  on
critical governance matters. My department  has  started  implementing  this
developmental  approach.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation   information   and
technology system was piloted in eight municipalities.  The  lessons  learnt
suggest a need to roll out the monitoring and evaluation IT system into  all
municipalities over the next two-year period. This diagnostic tool  will  be
followed by the diagnostic response, and the support team will be set up  by
the  end  of  December  2004.  This  team  will  be  able  to  come  into  a
municipality, follow up on the issues raised by the diagnostic tool and  put
in place corrective measures. The lessons learnt in two ventures managed  to
put in place the much-needed capacity that improved  revenue  and  stability
at Dipaliseng and Ethlanzeni. We will continue to consolidate  these  gains.
This is going to be a dedicated permanent team.

The department is committed to the elimination of  corruption.  We  will  be
enhancing sound systems of  accountability  within  all  structures  of  the
provinces. We are acting on all the identified forms of corruption  and  are
adopting a developmental approach to capacitate all our structures on  sound
governance practices. The full implementation of the  code  of  conduct  for
public servants is one of the initiatives.  Increased  contact  with  senior
leadership at municipal  level,  both  administrative  and  political,  will
enhance the plan to rid us of these negative elements. The  current  reality
is that free basic services are  not  reaching  people  who  need  it  most,
namely the previously disadvantaged sectors of our community. The reason  is
that the provision of readily measured water is not assured in the  previous
homeland areas and  a  sanitation  prerequisite  infrastructure  is  not  in
place. This infrastructure costs a lot of money.  I  am  suggesting  a  bold
move that will have an impact on service delivery. I am  proposing  that  we
bite the bullet and roll-out full water and  sanitation  services,  district
by district over the next five years. We will achieve  this  lasting  impact
if we look at the full  municipal  infrastructure  grant  and  roll-out  per
district of the total water and sanitation programme.  While  we  ponder  on
this strategy we will continue with the current plans that cannot be  halted
because they have already commenced. The roll-out  of  free  basic  services
will address the needs through the municipal infrastructure grant.

The province will deliver on  disaster  management  services  in  compliance
with the national policy. Plans  are  advanced  to  establish  a  provincial
disaster management centre and the roll-out of the provincial framework  and
guidelines that will assist every municipality to develop its  own  disaster
response  programme.  Numerous  capacity  building  initiatives  are  taking
place.  The  Norwegian  funded  initiative  enables  us  to  pilot  the   IT
diagnostic tool.  Workshops  are  taking  place  on  the  Municipal  Finance
Management Act.  This  will  ensure  sound  financial  management,  disaster
management, the roll-out on MIG and community development in Mpumalanga  and
the presidential strategic leadership development programme.

The introduction of community development workers to assist  with  community
participation at local government level will  start  with  60  participants.
Recruitment is at an advanced stage. Standards drafted  in  bylaws  will  be
published in the provincial Gazette. Municipalities, if  they  do  so  wish,
can adopt these bylaws  as  their  own.  This  will  faciliate  the  billing
system.  The  bylaws  in  question  are  related  to  credit  control,  debt
collection,    cemeteries    and    crematoria.     Thank     you.     [Time

Mr P F VILAKAZI (North West): Chairperson, hon Minister  Mufamadi,  Minister
Fraser-Moleketi, Deputy Minister Hangana, MECs and members of the NCOP,  you
will bear with me, I have a bit of flu. Deputy  Chairperson  of  Committees,
the new  paradigm  of  local  government  emerged  during  the  intense  and
vigorous election campaign, led by  the  President  of  my  party  the  ANC,
Comrade Thabo Mbeki, when he visited young and old, black  and  white  alike
in their homes to see what has to be done.

It emerged during the election day itself that saw millions in  long  queues
at Ga-Sekgonyane, Garankuwa, Motswedi,  Mafikeng,  Kanana,  Klerksdorp,  and
many  more  towns,  townships  and  villages,  including  farmlands  in  our
province. This is a mandate given by our people on how the ANC  should  take
government forward. The people of  South  Africa  entered  into  a  people's
contract with the ANC to deepen participatory democracy,  provide  municipal
services efficiently, and put quality shelter over their  heads  in  a  more
rapid way, creating jobs and fighting poverty.

On 24 May 2004 His Excellency President Thabo Mbeki gave all of us  marching
orders setting the tone for  a  delivery  framework,  underpinned  by  clear
targets and time-based deliverables in the  state  of  the  nation  address.
These targets, inter alia, included giving all people access to clean  water
in the next five years, extending basic sanitation  to  more  than  300  000
households in the coming year, eradicating the  bucket  system  in  all  our
townships by 2006, spending R14 million in the  next  three  years  to  give
people access to shelter, and lastly to spend R1,2  billion  annually  which
will focus on bulk electricity infrastructure in  rural  areas  and  address
the estimated 3 million household backlog in electricity.

The hon Premier of the North West, Ms Molewa, on 28 May  2004  directed  all
of us in the province to elaborate on  provincial  orders  of  delivery  and
this, inter alia, included in the short term to  act  decisively  to  ensure
functionality  of  all  those  municipalities  crippled  by  political   and
administrative problems, resulting in the collapse of service  delivery;  in
the medium to long term to  build  capacity  of  municipalities  to  deliver
services through training in conflict  management,  project  management  and
administrative skills, guided by the national strategy assembly  a  trouble-
shooting team to assist troubled municipalities, intensify the  training  of
ward committees, roll out the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme,  to  drive
skills development targeting the youth, women and people with  disabilities;
and capacitating traffic policing and public safety  institutions,  aligning
their  work  with  counterparts  in  other  provinces  and  municipal  level
enforcement agencies. She also said to us that municipal policing needed  to
be  piloted  in  the  province  in   the   Mafikeng   and   the   Rustenburg
Municipalities.
Minister Mufamadi on 21 June directed departments  of  local  government  in
the entire country to pay priority attention to technical  requirements  for
good governance. And on his part, he will assemble a  high-calibre  team  to
undertake intense hands-on support for  municipalities  experiencing  short-
term needs. He also mentioned with regard to  the  municipal  infrastructure
grant that we should ensure that over 375  000  households  benefit  through
the provision of clean water; and  that  over  300  000  households  benefit
through the access to basic sanitation in the year 2004-05.

He also said  that  the  progressive,  natural  solvency  of  municipalities
needed to be put on our priority list and  that  he  will  ensure  that  the
Property Rates Act guidelines are issued within the next  three  months.  He
also said that the equitable share allocation will be revised and  therefore
be equitably distributed. He also directed us to the  free  basic  programme
to extend the social safety net  to  the  most  vulnerable.  Today  Minister
Mufamadi highlighted the  need  to  create  an  effective  intergovernmental
framework   underpinned   by   interspherical   planning    and    budgeting
implementation processes. This we agree with and support.

On the 25 June we presented to the North  West  Provincial  Legislature  our
plan to realize  the  marching  orders  given  by  our  principals  and  the
delivery processes needed to service and develop our communities.  Over  the
past two months we  started,  as  a  department,  a  journey  to  shake  the
bureaucracy and the department in order to create an efficient  organisation
to meet the new paradigm.

We are on course to create  a  place  where  people  get  up  every  morning
searching for a better way to do their best and improving on what  they  did
yesterday. As we go about creating these efficiencies we will not  wait  too
long to get rid of managers and staff who are not willing or able to  change
and embrace the new breeze of working to achieve our marching orders.

We will spend a relatively short time to recruit, train, develop and  reward
the best amongst us. Change in how we will deliver will occur, as  you  have
never seen before, at a speed you have never seen. It will be fun for  those
who relish it and fearful for those who do not grasp its  opportune  moment.
For us in the North West there is only one way to respond positively to  the
marching orders of our principals and change the way we used to  do  things.
By this we do not mean that things were done wrongly in  the  past,  but  we
mean we should improve on how we used to do things.

Contrary to the belief of some councillors and some members of  the  public,
section  139  of  the   Constitution   intends   nothing   but   to   assist
municipalities  to  meet  their  obligations  and  that  of  serving   their
communities with basic services and developmental needs  without  fail.  The
North West Provincial Executive Council rightly intervened  through  section
139  to  stabilise  and  normalise  deteriorating  administrations  and  the
political functioning of various municipalities that impacted negatively  on
service delivery.

In  the  intervening  period,  Lekoataemane  local  municipality  has   been
successfully  dealt  with   and   normalisation   has   returned.   Mafikeng
municipality  is  currently  under  section  139(b),  which  proves  to   be
difficult to resolve. Recently an agent was appointed and  the  departmental
seconded  official  was  withdrawn  to  fast  track  and   consolidate   the
intervention.

Mamusa local  municipality  was  recently  dissolved  and  an  administrator
appointed. The processes are under  way  to  bring  back  administration  to
normality in this municipality. At the heart of most of these  interventions
there is a lack of discipline and co-operation  amongst  councillors,  which
ultimately  affects  the  functioning  of  councils.  It  also  affects  the
administration and consequently service delivery. As a province  we  have  a
constitutional  responsibility  to  ensure  that   municipalities   maintain
national standards or meet established minimum standards for  the  rendering
of services.

We cannot abdicate this responsibility and let the community suffer  at  the
hands of people who are otherwise more interested  in  issues  unrelated  to
the wellbeing of the community. We will not hesitate to  intervene  in  that
and bring perpetrators to book, and call for the re-election of leaders  who
put their interests first over that of the community. We  are  intending  to
take practical measures to  ensure  that  we  discharge  our  constitutional
mandate in earnest and avoid reacting to situations only  when  they  occur,
or when they have worsened.

Over  the  next  two  weeks  we  will  receive  an  assessment   report   of
municipalities in the province from the  Minister,  through  which  we  will
develop  a  targeted   intervention   plan   to   turn   around   struggling
municipalities. We  must,  however,  commend  the  following  municipalities
which we think are equal to the task:  the  Rustenburg  local  municipality;
the Potchefstroom local municipality; the Moses Kotane  local  municipality;
the Southern District local municipality,  whose  chairperson  has  had  the
opportunity to address the House today; the Bojanala district  council;  the
Bophirima district council and many more municipalities  that  continues  to
service our communities.

We will, in joint collaboration with the department  as  I  said,  undertake
the following in a much more focused way.  We  will  develop  early  warning
systems to monitor the performance of municipalities on a monthly basis;  we
will develop empowering legislation and regulation in line with section  156
of the Constitution and 105 of the Municipal Systems Act to  streamline  the
monitoring of municipalities.

We will assemble over the next month  a  high-calibre  team  guided  by  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government to undertake intense  hands-on
support for municipalities experiencing short-term needs. We do so,  mindful
of the need to streamline our  capacity  building,  support  and  monitoring
responsibilities ... [Time expired.]
Mr M A MZIZI:  The  Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration  is
responsible for providing policy and  strategic  leadership  to  the  Public
Service, to enhance the Public Service's ability to deliver on  Government's
priorities and objectives. This is one of  the  most  important  departments
because of its function of ensuring an efficient  delivery  of  services  to
our people.

The efficient delivery of services to our people can  only  be  achieved  if
the skills of public  servants  are  improved.  The  issue  of  ill-equipped
public servants who render an inefficient service should be dealt with as  a
matter of urgency.  This problem of inadequate skills of public servants  is
a contributing factor that slows down  service  delivery,  which  especially
affects the poor. It is vital that this issue be dealt with as  speedily  as
possible.

The inefficiency of Setas, in addition,  only  aggravates  this  problem  of
skills acquisition. The Setas are supposed to render a service, but  instead
they seem only to add to the problem instead of solving  it.  They  need  to
become more results driven for the  improvement  of  skills  acquisition  by
public servants. This is fundamental to the improvement of service  delivery
and an improved Public Service for all South Africans. In addition, the  IFP
believes that the Department of Public Service  and  Administration  renders
an important service. They need to focus on skills  acquisition  for  public
servants as a fundamental point of departure.

The IFP supports the  Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration's
objective to  prevent  and  combat  corruption  in  the  Public  Service  by
establishing and  implementing  strategies  and  partnerships  that  improve
ethical conduct and practice. In this regard the IFP supports the Vote.

The Department of Local Government and Administration  carries  out  a  very
important  function  in  our  society,  which  is  that  of  developing  and
promoting a national system of co-operative governance and  to  support  the
development of provincial and local government.

There is, however, concern about whether it has  enough  capacity  to  carry
out all the prerequisites in consolidating the system  of  local  government
for accelerating service delivery. In relation  to  this,  local  government
has to be capacitated adequately to ensure that it is able  to  perform  its
function effectively. One problem that will also affect access to  services,
and hence service delivery, is adequate funds  for  municipalities  to  make
basic services accessible to those who need them.

The IFP does not believe that adequate funds  have  been  allocated  to  the
budget of the Department of Local Government  and  Administration.  The  IFP
also believes that this budget will not accommodate the requirements of  the
free basic services for communities. Many  municipalities  have  failed  our
people in supplying free basic services, stating that their budgets  do  not
allow them to expand to reach all areas. One  such  example  is  the  Maluti
aPhofung in QwaQwa in the Free State.

The Phutadichaba  community  have  access  to  free  basic  services,  while
Ntabazwe township in Harrismith do not, yet they  are  served  by  the  same
council. In this regard, it is vital that adequate ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I am afraid your time  has
expired.

Mr D WORTH: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson. My speech this  afternoon  is
directed to the hon Minister for the Public Service and Administration.
Hon Deputy Chairperson, the job of politicians is to  formulate  policy  and
provide the strategic vision. The administration then has  to  execute  this
function. Our  public  sector  institutions  constitute  the  most  powerful
instrument of Government to realise the vision for South Africa. Our  people
are  entitled  to  the  realisation  of  this  vision  for  prosperity   and
democracy. Government therefore has the  right  and  the  responsibility  to
ensure that our public institutions are functioning optimally.

Whilst the Government has made  much  progress  in  transforming  the  state
machinery to make it more responsive to the needs  of  its  citizens  -  and
more accountable - the level of service is often hardly acceptable. One  has
to look at the service provided by  the  Departments  of  Home  Affairs  and
Social Development or the motor licensing  offices  throughout  the  various
provinces. The work ethic is sometimes poor and the Public  Service  is  not
always motivated to serve the people and taxpayers in  a  dignified  manner.
The President has stated however that:


  ... this Government will ensure that the  public  sector  discharges  its
  responsibilities to our people as a critical player in the process of the
  growth, reconstruction and development of our country.

People are by far the most valuable asset in any endeavour  and  this  holds
true for the Public Service. Employing over a  million  people,  the  Public
Service is by far the biggest employer in the  country.  Whilst  the  Public
Service  has  shrunk  by  around  15%  since  1994,  many   public   service
organisations are struggling to  meet  the  required  standards  in  crucial
areas. The introduction of the senior management service  has  improved  the
conditions for the senior managers with the aim of retaining and  attracting
skilled personnel, but the lack of technically empowered  personnel  at  all
levels is a matter of concern.

This problem is particularly acute in the provinces  and  local  government.
Many skilled and experienced personnel,  developed  since  1994,  are  being
lost to the private sector. The exodus of  doctors  and  nurses  from  state
hospitals and clinics partly reflects this pressure.

Local government continues to make use  of  consultants  at  enormous  cost.
Alternative ways must be  found  of  addressing  these  needs  by  means  of
training,  capacity-building  and  recruitment  before  hiring  consultants.
Consultants are often appointed without having the  required  experience  or
competence, skills are not transferred to the staff,  and  appointments  are
often virtually permanent.

The Democratic Alliance welcomes the  Government's  initiative  in  refining
the monitoring and evaluation system to improve  the  system  of  government
and the quality of outputs. We welcome the launch of the Batho Pele  Gateway
Portal  to  provide  streamlined  government  services,  as  we  heard  this
afternoon, online at post offices and multipurpose community centres.

Corruption  in  the  Public  Service  continues  to  be  of  major  concern.
Corruption is essentially the use of public office  for  private  gain.  The
most illegal activities in the Public Service happen with  the  awarding  of
tenders, buying of equipment and other goods and services. A  high  standard
of professional ethics must continue to be promoted and  maintained  through
the implementation  of  the  Public  Service  Anti-Corruption  Strategy,  by
strictly enforcing the Public Finance Management Act as well  as  the  Local
Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act.  Corruption,  however,  is
likely to continue to be  a  major  challenge  to  the  Public  Service  and
proactive efforts will be needed to address new forms of corruption as  they
emerge ... [Time expired.]

Ms E S MABE: Hon Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,
present MECs, hon members, special delegates, ladies  and  gentlemen,  these
are the speech notes of the MEC of the Free State who could not  be  present
here today because of unforeseen circumstances. It reads as follows:

We are celebrating 10 years of a democratic system  in  Government.  In  our
pursuit to restructure and govern the  country,  we  were  faced  with  many
daunting challenges; our efforts were not in vain. In these 10  years  local
government, in  particular,  has  assisted  the  country  in  achieving  the
following: We have established a nonracial, democratic, developmental  local
government; rationalised the number of  municipalities  from  99  to  25  to
ensure the pooling of resources and expertise for carrying out  the  mandate
assigned to local government; and developed and enacted a series  of  policy
and legislative frameworks geared towards transforming  municipalities  into
developmental entities - as envisaged by the Constitution.

A  number  of  tools  outlined  in  the  aforesaid  policy  and  legislative
frameworks, viz integrated development planning and  community  involvements
or engagements are being used effectively by municipalities as a  basis  for
ensuring optimal use of limited  resources  and  forging  participation  for
development   facilitation   with   communities   they   serve   and   other
stakeholders. Financial management and the position of  municipalities  have
been stabilised in the  past  three  years  through  the  Municipal  Support
Programme that yielded  a  positive  effect  on  the  treasury  capacity  of
municipalities.

Despite the laudable achievements, there are a  number  of  challenges  that
local government faces that need to be tackled with  relentless  vigour  and
determination. These  are  firstly,  the  limited  revenue  bases  that  are
prevalent in the majority of municipalities in our  province  -  this  means
that the attainment of enduring  financial  viability  will  be  an  arduous
task; secondly,  building  leadership  capabilities  for  the  provision  of
strategic and effective leadership at municipal level;  thirdly,  supporting
municipalities in the implementation of the new system of  local  government
- planning, performance  management  and  the  new  policy  frameworks:  the
Municipal Finance  Management  Act  of  2003  and  the  yet  to  be  enacted
Municipal Property Rates Act.

There are a number of factors that need to be dealt with  simultaneously  to
create an environment conducive to  setting  municipalities  on  a  path  to
attain financial viability. Firstly,  we  will  continue  providing  ongoing
support to municipalities in executing their  Treasury  responsibilities  of
preparing budgets, compiling financial  statements  and  updating  financial
records and  asset  registers.  Those  activities  are  the  foundation  for
financial  viability  as  part   of   the   Municipal   Support   Programme.
Strategically, we will be providing resources to selected municipalities  to
develop comprehensive  mechanisms  for  revenue  collection  strategies  and
development and  implementation  of  strategies  to  deal  with  the  rising
municipal debt in our  municipalities.  Furthermore,  we  will  ensure  that
projects identified and implemented in municipalities to  improve  liquidity
of municipalities contribute towards the achievement of objectives  set  out
in the Municipal Revenue Enhancement Programme developed by  the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government.

Secondly, we will be conducting an  extensive  review  on  how  the  lesser-
resourced   municipalities   in   our   province   have    executed    their
constitutionally assigned developmental mandate. This exercise will  provide
information for the anticipated review of  local  government.  Strategically
it would provide options to be pursued to support  municipalities  in  their
quest to achieve financial viability.

Thirdly, the department will be placing greater emphasis on  local  economic
development to support municipalities in their endeavours of  growing  local
economies and thus create a foundation for financial viability. However,  we
are aware that municipal  LED  initiatives  can  only  work  in  a  thriving
provincial economic development context. To this end, we  will  partner  and
encourage our relevant sector departments and other  stakeholders  like  the
private  sector  in  implementing  strategies  geared  towards  growing  the
provincial  economy.  That  will  invariably  impact  positively  on   local
economies.

In partnership with the SA Local Government Association -  Free  State,  and
the Department of Provincial and  Local  Government,  we  will  ensure  that
elected  municipal  leaders  are  trained.  We   will   continue   providing
councillor  training  in  the  budgeting  process.  We  will   ensure   that
councillors understand their role  as  envisaged  in  the  recently  enacted
Municipal Finance Management Act through convening a series of  training  or
information sessions.

We have forged  a  relationship  and  established  a  partnership  with  the
University of the Free State and Salgas in establishing a  Local  Governance
Unit to develop and capacitate municipal leaders. In the past year  we  have
trained 100 municipal leaders in project management. For phase  two  of  the
leadership and development programme, the unit will be running a  series  of
leadership programmes focusing on strategic planning, performance  budgeting
and community participation.

In partnership with the  Development  Bank  of  South  Africa,  through  its
development fund, R10,3 million has been granted to  implement  a  municipal
capacity-building programme. This programme will  supplement  the  mentioned
technical assistance that focused  extensively  on  enhancing  the  treasury
capacity  of  municipalities.  We  will  do   the   following   to   enhance
institutional  capacity,   administrative   leadership   and   capacity   in
municipalities: We will be establishing a support  team  at  the  department
that identifies and unblocks  bottlenecks  inhibiting  the  acceleration  of
service delivery, particularly free basic services.  We  will  be  providing
mentorship and ongoing technical support to municipalities  in  implementing
performance management systems. This will assist in  improving  the  quality
of municipal integrated development plans and  ensuring  the  accountability
of municipal leadership to developmental priorities that have  been  set  in
consultation with communities. A series of policy awareness  workshops  will
be convened with the provincial treasury  on  municipal  finance  management
and the Municipal Property Rates Act.

In partnership with local government, the Department of  water  Affairs  and
related  State  Education  and  Training  Authorities  we  will   facilitate
learnership programmes for 100 learner community development workers.  These
new cadres of workers will ensure that a critical  mass  of  South  Africans
gain access to the services that Government provides.

Lastly, we will also be documenting the  experiences  of  municipalities  in
our province that were short-listed for the Vuna Awards.  Their  experiences
will be translated into a best practice  guide  that  will  be  disseminated
widely to all our municipalities in our  province.  We  will  be  using  the
guide to launch a forum where municipalities will be exchanging  information
and learning from one another. It is envisaged that this forum would  lay  a
foundation  for  the  forging  of   collaborative   networks   amongst   our
municipalities. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I have  been  informed
that the following member is going to make her maiden speech in the NCOP.  I
have also been  informed  that  she  is  a  former  member  of  this  House.
Congratulations on being promoted to MEC for Local  Government.  [Applause.]
It is of course Ms Dorothy  Mahlangu,  former  Chairperson  of  the  Finance
Committee in the NCOP.

Ms D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, thank you very much, and good  afternoon  to  my
former colleagues. It's good to be back. I have fond memories of this  place
and I assure you that I will cherish them for as long as possible. First  of
all I would like to congratulate both Ministers for having been  reappointed
by our President. I think that shows his confidence in them,  and  indicates
that they have done well in the first five  years.  I  would  also  like  to
congratulate the leadership of the NCOP on  the  responsibilities  that  you
have been given. I know the challenges that this House is faced with, and  I
am looking forward to supporting you in whatever way I can.

Chairperson, Deputy Chair, Minister  Mufamadi,  Minister  Geraldine  Fraser-
Moleketi, Deputy Minister Nomatyala  Hangana,  congratulations  -  MECs  for
local government and housing  from  different  provinces,  members  of  this
august House, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to take part in  this  very
important debate today. The transformation of  local  government  structures
has not been an easy task, given the history of discrimination  between  the
haves and the have-nots in delivering basic services and the lack of income-
generating and productive economic activities in  some  of  our  localities.
The post-1994, democratic era provided us with  opportunities  to  transform
the  sphere  of  local  government  to  become  democratic,  inclusive   and
participatory - with sufficient checks and balances.

On 5 December 2004 we are celebrating four years  of  democratic  government
at local sphere. Despite some initial difficulties, the  Gauteng  government
has  successfully  established  15  functional  municipalities,  which   are
amalgamations of the 51 inherited from the apartheid dispensation.

I am proud to say that the local government sphere in the  province  is  now
stable. We must, however, continue to work with municipalities to become  an
effective sphere of government that is  able  to  deliver  services  to  all
communities, as well as to be responsible  and  accountable  to  ratepayers.
This will entail the maintenance  of  existing  and  the  expansion  of  new
infrastructure, especially to communities where these are lacking.

Having successfully established functional municipalities, we are now  in  a
consolidation phase to  ensure  the  strengthening  of  their  institutional
capabilities  and  financial  viability.  This  process  will  ensure   that
municipalities have proper billing  systems,  financial  management  systems
and  managerial  and  administrative  capacities  in  order  to   meet   the
challenges of local developmental government.

The consolidation  of  municipalities  in  our  province  will  also  ensure
greater citizen and community involvement in local governance, as  envisaged
in the different pieces of municipal legislation. In this  respect  we  will
ensure  functional   ward   commities   and   greater   responsiveness   and
accountability  by  councillors.  Municipalities  in  Gauteng  are   already
working on innovative ways  to  enhance  their  financial  viability.  These
include improving their billing system, revenue  enhancement,  different  IT
systems, replacing faulty metres, installation of new meters in areas  which
never had them before, implementation of proper credit control policies  and
improving the customer relations programme.

Almost all municipalities in our province have been  categorised  as  having
high capacity, particularly the metros and some districts, and some of  them
have medium capacity. They have been categorised by the  National  Treasury.
The Municipal Demarcation Board could not find any municipality  in  Gauteng
without capacity, only one district has low capacity.

Our efforts will be directed at ensuring that we  improve  the  capacity  of
those with medium capacity, but we will also have  a  specific  approach  to
help the high-capacity municipalities in the areas of  their  weakness.  The
R15 million in the current financial year will be used to target  particular
areas of weakness and to provide training, ensuring that we  use  accredited
service providers. In the past most municipalities  procured  services  from
organisations that were not accredited, hence they  could  not  claim  money
from Seta. We will work with municipalities to ensure that all of  them  are
able to address problems raised by the Auditor-General's report. I  remember
very well the last speech I made in this house was about such issues, ie  to
put policies in place to make  sure  that  we  help  municipalities  to  put
policies in place where such policies do not exist.

In the long term my vision is that we should see all municipalities  in  the
province getting unqualified audit reports. Today 102 community  development
workers have been deployed across our province.  We  are  working  with  our
local  government  and  the  water  Seta  to  further  train  the  community
development  workers  to  become  multiskilled  so  that  they  can   assist
communities to overcome service  delivery  blockages,  as  well  as  empower
communities to be effective stakeholders in Government.
By December 2004, 200 community development workers will be deployed into  a
learnership programme.  Priority in this regard is given to the urban  nodes
in our province, as announced by  the  President  in  his  state  of  nation
address.  In  some  of  these  nodes  we  have  already  deployed  community
development workers.  It  should  be  borne  in  mind,  however,  that  such
deployment  includes   active,   extensive   and   practical   work   within
communities.

Through deployment of  community  development  workers  Government  aims  to
ensure that community centres, such as MPCCs and parliamentary  constituency
offices, throughout the  province,  are  properly  utilised  as  a  form  of
engagement and offices for these  people.  But  they  will  be  linked  with
different council offices, and we are currently working on a study  that  is
going to guide us on what is the best form of institutional arrangement  for
community development workers, and on intergovernmental relations.  We  will
work closely with the Premier's office to  ensure  that  we  strengthen  co-
ordination and integration between the province and  municipalities  in  our
province.

This  will  also   assist   us   to   contribute   better   to   the   draft
intergovernmental relations  framework  and  to  the  Bill  currently  under
discussion  at  national  level.  In  the  meantime  we  will  use  existing
structures to  co-ordinate  and  support  the  provincial  imperatives  that
include municipalities. It is envisaged that in the medium to long term,  as
a province, we shall have to think more strategicly on how  to  ensure  that
we work together as the three spheres of government - being informed by  our
unique strength as a province and our capabilities.

You will recall that both the President and our Premier have  committed  our
Government to the fact that all citizens of  Gauteng  in  this  regard,  but
also the country, will have access to clean water and proper  sanitation  by
2009. This commitment is part of our effort  to  eradicate  poverty  in  our
societies. It is important to note that most people without access to  these
services reside in informal settlements, and we will work very closely  with
the Department of Housing in our province in the formalisation  of  informal
settlements, as announced by the Premier, and make sure  that  these  people
get basic services, whether temporary or waterborne structures.

As part of our commitment to extend these services to our  people  in  order
for them to live a decent life with pride and dignity, we have allocated  an
amount of R100 million for water and sanitation  in  the  current  financial
year. It will be used in different projects. Some of  it  will  be  used  to
eradicate the bucket system, some to service the informal  settlements,  and
another  amount  will  be  used  for  capacity-building  and   institutional
support. We are working very closely  with  municipalities  to  ensure  that
these services are delivered at an acceptable standard, because there  is  a
disjuncture  between  the  provincial  norms  and  what  municipalities  are
willing to compromise to come to an acceptable  norm.  So,  we  are  working
with other departments to ensure that we agree on some form of standard.

It is also important to know that most municipalities in our  province  have
included free basic electricity  to  connected  consumers.  There  are  only
three municipalities that are  not  in  a  position  to  do  so;  these  are
Randfontein, Nokensdiamond and Morafong. It is important  to  indicate  that
these municipalities are some of the municipalities that  do  not  have  any
form of revenue whatsoever, and when  you  talk  about  the  review  of  the
equitable share, consideration should be given to such municipalities  which
do not have any form of revenue, and so forth.

We have committed ourselves as a province to extend services to  where  they
do not exist, in particular to farms. Some of you  may  think  that  Gauteng
does not have rural areas, but  we  do.  We  are  going  to  work  with  the
agricultural organisations, both black and white, to  ensure  that  services
are extended to these areas. We will  continue  to  improve  monitoring  and
support  mechanisms  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of   municipalities   to
implement programmes and deliver services. We will work with the  Department
of Housing and the Department of Social Development to develop  a  framework
for the provincial indigent policy  to  guide  all  stakeholders,  including
municipalities in the province. In the end the policy must provide a  single
window for the benefit of the poor masses of our province.

The  municipal  infrastructure  grant  owes  a  contribution   towards   our
commitment to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014.  The  department  will
ensure that we  accelerate  the  municipal  infrastructure  development  and
maintenance programme. An amount of over R678 million that  will  come  from
national departments have been allocated to 10  municipalities  in  Gauteng,
that is three metros, six district and some local municipalities - and I  am
told my time is about to expire. So, I may not be in  a  position  to  share
some of my issues.

I just want to highlight a  few  challenges  as  I  conclude.  One  of  them
relates to what the President said  on  21  May.  He  said  that  the  first
regional electricity distributor must be ready by June 2005,  and  the  rest
by January 2006. To ensure that  municipalities  are  also  ready,  we  have
began the process of helping them to ring-fence their electricity  function,
so that when the rest comes into effect the municipalities in  the  province
do not get affected severely. Secondly, the  demarcation  process  has  been
started in earnest by determining the number of councillors,  and  the  next
phase is the delimitation of the inner-ward  boundaries.  To  this  end  the
work has ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr B  J  MKHALIPHI:  Thank  you  very  much,  hon  Deputy  Chairperson.  Hon
Minister, hon Deputy Minister, MECs,  special  delegates,  members  and  our
colleagues from Salga, as we approach the second decade of freedom the  role
of the local sphere of government will continue to occupy  centre  stage  on
matters of service delivery and development.

During the election campaign it was apparent that our people  mainly  raised
issues about local government despite the fact that the election  was  about
provincial and local government. This scenario clearly illustrates the  kind
of expectations people have of local government and the prejudice  faced  by
local government.

On considering the performance of the department in the past year,  as  well
as its projections  and  budget  for  the  current  year,  one  notices  the
remarkable strides that have been made. We note with appreciation  that  the
department has maintained the progressive stance in line with  our  declared
approach of developmental local governance. We also  noted  that  throughout
the process of policy implementations runs the  visible  vein  of  community
participation with the end results being policy enrichment  and  empowerment
of all role-players. Indeed, there is more room  and  opportunity  for  each
role-player to put forward  its  contribution  to  the  national  effort  to
ensure that indeed the people are governing.

During our interaction with the department we also noted the calculated  and
responsible manner in which the department intends dealing with some of  the
statutory  obligations  imposed  either   on   itself,   municipalities   or
provincial government. As a national department entrusted  mainly  with  the
co-ordination of  local  government  affairs,  the  department's  programmes
adequately address several  functions  stemming  from  legislation  and  the
Constitution. We are, however, challenged to ensure that municipalities  and
provincial governments attain the required levels of capacity  in  order  to
reach  the  milestones  and  meet  the  stipulated  timeframes  imposed   by
legislation as well as by the President in the state of the nation address.

As demonstrated to  us  during  the  briefing  we  are  confident  that  the
initiatives by the department, such as the Vuna Awards  and  especially  the
establishment of the local government leadership academy, will  add  impetus
to achieving these goals. As we continue to support and monitor the  strides
made by municipalities in fulfilling their constitutional  mandate  we  will
also have to tap into the expertise of the Municipal  Demarcation  Board  as
far as its assessment of municipal functions are concerned,  not  neglecting
our declared objective of a wall-to-wall local government. We  are  also  of
the opinion that the Municipal  Demarcation  Board  should  be  implored  to
maintain a fair balance, wherever possible, between using its  technological
expertise as opposed to community participation especially in the  processes
of  ward  delimitations.  We  are  of  the  view  that  increased  community
participation would further enhance the board's profile and its  activities.
We concur that the decisions on the determination of  ward  boundaries  will
not always meet everybody's wish. A further accord would be another look  at
the Demarcation Board's budget shortfall of R5,5 million. We  are  concerned
that this shortfall could compromise the board's activities,  especially  in
the light of the forthcoming local government elections. Despite  all  these
strides made and progress  achieved  at  local  government,  situations  may
still arise that would necessitate an intervention in terms of  section  139
of the Constitution.

Our honest observation is that recently interventions have  been  occasioned
by the human factor among councillors rather than any systems failure.  This
speaks volumes about the progress and sanctity of our  developmental  system
of local government. We are also of the opinion that we need to arrive at  a
situation ideally that  would  make  section  100  or  section  139  of  the
Constitution fall into some kind of disuse. I am sure  that  our  collective
ambition in this House and in Government in general is that  when  we  speak
of interventions, we refer only to the stipulations of section  154  of  the
Constitution, which entail the support and strengthening of the capacity  of
municipalities to enable them to  manage  their  own  affairs,  to  exercise
their powers and to perform their functions.

We need to move with speed and firmness to  address  the  tendency  that  is
looming  among  councillors.  We  need  to  indicate  that  the   increasing
tolerance of any irresponsible conduct will not be  tolerated  whenever  and
wherever it occurs. Colleagues, if anyone of you thought that  our  strides,
especially of our senior management there,  were  going  unnoticed,  someone
has some encouraging news for us all here. And I read here from a  quotation
of this booklet published by the South African Airways  entitled  The  South
African History. The hon Chris Landsberg, Director of the Centre for  Policy
Studies - and it is not that I always agree with him - has this to say:


  Rarely in the history of world affairs has a young democracy ...  exerted
  so much influence and leadership as does this liberated republic. Indeed,
  South Africa exerts a global leadership incommensurate with its size  and
  capabilities. It punches above its weight. South Africa's effect on world
  governance in the last 8 years has been nothing short of outstanding.

And I agree with him entirely on this matter. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! All right, all right, all  right,
ok. I am waiting for Mrs Dolo to  finish.  [Laughter.]  Are  you  done?  All
right.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you  very
much, Deputy Chairperson and I would like  to  thank  the  members  of  this
House for  their  contributions  to  this  Budget  Vote  debate.  One  could
actually comment on a number of matters raised  or  on  all  matters  raised
today, but I felt that this was also feedback to us in  the  governance  and
administration cluster by way of giving us input on the portfolio of  Public
Service and Administration as well as the portfolio of Provincial and  Local
Government.

One would interpret this as constructive input from patriots  who  have  the
interests of our country and the interest of  this  region  at  heart;  also
from patriots who would like to make inputs in order to ensure that  we  are
able to engage globally  in  an  appropriate  manner.  There  are  obviously
exceptions to one or two comments. I want to say generally to  everyone  who
has supported this Budget Vote and contributed to the debate  that  this  is
the way in which one has interpreted this.

In terms of one hon member raising a challenge in relation to  the  role  of
the state and the necessary centrality  of  the  state  in  a  developmental
state and even in the economy, I want to state this afternoon that there  is
a clear need for the role of the state.  You  find  this  not  only  in  the
developing countries, but also in  the  developed  world,  so  we  must  not
develop a blind side when we engage in certain debates because we know  that
the private sector can drive growth. But the role of the  public  sector  is
essential for growth opportunities and dealing with certain  realities,  and
if we look at our situation we can mention one and that is that of  economic
disparities. We have in South Africa examples where we've used very  clearly
the whole issue of public funding. Gauteng province is one such example,  if
one has to give an example, where  public  funding  was  used  to  crowd  in
private funding or to crowd in  both  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  I
think we need to be careful that we do not become narrow in the way we  want
to analyse that.

We also see the need for the role of the state if we want to talk about  the
deracialisation of the economy. When it comes to the Public  Service  sector
we are going to use procurement in terms of contributing to the whole  issue
of empowerment, etc. I raise this not apologetically, but  merely  to  state
that we need to be very careful when we narrow  down  a  debate  because  we
have a particular blind side or we are ideologically myopic when we look  at
particular issues. I think it is  also  necessary  to  say  that  there  are
certain services that can only be delivered by  the  Public  Service  sector
and delivered quite well in instances.

I don't think at any point today did one claim, or at any point  previously,
that the public sector has reached the  point  where  we  have  a  situation
where all services are delivered across the spectrum. We have  clearly  said
that there are disparities  in  the  nature  in  which  these  services  are
delivered. This is precisely why we are looking at the issue of  people  and
systems, and the institutions that are there, and we are trying to  see  how
we can improve this on an ongoing basis. I do not think we are  doing  badly
but we can do better and we need to see how we can do better.

So very clearly then, just to conclude that aspect, there  is  a  particular
set of values that you will only find in the public sector and  not  in  the
private sector that is very necessary when you look at the issue of  service
provision. Hon chairperson of the select committee, I actually want  to  say
that one really appreciates your  inputs  and  I  want  to  raise  one  mild
concern about an analogy that you used today. You said we  should  interpret
Batho Pele as the people being the bosses  and  the  owners  of  the  state.
Knowing where you come from, I am not sure how you engage  with  bosses  and
owners of a private entity and I did not think that  we  wanted  an  ongoing
class struggle. Instead I thought that we should to change  that  analogy  a
little bit. But I think the point you made about serving the  people  is  an
absolutely essential point. In terms of the points other members  have  made
around the centrality and importance of human resource development  we  will
not and cannot argue about that in any way. Yes, we are working  on  how  we
are going to take it forward. We centrally at the level  of  governance  and
administration have a particular subcommittee that looks at the question  of
human resources.
On looking at our responses to dealing with  the  challenges  around  skills
development for the immediate future, the medium term  and  the  long  term,
this will also deal with the  area  of  scare  skills  that  largely  covers
professional capacities. For us the  big  challenge  is  that  our  response
around human resources in our country  should  be  such  that  we  know  the
interventions will be sustainable and we will  be  able  to  deal  with  the
questions in a manner that is required.  This  covers  issues  that  include
retentions, recruitment of personnel and conditions of service.

We heard what our President said when he spoke about this matter last  week.
I also want to say  regarding  the  issue  of  consultants,  we  do  have  a
framework for the use of consultants in a responsible manner in  the  Public
Service. I will suggest that hon Worth, who seems to be new to  this  House,
accesses our site and looks at what is  available  there  because  there  is
quite important information that can be shared. That  also  deals  with  the
anticorruption thrust.

I want to conclude by saying that,  when  you  look  at  the  anticorruption
framework, we can pride ourselves as a democracy that  we  have  contributed
to putting that framework in place. We have also put  in  place  legislation
that hon members have heard about over recent days that has  been  used  for
Operation Dribble. That framework  was  not  in  place  in  the  past.  That
legislation was not there to be used. We should commend  ourselves  on  what
we have done. On matters of community development workers  and  all  others,
we note this and we definitely will come back  and  report  to  the  various
committees. I thank you.

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  I  wish  to
join Minister Fraser-Moleketi in thanking the hon members  who  participated
in the discussion of the two Votes  before  the  House.  In  the  course  of
discussions and the debate  members  and  delegates  made  several  valuable
suggestions on what needs  to  be  done  to  improve  the  efficacy  of  our
governance and administrative systems. I  want  to  assure  the  House  that
these suggestions will be taken to heart.

I also wish to note the  announcement  made  by  the  ``share  person''  ...
[Laughter.] ... of the select committee, the  hon  Shiceka,  to  the  effect
that the committee intends visiting  municipalities  in  order  to  put  its
collective finger on the pulse of the local government system.   We  welcome
this because we believe that it will enable the committee on behalf  of  the
Council to better monitor the work of the administration and the  executive,
and also to co-operate with us for the good of  our  country.  Once  more  I
want to thank you all.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you  very
much.  On  behalf  of  the  Council  I  also  wish  to  thank  you  all  who
participated in the debate today, including the two Ministers.

That concludes the debate and the House is adjourned. Thank you very much.

The Council adjourned at 17:42.
