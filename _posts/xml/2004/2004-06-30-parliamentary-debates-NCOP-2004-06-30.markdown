                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move
at the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ANC has yet again scored a resounding victory in a by-
       election, this time in ward 6 in the Emthanjeni Municipality (De Aar,
       Hanover, Britstown) which was previously a DA ward;


  (2) further notes that this by-election was  held  as  a  result  of  the
       resignation of Councillor  A  Gafoor  from  the  Democratic  Alliance
       because of the intolerable level of racism within that party;


  (3) expresses its dissatisfaction that the DA initially refused to accept
       his resignation and tried to force him to remain as a  DA  councillor
       despite his feeling uncomfortable about the racism within the DA;


  (4) notes that the DA  eventually  accepted  his  resignation,  whereupon
       Gafoor joined the ANC and was elected unopposed as an ANC councillor;
       and


  (5) welcomes his election as a demonstration of  the  embracing  of  non-
       racism espoused by the ANC and a rejection of racism, both noticeably
       and subtle, which still characterises parties such as the DA.

Mr M A MZIZI: Deputy Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  at  the  next
sitting of this House I shall move on behalf of IFP:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  that  a  forensic  audit  commissioned   by   the   eThekwini
       Municipality into black  economic  empowerment  (BEE)  fronting,  has
       uncovered a potential scandal involving at least five companies which
       used to win contracts for Durban's uShaka Marine World;


  (2) further notes that this unethical  practice  of  fronting  is  common
       throughout South Africa and is undermining and  disrupting  the  work
       that  is  being  done  to  try  and  implement  true  black  economic
       empowerment and transformation;


  (3) condemns fronting and the people who are enriching themselves through
       this unethical process; and


  (4) hopes that the eThekwini Municipality will take  action  against  the
       guilty parties once the full report is ready.
                   SOUTH AFRICAN DRAGON BOAT WOMEN'S TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A WATSON: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson. I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride -


       (a)  the exceptional achievement of the  South  African  Dragon  Boat
           Women's Team who were awarded second place out of 48 teams  from
           20 countries participating  in  the  International  Dragon  Boat
           Championship in Taipei last week; and


       (b)  that the leader of this team is none other than  the  honourable
           Sherry  Chen,  representing  the  Democratic  Alliance  in   the
           Council; and


  (2) extends its sincere congratulations to Ms Chen, to  her  team  of  18
       young women representing our rainbow nation and to the South  African
       Ambassador in Taiwan, who hosted the team during their sojourn.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF LABOUR
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A WATSON: Agb Voorsitter, die DA stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  met hernude verwarring van die uitlating van  die  Minister  van
           Arbeid, Membathisi Mdladlana, wat Maandag in  Boksburg  verklaar
           het  dat  sy  kabinetskollega,  mnr  Marthinus  Van   Schalkwyk,
           eersdaags ten volle by die ANC gaan aansluit; en


       (b)  dat die DA die ANC die ongerief van mnr Van Schalkwyk  in  hulle
           binnekring gun;


  (2) `n beroep doen op mnr Van Schalkwyk om nou vir eens en vir altyd  oop
       kaarte te speel stel;


  (3) verder daarvan kennis neem dat kiesers reeds ten volle bewus is  van,
       en ontnugter is deur die politieke verraad wat deur die leierskap van
       die Nuwe Nasionale Party gepleeg is deur  sy  ongemagtigde  omhelsing
       van die ANC en sy magsbehepte, sentristiese ideologie; en


  (4) van mening is dat  die  kiesers  verdien  om  te  weet  wat  mnr  Van
       Schalkwyk se verdere verraderlike planne is.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson, the DA moves without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with renewed confusion the statement by the Minister of  Labour,
           Membathisi Mdladlana, who said in Boksburg on  Monday  that  his
           Cabinet colleague, Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, would  soon  join
           the ANC fully; and


       (b)   that  the  Democratic  Alliance  does  not  envy  the  ANC  the
           discomfort of having Mr van Schalkwyk in their inner circle;


  (2) appeals to Mr van Schalkwyk to put all his cards on  the  table  once
       and for all now;


  (3) further notes that the voters are already fully aware  of,  and  have
       been  disillusioned  by  the  political  treason  committed  by   the
       leadership of the New National  Party  by  way  of  its  unauthorised
       embracing of the ANC and its power-crazy, centristic ideologies; and


  (4) is of the opinion that  the  voters  deserve  to  know  what  Mr  van
       Schalkwyk's further traitorous plans are.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
In the light of the objection, the motion may not  be  proceeded  with.  The
motion without notice will now become a notice of a motion.

Declarations of vote made on behalf of the  African  National  Congress  and

Declarations of vote:

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, the ANC supports  the  Vote  because  we  believe
that much has been achieved in the Department of Justice and  Constitutional
Development, particularly in putting the supremacy of the Constitution  over
Parliament. The bench has also been transformed and is beginning to  reflect
the demographics of our country. By 2002 the conviction rates in our  courts
had increased to 81%. We also believe that our courts have reduced the  time
it takes to process cases. We believe that a  lot  has  also  been  achieved
with the establishment of special courts, particularly for sexual  offences.
In that respect, we believe that much has been achieved because  the  courts
have been taken to the people in the townships and the villages. This  means
that we have brought justice closer to the people. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  M  A  MZIZI:  Chairperson,  we  in  the  IFP  support  the  Justice  and
Constitutional Development Budget Vote, but we do have  some  concerns.  The
Auditor-General's  report  on  the  annual  financial   statement   of   the
department for the year ending 31 March 2003 identified a  number  of  areas
of  concern,  including  noncompliance  with  the   department's   financial
instructions and criminal activities amounting to  at  least  R2,9  million.
The department will not be able to move forward  and  deal  adequately  with
the issues that it is supposed to  deal  with,  unless  these  problems  are
addressed urgently. Thank you.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 25 - Safety and Security - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 26 - Agriculture - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 27 - Communications - put.
Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 28 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 29 - Housing - put.

Declarations of vote made on behalf of the  African  National  Congress  and
Inkatha Freedom Party.

Declarations of vote:

Ms H F MATLANYANE: Chairperson, we in the ANC  feel  strongly  that  housing
the poor is of the utmost importance to us. To be given a key  to  your  own
house and to be told that from that day onwards you own  that  house,  is  a
moment that you'll always remember and that will always bring tears  to  the
eyes of many rural people. We, as the ANC, are saying that we are  going  to
improve the quality of houses that are going to  the  built.  We  will  make
sure that each and every South African is given shelter for his or  her  own
family. We in the ANC are committed to the  people's  contract  of  ensuring
that we eradicate poverty and create employment. I thank you.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, there are a number of pressing issues  to  attend
to and a lot more work has to be done by the department if  inroads  are  to
be made in addressing the housing problems in  South  Africa.  The  Minister
mentioned the eradication of informal  settlements  in  her  speech  to  the
Senate. This is a mammoth task that will require an enormous amount of  work
if they are to address it along with the backlogs. We hope  that  there  are
adequate funds available and that specific  timeframes  are  set.  The  IFP,
however, supports this Vote.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Deputy Chair, I just want  to  get  clarity
before we adopt the Vote. Could the hon Mzizi  clarify  for  us  whether  we
still have a senate in this democratic Government? [Laughter.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, having come from the old school,  this  was  just
an error - a slip of the tongue. [Laughter.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 30 - Land Affairs - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 31 - Minerals and Energy - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 33 - Transport - put.

Declarations of vote made on behalf of the Democratic Alliance  and  African
National Congress.

Declarations of vote:
Mr A WATSON: Thank you, hon Chair. My colleague in  the  National  Assembly,
the hon Stuart Farrow, has already  alluded  to  the  reasoning  behind  our
objecting to this particular Vote.

As  was  also  the  case  with  other  Votes  in  terms  of  which  we  made
declarations in regard to our objections,  it  would  serve  no  purpose  to
repeat our fundamental objections in each case; hence,  our  objections  are
noted. However, as far as transport is concerned, we do,  however,  wish  to
expand somewhat in reference to the state of our provincial roads.

In virtually all the provinces, most of  our  roads,  other  than  the  toll
roads, are in a terrible state of disrepair, and the  stock  answer  is,  of
course, that we simply do not have  enough  money  for  roads.  What  is  of
paramount concern, however, is the ultimate distribution and application  of
the road levy, which is part of the price of motor fuel. Do the hon  members
realise that R1,11 of every litre of petrol and 95 cents of every  litre  of
diesel is channelled back to Government in the form of a road levy?

The principle is sound. The more you drive, the bigger  your  share  in  the
upkeep of roads. Also, whilst bigger vehicles cause  more  deterioration  to
roads, so do they also use more fuel and consequently contribute  more.  The
mystery is, however, what ultimately happens  to  your  daily  contribution,
kilometre by kilometre?

I shall tell you. The levies are taken up in the fiscus and  are  ultimately
redistributed to provinces on an equitable basis,  but  that  is  where  tub
runs dry. Provinces can use their respective shares in any  way  they  wish,
and they obviously do so to make their books  balance.  The  end  result  is
that levies, supposedly  paid  for  road  maintenance,  could  be  used  for
education and health, and in any other department where a  fair  share  will
probably disappear in some corrupt way or another.

The DA, therefore, feels that the  road  levies  should  be  distributed  in
proportion to kilometres of roads and established road usage  in  provinces,
and that the  funds  so  collected  should  be  totally  dedicated  to  road
maintenance.  We  feel  that  this,  together  with  other  funds  currently
budgeted and budgeted annually, will form the only viable  base  from  which
to fund proper  road  maintenance.  The  present  system  is  tantamount  to
defrauding motorists and transporters, and we call  on  the  Government  and
the Minister, in particular, to rectify  the  situation.  The  DA  therefore
objects to this Vote.

Mr R J TAU: Hon Chair, we in the ANC have said that  during  this  financial
year our job is to ensure that we reduce the poverty  levels  that  continue
to bedevil our society, especially amongst those in  the  poor  rural  areas
and, in particular, women. Our job is to  improve  the  performance  of  our
transport system in order to improve economic activity, thus  creating  jobs
and growing our economy.

Acknowledging the bad state of our roads, the hon Minister Jeff  Radebe  had
this to say during the budget debate in the NCOP on 11 May 2004:


  Such is the poor state of maintenance of many of our roads  that  I  must
  indicate to this House that, together with the provinces and  Sanral,  we
  will consider reclassifying certain strategic roads  from  provincial  to
  national if this is the only way to ensure the allocation  of  sufficient
  funds for upgrade and maintenance work.

Whether the DA was fast asleep or fantasising about something else  at  that
time, we do not know. Anybody who stands up to oppose this Budget  Vote  is,
in fact, opposing the betterment of the lives of our people. We in  the  ANC
will not stand by and watch, given the fact  that  we  have  been  given  an
overwhelming majority to ensure that we close the second  economy  that  our
President has alluded to. We will not subject our people to poverty and  bad
roads that endanger their lives. Ours is a mandate  given  by  the  poor  to
better their living conditions, and so we shall not apologise.

May those who have resolved to consistently lie to our people,  continue  to
subject themselves to the prophecy of doom and hell.  Some  friendly  advice
for them is that South Africa belongs to all those who  live  in  it,  black
and white, and not only those who are privileged will be  able  to  use  our
roads. In fact, our budget is to ensure  that  our  road  infrastructure  is
developed in such a way that it will benefit even those who do not have  the
means  to  use  that   particular   infrastructure.   Also,   infrastructure
development is going to be labour intensive so  as  to  benefit  our  people
economically. So, I declare that this Vote be seen as a  genuine  instrument
that will benefit the lives of our people. Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus dissenting).

Vote No 34 - Water Affairs and Forestry - put.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Question put: That the Schedule be agreed to.

Schedule agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

          CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATION BILL AND OF REPORT THEREON

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, the  seriousness  of  the
matter before us needs to be taken into  account.  We  are  voting  for  the
current fiscal year, for the resources to be spent by all  of  national  and
provincial Governments effectively, and because of the earnestness  of  this
matter, I am sure that all members in their committees  have  applied  their
minds thoroughly to this, and I therefore move. Thank you. [Applause.]
Mr  T  S  RALANE:  Chairperson,  Ministers,  I  congratulate  you  on   your
appointments to your new positions. While we adopt the  estimates  allocated
to each Budget Vote today, our work as members of the NCOP  in  relation  to
these appropriations does not end here. Whilst  the  legislative  powers  of
the national Parliament and the provincial legislatures  are  important  for
the approval of budget legislation, the oversight powers  of  the  NCOP  and
provincial legislatures are equally pivotal, especially with regard  to  the
monitoring and evaluation of the  performance  of  national  and  provincial
departments.

Our Constitution recognises that Parliament  and  the  legislatures  have  a
critical role to play in overseeing better performance in  the  delivery  of
services. Therefore, the challenges facing members  of  Parliament  and  the
provincial legislatures are to improve the capacity of select  and  standing
committees to hold departments  to  account  for  their  performance,  using
budget documents, strategic plans and annual reports. Annual  reports  allow
Parliament to evaluate the performance of a department after the end of  the
financial year, whilst during the year quarterly  reports  allow  Parliament
to monitor performance during the financial year.
The National Treasury informed the finance committees of  Parliament  during
their recent  briefing  that,  with  references  to  conditional  grants  to
provinces, national departments did not comply fully with  the  Division  of
Revenue Act in the financial year ending March 2003. Moreover, the  Auditor-
General reported for the same financial year that their audit could  not  be
satisfied that the transfer payments were  utilised  as  stipulated  in  the
Division of Revenue Act. It is under these circumstances that  we  wrote  to
eight national departments in June this  year  and  raised  a  total  of  42
questions in relation to provincial conditional grants in the  previous  and
current financial years. Members would be  pleased  to  know  that  we  have
received two detailed responses and six acknowledgements  already.  Much  of
the oversight work in relation to provincial conditional grants is  ongoing,
and I hope that the incoming chairpersons of the select committees, both  of
finance and other committees, will continue with  follow-up  investigations.
We urge the House to vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, this  was  such  a  long  and  intense
debate. [Laughter.] There were so many speakers in the debate  that  I  lost
track of  some.  I  would  like  to  congratulate  Mr  Tutu  Ralane  on  his
reappointment as the Chair of the Joint Budget Committee, and  I  thank  the
members for their support. [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Chair, on a point of information, we  did  agree  that  the  DA
member of that committee would also have two minutes in which  to  speak.  I
do not know why that did not happen. We had a meeting yesterday and, in  the
absence of our Whip, I  discussed  it  with  the  Chief  Whip  and  with  Mr
Sulliman, and I really want to know what has happened?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Okay,  Mr  Watson,  we
need to learn to talk to each other. I  mean,  the  Chief  Whip  is  in  the
House, and you people had a speakers' list before  we  got  into  the  House
that could have been sorted out. Really, to ask the Chair now is  unfair.  I
do not know what to say to you, but the debate is  closed  now.  [Applause.]
Would the two of you please resolve the issue? The  Minister  has  responded
to the debate already. Chief Whip, do you want  to  say  something  in  this
regard?

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  NCOP:  Hon  Chair,  we  did  have  consultation  ...
[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  The  hon  member  is
answering your question.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: We did  have  consultations  with  the  relevant
party as far as three  weeks  back  in  relation  to  the  passage  of  this
Appropriation  Bill,  and  we  were  in  consultation  up  until   yesterday
afternoon. We did circulate the speakers' list for  comment.  There  was  no
comment. I personally tried to phone the leader of  the  opposition  in  the
name of the hon D A Watson, but could not get a response.  I  took  it  that
that silence meant acceptance of the draft speakers' list, and I  move  that
we proceed.

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): We  proceed  with  the
next order of the day. The matter is closed.

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order,  please,  before  we  proceed:  Since  the
discussion that took place yesterday  was  disregarded,  may  I  please  get
clarity if I was phoned during my lunchtime? I apologise  that  I  also  eat
like most people. [Interjections.] I only got a note  from  the  Chief  Whip
when I came into  the  House,  but  we  did  have  a  very  long  discussion
yesterday.  Also, on the next item, the Taxation Bill, it  was  agreed  that
my member would speak for two minutes. May I have clarity before  you  start
and close the debate?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Mr Watson, the  matter
is disposed of. You may discuss that with the Chief  Whip.  Let  us  proceed
with the next order of the day.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I am trying to  work  out  whether  to
start in the middle of the speech or just to say that I move. I  think  that
I shall opt for the latter. [Applause.]

Mr E M SOGONI:  Chairperson,  should  I  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  the
Minister?
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Nobody has said that.

Mr E M SOGONI: Chairperson, congratulations  to  the  comrade  Ministers  on
their appointments for this new term. Today marks the last day of June,  the
historical month of the youth and the fourth day after  the  anniversary  of
the Freedom Charter. I also wish to extend a belated happy birthday wish  to
our President.

All the parties who attended the meeting - Mr Watson, I  am  sure,  will  be
happy to hear that - unanimously adopted the Taxation Laws  Amendment  Bill.
The law we are amending today was first passed in 1949, and the same Act  of
1949 has been  amended  over  the  years.  There  is  a  debate  of  whether
Parliament should not be looking at  enacting  a  new  Taxation  Bill  every
year. Over the  past  decade  of  freedom  the  South  African  economy  has
benefited tremendously from tax policy reforms  as  a  result  of  efficient
revenue collections, thus enabling the democratic Government  to  grant  tax
relief of over R72 billion to the people  of  this  country.  As  such,  tax
relief  contributed  to  rising  household  consumption  expenditure,   thus
boosting economic development and promoting small businesses.
For the 2004 financial year, personal income tax relief of R4  billion  will
be put back into people's pockets, thus translating  to  a  real  disposable
income and encouraging a culture of saving. This means that the  income  tax
rebate is being raised to R32 000 for citizens under the  age  of  65  years
and R50 000 for those citizens of 65 years and above, thus pushing back  the
frontiers of poverty. Secondly, the transfer duty threshold has been  raised
to R150 000 to encourage acquisition of property by low-  and  middle-income
groups. This will translate to a saving of about  R500  for  all  properties
bought henceforth. Thirdly, to encourage economic empowerment, the  Treasury
proposes to  table  legislation  to  allow  long-term  tax-free  shares  for
employees to be kept at certain amounts. That  is  subject  to  negotiations
and employers need to conform to provided  restrictions  to  prevent  short-
term sales of shares by the employees. This proposal is not for the  current
financial year, but for next year. Fourthly, the  first  economy  will  also
benefit from detailed proposals to restructure taxation  of  mineral  rights
holders  to  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  our  country,  thus
simplifying and addressing double taxation in some cases.

Other areas to benefit include pension fund taxes. In that area Treasury  is
correcting duplication between SARS and FSB. This  means  that  powers  will
now be delegated to FSB to deal with that function.  The  other  areas  that
will benefit are biofuels  and  toll  roads.  With  regard  to  toll  roads,
legislation was passed in 2003  converting  Sanral  to  a  tax-free  entity,
retrospectively with effect from 1998. That resulted  in  unintended  losses
of  deduction  for  list  premiums  and  list  hold  improvements  made   by
concessionaires, so this Bill will also rectify these.

Finally, 9 July 2004 will be the last day on which to  submit  tax  returns.
We would like to implore our public representatives to lead  by  example  by
submitting their tax  returns  in  time  this  year.  Guided  by  the  above
principle, we believe this Taxation  Bill  is  contributing  to  a  people's
contract to create work and fight poverty and bridge  the  gap  between  the
first and the second economies. Ngiyabonga. [I thank you.] [Applause.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.
 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON AGREEMENT BETWEEN
     GOVERNMENT OF REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND GOVERNMENT OF KINGDOM OF
 SWAZILAND FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION
                       WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME

Mr D J BOTHA: Deputy Chair, the select committee considered this  Bill  very
carefully. The purpose of this agreement is twofold:  Firstly,  it  provides
for the avoidance of  double  taxation  and,  secondly,  it  puts  in  place
mechanisms for an exchange of information between  the  tax  authorities  of
the two countries.

This agreement, concluded between the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the
Kingdom of Swaziland, adheres to the key requirements  of  the  Organisation
of Economic Co-Operation and Development. This organisation consists  of  29
mainly industrialised member countries. South Africa is not a member of  the
OECD. The state law advisers of  the  Departments  of  Foreign  Affairs  and
Justice have been consulted on this agreement, and they have agreed  to  it.
The Select Committee on Finance  recommended  that  this  House  adopt  this
agreement. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  Section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  the  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. Are you all  present?
Thank you.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. Is there  any  province
that wishes to do so? There is none. We shall now proceed  to  vote  on  the
question. I shall do this in an alphabetical order per province.  Delegation
heads must please indicate to the Chair  whether  they  vote  in  favour  or
against, or whether they abstain. The Eastern Cape?

 CONSIDERATION OF AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION OF VINE
    AND WINE AND OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                               AFFAIRS THEREON

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon  members  of  this  House,
this is the statement by the Select  Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental
Affairs on the reaccession to the International  Organisation  of  Vine  and
Wine, the OIV:
The  Select  Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs  supports  and
approves without reservation South Africa's accession to the new  treaty  of
the OIV, signed in April 2001. The committee  believes  that  ratifying  the
treaty will benefit South Africa enormously. I will show why  the  committee
has made this decision and provide reasons why South  Africa  should  become
party to the 2001 OIV treaty.

South Africa is one of the top producers and exporters  of  wine.  The  wine
industry contributes about R15,5 million to the annual GDP of  the  country.
With its roots firmly embedded in the Western Cape, an estimated 60% of  the
industry's activities have an impact on the region's economy.  The  industry
has also  provided  a  number  of  employment  opportunities,  directly  and
indirectly.  In  the  Western  Cape,   particularly,   a   number   of   job
opportunities were created. These were tourism related  and  linked  to  the
wine industry. A number of local and international tourists  regularly  come
to view wine routes in the province.

It is important for South Africa to boost this industry so  that  more  jobs
will  be  created.  Being  part  of  this  international  organisation  that
currently include all major countries producing wine, except Canada and  the
United States of America, South Africa will have the  opportunity  to  share
information and co-operate  with  countries  that  have  done  well  in  the
industry.  Our  participation  in  the  OIV  will  definitely  increase  the
production of wine and create a greater  export  orientation  in  the  South
African wine industry.

The International Organisation of Vine  and  Wine  serves  as  international
reference point for wine and vine  issues,  including  scientific  research,
production methods, education and economic  and  trade  issues.  Resolutions
taken by the OIV can have an  important  influence  on  world  trade.  South
Africa does not need to be left out in discussions in  the  OIV  that  might
have an impact on its wine trade and thus affect its economy.

Why the new treaty? The OIV was established in 1924.  The  1924  OIV  treaty
currently regulates the OIV. South Africa has  been  a  member  of  the  old
Organisation of Vine and Wine  since  1963.  The  old  OIV  has  had  to  be
reviewed to accommodate the interests of other members  who  were  sidelined
in its administration and in the decision-making process. The  old  OIV  was
dominated by French interests, and was  very  Eurocentric  in  dealing  with
issues. That was to our disadvantage,  and  to  the  disadvantage  of  other
countries outside European borders.

The working language was predominantly French,  meaning  that  all  official
documents were written in French. For South Africa this meant  that  we  had
to get someone to translate the documents into English. We might  also  have
been left behind in  some  important  discussion  because  of  the  language
barrier.

The main aims of the OIV are to establish international norms and  standards
on vine and wine products; to set guidelines on  new  wine-making  practices
and techniques; product definition and  labelling;  food  safety  principles
and harmonising standards on vine and wine  products;  to  facilitate  trade
and to promote collaboration and sharing of scientific  research.  The  main
objective of the OIV, which is linked to its aims, is to inform its  members
of measures taken on vine and wine where concerns  of  producers,  consumers
and other players are taken into consideration.

The benefits of South Africa being a member of the 2001 OIV treaty are  that
it will help to complement South Africa's  research  capacity,  as  it  will
provide a platform for exchange of  information  for  researchers;  it  will
provide South Africa with the  ability  to  monitor  relevant  international
technical, regulatory and trade issues regarding wine; and it  will  provide
South Africa with a forum to participate  directly  in  the  formulation  of
resolutions regarding wine and vine production and trade.

Full participation by South Africa in the OIV will help to ensure  that  our
domestic practices are aligned with international recommendations  where  we
deem this to be appropriate.

In conclusion, based on the benefits that South  Africa  will  enjoy  if  it
continues its membership of the OIV, and the disadvantages  it  will  suffer
or opportunities it will miss if it forfeits its membership,  the  committee
agreed that South Africa should rectify the 2001 OIV  treaty  and  become  a
full member of  the  new  OIV.  It  is  very  important  that  South  Africa
participates in the standard setting of wine and vine products to guard  our
own interests. In these matters, it is  important  that  the  South  African
Government should consult and involve the industry in all stages.

A strong partnership with the industry is required to  promote  trade,  deal
with food issues and create  sustainable  development.  As  a  committee  we
commend the role played by the Ministry of Agriculture to  ensure  that  the
industry was part of the whole process. As a  committee  we  recommend  that
South Africa should sign this agreement as a matter of urgency  so  that  it
can start to enjoy benefits from it, and not be left  behind  -  unaware  of
the developments happening globally in the wine industry.  We  support  this
treaty. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  The  hon
Minister has been listening very carefully. However, there are other  people
in this House who have  misinterpreted  what  the  Reverend  has  said.  The
Reverend did not say, "wine and dine". He said: "wine  and  vine".  I  think
that is an agreement you will be signing! [Laughter.]

That concludes the debate. I shall now put the  question.  The  question  is
that the report should be adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms
of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their  provinces'  vote.
They are all present. In accordance with  Rule  71,  I  shall  first  accord
provinces the opportunity to make their declarations of  vote,  if  they  so
wish. There is none.

We shall then proceed to  voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against, or whether  they  abstain.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  All  provinces
have voted in favour. I therefore declare the report adopted  in  accordance
with section 65 of the Constitution.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

                OVERSIGHT VISIT TO QAUKENI LOCAL MUNICIPALITY

            (Consideration of Report of Select Committee thereon)

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, from 19 to 22 June 2004 the Select  Committee  on
Local Government and Administration visited the Qaukeni local  municipality.
It was in response to the  request  by  the  Department  of  Housing,  Local
Government and Traditional Affairs for the continuation of the  intervention
in that municipality for a period of three months.

The department believed that progress was made in the following areas:  one,
reviewing the budget in terms of the IDP; two, building  the  administration
of  the  council  and  IT  systems;  three,  improving  the  financial   and
management systems.

The findings of the committee were that, one, in that council there  was  no
organogram for administration;  two,  the  budgeting  process  was  done  by
consultants - there was no capacity  whatsoever  to  do  budgeting  in  that
council;  three,  staff  members  were  being  abused  by  managers,   being
assaulted - and this with impunity - and were also  assaulting  each  other;
four, there were no computers available in that administration; five,  there
was embezzlement of funds in that council; six, the  tendering  process  was
abused as much  by  officials  as  councillors;  seven,  there  was  no  co-
operation  by  management  and  staff  with  the   administrator   and   the
intervention team. The list is endless.

The recommendations of the committee are tabled in the ATC. They are  there.
However, in terms of the feedback we got from that visit, the  premier,  the
MEC, the district  executive  mayor,  workers,  businesses,  community-based
organisations and ward committees were very happy with the visit. They  said
that I must say to the NCOP: "Halala, NCOP, halala!"

Their budget was approved on 25 June  and  everybody  was  there,  with  the
exception of five councillors who  have  taken  the  council,  the  national
Government, as well as the Eastern Cape government to court. The  suspension
of that council is being lifted gradually.

I want to thank the chair of the council and her deputy for  their  guidance
and stewardship. I also want to thank the Chair of Chairs,  her  deputy  and
the Chief Whip for their unwavering support. I want  to  thank  the  dynamic
team, our committee, for their insightful input  and  contribution  wherever
they are, because over 80% of  the  members  of  this  committee,  including
myself, are new. I also want to thank my caring mother and my  children  for
their understanding. We dare not fail our people and betray their trust.

I want to propose  that  we  adopt  the  report,  as  outlined.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I shall now put the question. The  question  is
that the report be adopted. As the  decision  is  dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain  whether  delegation
heads are present in the Chamber to cast their  provinces'  votes.  Are  all
delegation heads present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. We  shall  now  proceed
to voting on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in  alphabetical  order  per
province. Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they
vote in favour of or against,  or  whether  they  or  abstain  from  voting.

Ms N NTWANAMBi: Sihamba nayo, kakuhle, Sihlalo. [We happily  go  along  with
it, Chairperson.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Nine  provinces  have  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the report adopted. [Applause.]

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: As we conclude, may I take this opportunity  to
thank the hon Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor Manuel, and  the  hon  Minister
of Agriculture and Land Affairs for their courtesy  visit  to  the  National
Council of Provinces. We welcome your visit, hon Ministers.

May I also take this opportunity to bid farewell to one of  our  members  in
the Council, Ms Ndalane, who will be going back to the  province.  She  will
be resigning as from tomorrow. We wish her well going  back  home.  We  hope
that she will do all she can for her father who is not  well.  We  hope  and
wish her all the best in ensuring that she takes care of her father.

May I also say to hon members as we go on leave that you know that  you  did
not have any leave after the elections. Can  you  take  the  two  weeks  and
treat  yourselves  to  the  best?  [Applause.]  [Interjections.]  Well,  hon
Ministers, most unfortunately we have to  be  here  to  continue  doing  the
work. I hope that  during  the  next  two  weeks  all  of  us  will  do  our
constituency work and come back to report to the House on  the  issues  that
we have discovered while we were doing our  constituency  work.  I  want  to
say: Go well, take care and arrive alive. Thank you very much. The House  is
adjourned. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 15:04.
