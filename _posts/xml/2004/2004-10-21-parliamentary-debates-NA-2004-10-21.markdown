Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I hereby give notice that I
intend moving the following motion:

       That the House –

     1) notes that –


       (a) with reference to the Firearms Control Act the Minister of
            Safety and Security stated that: “Unfortunately, the
            processes that must enforce the Act are not working
            effectively.”;


      (b) the implementation of the Act has caused a great a deal of
            confusion at grass roots level; and


         c) the Act is negatively affecting various businesses and
           industries in South Africa, and

     2) therefore resolves that the House debates the various issues
            surrounding the implementation of the Firearms Control Act.


The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Are there any further notices of
motion?  None.  We come to motions without notice. Are there any motions
without notice?  Please continue, hon member. Is that a notice of motion?

  industrial policy.
