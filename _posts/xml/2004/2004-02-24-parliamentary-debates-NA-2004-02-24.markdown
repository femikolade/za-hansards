                 ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS ERADICATION OF POVERTY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnu M M  MASALA  (ANC):  Ikhwelo  lityala,  mawethu.  Somlomo,  ndiphakamela
ukubulela,  ukuthi  enkosi  kuRhulumente,   egameni   likaKhongolosi   nomzi
waseMpofu neziphaluka.

Aniyivanga na injoli yesizwe,  uMphathiswa  wezeZimali  xa  ibizathuza  kule
nkundla  isithi:   ``Wagwetywa   ndlala''.   Ibibhekisa   kuni   maxurandini
aseGangceni,  aseNcaza,  aseDyala,  aseMpofu,  aseMhlangeni,   aseBhafoliti,
akuNondyola   naseNtilini,   nani   mafa-nankosi   kwikomkhulu    likaMaqoma
ngokwakhe,   eTshokotshela.   Ngxatsho   ke,   Ngqongqoshe!   Ngxatsho   ke,
Mphathiswa!

Baginy'  ingwiq'  abant'  abakhulu.  Mababe  ngathi   banyathelela   phezulu
oonozakuzaku  bakho  angade  omiwe  ngumoya   amaxhego.   Zibolile   iintaba
zeNkonkobe yidywabasi, Khumalo. Bakhangele kuwe abantwana bakho,  ngethemba.
Uthini?

Kunamhlanje nje ngathi iintili zeNgxwengxwe  zaphusile,  kodwa  amabel'  ale
mazi abhonxile. Enkosi, Mama. [Laphela ixesha.] [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation
of Xhosa memberâ€™s statement follows.)

[Mr M M MASALA (ANC): That is a whistleblower, fellow countrymen and  women.
Madam Speaker, I stand here to express my gratitude to  this  Government  on
behalf of the African National Congress, Seymour and the surrounding areas.

Did you not hear the hon Minister of Finance when he was giving the  medium-
term budget thereby announcing that hunger and poverty will be driven  away?
He was talking to you, those who come from the  areas  of  Gangceni,  Ncaza,
Dyala, Seymour, Mhlangeni, Balfour, Nondyola and Ntilini. He was talking  to
you, subjects of King Maqoma  at  Tshokotshela.  Thank  you,  hon  Minister,
thank you! The elders are  waiting  in  anticipation.  Let  your  department
deliver before they become impatient. Your  children  are  waiting  on  you.
What are you saying? In you lies our hope. In you lies  our  destiny!  [Time
expired.] [Laughter.]]

                              IRAQI OIL SCANDAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms R TALJAARD (DA): Madam Speaker, the Iraqi  oil  scandal  is  increasingly
engulfing  the  ANC-led  Government.  ANC  mouthpiece  Kgalema   Motlanthe's
irresponsible statements of  cosy  relations  between  the  ANC  and  Saddam
Hussein's Baathists puts  South  Africa  in  a  category  with  yet  another
international pariah. Questions raised  by  the  alleged  links  between  Mr
Sandile Majali,  the  ANC,  prewar  Iraq's  crude  oil  bonanza  and  Imvume
Resources's R2 billion windfall  from  Government  contracts,  and  possible
kickbacks for ANC fundraising cannot remain unanswered. [Interjections.]

Mr Motlanthe's responses are  wholly  inadequate.  To  make  matters  worse,
South  African  peace  support  operations  in  Burundi  and  the  DRC   are
compromised by charter companies, Volga  Atlantic  Airlines,  Marvotech  and
Norse Air Services' alleged links to Russian  mafia  gunrunner  Victor  Bout
and his Ukranian sidekick Yuri Sidorov, who were implicated in arms  trading
by the UN Security  Council's  expert  panels  and  the  Centre  for  Public
Integrity's Study on War Profiteers. [Interjections.] The DA calls on ...

The SPEAKER: Order, hon member. Yes, Minister?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of  order.  Is  it
appropriate for members to raise party-political issues  or  party-political
allegations under this item on the agenda?
The SPEAKER: I regret that that is a habit, and  there  is  nothing  in  the
Rules that prevents it.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Then we have to sort out the Rules, Madam  Speaker,
because this is completely out of order.

The SPEAKER: Minister, I would welcome radical reassessment of the Rules.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: We might have to ask about the  links  between  the
hon member and the mafia. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, there is  an  opportunity  for  members  to  make
statements and members should follow up. Hon Ms  Taljaard.  [Interjections.]
Order!

Mr T D LEE: Madam Speaker, the Minister referred to the member's links  with
the mafia. I think that is totally unacceptable.
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, that was out of order.  Would  you  please
withdraw that statement?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I did not  draw  any  inferences.  I
said we might have to ask.

The  SPEAKER:  Hon  Minister,  I  think  the  comment  in  the  context  was
unacceptable.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: In the context  of  her  sensitivity,  I  withdraw,
Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Will you please proceed.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker,  it  is  regrettable  that  the  Minister  has
stooped to this level.

The DA calls on the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Defence  and  Intelligence
to take all the necessary steps to clear the air  and  save  South  Africa's
foreign policy and international reputation from these scandals.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I want to draw your attention to  the  fact
that I prefaced my earlier ruling by saying that I regret  that  this  is  a
habit in the House, and I do wish that you would not, on all  sides,  engage
in it.

               PROBLEMS REGARDING DELIVERY OF ANTIRETROVIRALS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP  would  like  to  congratulate
the team within the Health department that has put together the  operational
plan for the roll-out of antiretrovirals. They have  compiled  an  excellent
programme. But, as  the  IFP  has  warned  before,  with  regard  to  health
delivery, good ideas without realistic mechanisms for implementation are  as
good as seeds without water.

The entire programme revolves around the delivery of  medicines.  For  years
we have argued over drug procurement.  Even  now  we  are  consumed  with  a
debate over the prices of medicines, but  the  method  of  delivery  is  our
greatest downfall. It is filled with cracks between private  companies  that
deliver medicines to Government warehouses, thence via private tenderers  to
Government hospitals who take them to  clinics,  and  between  those  cracks
billions of rands' worth of medicines are stolen. The  antiretrovirals  will
be to the people who want to get their hands on  them  what  the  elixir  of
life was to people in the past.

There  is  no  reason  why  we  should  not  have   single,   public/private
partnerships  which  provide  private  management  of  the  entire  delivery
service, from the source of  production  to  the  source  where  the  people
consume the medicines. Also, the funding mechanism is too  bureaucratic,  as
is the entire health structure which attempts to centralise control  in  the
office of the Minister, while aiming for decentralisation  and  delivery  to
the people.

The IFP proposes a far simpler  relationship  between  national,  provincial
and local governments, with power vested from  the  bottom  up  rather  than
from the top  down,  and  this  would  enable  the  programme  to  be  well-
delivered. Thank you. [Time expired.]

                         YOUTH INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME

                            (Member's Statement)
Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC  commends  the  continuing
efforts of Government to improve  the  skills  base  of  the  youth  of  our
country. On Friday, 20  February  2004,  the  State  Information  Technology
Agency held the official launch of  the  Youth  Internship  Programme.  This
programme will assist in building  an  ICT  skills  base  by  providing  300
individuals from historically disadvantaged backgrounds with training  every
year.

The programme is a partnership between Sita, the Umsombomvu Youth  Fund  and
the Public Sector SETA. It targets 51% female and 4%  disabled  persons.  We
commend  the  ANC-led  Government  on  implementing  this  very  progressive
programme which cuts through the nerve of the colonial apartheid  legacy  by
focusing on skills development among those sectors that bore  the  brunt  of
the policies of the past. I thank you.
                      MATRIC EXAMINATIONS DISCREPANCIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Chairperson,  the  Minister  of  Education  should
consider expanding investigation into the  failure  rate  of  Grade  10s  to
cover also the alleged high drop-out rate of matrics.  The  New  NP  is  not
questioning the hon Minister's statistics, but according  to  press  reports
555 118 matrics were registered last year, but only 440 267 wrote the  final
exam. This means 114 851, almost  115  000  matrics,  disappeared  from  the
system during the year. The reason for this should  be  urgently  determined
and addressed.

It is also important to know whether the thousands of matrics  who  did  not
write the exams are still completing their school  career  or  whether  they
dropped out of school altogether.
The New NP realises that  there  will  always  be  the  no-shows  and  other
unforeseen reasons  for  matrics  not  writing  the  final  exams,  but  the
discrepancy between the number of learners who registered for Grade  12  and
the number who completed the year is still unacceptably high. Therefore  the
New NP calls on the Minister to investigate these  allegations  and  address
the situation effectively, as he is now doing in the  case  of  the  failure
rate of Grade 10 learners and will, we hope, also  do  with  regard  to  the
poor numeracy and literacy ability of Grade 8 learners. I thank you.

               FF PLUS AND CPC ELECTION CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Mevrou die Speaker, Die VF Plus en die  Cape  People's
Congress (CPC) het  nÃ¡  indringende  samesprekings  vandag  in  Kaapstad  'n
verkiesingsooreenkoms van samewerking bereik. Die CPC is 'n politieke  party
wat sy steunbasis veral in  die  Wes-  en  Noord-Kaapse  bruin  gemeenskappe
vind. Die CPC het in 2000 aan die  munisipale  verkiesing  in  die  Wes-Kaap
deelgeneem en het die magsbalans  in  die  Theewaterskloof-stadsraad  gehad.
Die CPC  het  nou  besluit  om  verder  te  gaan  en  die  politiek  ook  op
provinsiale vlak te betree.

Die VF Plus en die CPC gaan albei afsonderlik in hul eie  reg  met  hul  eie
kandidate en veldtogte aan die 2004-verkiesing in die  Wes-Kaap  en  in  die
Noord-Kaap deelneem. Aangesien die CPC nie aan die verkiesing  op  nasionale
vlak gaan deelneem nie, het hy op sy ondersteuners 'n beroep  gedoen  om  op
nasionale vlak hul stem vir die VF Plus uit te bring.

Die twee partye stem saam oor onder andere die  volgende:  die  nastreef  en
bevordering  van  Christelike  waardes,  die  beskerming  en  uitbouing  van
Afrikaans as inheemse taal, die herinstelling van die  doodstraf  ten  einde
ons gemeenskappe te beskerm teen misdaad, die beÃ«indiging  van  regstellende
aksie wat albei ons gemeenskappe en  van  ons  jongmense  benadeel,  en  die
bemagtiging van ons onderskeie gemeenskappe.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans memberâ€™s statement follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER (FF): Madam Speaker, the FF  Plus  and  the  Cape  People's
Congress (CPC) have, after incisive discussions in Cape Town today,  reached
an election agreement of co-operation. The CPC is a  political  party  which
finds its  support  basis  especially  in  the  Western  and  Northern  Cape
coloured communities. The CPC took part in the  municipal  election  in  the
Western Cape in 2000 and held the balance of power  in  the  Theewaterskloof
Town Council. The CPC has now decided to  go  further  and  also  engage  in
politics at a provincial level.

The FF Plus and the CPC are both going to participate, separately  in  their
own right with their own candidates and campaigns, in the 2004  election  in
the Western Cape and in the Northern Cape. As the CPC is  not  participating
in the election at national level, it has appealed  to  supporters  to  vote
for the FF Plus at national level.

The two parties are in agreement  about,  inter  alia,  the  following:  the
promotion of Christian values, the protection and building of  Afrikaans  as
an indigenous language, the reinstatement of the death penalty in  order  to
protect our  communities  against  crime,  the  termination  of  affirmative
action which is to the disadvantage of both our communities  and  our  young
people and the empowerment of our respective communities. I thank you.]

             NEW AND IMPROVED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN MAMELODI

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D C MABENA (ANC): Madam Speaker, South Africans are consistent  in  their
determination  to  unite  in  a  people's  contract  to  ensure  progressive
improvement in their mental, physical  and  social  health.  On  Friday,  20
February 2004, the Gauteng MEC for Health,  Dr  Gwen  Ramokgopa,  officially
opened the Holani Clinic in Mamelodi East within  the  Tshwane  metropolitan
area.

The  clinic  itself  was  built  in  partnership  with  the   De   Stichting
Verpleging/Verzorging Eindhoven, an NGO from the Netherlands.  The  building
and official opening of this clinic further demonstrates the  commitment  of
the ANC-led Government to bringing quality primary health care  to  all  our
people, especially those who have been deprived of these basic services  for
far too long.

On the same day there was a  sod-turning  event  for  the  building  of  the
second phase of the Mamelodi Day Hospital in preparation for  its  upgrading
to a level 2 full-fledged hospital. This sod-turning event has  been  hailed
by the people of Mamelodi as a demonstration of  the  continuing  commitment
of the ANC to the creation of a better life for all.

                 TREES GIVEN TO MEMBERS BY FINANCE MINISTER

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms T E MILLIN (IAM): Madam Speaker, as this is  probably  my  last  member's
statement  in  this  honourable  House,  I  have  resolved  to  be  nice  to
everybody, including the ANC. In any case, I believe congratulations are  in
order to the Minister of Finance on his eighth Budget Speech delivered  last
week, which could in broad terms be described  as  pretty  balanced,  albeit
with a  strong  socialistic  tone.  It  has  been  described  by  a  certain
newspaper - which  I  shall  quote,  so  I  hope  no  points  of  order  for
unparliamentary language will be called by the  ANC  Chief  Whip  or  anyone
else - as ``a bloody good Budget''.

I would also like to thank the hon Minister for his gift of a tree, which  I
shall plant on returning home. Unfortunately, not having  any  grandchildren
yet, it will more likely be my great-grandchildren who will  be  sitting  in
its shade one day. I did wonder, though, why we were  receiving  trees  from
our Finance Minister, rather than from our Forestry Minister. But I think  I
have hit on the answer to that one - our Finance Minister, by presenting  us
all with our young saplings is proving beyond  doubt  that  money  does  not
grow on trees. I thank you. [Applause.]

                  HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN CAMPAIGN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M M MALUMISE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC commends Government  and,  in
particular,  the  Department  of  Health  on  its  launch  of  the   Healthy
Environment for Children  campaign.  Each  year  the  unhealthy  environment
contributes to the deaths of over 5 million children under  the  age  of  14
years.

The health of a large number of South Africa's  children  is  threatened  by
environmental risks in their homes and schools. Exposure  to  higher  levels
of indoor  air  pollution,  chemicals  in  the  environment  such  as  lead,
pesticides and mercury, together with poor access to water  and  sanitation,
and other poor hygiene practices, are some of  the  issues  the  effects  of
which require improved awareness among our people.

Studies have shown a link in children with high blood lead levels and  lower
IQ scores, short  concentration  spans,  decreased  growth  and  even  brain
damage. We call on South  Africans  to  unite  in  a  people's  contract  to
further accelerate the rate of delivery of water and  sanitation  programmes
and of elimination of the use of lead in petrol. I thank you. [Applause.]

                SOUTH AFRICA'S QUIET DIPLOMACY FAILS ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S M CAMERER (DA): Madam Speaker,  President  Robert  Mugabe's  statement
that he would not hold talks with Morgan Tsvangirai for as long as  the  MDC
were allies of Western countries, along with his earlier statement  that  he
will cling to power for the next five years,  has  exposed  President  Thabo
Mbeki's policy of quiet diplomacy as an embarrassing and costly disaster.

Quiet diplomacy may delay international action on the  Zimbabwe  crisis  and
buy more time for Robert Mugabe to bring ever more ruin to his country,  but
it is damaging to  South  Africa's  national  interests  and  it  undermines
President Mbeki's international standing. South Africa deserves better.  The
ANC must move from its policy of not-so-silent support  for  Zanu  PF  to  a
real condemnation of Robert Mugabe and the exertion of significant  pressure
to bring about a democratic transition in that  country  before  it  is  too
late. Thank you.

            ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS PHYSICALLY DISABLED PERSONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B W DHLAMINI (IFP): Madam  Speaker,  physically  challenged  people  have
many challenges and obstacles that they have to overcome every day of  their
lives. It is, therefore, totally unacceptable that there  are  still  people
who insult, abuse and violate their rights.

A Pretoria man, who is not physically challenged and who  recently  appeared
in court, allegedly parked his car across several  parking  bays  designated
for physically challenged people outside a restaurant. When asked to  remove
his vehicle, he allegedly refused and started to insult disabled people  and
the police who were called in to assist.

This behaviour is disgraceful and has  no  place  in  our  society,  and  it
should not be tolerated. All South Africans,  whether  they  are  physically
disabled or of a different race,  have  rights  and  must  be  treated  with
respect and dignity. We South Africans need to  be  more  sensitive  to  the
rights of those who are physically disabled. As MPs, let us set a trend  and
treat the physically challenged with  respect  and  dignity.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

    INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ACTION ON THE ISRAELI SEPARATION WALL

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr Z P JORDAN (ANC): Madam Speaker, on 23 February 2004  the  Government  of
South Africa joined with others in requesting  the  International  Court  of
Justice in the Hague to offer advisory opinion  on  the  legal  consequences
arising from the construction  of  the  separation  wall  including  in  and
around East Jerusalem, by  Israel,  the  occupying  power  in  the  occupied
Palestinian territory.

The 7,50-metre-high wall, which runs through the lands  occupied  by  Israel
since June 1967, that is for the  past  36  years,  is  responsible  for  an
escalating   humanitarian   catastrophe   in   the   occupied    Palestinian
territories. Its construction  will  result  in  the  fragmentation  of  the
territory of any future Palestinian state  into  a  number  of  economically
unviable walled ghettos or  ``shtetls''  as  they  were  called  in  Eastern
Europe. The construction of the  separation  wall,  which  the  Palestinians
today referred to as an ``apartheid wall'',  is  serving  as  a  pretext  to
seize more land and to annex it to the state of Israel. This wall is  unique
in history and poses unprecedented challenges to international law.

We, in this House, have repeatedly called on both sides in this conflict  to
cease all acts of violence. We once more reiterate  our  commitment  to  the
creation of a regional environment in which  Israel  can  coexist  with  its
neighbours within secure borders and  free  from  the  threat  of  violence.
However, the actions of Israeli authorities, such  as  the  construction  of
this wall, can only fuel the cycle of violence  and  counterviolence.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

                       NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANC FOR LAND

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C B JOHNSON (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP still believes  that  the
best way to address the concerns of all South Africans  is  by  way  of  its
approach, namely through negotiation and discussion with the ANC.

Why do we say this? At the time when the Land Restitution  Bill  was  before
the  portfolio  committee,  we  were  of  the  view   that   not   all   our
constituencies'  concerns  were  adequately  expressed.  We   entered   into
negotiations and discussions with the ANC, and certain checks  and  balances
were built in in order to address these concerns.

Why is this important to a landowner? It is important because the  landowner
must know that the Minister, as an  administrative  functionary,  is  always
subject to  judicial  review;  that  the  Minister  must  in  all  cases  of
expropriation give adequate notice,  give  adequate  reasons  and  give  the
landowner the right to make representations.

This shows that the New NP's approach of speaking to  the  ANC,  instead  of
screaming at the ANC as certain other parties do, is the best  approach  and
the only way to achieve win-win solutions for all South Africans. So,  while
the DA  is  on  its  continuous  little  mission  of  being  an  alternative
government, the New NP  will  speak  to  the  real  Government.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! In the absence of the ACDP, I will give the slot to  the
FF.

                     HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Agb Mevrou die Speaker, die  ANC-regering  het  gister
'n  voorlegging  gedoen  voor   die   Internasionale   Geregshof   oor   die
menseregtevergrype in die stryd tussen Israel en die Palestyne.
In die Zimbabwiese situasie is net sewe van  die  55  MDC-opposisielede  nog
nie een of ander tyd deur die Mugabe-regering in die tronk  gegooi  nie.  By
'n internasionale mediakonferensie oor mediavryheid is verlede  week  bevind
dat Zimbabwe se mediavryheid die swakste in Afrika is.

Dit bly vir die VF Plus onverklaarbaar waarom die ANC steeds  voortgaan  met
stille diplomasie as 'n oplossing vir die  menseregtevergrype  in  Zimbabwe,
maar dieselfde strategie nie gebruik rakende  die  situasie  in  die  Midde-
Ooste nie. Hoekom werk dit by die een en nie by die ander nie? Die  korrekte
optrede sou wees om ook in Zimbabwe op dieselfde wyse op  te  tree,  naamlik
om duidelik  te  sÃª  hierdie  Regering  heg  belangrikheid  aan  menseregte.
Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans memberâ€™s statement follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER (FF): Hon Madam Speaker, yesterday the ANC Government  made
a submission before the International Court of Justice regarding  the  human
rights violations in the battle between Israel and the Palestinians.

In the Zimbabwean situation only seven of  the  55  MDC  opposition  members
have not been jailed by the Mugabe government at some or other stage. At  an
international media conference on media freedom last week it was found  that
Zimbabwe's media freedom is the weakest in Africa.

The FF Plus cannot understand why the ANC is  still  continuing  with  quiet
diplomacy as a solution to the human  rights  violations  in  Zimbabwe,  but
does not use the same strategy regarding the situation in the  Middle  East.
Wy does it work for one and not for the other? The correct action  would  be
to act in Zimbabwe in  the  same  way,  namely  to  say  clearly  that  this
Government attaches importance to human rights. Thank you.]

                        IMPACT OF BUDGET ON THE POOR

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like  to  express  my  sincere
appreciation to both hon members, Masala and Millin. Hon  Masala  said  that
the Budget impacts very directly on his constituency in  Limpopo.  I'm  sure
members who live and work amongst the poor would be  able  to  reflect  that
similarly.

The change over the past 10 years has  brought  measurable  improvements  in
the quality of life of all our people. I think it  is  that  that  will  see
this side of the House returning in even larger numbers after the  elections
on 14 April 2004. Thank you. [Applause.]

                               MATRIC DROPOUTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, for your  forbearance,  there  are
two issues here, and  one  is  education.  I  belong  to  the  international
cluster, in relation to the hon Mulder's intervention.

I am grateful to the hon Olckers for raising the issue of the  matric  drop-
outs. The figure of those who wrote the matric examinations is not 440  000,
it is 600 000. And there  were  nearly  200  000  who  were  ...  I'm  being
disturbed by the hon Chief Whip of the ... He is referring to  my  stylistic
presence today, which I abjure. [Interjections.] Style  has  nothing  to  do
with Parliament.

The SPEAKER: Minister, you are using up your time.
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Sorry. Can I  say,  therefore,  that  this  is  a
matter that we have looked at for the statistics. Secondly,  if  it's  part-
time people who have registered and written the examinations,  it  is  quite
clear that there will be repeats. But, in any case, we  must  look  at  this
very seriously because the number of those who write the matric  examination
is enormously important for  human  resource  development,  apart  from  the
waste of capacity, talent and initiative that's  involved  in  that.  So  we
will do this seriously, but we won't do it  simply  because  the  statistics
are brought to our attention in the newspapers.

The second point is in relation to the comparison that the  hon  Mulder  has
made between the wall  and,  in  fact,  the  situation  in  Zimbabwe.  I  am
surprised that the hon Mulder, who believes that the  most  important  right
in a democracy is self-determination forgets to apply it to the  Palestinian
situation. Whatever happens - even  in  Zimbabwe  -  is  in  relation  to  a
sovereign independent state. We  may  take  a  position  in  relation  to  a
sovereign independent state, but the most elemental  and  fundamental  right
of all is the right to self-determination, which  Israel  forbids,  ignores,
violates and refuses to accept. It refuses to accept that  the  wall  is  in
breach of the Geneva Convention, as the hon  Deputy  Minister  said  at  The
Hague today, in fact, that it is an  acquisition  of  Palestinian  territory
rather than a guard against terrorist activities.  I'm  surprised  that  the
hon  Mulder  makes  that  equation,  because  there  are  two   fundamental,
different features: 3 500 Palestinians have died whilst about  800  Israelis
have died.

The Government's position is that there must be negotiation. There  must  be
recognition of the right to self-determination for  the  Palestinian  people
and that the Palestinian people must decide their own future in  a  national
territory that the international community recognises. The  hon  Mulder  may
agree  to  that,  but  I  think  equating  the  two  situations  is   highly
opportunistic, unnecessary and, in the end, a dismal  intervention  in  this
House. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, I'm sure both you and Mr Gibson will enliven  the
forthcoming elections with a debate on the dress code. [Laughter.]

                  HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN CAMPAIGN

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like  to  thank
the hon member Malumise for raising the issues around a healthy  environment
for our children.

Yes, indeed, I may report to this House that yesterday  we  formally  opened
the International Congress on Environmental Health, the first conference  of
this nature to be held on the continent. We are very  proud  that  as  South
Africans we are hosting this conference.

We raised exactly  the  same  issues  that  MP  Malumise  mentioned  in  her
statement, and, as I say, we are very grateful for that. In this regard,  we
will recall that in the margins of the WSSD we launched, as  the  Department
of Health, a campaign for a healthy environment for our  children.  We  have
also established a multisectoral committee to  develop  concrete  plans  and
monitor their implementation for the sake  of  our  children  so  that  they
live, learn and play in a healthy environment.

Once more, thank you very much MP Malumise, for your statement. [Applause.]

                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I rise against  the  hon  Gibson  in
support of the sartorial  elegance  of  the  Minister  of  Education.  South
Africa  has  one  of  the  most  transparent  and   equitable   systems   of
intergovernmental grants, with three allocations made per province  and  per
municipality from the National Revenue Fund. This information  is  published
in the Division of Revenue Bill as  tabled  on  Budget  Day,  allowing  each
province and municipality to include all grants  in  their  budgets  and  to
properly plan for their expenditure.

However,  we  must  constantly  remind  ourselves  that,  while  exceedingly
important, transparency of our intergovernmental system is  not  an  end  in
itself. To fellow South Africans what matters most is the  extent  to  which
we as political office-bearers  take  advantage  of  the  strengths  of  our
system to deliver more  and  better  services  for  the  betterment  of  the
quality of life for  all  South  Africans.  What  matters  to  fellow  South
Africans is whether between the executive and Parliament we hold each  other
accountable for the appropriate use  of  the  resources  allocated  in  this
Bill.

Given our intergovernmental system,  each  province  and  municipality  will
budget for these national allocations, determining  how  its  share  of  the
funds will be used to give expression to its priorities under  the  umbrella
of policy frameworks agreed to through the intergovernmental forums such  as
Minmecs, joint Minmecs, the Budget Council, the Budget Forum  and  also  the
extended Cabinet meetings.
Last week, when we tabled the Budget, we spelt out how  the  national  share
is divided among the national functions. We are not able to do this for  the
provinces and municipalities, as they have not yet published their  budgets.
But, as in  previous  years,  we  shall  publish  this  information  in  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review later this year.

This  year's  Bill  allocates  61,8%  of  nationally  raised   revenues   to
provincial and local  governments,  to  give  effect  to  this  Government's
priority of reducing poverty and vulnerability. The core of the Division  of
Revenue Bill is contained in the seven schedules to the Bill.

Schedule 1 provides a summary of  the  allocation  of  funds  to  the  three
spheres of Government. Of the R389,9 billion  in  the  Budget  for  the  new
fiscal year,  the  national  Government  is  allocated  R201  billion.  This
allocation  includes  R52,9  billion  for  debt  service   costs   and   the
contingency reserve, leaving national  Government  with  R120,6  billion  to
allocate  to  national  departments,   including   conditional   grants   to
provincial and local governments.

Schedules 3 and 4 allocate the equitable share component  to  provinces  and
municipalities. Schedules 5 to 6  further  allocate  conditional  and  other
grants to provinces. About R21,2 billion is  given  to  provinces  and  R6,6
billion is given to local government.

The 2004 Medium Term  Expenditure  Framework  builds  on  the  sound  policy
framework that evolved over the first decade of democracy and  provides  for
further deepening and consolidation of social services, which  make  up  the
bulk of provincial expenditure.

The allocations to provinces further reinforce spending  to  reduce  poverty
and vulnerability through  increased  allocations  for  social  security  to
provide for the further extension of the social security net.  The  emphasis
is on completing  the  phased  extension  of  the  child  support  grant  to
children up to the age of 14 years through grants introduced, starting  from
last year.

The allocation of the child support extension grant rises from R1,2  billion
in the current fiscal year, to R3,7 billion in 2004-05,  further  increasing
to R9,2 billion in the fiscal year ending on 31 March 2007.

The Budget  strengthens  Government's  response  to  HIV/Aids.  It  provides
additional  funds  for  the  health   sector   to   implement   Government's
comprehensive response to HIV/Aids. It allocates  R1,9  billion  more  to  a
conditional grant over the  three  years  to  roll  out  the  antiretroviral
drugs. This brings earmarked spending to combat  HIV/Aids  to  R3,5  billion
over the next three years.

The 2004 Budget maintains a strong growth in  the  allocation  targeted  for
provincial infrastructure development  and  maintenance,  rising  from  R2,3
billion in the current fiscal year to R4,1 billion in the third year.  As  a
result, national transfers for infrastructure amount to R11,2  billion  over
the next three years.

In addition to addressing backlogs in social  and  economic  infrastructure,
rising infrastructure allocations lay the basis for the expansion of labour-
intensive  projects  under  the  auspices  of  the  Expanded  Public   Works
Programme. The  grant  will  also  provide  for  agriculture  infrastructure
development  to  support  farmers  who  acquire   new   land,   particularly
beneficiaries of our land reform programme.

In this year's Budget, a new conditional grant is proposed  to  support  the
implementation of a broad range of  farmer-support  services  to  developing
farmers. Increasing access to services is critical for the success  of  land
distribution initiatives and the  LRAD  programme.  About  R750  million  is
allocated to this over the MTEF years.

Over the next three years, municipalities will receive R47,3 billion  or  an
additional R3,9 billion. The substantial increase in  the  local  government
share mainly targets the provision of free basic services, the extension  of
services  to  areas  not  presently  serviced  and  job   creation   through
investment and labour-based infrastructure programmes.

The 2004 MTEF also takes major steps in  streamlining  funding  through  the
consolidation  of  infrastructure  grants  into   municipal   infrastructure
grants. The MIG totals R16,6 billion over the next three  years,  reflecting
an additional R1,7 billion. This grant together  with  other  infrastructure
grants being phased out is a key instrument to  support  the  infrastructure
budgets of municipalities, to support the  extension  of  services  to  poor
households, to maintain and upgrade municipal infrastructure and to  support
urban renewal and rural development.

Finally, allocations for capacity-building and  restructuring,  up  to  R750
million a year over the MTEF period, are appropriated. This is to  encourage
municipalities to build in-house capacity to focus on planning, project  and
financial management and budget reforms envisaged in the  Municipal  Finance
Management and Municipal Systems Acts.
Our system of grants is so transparent and  so  voluminous,  with  the  many
appendices on local government grants, that even our journalists missed  the
importance of  publishing  our  consolidated  tables  on  total  grants  per
municipality, as set out in table E22 in Annexure E in  the  Budget  Review.
For example, it notes that the OR Tambo  municipalities,  including  Umtata,
will collectively receive the highest at R823 million in the first  year  of
the  MTEF,  followed  by  the  Amathole  municipality   at   R743   million,
Johannesburg at R683 million, eThekwini  at  R643  million,  Ekhurhuleni  at
R504 million and Vhembe at R445 million.

I want to conclude  by  noting  that  the  first  decade  of  democracy  has
witnessed  remarkable   progress   in   the   development,   evolution   and
consolidation of South Africa's  intergovernmental  grants  system.  Looking
ahead, we need to improve this system to ensure that  it  is  able  to  deal
with the challenges facing us in  the  coming  decade.  The  publication  of
Census 2001 results, together  with  the  restructuring  of  the  system  of
social grants and the electricity distribution industry,  provides  us  with
the opportunity to undertake this review for the 2005 Budget.

More importantly, we need  to  focus  on  how  to  improve  the  quality  of
spending in all spheres of government. Ten years on, we should  be  able  to
reap the benefits of any improvements in the delivery of services  over  the
second  decade  of  democracy.  To  do  so,  Parliament  and   all   elected
legislatures will need to improve their system of oversight  to  assess  the
performance of government in all three spheres. I have pleasure  in  tabling
the Division of Revenue Bill for  its  second  reading  debate.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon members,  when  the  Minister  of
Finance delivered his Budget Speech on 18  February  2004,  he  also  tabled
this Division of Revenue Bill, which is before Parliament today.  This  Bill
is a constitutional requirement that determines the  equitable  division  of
nationally  raised  revenue  between  the  three   spheres   of   government
vertically, and also horizontally amongst provinces.

In  his  speech  the  Minister  referred  us  to  the  principles   of   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme underpinned by  five  major  policy
programmes. These principles are: the meeting of basic needs,  building  the
economy, democratising the state and  society,  developing  human  resources
and, finally, the implementation of the RDP.

For purposes of this debate, allow me to  address  myself  to  the  task  of
democratising the state and society and that of meeting the basic  needs  of
our populace, which is central to the Division of Revenue  Bill.  The  ANC's
commitment to the  course  of  equality  and  socioeconomic  development  is
demonstrated by this piece of legislation. To quote from the RDP document:


  Democratisation  is  integral   to   the   RDP.   Without   thoroughgoing
  democratisation the potential of our country and its people will  not  be
  available for a coherent programme of reconstruction and development.

The matter of an equitable division of revenue is an issue of  human  rights
enshrined in our Constitution and  is  in  line  with  the  Freedom  Charter
adopted by the People's Congress in 1955, in Kliptown. When the Division  of
Revenue Bill is tabled, one thing that is of  prime  importance  is  how  it
takes into account all matters listed in Section 214(2)(a)  to  (j)  of  the
Constitution. These include: the  national  interest,  provision  for  debt,
national Government needs, and provision of  the  constitutionally  mandated
basic services by provinces and local government. These matters are  covered
by the FFC recommendations which one of  my  colleagues  is  going  to  deal
with.

Given  the  history  of  this  country,  where  resources  were  not  shared
equitably among all citizens, it became imperative that the  new  democratic
order be supported by democratic instruments like  this  Bill.  Our  systems
have evolved and matured and they  ensure  the  progressive  realisation  of
socioeconomic rights and the creation of a people-centered  and  transparent
process that addresses the legacy of apartheid.

There has been a steady improvement in  the  provinces'  capacity  to  spend
efficiently and compliance with the Public Finance Management Act  has  been
positive lately. This year also sees the  phased-in  implementation  of  the
Municipal Finance Management Act and I am confident that this will also  add
to the already developing trend  towards  accountability  and  transparency.
Considerable funding has  been  dedicated  to  building  capacity  in  local
government, specifically in the areas  of  management,  planning,  technical
services, budgeting and financial management.

As we debate the Division of Revenue Bill today, I'm tempted  to  reflect  a
bit on our past, when the majority  of  us  were  marginalised  and  totally
excluded from sharing in the resources of this country  in  total  disregard
of our basic human rights. This gave rise to  the  situation  that  the  ANC
Government inherited in 1994. Our people were condemned to  live  in  places
that are not suitable for human habitation and were referred to  as  surplus
people. Despite the tremendous progress that the ANC has made in  addressing
these disparities, many challenges  still  confront  us.  This  division  of
revenue takes us a step closer to the realisation of our dream of  a  better
life for all, as well as building the fiscal capacity and efficiency of  the
provincial and local spheres  and  the  reduction  of  economic  disparities
whilst promoting stability and predictability.

 Building on the Growth and Development Summit resolutions and the  Ten-year
Review, this division of revenue feeds into the 2004  MTEF's  renewed  focus
on  strengthening  investment  and  job  creation,  reducing   poverty   and
supporting vulnerable groups,  education  and  skill  development,  creating
sustainable communities and enhancing service delivery.
One of the key challenges facing  delivery  programmes  is  to  address  the
problems of the second economy. We need to deal with issues such  as  income
poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, hence the expanded public  works
programme.

To  give  expression  to  our  commitment  to  the  improvement  of  service
delivery, both the shares for provincial and  local  government  allocations
increase significantly. The provincial allocation increases  from  56,8%  to
58% and the local government allocation from 4,4%  to  4,6%  over  the  MTEF
whilst the national share decreases  from  38,9%  to  37,4%  over  the  same
period.  Over  half  of  the  additional  resources  are  allocated  to  the
provinces in recognition of the challenges they face  in  delivering  social
services,  building  and  maintaining  economic  infrastructure,  employment
creation, promoting rural development and coping with HIV and Aids.
Local government, which must deal with the provision of free  basic  service
and expand municipal infrastructure, also gets a larger slice of  additional
revenue than its baseline allocation. These allocations alone  are  not  the
solution to the problem of years of dispossession and deprivation.  The  ANC
is not only faced with the responsibility of delivering on its mandate of  a
better life for all, but all of  us  were  victims  and  therefore  all  our
people are the beneficiaries.

The  most  critical  part  is  that  of  ensuring  that  reconstruction  and
development really takes place. Oversight therefore becomes critical for  us
as public representatives and that calls upon  all  of  us  to  ensure  that
these Government policies are implemented. Some of us tend to abdicate  this
responsibility because of our political persuasions and lack  of  commitment
to this country and its people. The rightwing in this country  has  taken  a
decision that they will fight any effort to bring about a  better  life  for
all and they continuously insult our people's integrity  by  asserting  that
life is now worse than it was pre-democracy. As they tell  the  story  of  a
bleak future, they cannot even convince themselves that  the  lie  they  are
telling will one day be true. Our people know the truth.

It takes a lot of courage to tell a person who did not have a roof over  his
or her head and who now does, that apartheid was  better.  For  a  pensioner
who now earns R740, it is absurd in the extreme to  tell  him  or  her  that
life was better before; and to all  recipients  of  social  grants  and  the
indigent policies of the ANC Government one must be  insane  to  attempt  to
tell our people that they were better off without  electricity  and  running
water and decent access roads. It's a long and arduous road that requires  a
people's contract to overcome and our people are  taking  up  the  challenge
already, taking advantage of the Expanded Public  Works  Programme,  Working
for Water projects and Zibambele in KwaZulu-Natal. Whilst these  are  short-
term measures, the skills acquired and the  installation  of  infrastructure
has long-term socioeconomic benefits.

Indeed, there will be no major policy changes but  an  acceleration  of  the
implementation of  our  programmes  supported  by  the  resources  allocated
through this process of the Division of Revenue Bill. The ANC supports  this
Bill. I thank, you Madam Chair.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  Minister,  the  R327  billion
revenue projection in this Budget is to be primarily located  at  provincial
and local government levels. Nationally raised revenue is divided to  target
considerable  spending  on  the  Expanded   Public   Works   Programme   via
conditional   provincial   infrastructure   grants   and    the    municipal
infrastructure grants, as well as the new conditional HIV/Aids grant  to  be
administered  by  provinces  as  part  of  the  new  comprehensive  HIV/Aids
treatment and care strategy.

In their submissions to the Portfolio Committee on  Finance,  the  Financial
and Fiscal Commission highlighted that the number of  households  living  in
poverty rose from 28% to 33% between 1995 and 1999, largely  driven  by  the
current and growing unemployment crisis.

The consequences of the unemployment crisis can also be  seen  and,  indeed,
felt in budgetary terms in the pressure  on  social  grants  and  on  social
grant expenditure. When social grant expenditure grows from R10  billion  in
1993 to R40  billion  projected  in  2004,  with  the  highest  real  growth
projected for social welfare, a stark reminder is delivered  of  what  South
Africa's non-negotiable top  priority  must  be:  economic  growth  and  job
creation. There is, clearly, no greater political  challenge  and  there  is
equally no more effective means of arresting poverty.

The Division of Revenue Bill  takes  the  first  step  in  rolling  out  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, with a considerable amount of R1,7  billion
allocated and targeted at the municipal infrastructure grant.

Clause 11 of the Division of Revenue Bill introduces four new subclauses  to
facilitate the phasing-in of  the  Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant.  Clause
11(6)  requires  municipalities  to  provide   specific   details   on   the
implementation of capital budgets as part of a three-year capital plan.
Compliance with these provisions will have  to  be  carefully  monitored  by
National Treasury, councils and, indeed, provincial legislatures  to  ensure
that  spending  on  the  Expanded  Public   Works   Programme   results   in
economically productive infrastructure.

While the DA believes  that  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  has  a
contribution to  make  to  poverty  alleviation  in  the  context  of  South
Africa's structural skills deficit, it cannot provide long-term  sustainable
solutions and job creation. While these programmes,  if  closely  monitored,
can contribute to addressing the  infrastructure  backlogs,  they  will  not
arrest the unemployment crisis or result in higher economic growth  and  job
creation.

The DA would like to highlight two critical elements that could even  hamper
the implementation of the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.  Firstly,  the
implementation of the Local Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act
will bring  considerable  upheaval  in  the  context  of  limited  financial
management capacity at local level, which  could  inhibit  the  roll-out  of
public/private partnerships and private sector involvement.

Secondly, at the very time that  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  is
being announced, the meddlesome Minister of Public Works is phasing  in  and
implementing a  new  register  for  the  construction  industry.  These  two
factors can, indeed, impede  the  roll-out  of  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme.

When the Minister announced the R2,1 billion additional allocation to  fight
HIV/Aids, this was obviously welcomed by all in civil society  and,  indeed,
by the Official Opposition. I would like to raise a question on a matter  in
respect of clause 23(2)  of  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  and  the  new
HIV/Aids grant allocation. In terms  of  this  provision,  the  Minister  of
Health and the  Department  of  Health  will  have  a  considerable  say  in
reallocating funding of the new conditional grants  to  provinces  that  are
spending faster.

Well, this may sound in principle, but there  is  a  concern.  According  to
Annexure E of the Division  of  Revenue  Bill,  this  will  be  done  taking
cognisance  of  the  monitoring  framework  established  by   the   National
Department of  Health  and  the  reporting  requirements  specified  by  the
National Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the comprehensive  treatment
plan.

Based on the performance of the Minister of Health in HIV/Aids, the  DA  can
but express the hope that the Minister will not frivolously  redirect  funds
to different provinces. In addition, the DA trusts that the Government  will
finalise the tender for the antiretroviral drugs before opting  to  penalise
provinces and redirect spending. The DA supports  the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill.

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, I don't intend to dwell on the numbers  or  the
other details of this Bill. Rather, I will talk  more  generally  about  the
evolution of the Bill as a legislative instrument, because  I  believe  that
this far-reaching  division  of  revenue  exercise  is  as  deserving  of  a
reflective 10-year assessment as many of  the  other  achievements  that  we
are, these days, acknowledging.

I suppose  the  most  general  observation  to  make  is  on  the  seemingly
uncontested and methodical production of the  Bill  each  year.  I  remember
back in the mid-1990s,  before  the  first  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  was
produced, attending a number of workshops and conferences and  listening  to
a number of high-ranking  international  experts  making  us  aware  of  the
complex formula difficulties and of inevitable tensions between  levels  and
components of government resulting from the contestation of funds.  We  were
told that it would take at least 10 to 15  years  of  technical  debate  and
heated challenges  from  the  lower  stratas  of  government  to  achieve  a
division of revenue consensus in our country.

Madam  Speaker,  despite  the  production  of  a  highly  intricate  set  of
intergovernmental fiscal relations, as can be seen in the  Bill  before  us,
there has been  relatively  no  discord  between  the  various  governmental
components over the gradual development of these arrangements. And  I,  each
year at this particular time, phone the KZN MEC for Finance  for  his  views
on the current Bill and each year, in the main,  he  expresses  satisfaction
with the collegiate and fair way in which the Bill has been produced.

Moving from process to substance, the content and the structure of the  Bill
has become increasingly well-considered  and  businesslike,  leaving  little
room for intergovernmental misunderstandings in its implementation.

I have, however, in recent years, wondered about the growing  scope  of  the
Bill and its development beyond the purpose expressed in section  214(1)  of
the Constitution  and  even  perhaps  beyond  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Relations Act of 1997, especially as to the detail of the processes  of  how
moneys are transferred and spent  at  the  lower  levels,  as  well  as  the
responsibility and accountability arrangements in this regard.
However, one is very pleased that  there  has  been  no  challenge  to  this
extended scope put in the Bill as  circumstances  at  provincial  and  local
government level, for now any way, make this scope very necessary.

Further to this wider role of the Bill, I would like to  acknowledge  a  few
specific developments: I think the Bill, as  an  instrument  of  policy  co-
ordination across Government, has taken on a very useful position  like  the
emerging prominence of municipal financial considerations;  the  elimination
of unfunded mandates; the improved formula-based and project or  conditional
grant proportion and the way these have come to increasingly recognise  real
socioeconomic conditions as they exist  on  the  ground;  the  extension  of
financial management  considerations  and,  in  particular  this  year,  the
introduction of value-for-money requirements. These are all very useful  and
welcome developments.

We want  to  acknowledge  the  strong  and  effective  leadership  that  the
National Treasury has demonstrated, both from the technical perspective  and
the facilitation of subnational Government participation in  the  production
of this Bill. We support the Bill.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, the New NP will support the  Bill  providing
for the  revenue  payment  payable  to  the  various  provincial  and  local
governments. The provinces and municipalities are going to  play  a  crucial
role in the execution of the Extended Public Works Programme  aimed  at  the
empowerment of the unemployed.

This will only  be  the  start  of  a  process  to  permanently  reduce  the
unacceptably high unemployment rate in South  Africa,  so  crucial  for  the
survival of our young democracy. Billions of rands will  be  at  stake.  The
Constitution  of  South  Africa  requires  that  factors  such  as  national
interest, developmental needs, economic disparities and the fiscal  capacity
and efficiency of the second and third tiers of government in  South  Africa
be taken into account before payments to the provinces can be enacted.

The media  reports  continued  negligence  and  financial  mismanagement  by
provinces such as the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.  Fingers  are  pointed
at certain councillors for self-enrichment to the detriment of the poor.  An
example is the Kannaland Municipality in the Western  Cape  reported  on  in
this morning's papers. Poor service delivery is still the order of  the  day
in many municipalities. We cannot allow this to continue. After 10 years  in
Government, inexperience is no excuse anymore.
The question is, has any action been  taken  against  any  province  or  any
municipality on the grounds  of  financial  mismanagement,  inefficiency  or
corruption and fraud?  Will  the  Minister  today  undertake  to  enact  the
Constitution against people who, through greed  and  dishonesty,  in  future
maliciously undermine the outcome of job creation  programmes  such  as  the
Extended Public Works Programme? We will have to improve on delivery to  the
people. Thank you. [Interjections.]

Mr F C FANKOMO: Madam Speaker, hon members, the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill
for  the  year  2004  provides  for  the  equitable  division   of   revenue
anticipated to be raised  nationally  among  the  national,  provincial  and
local governments and therefore promotes  co-operative  governance  and  the
principles  of  intergovernmental  relations  on  budgetary  matters  as  is
required  by  the  Constitution.   This   Bill   promotes   a   culture   of
predictability and certainty in respect of all allocations to provinces  and
municipalities.

This allows these  governments  to  plan  their  budgets  over  a  multiyear
period. It promotes transparency, equity and accountability for the  use  of
public resources by  ensuring  that  all  transfers  are  reflected  in  the
budgets of benefiting provinces and municipalities. These  are  the  drastic
major policy changes that have taken  place  since  1999,  when  the  Public
Finance Management Act was promulgated.

Interestingly, the Bill correctly fits in with the  policy  of  the  ANC  of
providing a better life for all  by  way  of  the  national  and  provincial
governments' transference of assets to municipalities. This goes  well  with
the  principle  of  co-operative  governance,  which  is  a   constitutional
requirement. For this purpose the ANC promises in its manifesto to create  1
million jobs for the poor over the coming five years through a public  works
programme.

During these years people will be trained to ensure self-sustainability,  as
opposed to dependency on Government social grants. Government will  continue
in its fight to roll back the frontiers of poverty and create a better  life
for all people.

In addition to this there is a serious challenge posed by unemployment.  The
ANC-led  Government  will   strive   to   create   job   opportunities   via
infrastructure  projects,  environmental  programmes,  community-based  care
programmes and small business/co-operative development.

In the fight against poverty the local government share increases  over  the
next three years by more than R3 billion  over  the  baseline  for  2004-05,
with an increase of 6%, beginning with  R1  billion  for  2004-05  and  R1,3
billion for 2005-06. There are  additional  allocations,  giving  effect  to
Government's commitment to fighting poverty and creating job  opportunities.
These  include  the  provision  of   free   basic   service   infrastructure
development and institution building.

Local government's share grew from R12,4 billion during the course  of  last
year to R14 billion during the course of  this  year.  Thus  the  allocation
will grow  to  R17  billion  by  the  end  of  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework in 2006-07. For the  current  fiscal  year  of  2004-05,  a  total
amount of R12,3 billion will be  transferred  to  local  government  by  the
national Government. This is subdivided  into  R7,3  billion  for  equitable
shares and related matters, R4,1 billion for infrastructure and  R9  million
for current transfers.

In accordance with section 214 of the Constitution the  national  Government
must unconditionally allocate equitable shares to local government. This  is
growing in significance relative to the conditional grants.  Over  the  past
eight years the equitable share to local government grew from  R1,5  billion
to R9,4 billion, from 1996 to 2004, and rising  over  the  MTEF  period  for
2004-07. The growth is six times more than the 1995 grant.

This  is  as  a  result  of  the  progress  made  in  the  consolidation  of
infrastructure grants at municipal  level.  However,  as  a  result  of  the
seriousness of the ANC during the current MTEF period, an  amount  of  R12,3
billion has been apportioned for the combating  of  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic.
This  shows  that  the  ANC  takes  into  consideration  the  concerns   and
contributions of the country's citizens.

Over the past eight years the ANC and its Government have been  striving  to
improve systems for the purpose of good governance in all three  spheres  of
government.  Therefore  the  current  capacity-building  and   restructuring
grants are  allocated  at  R2,2  billion  over  the  next  MTEF  period  for
municipalities.

With regard to the actual concern and dedication of the  ANC,  the  poverty-
stricken provinces received a large stake  of  the  national  share,  unlike
rich provinces. For example, Limpopo, the  Eastern  Cape  and  KwaZulu-Natal
received more than 56% of the cake from the  national  Government.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Deputy Speaker, the ACDP can comfortably align itself  with  the
objectives intended by the Division of Revenue Bill.  Considering  the  vast
amounts of money transferred to provinces and local government through  this
division, notice must be taken of the concerns raised by the  department  in
terms of oversight and management.

The complex dynamics driven by this Division of  Revenue  Bill  between  the
tiers of government puts tremendous pressure on any effort to  establish  an
audit trail to ensure that the money is spent on what it was  intended  for.
Through a network of Acts the Bill  tries  to  define  responsibilities  and
control mechanisms to try to establish such a path. It also  indicates  what
amounts of moneys are allocated for what purposes.

Various reports by the  Auditor-General,  however,  indicate  qualifications
and, in many cases, the impossibility of being able to report  at  all.  The
lack of capacity, the  nonexistence  of  recognised  financial  systems  and
procedures and the wrong appropriation of funds  are  some  of  the  reasons
given.

The  Constitution  determines  the   distribution   of   funds.   This,   by
implication, enforces the establishment of  the  necessary  capacity.  Funds
are dedicated for capacity-building, but progress is  not  satisfactory.  It
is suggested that the Department of Finance  keep  back  a  portion  of  the
equitable share. This can then be used to strengthen the team  in  order  to
evaluate   the   individual   receiving   provinces,   municipalities    and
institutions in terms of their capacities and affordability of compliance.

Where necessary,  assistance  should  be  given  in  the  implementation  of
systems, as well as dedicated training. If administration support should  be
contracted in to ensure financial control on a  more  affordable  basis,  it
should also be considered. One does not want to infringe on the autonomy  of
governing bodies, but the responsibility of  ensuring  responsible  spending
of revenue must  also  be  accepted  by  the  collecting  agent.  The  ACDP,
however, will support the Division of Revenue Bill.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, the  UDM  welcomes  the
increasing share of national revenue that is being awarded to provinces  and
municipalities. The proportional division among provinces also reflects  the
greater needs of provinces with large populations of poor people.

The infrastructure development allocations for provinces and  municipalities
are similarly welcome. However, these welcome provisions do not  necessarily
translate into delivery on the ground. In far  too  many  cases,  especially
where it affects mostly poor people, there has  been  an  unacceptably  high
incidence  of  roll-overs  and   underspending.   Lack   of   capacity   and
mismanagement remain problems  that  undermine  the  equitable  division  of
revenue.

The UDM would have liked to see more  direct  involvement  by  the  national
sphere of government in, for instance, infrastructure delivery.  This  would
help to ensure that budgets are transformed into delivery at  a  better  and
more responsible pace. Such an approach would also create  opportunities  to
directly enhance and promote capacity at provincial and  local  levels.  The
UDM supports the Bill. I thank you.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, the NA supports the  amounts  reflected  in
the Division of Revenue Bill, especially the  new  provisions  for  HIV/Aids
grants and the amount of R1,7Â billion for  the  Public  Works  Programme  to
local governments.

Dis een ding om geld beskikbaar te stel; dis maklik. Die  vraag  is  of  die
administratiewe  en  rekenkundige  kapasiteit  daar  is  om   hierdie   geld
effektief aan te wend. Daarom steun die NA  die  bepalings  in  Deel  6  van
hierdie wetsontwerp, wat vereistes stel aan plaaslike  owerhede,  by  gebrek
waarvan toegekende fondse teruggehou of selfs weerhou kan  word.  Ook  steun
ons veral artikel 26, waarvolgens  'n  stelsel  van  voogmunisipaliteite  in
werking  gestel  word  om  munisipaliteite  by  te  staan   wat   oor   swak
administratiewe kapasiteit beskik.

Die vraag wat die NA aan die  Minister  wil  stel,  is  dit:  Indien  sekere
munisipaliteite nie oor die kapasiteit, kundigheid en  toewyding  beskik  om
fondse wat van die nasionale fiskus kom verantwoordelik  aan  te  wend  nie,
geld dit nie ook hul bevoegdheid om belastings  verantwoordelik  te  hef  en
aan te wend nie? Te  veel  munisipaliteite  gebruik  gewoon  die  roete  van
verhoogde eiendomsbelasting om selfgemaakte tekorte aan te vul.

Die vraag is of die belastingbetaler  nie  ook  dieselfde  reg  het  as  die
Minister om geld terug te hou  indien  dit  swak  aangewend  word  nie.  Die
kontrolestelsel  oor  die  onbevoegde  munisipaliteite   ten   opsigte   van
belastinggeld moet dringend opgeskerp word. Die NA steun die  wetgewing  oor
die verdeling van inkomste. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[It is one thing to make money available; that  is  easy.  The  question  is
whether  the  administrative  and  accounting  capacity  is  there  for  the
effective  utilisation  of  this  money.  Therefore  the  DA  supports   the
provisions  in  Part  6  of  this  Bill,  which  set  conditions  for  local
authorities, failing which allocated funds are held back or  even  withheld.
We also support especially section 26, in accordance with which a system  of
guardian municipalities are implemented to assist municipalities which  have
a poor administrative capacity.

The question which the NA wants to ask the  Minister  is  this:  If  certain
municipalities do not have the capacity, competence or  dedication  to  make
responsible use of funds coming from the national Treasury, would  that  not
apply to their ability to levy and utilise taxes a responsible way as  well?
Too many municipalities simply take  the  route  of  increased  taxation  to
supplement deficits they themselves have created.

The question is whether the taxpayer does not also have the  same  right  as
the Minister to hold back money if  it  is  used  irresponsibly.  The  check
system over the incompetent municipalities in respect of tax  payments  must
be urgently improved. The NA supports the legislation  on  the  distribution
of income. I thank you.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Hon Deputy Speaker, I have been wanting to say something  and
now I have the opportunity to do so. Hon Minister of Finance,  I  think  you
would like this. One Manuel is good, but two  Manuels  would  be  infinitely
better. Basically, what I am saying is that all processes have a  front  end
and a back end.

Now, at the front end we have a Trevor  Manuel  who,  by  all  accounts,  is
extremely good at his work.  He  is  a  great  visionary  and  an  extremely
competent Minister of Finance; and, so long as we  have  him  at  the  helm,
this country can be assured that we will make  great  progress.  [Applause.]
But now that is the story of the one Manuel, the Trevor Manuel.

Now, I have said this previously and I have every reason to repeat  that  we
have total confidence in this Minister of Finance. Now we come to the  story
of the second Manuel. The second Manuel would be an appendix  no  8  to  the
Division of Revenue Bill, because all of us in this House have spoken  about
the  important  need  for  oversight.  But  without  a  formal  document  of
oversight that sets out in detail what needs to be done by  whom,  when  and
where, we are merely exercising a wish, rather than putting a  programme  in
front of us which determines how this House and all  of  us  as  members  of
Parliament would give value to this great Minister of  Finance  by  ensuring
that that which he does so well at the beginning continues  to  happen  well
at all levels, because we have continued to exercise oversight.

So my plea is that we should have two Manuels and, with that, I  have  great
happiness  in  supporting  the  Division  of  Revenue   Bill.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the  South
African economy can be divided into a well-developed component  with  access
to credit security for individuals that participate in this  economy.  These
individuals also have a fair, acquired level of skill. The  other  component
of the economy experience a high degree of unemployment, relatively low  job
security and limited access to credit. Individuals from this component  also
suffer from unemployment. We also  found  that  they  very  much  depend  on
Government grants and social networks for their income.

It is  estimated  that  only  4  million  South  Africans  pay  taxes.  This
particular tax gap is of great concern. It is roughly estimated that two  to
three  million  South  Africans  do  not  pay   taxes.   This   is   clearly
unacceptable. It is also well known that jobs come at  a  massive  cost.  In
the Budget the hon Minister outlined the forthcoming Public Works  Programme
that seeks to provide employment to one million  people  in  the  next  five
years. It is of crucial importance that this  programme  be  implemented  in
order to alleviate the unacceptable rate of unemployment,  which  stands  at
31%.

During hearings regarding the Budget, an official  of  Sars  mentioned  that
tax documentation will  be  simplified.  In  a  submission  to  the  finance
committee this morning, a well-known tax lawyer said that our tax system  is
so complex that, and I use his exact  words,  ``compliance  is  hindered  by
complexity''.
Die  belastinggaping   kan   verminder   word   indien   dokumentasie   meer
verbruikersvriendelik word. Belastingontduiking strek niemand  tot  voordeel
nie. Armoede is 'n verskynsel wat die hele  wese  van  die  sosio-ekonomiese
orde in Suid-Afrika bedreig. In wese beteken  die  wetsontwerp  dat  toelaes
van die fiskus na drie regeringsfere, naamlik die nasionale, provinsiale  en
plaaslike regeringsvlak afgewentel word.

Insette  en  uitsette  moet  gemoniteer  word  rakende  die  kwaliteit   van
dienslewering. My eerlike mening is dat die proses  van  die  toewysing  van
toelaes streng op behoefte geskoei moet word en dat  veel  meer  gedoen  kan
word om  die  kwaliteit  van  dienslewering  op  voetsoolvlak  te  verbeter.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The tax gap can be reduced  if  documentation  could  be  made  more  user-
friendly. Tax evasion does not benefit anyone. Poverty is a phenomenon  that
is threatening the very fibre of the socioeconomic order  in  South  Africa.
In essence the Bill means that grants will be passed on  by  the  fiscus  to
the three government spheres, namely  the  national,  provincial  and  local
government level.

Inputs and outputs must be monitored in regards to the  quality  of  service
delivery. My honest opinion is that the process of the allocation of  grants
must be based strongly on need and that much more should be done to  improve
the quality of service delivery at grass-roots level.]

The state will not be able to provide adequately for  the  aged  in  future.
Retirement tax, according to Professor Matthew Lester,  took  more  than  R6
billion from the pockets of individual members of retirement funds over  the
past tax year. Hon Minister, I will not be able to speak on Friday and  that
is why I am referring to this now.

In your submission  to  the  finance  committee,  you  stated  that  tax  on
retirement  funds  is  an  extremely   complex   issue   with   far-reaching
implications. The age profile of the elderly is rising. The interest  income
of many has declined, coupled with rising medical  and  other  expenses.  An
urgent appeal is made to set a deadline of  12  months  for  the  task  team
assigned to investigate the taxes on retirement funds. I thank you.

Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister  Manuel,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers and hon members, the African writer and  poet,  Ben  Okri,  wisely
cautions us when he says, and I quote:


  To poison a nation,  poison  its  stories.  A  demoralised  nation  tells
  demoralised stories to itself. Beware of storytellers who are  not  fully
  conscious of the importance of their gifts, and who are irresponsible  in
  their application of their art: they could  unwittingly  help  along  the
  psychic destruction of their people.

As we celebrate the first decade of freedom and democracy, the  overwhelming
majority of our people who  had  known  nothing  but  despair,  deprivation,
exploitation and humiliation since  time  immemorial,  know  that  yesterday
they had nothing to  hope  and  live  for.  Today  things  are  better,  but
tomorrow things will be even better.

The Division of Revenue Bill, which I rise to support on behalf of the  ANC,
confirms that contrary to what doomsayers are saying, our first 10 years  of
freedom have indeed been 10 years of increasingly making  resources  in  the
hands of the state available to uplift  disadvantaged  South  Africa.  These
have been 10 years of expanding opportunities to build  a  better  life  for
all.

Throughout the years, the ANC led with the slogan, ``Power to the  people''.
It waged a determined political and ideological  struggle  to  ensure  that,
both in theory and in practice, this was not misinterpreted  and  vulgarised
to  mean  power  to  the  ANC.  This  position,  grounded  on  a  particular
understanding of the task of the democratic movement,  continues  to  inform
the perspectives of the ANC on the nature of the democratic state. The  most
important, current defining feature of the South African  democratic  state,
led by the ANC, is that it champions the aspirations  of  the  majority  who
have been disadvantaged by the many decades of undemocratic rule.
Our primary task as the ANC is to work for the  emancipation  of  the  black
majority, the working people, the urban poor, the rural poor,  women,  youth
and the disabled. The task of our democratic state is to champion the  cause
of our people in such a way that these basic aspirations  of  this  majority
assume a state of hegemony which informs and guides policy and  practice  of
all institutions of Government and state.

Together as a people, we have made great strides  in  the  first  decade  of
freedom and democracy. Despite the challenges that we face,  the  future  is
brightening daily, giving us new possibilities.  Indeed,  yesterday  we  had
nothing to hope or live for, but  today  things  are  better,  and  tomorrow
things will be even better. We have created  the  possibility  of  releasing
more resources for social and economic services while building a modern  and
competitive economy. Learning from our experiences in the  first  decade  of
democracy, we can do better in the second decade.

In  your  Budget  Speech,  hon  Minister,  you  correctly   identified   key
challenges facing all delivery programmes to address  the  problems  of  the
second economy, income poverty, unemployment and social  exclusion.  As  the
ANC, we are satisfied that the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  and  the
expansion of the  social  net  by  extending  the  child  support  grant  to
children up to the age of 14  years,  skills  development  and  agricultural
support redistribution programmes and various other policy  initiatives  and
interventions will benefit, albeit in  the  short  and  medium  term,  those
people who are trapped in the second economy.

We call  on  all  our  people  to  take  advantage  of  these  measures  and
opportunities. The announcement of the Expanded Public works Programme  ties
in well with earlier  proposals  by  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission
during the 2003 MTBPS hearing and  a  recommendation  by  the  Joint  Budget
Committee  that  capital  grants  be  designed  to   progressively   address
infrastructure backlogs.

Se setla thusa go isa ditirelo kwa bathong ba rona le go lwantsha  tlala  le
lehuma tse di aparetseng bontsi ba batho ba  rona  ba  ba  tlhokang  ditiro.
[This will help by taking services to the people and to fight poverty  which
has engulfed many unemployed people.]

Our goal as the ANC is to create a South Africa in which all can  experience
an improving quality of life, enjoy equal human rights, with access  to  the
opportunities that freedom has brought us, bound together  as  a  nation  by
our humanity.
As the ANC, we have confidence in our future and call on all our  people  to
join in a people's contract to create work and fight poverty. As we  welcome
the  comprehensive  review  of  the  fiscal  framework  of   provinces   and
municipalities,  we  also  note   that   Government   has   considered   all
recommendations of the FFC and has either responded favourably  to  them  or
has taken them into account in investigating options to  address  challenges
and concerns raised. We appreciate the  crucial  role  that  the  commission
plays in shaping the determination of equitable shares  to  all  spheres  of
government and take their input and proposals seriously.

We  are  also  satisfied  that  in   order   to   monitor   compliance   and
implementation, provinces and local governments  will  now  be  required  to
report on  the  contribution  of  their  equitable  share  towards  economic
growth,  employment  generation,  small  business  development   and   black
economic empowerment; and have this information published on their  websites
for public scrutiny. The  inclusion  of  development  indicators  will  also
assist in the evaluation of the efficacy of  the  nodal  funding  to  ensure
that development objectives are realised and benefit our people.

In conclusion, I wish to remind the  DA  and  its  reactionary  self-serving
alliance, that no amount of negative rhetoric is ever going to convince  the
masses of our people that they are a demoralised  nation.  As  the  ANC,  we
have confidence in our future and in the masses of our  people.  We  believe
that, learning from our experience, we can do more, better.

I wish to reiterate that we South Africans are  not  a  demoralised  nation.
Together we can and will do more, better, because yesterday we  had  nothing
to hope or live for. Today things are better, but tomorrow  things  will  be
even better. Forward to  a  people's  contract  to  create  work  and  fight
poverty! Power to the people!

Ke a leboga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would like to  express
appreciation to all the parties  for  supporting  the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill, 2004. Just one or two issues to clarify for the hon Aucamp.

Is jy by, Cassie? [Are you with us, Cassie?]

Mr C AUCAMP: Ek luister nou. [I am listening now.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: O, dankie. [Oh, thank you.]
They raises issues about local authorities. Now the  law  is  the  law.  You
can't withhold rates and taxes  from  local  authorities.  The  issue  about
capacity is that it must be built; and the whole idea of  local  authorities
and the entire structure of the Municipal  Systems  Act  and  the  Municipal
Structures Act is, in fact, that councillors be  directly  accountable.  And
unless we deal with those issues and hold councillors accountable,  we  will
fail in that mission. Democracy will be one sphere short. And so  in  trying
to understand this issue - I speak on behalf of the Minister for  Provincial
and Local Government - it is very important that we ensure that we can  hold
local authorities accountable.

I think the same applies to the issues that the hon  Odendaal  raised  about
the Expanded Public Works Programme. Some work will be done there, and  some
in the provinces, but it  is  very  important  that  we  are  able  to  have
measurable objectives. And our entire system has now evolved  to  the  point
where, in the estimates of national expenditure or the 131 pages  which  hon
members received last week, there are measurable objectives.

I accept that the hon Rabie has taken a bit of a detour,  because  he  can't
participate in the debates on Friday, but we must watch  these  lawyers  who
talk their own book. We must not convert what  they  say  into  indisputable
fact.

You know, there was one gentleman who addressed the committee this  morning.
He had a figure, and he published the figure. He  was  confident  enough  to
publish the figure on amnesties last week. And I  was  very  surprised.  How
does he arrive at a figure like that? What kind of abacus does  he  use?  Is
it the same one used by opposition parties as they arrive at numbers? It  is
a curious thing, but it doesn't make it fact  because  he  said  it.  So  my
pleading is just, Doctor, you are older than 12 now. You  must  be  able  to
see through what this gentleman was saying this morning. He is  talking  his
own book. Thank you very much for supporting the Division of  Revenue  Bill,
2004. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That concludes the debate. Are there any  objections  to
the Bill being read a second time? No objections. Agreed to.  The  secretary
will read the Bill a second time.

Bill read a second time.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Bill will be referred to  the  National  Council  of
Provinces for concurrence. The secretary will read the second Order  of  the
day.

                DROUGHT RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr E (Cassim) SALOOJEE: Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to digress  a  little
in  order  to  illustrate  the  social  context  within  which  the  ANC-led
Government seeks to introduce the Drought Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill.

It is important to know where we come from, before we can really know  where
we are heading. There are those in our country  today  who,  for  their  own
reasons, want to forget where we come from; those who want to deny the  fact
that our  country  is  still  suffering  as  a  result  of  the  scourge  of
apartheid; those who want to tell our  people  that  they  were  better  off
under the previous  regime  and  that  the  strides  taken  by  the  ANC-led
Government in the past 10 years have done nothing to improve  the  lives  of
our people.

Surely South Africa demands better than these doomsayers who  want  to  take
us back to a time when the majority of our people  lived  in  conditions  of
oppression and fear. To these people we want to say it that will take a  lot
longer than 10 years to erase from memory centuries of deprivation  and  the
dehumanising  treatment  meted  out  to  the   majority   of   our   people.
[Interjections.] However, this ANC-led  Government  is  committed  to  doing
just that, and the past decade can bear testimony to our efforts.

There were both resounding successes and some  failures,  and  we  say  that
frankly.  Through  good  planning  and  hard   work   our   successes   have
consistently outweighed our failures, and  where  we  have  failed  we  have
learned from such mistakes. Our people know where we  are,  that  we  are  a
caring Government which takes care of all South Africans, not just a  chosen
few.

Despite our ongoing efforts, it is an unfortunate truth that many people  in
our country continue to live in conditions of extreme  poverty,  hunger  and
malnutrition. The ANC-led Government, which  is  committed  to  turning  the
situation around, has put in place many programmes to fulfil this goal.

In order to  further  address  this  problem  our  Government  launched  the
Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Strategy and  Programme  during  July
2002. A very successful part of the Integrated Food Security  and  Nutrition
Strategy and Programme  is  a  food  emergency  scheme  which  is  aimed  at
significantly reducing hunger, malnutrition and  food  insecurity  by  2005.
The  food  emergency  scheme  also  aims  to  develop   comprehensive   food
production and trade schemes through  the  establishment  of  household  and
communal food gardens, and ensuring that the poorest families have  food  on
the table.

Communities, therefore, empower themselves by  developing  skills  necessary
to  maintain  such  communal  gardens  and  by  contributing  to  their  own
sustenance. The food emergency scheme targets families  with  little  or  no
income, children, orphans, child-headed households and  people  living  with
HIV/Aids, and has assisted over a million  of  the  most  vulnerable  people
since its inception.

The Minister of Social Development announced recently that about 300 000  of
the poorest households have thus far been  provided  with  food  parcels  as
part of the scheme. This has had a significant impact on ensuring  that  the
most vulnerable and poor in our country have some sort of food security.

Another important part of the food emergency scheme has  been  that,  whilst
beneficiaries have  been  receiving  these  food  parcels,  they  have  been
registered  for  social  grants.  Significant  numbers  of  the  people  who
benefited from the distribution of food parcels need not rely on  this  form
of assistance if they receive the social grants to which they are  entitled.
Many of these beneficiaries are also participating  in  sustainable  poverty
relief and income-generating  programmes,  which  allows  them  to  move  to
positions where they become more self-reliant.

We want our people to move out  of  what  President  Mbeki  has  called  the
``Second Economy',' where they are continually reliant on informal jobs  and
social assistance in order to survive, to situations where they  can  become
full participants in our economy.

The Portfolio Committee on Social Development has had first-hand  experience
of the many successes of our Government's antipoverty programmes during  our
various oversight visits and in our constituencies. However,  we  have  also
seen that much more can be done to improve the lives of our people.

Despite the undeniable success of the food  emergency  scheme,  we  are  all
aware that our country is currently in  a  situation  where  as  many  as  4
million South Africans are still at risk of  food  shortages  owing  to  the
drought. Our Government has put  in  place  a  co-ordinated  and  integrated
drought-mitigation plan, which aims to reduce the impact of the  drought  by
providing emergency relief to vulnerable  rural  communities;  by  providing
fodder and water to both communal and commercial farmers; and  by  providing
water for human  consumption  and  preventing  communicable  diseases,  with
special emphasis on malaria and cholera.

Madam Deputy Speaker and hon  members,  the  Minister  of  Finance  recently
introduced the Drought Relief Adjustments Appropriation Bill, which aims  to
make funds available to provide for  further  drought  relief  to  the  most
vulnerable in our country.

The Department of Social Development has been entrusted with the  allocation
of a further R60m  in  order  to  fund  emergency  relief  among  vulnerable
communities affected by the drought. The department has decided to give  our
people a one-off cash  payment  instead  of  food  parcels,  which  will  be
distributed with the aid of traditional leaders,  faith-based  organisations
and other NGOs.

It is important that communities assist the Government in ensuring that  the
right people benefit from this assistance. We ask  our  people  to  remember
that it is only through partnership in the people's  contract  that  we  can
fight all forms of poverty. Our Government intends to pay  those  households
which are hardest hit by the drought a one-off  cash  payment  of  at  least
R900 for survival. The benefit will be available in certain parts  of  those
areas which our President has declared disaster areas.

This benefit will  go  to  significant  numbers  of  people  who  depend  on
farming, and will provide immediate  relief  instead  of  food  parcels  and
fertiliser packs, which may take a long time to reach our  people.  The  aim
of this programme is to make sure that our people have the  immediate  tools
to provide food during this time of  drought.  Fertiliser  packs  and  other
measures do not provide an immediate solution to those people who need  food
today.
The following people  will  be  entitled  to  apply  for  emergency  drought
relief: vulnerable individuals as well  as  households  of  poverty-stricken
families who are destitute as a result of the drought in  certain  districts
of the affected provinces; those who live in such areas and who have no,  or
limited, employment and/or income-generating opportunities; farmworkers  who
have been laid off work due to the persistent drought;  persons  in  farming
communities whose livelihoods have been severely affected  by  the  drought;
and persons in households who rely directly or indirectly on  farming.  This
programme is  another  example  of  the  inclusive  approach  taken  by  our
Government.

We are committed to ensuring that all South Africans who are suffering as  a
result of this drought benefit from this emergency relief. We  will  provide
the same relief to all eligible people, according to the same criteria;  not
more benefits to some than to others, based  on  arbitrary  and  meaningless
distinctions. We all know the consequences  of  such  a  practice.  We  know
where we come from, unlike some members on this side of the House.

Of course, there is a very real concern that people could use the money  for
alcohol and  other  nonessential  items.  Our  Government  is  committed  to
providing relief to our people in this time, but  we  appeal  to  people  to
remember that this is a once-off payment meant to provide immediate  relief,
and we asks them to use the money responsibly. The people's contract ask  us
to work together to fight poverty and corruption.

The people's contract will not be as successful as it could  be  if  one  or
both parties do not fulfil the ends of the bargain.  This  bargain  in  this
instance is that the ANC-led Government is giving our  people  money  during
their time of need, and we ask the people to buy food  and  other  necessary
items. The purpose of  this  form  of  assistance  is  to  ensure  that  our
Government provides crucial humanitarian relief to people affected in  order
to reduce the serious impact of this drought.

The ANC support this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Praat! [Speak!]

Mnr A  J  BOTHA:  Wag  maar  net  so  bietjie  tot  my  tyd  reg  is,  hoor.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Agb Adjunkspeaker, ek verneem dat die agb Hanekom,  gewese
Minister vir Landbou en Grondsake, waarsku dat die Parlement nie  te  maklik
bystand moet verleen aan boere nie, want hulle kan dan moontlik bederf  word
en afhanklik raak van dergelike hulp in die toekoms.  Nou  terwyl  mens  met
die agb Hanekom moet saamstem dat dÃ­t moontlik  is,  is  dit  verbasend  dat
ander mense - ander dele van die bevolking - nie  aan  dieselfde  versoeking
blootgestel word nie, en mens wonder hoekom die landbou uitgesonder word.

Die ANC glo hoeka dat boere bedorwe, vet  hanslammers  is  wat  geleer  moet
word hoe om aan die agterspeen te suip. In diÃ© verband moet ek  sÃª  die  ANC
is nogal doeltreffend, soos die ondervinding die  afgelope  10  jaar  geleer
het, Ã©n soos wat hul planne met grondbelasting en onteiening nou vir ons  'n
voorskou gee. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dis baie  waar,  my  vriend;  jy  moet  maar
bietjie lees wat julle doen.

Die DA verwelkom die bykomende geld wat moet help om 'n  landbouramp  af  te
weer, en ons sal dus niks doen om hierdie fondse in gevaar  te  stel  of  te
vertraag nie, want dÃ­t kan op sy beurt net bydra tot die ramp, soos wat  die
twee-en-'n-half-jaar vertraging met die hantering van die  koueramp  in  die
Drakensberge  en   die   Maluti-hooglande   alreeds   menselewens   tragies,
onnodiglik en skandelik verwoes het. Daardie mense kry  nou  net  een  kwart
van hul skade twee-en-'n-half jaar te laat, maar  netjies  in  tyd  vir  die
komende verkiesing.

Vir ramphulp om doelgerig en van waarde te wees, moet dit  sinvol  en  tydig
aangewend word, dÃ¡Ã¡r waar dit 'n verskil kan maak. In hierdie opsig het  die
ANC-regering tragies nog niks geleer nie. Die hulppakket aan  veeboere  word
byvoorbeeld beperk tot net 30 grootvee. 'n KommersiÃ«le boer  -  dit  is  nou
een wat boer vir die  mark  sodat  al  diÃ©  lede  wat  vandag  hier  in  die
Parlement sit, vleis op die tafel kan hÃª wanneer hulle gaan aansit  vir  ete
- kan nie 'n bestaan maak met 30 grootvee nie;  dis  bykans  onmoontlik.  'n
Paar honderd is nodig vir diÃ© boer om selfstandig  te  raak  en  homself  in
staat te stel om droogtes en ander  rampe  te  oorleef  wanneer  hulle  kom.
KommersiÃ«le veeboere is dus vir alle  praktiese  doeleindes  uitgesluit  van
hierdie hulp. Agb Adjunkspeaker, Suid-Afrika  verdien  definitief  beter  as
dÃ­t.

Verantwoordelike  regerings  stel  tereg  belang  in  die  ontwikkeling  van
besproeiing en die bou van damme en besproeiingskemas om  te  help  met  die
daarstel van voedselsekuriteit vir die land. Wanneer so 'n dam, soos bv  die
Allemanskraaldam in die middel van die Vrystaat, begin opdroog  -  soos  wat
nÃ³Ãº die geval is - en Minister Kasrils die besproeiingswater  summier  afsny
in  die  middel  van  die  seisoen,  dan  is  dit  'n  ramp,  want   daardie
nedersetters   se   gesaaides,    wat    heeltemal    afhanklik    is    van
besproeiingswater, gaan tot niet op die land. Ook  vir  hierdie  kommersiÃ«le
boere word geen ramphulp beplan nie, Minister.

'n Mens kan dus verstaan met hoeveel vreugde en dankbaarheid  hierdie  boere
verneem het dat die  Departement  van  Maatskaplike  Ontwikkeling  wel  hulp
aanbied vir hul werknemers  wat  vanselfsprekend  nou  die  gevaar  loop  om
werkloos te raak.

U kan uself dus indink met watter skok hierdie mense toe  moes  verneem  dat
dit hoegenaamd nie die plan is nie. Nee, dit is nie net vir die werkers  wat
die gevaar loop om hul werk te verloor as gevolg van  die  droogte  waarvoor
diÃ© hulp aangebied  word  nie,  maar  alle  plaaswerkers  in  alle  droogte-
verklaarde distrikte word ywerig aangemoedig om aansoek te doen om R900  elk
vir droogte-ramphulp, Ã²f hulle nou hoegenaamd ly onder die droogte Ã²f nie.

Die agb lede moet nou baie mooi verstaan, hierdie Regering wat hier  sit  sÃª
vir mense wat voltyds in diens is, Ã©n  wat  'n  volle  salaris  ontvang  dat
hulle moet kom sodat die Regering vir hulle 'n pasella kan gee net vÃ³Ã³r  die
verkiesing. Mens wonder wat die ander mense wat hier buite op die vlakte  en
in ander townships bly, wat nie werk het nie en nie  'n  inkomste  het  nie,
dink van diÃ© plannetjie waaroor jy  so  lekker  daarso  skrou.  Gaan  vertel
hulle van diÃ© plan; praat die waarheid.

Hierdie ANC-lede wat hier sit, en hul Nuwe NP-bondgenote,  moenie  sÃª  hulle
weet nie van hierdie ongerymdhede nie, want ons het hulle, by name -  en  by
name, adjunkminister Du  Toit  -  net  12  dae  gelede  ingelig  hieroor  en
uitgedaag om dit stop te sit. Hy en al die ANC-lede en  hul  bondgenote  wat
hier sit, bly egter tjoepstil soos muise. En  hoekom  bly  hulle  tjoepstil?
Dit is dan juis hul plan om ander mense se geld sÃ³ te misbruik tot  hul  eie
voordeel, en as dit nie so is nie, praat daarteen en  sÃª  vir  ons  wat  die
waarheid is. Suid-Afrika verdien beter as dÃ­t.

Is dÃ­t die kontrak? Kom sÃª jy vir ons, is dÃ­t die kontrak  waarvan  die  ANC
en julle praat, wat julle met die mense wil sluit? Is die  gedagte  dat  diÃ©
geld soos manna uit die PresidensiÃ«le vliegtuig afgegooi gaan word  vir  die
mense om dit te ontvang sodat hulle kan glo dat hulle  daarom  vir  die  ANC
moet gaan stem, Ã©n vir julle, by name, deur vir die ANC te stem? Ek het  vir
julle nuus, en dit is dat baie minder mense diÃ© kontrak by die stembus  gaan
teken as wat die ANC dink. Die rede  hiervoor  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Julle
kan maar wag, die dag kom nader. Die rede hiervoor is baie eenvoudig:  hulle
is moeg van leÃ« beloftes, hulle is moeg van  ANC-bogstories  wat  vir  hulle
vertel hoe lekker hulle lewe, want hulle lewe nie lekker nie, Meneer;  hulle
sit en krepeer daar op die kant, hulle krepeer dÃ¡Ã¡r  in  Soweto  waar  hulle
moet kyk na 'n ``billboard'', so groot soos die Arabella-hotel hieronder  by
die Waterkant, waarop jou leier se gesig pryk Ã  la Saddam Hoessein,  en  dan
wonder hulle: ``Waar kom die geld vir daardie ding vandaan?'', terwyl  julle
nie geld vir hulle het nie, maar geld het om vir mense te gee om  vir  julle
te stem. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die mense gaan nie diÃ© kontrak onderteken  nie,  want  hulle  weet  dat  diÃ©
pasellas gesteelde geld is. Dit is gesteelde geld, Meneer, en as dit  anders
is, verduidelik vandag vir ons hier hoekom dit anders is. Dit  is  gesteelde
geld in die eerste  plek,  want  die  geld  van  die  belastingbetaler  word
wanaangewend. Dit is gesteel in die tweede plek, want dit  word  gesteel  by
die werklike hulpbehoewendes, soos die bestaansboere wat as gevolg  van  diÃ©
droogte geen oes of geen kos gaan hÃª tot ten minste volgende jaar nie.

DiÃ© negehonderd rand wat so lekker misbruik word om stemme te koop,  behoort
aan daardie mense en mense soos hulle, wat dit nodig het om kos te koop  vir
hul families tot ten minste volgende jaar wanneer daar hopelik weer  'n  oes
gaan wees. Negehonderd rand vir drie maande gaan nie daardie kos  koop  nie.
Agb Alie jy weet blykbaar nie waarvan jy  praat  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Jy
sal nog die alie sien vir 'n tweede maal.

Die DA steun die toekenning van addisionele fondse vir die  ramp,  maar  ons
sal elke moontlike middel gebruik om die wanaanwending daarvan te stop,  wat
die kommersiÃ«le landbou - en dis die oorgrote deel van die  landbou  in  diÃ©
land - totaal uitsluit, soos wat ek hier verduidelik het. En diÃ©  van  julle
wat sit en skrou, weet nie daarvan nie, julle weet nie waarvan  julle  praat
nie en julle gee nie om nie, want julle dink die kommersiÃ«le  boere  is  net
50 000. [Tussenwerpsels.] Jy weet nie waarvan jy praat nie, Meneer,  jy  eet
net die kos, want jy kan dit nie maak nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Jy probeer al die laaste tien jaar om boere te vestig.  Julle  het  nog  nie
een honderd suksesvolle boere  gevestig  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Julle  kan
maklik mense maak, maar julle sal nou leer dit is baie moeiliker om 'n  boer
te maak. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons sal dus alles in ons vermoÃ« aanwend om  julle
te  stop  om  hierdie  geld  te   steel   en   stemme   daarmee   te   koop.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek dank die agb Adjunkspeaker. [Applous.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Listen, just wait a bit  until  my  time  starts,  you  hear.
[Interjections.] Hon Deputy Speaker, I  understand  that  the  hon  Hanekom,
former  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,  has   warned   that
Parliament should not render assistance  to  farmers  too  readily,  because
they could then become spoilt  and  dependent  on  such  assistance  in  the
future. Now while one has to  agree  with  the  hon  Hanekom  that  that  is
possible, it is  surprising  that  other  people  -  other  sectors  of  the
population - are not exposed to the same temptation,  and  one  wonders  why
the agricultural sector is being singled out.

The ANC already believes that farmers are spoilt, fat  hand-fed  lambs  that
must be taught to take the hindmost teat. In this regard, I  must  say  that
the ANC is rather effective, as experience has taught us during the past  10
years, and as their plans with regard to land tax and expropriation are  now
giving us a preview of. [Interjections.] It is very  true,  my  friend;  you
should read about what you are doing.

The DA welcomes the  additional  money  that  has  to  assist  in  avert  an
agricultural disaster, and we will therefore not do anything  to  jeopardise
or delay these funds, as this in turn can only contribute to  the  disaster,
in the same way as the two-and-a-half-year delay  in  the  handling  of  the
disaster when it snowed in the Drakensberg  and  the  Maluti  highlands  has
already  tragically,  unnecessarily  and  disgracefully  destroyed  people's
lives. Those people are now only receiving compensation  for  a  quarter  of
their losses two and a half years too late, but perfectly in  time  for  the
forthcoming election.

In order for disaster relief to be effective and of  value,  it  has  to  be
implemented  meaningfully  and  timeously,  right  where  it  can   make   a
difference. In this regard,  tragically,  the  ANC  Government  has  learned
nothing. For example, the relief package to cattle  farmers  is  limited  to
only 30 head of cattle. A commercial farmer - that is  a  farmer  who  farms
for the market so that all these members sitting here  in  Parliament  today
can have meat on the table when they sit down to a  meal  -  cannot  make  a
living with 30 head of cattle; it is virtually  impossible.  A  few  hundred
are needed in order for the farmer to be self-sufficient  and  to  be  in  a
position  to  survive  droughts  and  other  disasters  when  they   happen.
Commercial  cattle  farmers  are  therefore,  for  all  practical  purposes,
excluded from this  relief.  Hon  Deputy  Speaker,  South  Africa  certainly
deserves better than that.

Responsible governments rightly take  an  interest  in  the  development  of
irrigation and the building of dams and irrigation schemes to assist in  the
achievement of food security for the country. When such a dam,  for  example
the Allemanskraal Dam in the middle of the Free State, begins to  dry  up  -
as is now the case - and Minister Kasrils summarily cuts off the  irrigation
water in the middle of the season, it is a disaster;  because  the  standing
crops of those who  are  settled  there  which  are  entirely  dependent  on
irrigation water are destroyed on the ground. For these  commercial  farmers
no disaster relief is planned either, Minister.

One can therefore understand with  what  joy  and  gratitude  these  farmers
learned that  the  Department  of  Social  Development  did  in  fact  offer
assistance to their employees who now  clearly  run  the  risk  of  becoming
unemployed.

You can therefore imagine the shock when these  people  then  had  to  learn
that that was not the plan at all. No, this assistance is not being  offered
only to those workers who run the risk of losing their jobs as a  result  of
the drought; rather, all farmworkers in all  drought-ravaged  districts  are
enthusiastically being  encouraged  to  apply  for  R900  each  for  drought
relief, whether they are suffering at all as a result  of  the  drought,  or
not.

Hon members must understand clearly that this  Government  sitting  here  is
telling people who are permanently employed and who receive  a  full  salary
that they must come so that the Government can  give  them  a  present  just
before the election. One wonders what the other people who  live  out  there
on the flats and in other townships, and who do not have work or an  income,
think of this little plan you are taking  so  much  pleasure  in  advocating
there. Go and tell them about this plan; tell the truth.

These ANC members sitting here, and their New NP allies, must not  say  they
are not aware of these irregularities, because just 12 days ago we  informed
them by name - and Deputy Minister Du Toit specifically  -  about  this  and
challenged them to put a stop to it. However, he and  all  the  ANC  members
and their allies sitting here are as quiet as mice.  And  why  are  they  as
quiet as mice? It is, after  all,  precisely  their  plan  to  misuse  other
people's money to their own advantage, and if that is not  the  case,  speak
out about it and tell us what the truth is.  South  Africa  deserves  better
than this.

Is this the contract? Tell us, is this the contract that  you  and  the  ANC
talk about, that you want to conclude with the  people?  Is  the  idea  that
this money will be thrown from the presidential  aeroplane  like  manna  for
the people to receive, so that they can believe that for  that  reason  they
should vote for the ANC, and for you, specifically, by voting for  the  ANC?
I have news for you, and that is that far fewer people  are  going  to  sign
this contract at the polls  than  the  ANC  thinks.  The  reason  for  thisÃ 
[Interjections.] Just wait, the day is coming. The reason for this  is  very
simple: They are tired of empty promises; they are  tired  of  ANC  nonsense
telling them how well they are living, because they  are  not  living  well,
sir, they are wasting away on the sideline. They are wasting away in  Soweto
where they have to look at a billboard as large as  the  Arabella  hotel  at
the Waterfront down here, on which your leader's face appears  Ã¡  la  Saddam
Hussein, and then they wonder: ``Where does the money  come  from  for  that
thing?'', while you do not have money for them, but you  do  have  money  to
give to people to vote for you. [Interjections.]

The people are not going to sign  this  contract,  because  they  know  that
these presents are stolen money. It is stolen money, sir,  and  if  that  is
not the case, explain to us here today why that  is  not  the  case.  It  is
stolen money,  in  the  first  place,  because  taxpayers'  money  is  being
misused. It is stolen, in the second place, because it is being stolen  from
those who are truly needy, such as  the  subsistence  farmers  who  are  not
going to have any crops or any food until at  least  next  year  because  of
this drought.

These amounts of nine hundred rand that are  being  freely  misused  to  buy
votes, belong to those people and people like them, who need it to buy  food
for their families until at least next year, when one hopes there will  once
again be a crop. Nine hundred rand for three months will not buy that  food,
hon  Alie.  Apparently  you  don't  know  what  you   are   talking   about.
[Interjections.] ``Jy sal nog die alie sien vir 'n tweede maal.'' [You  will
come up short again.]

The DA supports the allocation of additional funds for the disaster, but  we
will utilise every possible means to stop the misuse of those funds,  which,
as I have explained here, totally  excludes  commercial  agriculture  -  and
that is by far the greater portion  of  agriculture  in  this  country.  And
those of you who sit and hoot, do not know about it, you do  not  know  what
you are talking about and you do not care, because you think the  commercial
farmers only number 50 000. [Interjections.] You do not know  what  you  are
talking about, sir, you merely eat the food, because  you  cannot  make  it.
[Interjections.]

You have been trying to establish farmers for the past 10  years.  You  have
not yet established a hundred successful  farmers.  [Interjections.]  It  is
easy to make people, but you will now learn that it is  far  more  difficult
to make a farmer. [Interjections.] We will therefore do  everything  in  our
power  to  stop  you  stealing  this  money  and  using  it  to  buy  votes.
[Interjections.] I thank the hon Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I now call the  hon  Joubert  who  will  be  making  his
maiden speech.

Mr L K JOUBERT: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, it is a  great  privilege
and honour for me to address this House for the first  time.  I  express  my
thanks and appreciation to the  president  of  the  IFP,  the  hon  Dr  M  G
Buthelezi, for the trust put in me. Thank you.

Water is the blood of Mother Earth and there is  nothing  that  can  survive
without water. Unfortunately, water is a scarce commodity  in  South  Africa
and drought conditions are the rule rather than the exception.

In the past, we had the so-called great droughts of 1864, 1903, 1916,  1933,
1964-66 and 1983, which  affected  large  areas  of  our  country  and  left
permanent scars on agriculture and  rural  society.  From  time  immemorial,
some parts of the country have experienced constant droughts and  only  very
rarely has the entire country been free of drought in any particular year.

I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to salute the farmers of  South
Africa who continue to supply  food  under  these  adverse  conditions;  who
continue to have faith to plant, even sometimes in dry  soil;  who  continue
to have faith to put the ram to the ewes not knowing what pastures  will  be
like five months later; and who continue to put the bull  to  the  cows  not
knowing what grazing conditions will be like nine months later.

This House has done much for drought  relief  in  the  past  and  the  first
Drought Stress Relief Act was passed as far back as in 1916. I am  proud  to
state that my great-grandfather, the hon George Kolbe, South  African  Party
member for the constituency of Wakkerstroom, where I hail from, was  one  of
the active supporters of the 1916 Act. It is therefore a  great  honour  and
privilege for me to support this Bill on behalf of the IFP.

However, as drought conditions are the rule rather than the exception,  more
preventive action should be taken.  The  obvious  preventive  action  is  to
conserve more water.  Much  has  already  been  done  in  this  regard  and,
excluding the Lesotho Highlands project, there are 143 public  dams  in  the
country with a total storage capacity of 30 billion cubic metres.  But  this
is not near the potential we have, and it is my submission that where a  dam
can be built in this country, it  should  be  built.  Like  the  electricity
network we have, I envisage a pipeline system covering the whole country  to
bring drought relief where and when needed.

The fact that we  are  a  drought-stricken  country  is  not  necessarily  a
deterrent. It has been said that the  ideal  place  to  farm  is  a  desert,
provided you can supply enough water, as has been  proven  by  some  Middle-
Eastern countries.

If we can lay a pipeline  from  Durban  to  Johannesburg  for  oil  or  from
Mozambique to Secunda for gas, surely we can  do  the  same  with  water  by
establishing a water pipeline grid over the  whole  country.  In  the  past,
people trekked to greener pastures when drought struck. This  is  no  longer
possible, but instead we can bring  the  water  to  people  when  and  where
needed. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mevrou die  Adjunkspeaker,  dit  is  vir  my  'n  aangename
voorreg om die nuwe lid, mnr L K Joubert van die IVP geluk te  wens  met  sy
nuwelingstoespraak wat hy vanmiddag hier in die Raad gelewer  het.  Ek  weet
nie of hy dalk 'n rekord opstel vir die lid wat die kortste  termyn  in  die
Parlement  gedien  het  nie,  maar  indien  hy  toekomsplanne  het  met   sy
parlementÃªre loopbaan, wens ons hom baie sterkte daarmee toe.

Wat het  die  agb  lid  mnr  Andries  Botha  vanmiddag  vir  Suid-Afrika  se
kommersiÃ«le boere gedoen? Hy het van hulle vyande van die Regering  van  die
dag gemaak. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is wat hy vanmiddag  vir  die  kommersiÃ«le
boere gedoen het. Kyk hoe lyk die Minister van Finansies. Die  Minister  van
Finansies is nie baie gelukkig met  hierdie  skree-en-skel-tegniek  of  styl
waarmee die DA hierdie sake aanpak nie. Dieselfde het gebeur met  munisipale
belastings op landbougrond.  'n  Geskree  en  geskel  op  die  Regering  het
absoluut niks bygedra tot die verligting van die dilemma  waarin  die  boere
hulle bevind het nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]

Dit is die Nuwe NP en  sy  leier,  mnr  Marthinus  Van  Schalkwyk,  wat  die
Minister van Provinsiale Sake en Plaaslike Regering gaan spreek het, en  ons
het met hom 'n  ding  uitgewerk.  Die  wet  is  verlede  week  deur  hierdie
Parlement gevoer. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Landbou Unie,  namens  die  boere  van
Suid-Afrika, is heeltemal tevrede met dit wat bereik  is,  en  ons  sÃª  baie
dankie vir die Regering  dat  hulle  ingestem  het  om  met  ons  te  praat.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Maar u bereik absoluut niks. U beduiwel die saak  van  die
kommersiÃ«le boere in Suid-Afrika met die styl wat u  vanmiddag  weer  gevolg
het, en dit is wat vorentoe sal gebeur.

Hierdie  droogtehulp  is  noodsaaklik.  Dit   maak   voorsiening   vir   die
verskaffing van drinkwater aan mens en dier, en  ook  vir  die  aankoop  van
veevoer gedurende die knellende droogte. Dit  maak  verder  voorsiening  vir
sekere  addisionele   mediese   en   maatskaplike   dienste   aan   kwesbare
gemeenskappe in ons land wat baie hard deur die droogte gekwes word.

Die probleem, soos u uitgewys het, is dat die hulp egter beperk word tot  30
beeste per boer. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dit  sal  beteken  dat  die  hulp  egter
beperk word tot 30 beeste per boer.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is a great privilege  for  me  to
congratulate the new member, Mr L  K  Joubert  of  the  IFP  on  his  maiden
speech, which he made here in the Council this  afternoon.  I  do  not  know
whether he has perhaps not set a  record  for  the  member  who  served  the
shortest  term  in  Parliament,  but  if  he  has  future  plans   for   his
parliamentary career, we wish him everything of the best.

What did the hon member Mr Andries Botha do for  South  Africa's  commercial
farmers this afternoon? He has made them enemies of the  Government  of  the
day. [Interjections.] That is what he has done for commercial  farmers  this
afternoon. Just look at the Minister of Finance. The Minister of Finance  is
not very happy with this shouting and screaming technique or style that  the
DA employs to deal with these matters. The same happened with municipal  tax
on agricultural land. Shouting and  screaming  at  the  Government  did  not
contribute anything to relieve  the  dilemma  in  which  the  farmers  found
themselves. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

It is the New NP and its leader, Mr Marthinus van  Schalkwyk,  who  met  the
Minister for  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  and  together  we  worked
something out. That Act was passed by this Parliament last week.  The  South
African Agricultural Union, on behalf of the farmers  of  South  Africa,  is
completely satisfied with what has been achieved and we would  like  to  say
thank you  very  much  to  the  Government  for  agreeing  to  talk  to  us.
[Interjections.]  But  you  are  achieving  absolutely  nothing.   You   are
bedevilling the cause of commercial farmers in South Africa with  the  style
that you once again followed this afternoon, and that is  what  will  happen
in future.

This drought relief is essential. It provides for the provision of  drinking
water to humans and animals, as well as for  purchasing  fodder  during  the
oppressive drought. It further provides for certain additional  medical  and
social services to vulnerable communities in our country that are being  hit
very hard by the drought.

The problem, as you pointed out, is that the aid will be  restricted  to  30
head of  cattle  per  farmer,  however.  [Interjections.]  This  will  mean,
however, that the aid will be restricted to 30 head of cattle per farmer.]

Mnr A J BOTHA: Is dit 'n probleem? [is that a problem?]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Dit beteken  dit  sal  noodsaaklike  verligting  bring  aan
kleinboere.  [This  means  that  it  would  bring  urgent  relief  to  small
farmers.]

Mnr A J BOTHA: Is dit 'n probleem vir jou? [Is that a problem for you?]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Maar, dit stuur 'n nare boodskap deur aan  die  kommersiÃ«le
boeregemeenskap. My styl om dit aan te spreek is heeltemal anders as  joune,
Andries Botha! [Tussenwerpsels.] Jy dien nie die belange van  die  boere  in
Suid-Afrika nie. Jy beduiwel die saak van kommersiÃ«le boere in  Suid-Afrika.
[Applous.]

KommersiÃ«le boere, geagte Minister, is ook maar net  soos  bestaansboere  of
kleinboere. Hulle is afhanklik van die natuur, en as  die  natuur  jou  hard
slaan en die 30 beeste wat jy besit vrek van die droogte, dan is jy  in  die
sop. As jy 'n honderd beeste besit en die  droogte  slaan  jou  hard  en  al
honderd van jou beeste vrek, is  jy  in  die  sop.  Dit  is  maar  dieselfde
probleem wat jy het. Dit is so dat die landbougemeenskap  hierdie  maatreÃ«ls
wat getref word, verkeerd sal beleef. Dit is  so  dat  hulle  sal  dink  dat
hulle deur hierdie Regering nie gesien word synde  'n  belangrike  bydra  in
Suid-Afrika te lewer nie.

Ek weet mos dat almal van  ons  om  voedselsekuriteit  in  hierdie  land  te
verseker ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But it  sends  out  an  unfavourable  message  to  the  commercial  farming
community. My style of addressing this issue differs completely from  yours,
Andries Botha!  [Interjections.]  You  are  not  serving  the  interests  of
farmers in South  Africa.  You  are  obstructing  the  cause  of  commercial
farmers in South Africa. [Applause.]

Commercial farmers, hon Minister, are  precisely  the  same  as  subsistence
farmers or small farmers. They are dependent  on  nature,  and  when  nature
hits you hard and the 30 head of cattle that you  own  die  because  of  the
drought, then you are in trouble. If you own one hundred head of cattle  and
drought hits you hard and all one hundred of your cattle die, then  you  are
in trouble. It is the same problem that you have. It  is  a  fact  that  the
agricultural community will experience these measures that are  being  taken
in the wrong way. It is so that they will think that they are  not  seen  by
this Government as making an important contribution in South Africa.

I know indeed that in order to ensure food security in this country  all  of
us ...]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Ek dank u. [Applous.] [I thank you.] [Applause.]]

Mr A BLAAS: Deputy Speaker, one cannot object to any form  of  relief  given
to the people affected by the  drought.  For  this  reason,  the  ACDP  will
support the principle of the Bill. The ad hoc manner in which this  Bill  is
presented to the House, however,  does  not  do  justice  to  the  lawmaking
process. It has, undoubtedly, a ring of  election  opportunism  attached  to
it.

As indicated, it allows for an additional R250Â million to be made  available
for   drought   relief,   bringing   the   total   drought   mitigation   to
R625,1Â million. The concern is that uncertainty exists as to what the  long-
term objectives of the relief measures will be.

An additional R60 million is made available  to  the  Department  of  Social
Development to fund emergency relief to vulnerable  communities.  One  would
have expected that this would have been focused  on  people  who  have  lost
their jobs as a result of the drought. It may be the case  that  people  may
now still be employed and qualify for this social  grant.  How  will  it  be
ensured that people do not receive double benefits, while other people  lose
out completely? If farmers are forced off their land this  will  necessarily
result in job losses.

An  additional  R30Â million  is  made  available  to  provide   fodder   for
livestock. To what extent will this ensure sustainable  breeding  stock  for
future supply? The anticipated preventative steps against diseases  must  be
supported as well as the long-term investment in safeguarding boreholes.

One cannot object to any form of relief given  to  people  affected  by  the
drought. This Bill, unfortunately, is short-term focused,  with  hardly  any
attention given to the long-term consequences of  the  drought.  We  express
our sincere compassion for everybody who is  affected  by  the  drought  and
pray that the much-needed rain will still fall  to  relieve  the  difficulty
and suffering. Thank you.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, the  full  extent  of
the drought across large parts of the country is, in  all  likelihood,  only
going to make itself felt in the coming months. Therefore, it is  wise  that
we should respond to this looming crisis pre-emptively. Already the  drought
is threatening the livelihoods and food security  of  many  farmworkers  and
the rural poor.

There is therefore no doubt about the  correctness  of  taking  this  relief
measure. The UDM  would,  however,  express  concern  about  the  method  of
applying this relief. We are  in  concurrence  with  the  Sowetan  newspaper
editorial of yesterday in  which  the  view  was  expressed  that  it  would
perhaps be better to provide  relief  in  the  form  of  food  vouchers,  as
opposed to direct cash payouts. There is simply no guarantee that  the  cash
will be spent on addressing  household  food  security,  which  is  what  we
intend this relief for.

Another matter that we have to raise is the preparedness  of  Government  to
deal with the drought should current weather conditions persist. Whilst  the
current drought relief should address current problems to  some  extent,  it
remains an ad hoc measure.

There is simply no guarantee that the drought will  not  deepen,  especially
with the dry season upon  us.  We  would  urge  the  National  Treasury  and
relevant line-function departments to develop adequate  long-term  plans  to
cope with reduced agricultural production, water scarcity and greater  rural
poverty and hunger. The UDM supports the Bill. I thank you.

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was a small-scale  farmer  growing
subtropical fruit, I know exactly how devastating it is when the rain  stays
away. Therefore the need to  have  a  Government  programme  in  support  of
drought mitigation is something that all of us can indeed heartily  support.
However, as the hon Blaas pointed out, we also need to  look  at  the  long-
term effects of the drought. The fact that because of  climatic  changes  we
are going to get droughts on a more regular basis,  and  also  floods  on  a
more regular basis, indeed means that we have to take a  long-term  view  of
supporting our farmers.

Hon Minister, I think one of the most overlooked aspects - and  I  say  this
to the Minister of Agriculture who is here too - is  the  need  to  look  at
shade-cloth farming. In a country that is as water-shy as South  Africa,  we
are missing out on a great opportunity in not investigating the  possibility
of subsidising small farmers with shade cloth. This is the way in  which  we
can make the limited water resources in our country go very far indeed.

Also, we need to look at the opportunities that Ecosan offers, in  which  we
take the system of sanitation and also link it to food production.  This  is
something that has been done very successfully and it  is  obvious  that  in
South Africa, facing future droughts and facing food shortages, we  need  to
look at this.

So, I would like to make an appeal that we please look very deeply into  the
question of shade-cloth farming, because this is one way  in  which  with  a
plot as small as 5 square metres we can guarantee that a family of five  can
be adequately fed and raised. That's how my father raised us - with  a  very
small garden - and I can appreciate the value of that in a country  where  a
food shortage is still a problem. Thank you.

Mr D A HANEKOM: Madam Deputy Speaker, Minister Manuel, Minister  Didiza  and
hon members, although we are dealing with  the  Drought  Relief  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill, I would like to locate it in the context of the  overall
Budget, because this particular money that  we  are  voting  on  now  is  an
additional amount - I think Minister Manuel  may  explain  that.  It  is  an
additional amount of money allocated in 2003-04 for that particular  Budget.
I will concentrate on the agricultural part  of  it  and  the  provision  of
water for mainly human consumption.

This amount of money - R250 million - has been divided into  various  parts.
Thirty five million rand is going  towards  primarily  malaria  and  cholera
control. It is going to the Department of Health. Sixty  million  rand  will
go to the Department of Social Development as we  have  already  heard  from
the hon member Saloojee. An amount of R60 million  is  going  to  vulnerable
communities. Thirty million rand  of  this  money  will  go  to  agriculture
mainly for fodder for livestock; and R125 million goes to the Department  of
Water Affairs mainly for water for human consumption.

Now the R30 million that goes to agriculture is not all the  money  that  is
being spent on agriculture. The way I read it is that  a  total  -  I  think
Minister Didiza might help us here - of R220 million has been  allocated  to
support farmers in the context of this current drought. So it is  much  more
than  the  R30  million  that  appears  in   this   particular   Adjustments
Appropriation Bill.

The reality of drought is that it  hits  hard  and  it  hits  certain  areas
harder than others and it hurts. I think it is necessary to  say  that  this
allocation is another reflection of the fact that the ANC-led Government  is
a caring government.

Most of this money goes directly to  vulnerable  communities  and  to  water
provision for human consumption. Most of this Budget goes  to  poor  people.
It does raise certain policy questions though,  Minister,  and  I  think  we
need to apply our minds to these matters in an  ongoing  way.  Some  of  the
policy issues relate to drought relief and  in  particular  money  going  to
farmers during periods of drought  for  drought  relief.  What  we  have  to
consider is that South Africa is a drought-prone country.  Drought  is  part
of our normal climatic cycle and it will occur periodically.

Clearly, livestock farmers are affected in areas that get  less  than  their
normal rainfall and that will always be the case. The  policy  question  is:
What is the difference between the needs of a livestock farmer  who  has  to
buy in fodder during a drought year and a fruit  farmer,  for  example,  who
loses his entire crop through hail damage? Is there relief  for  that  fruit
farmer who has suffered hail damage or a poultry farmer who  loses  all  her
chickens because of an outbreak of Newcastle disease? Is there going  to  be
relief for that poultry farmer or, for that matter, for a  livestock  farmer
who experiences a devastating veld fire which not only happens during  times
of drought - it can happen at  any  time.  These  are  some  of  the  policy
questions that arise.

The question, of course, Minister Manuel, is where does it stop? So we  have
to think about these  things  very  carefully.  However,  we  welcome  these
initiatives and in particular some of the work done  by  the  Department  of
Agriculture  and  some  of  their  interventions.  I  think  they  are  very
important in particular where we have good information going to farmers.  We
have good weather forecasts and it is up to farmers  to  make  use  of  this
information. I think this has been improving systematically  as  years  have
gone by. Livestock farmers  were  in  fact  advised  by  the  Department  of
Agriculture to reduce their  livestock,  especially  in  these  areas  where
drought and dry conditions were predicted.  However,  not  everybody  heeded
this warning. I think the important message  here  is  that  farmers  should
plan carefully, heed the warnings, heed the good advice and  listen  to  the
information.

The other thing that I think we really would welcome, Minister Didiza,  from
an agricultural point of view, is the move  towards  the  Agricultural  Risk
Insurance Bill, which is an initiative from your department.  That  is  very
important. Crop farmers were also warned in certain areas that  they  should
be careful; and of course some people did proceed to plant and incurred  all
of the expenses that go along with that and then  did  not  get  a  crop.  I
think it's very important for farmers to listen to the good information  and
to reduce their risk by planning very carefully and listening  to  the  good
advice that is available.

Obviously, when it comes to supporting vulnerable people, some of  the  same
questions arise as,  of  course,  people  are  affected  in  these  drought-
stricken areas, but while we are talking there are hungry  people  in  other
areas as well. The question will always  arise,  once  you  make  a  one-off
payment available to some areas, what  about  the  hungry  people  in  other
areas? Those questions are very important, Minister.

Now, regarding the issue of water, there is no question about the fact  that
these things have to be done anyway. The R125 million or  the  R100  million
that is being  allocated  for  emergency  water  supply,  I  think  is  very
important. It is part of ongoing work. We should take note of the fact  that
the prediction at the  moment  is  that  this  drought  is  unlikely  to  be
substantially broken, although it's  raining  well  in  many  parts  of  the
country. We welcome that. But again, as I have said before, I  am  going  to
situate this in the context of the overall Budget.

Now, Trevor, I do not want to  be  a  praise  singer.  You  know  that  your
praises have been sung by many people. I am not going to add to that, but  I
must say that this Budget, the 2004-05 Budget, comes at  quite  a  difficult
time. Revenue is down from what was expected and yet  expenditure  continues
to go up, especially social expenditure. I think this is a good-news  Budget
and I think  it  is  a  remarkable  achievement.  Yes,  the  deficit  is  up
slightly, but in real terms it is much lower than the earlier deficits  that
you were dealing with. The amount of money that we spend  on  servicing  the
debt has gone down dramatically. So the good  news  is  that  here  we  have
Minister Manuel, not just the good Minister Manuel, but  a  Minister  Manuel
carrying out ANC policy. Our  country's  economy  is  on  a  sound  footing.
[Applause.]

In the few minutes I have left, we need to reflect on what have  been  quite
extraordinary achievements over the past ten years. Ninety five  percent  of
our young children today are in primary schools. Poor children all over  the
country are getting some nutritious food every day.  This  is  a  remarkable
achievement. [Applause.]

About 7,5 million people today are receiving social grants  and  the  figure
continues to rise. As you know, in this Budget Minister Manuel  announced  a
R40 increase in the social grants, the  disability  grant  and  the  old-age
pension. That's a remarkable achievement and it will continue to  rise.  And
why? This is happening in a difficult year. Why we can say  with  confidence
that it will continue to rise is  simply  because  we  have  a  well-managed
economy. We know that the money will be available in years to come.

Minister, we can say that with absolute certainty and  absolute  confidence.
Minister, you could have taken the easy route in  earlier  years  and  spent
more money, but that route was resisted. I know you came  under  attack  and
received a lot of criticism, but I think  you  have  proved  that  you  have
considered these matters very carefully because today, in a difficult  year,
we can spend more to improve the lives of poor people and in years  to  come
even more. We have a well-managed economy and when we celebrate 10 years  of
democracy  and  freedom  we  also  celebrate  10   years   of   considerable
achievement.

We are also acutely aware of the massive challenges in front of us, but  the
good news is that plans are in place, the economy is  sound  and  much  more
can and will be done in the next 10 years. We can say that  with  confidence
because the economy is growing, the deficit is low,  revenue  collection  is
sufficient and we can do it. ``Trevor ChÃ© Manuel'', The  Mail  and  Guardian
called him. Well, I would not go that far, neither would  Jeremy,  he  tells
me. I do not think you would even say that yourself. Clever Trevor, is  what
I would call him; just Clever Trevor. But  Comrade  Trevor,  what  you  have
shown is good leadership over a long period  of  time.  The  pieces  are  in
place and you have a fantastic team. If you  move  to  greener  pastures  or
other pastures - we read in the newspapers that this might  happen  one  day
and it will happen one day; we all will, even if we don't  know  as  we  sit
here today what our pastures are going to be in a  few  months  time  -  the
thing here, Minister Didiza, is that there is nothing to  be  worried  about
because the pieces are in place.  There  is  a  good  team  and  we  can  be
confident, and that is a sign of good  leadership  ...  [Interjections]  ...
that is why we should probably vote for the ANC. I think it  sounds  like  a
good idea. [Applause.] That sounds like a good idea.

I would like to say, Comrade Trevor, that you also have  outstanding  people
from the committees who have given you good support. And, let me add, not  a
popular thing to say amongst the masses today, who don't  really  like  some
of the opposition parties, that some of the  opposition  representatives  in
the committee have really contributed well. One of them gives you  a  really
hard time, but I think ... [Interjections] ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: It's okay.

Mr D A HANEKOM: She's fine. You know  people  like  Raenette  Taljaard  over
there have made a really good contribution. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  your  time  has
expired. [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: That's a pity, but thanks very much. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson and hon members, let me  again  express
appreciation for the support for the Bill, but also deal with a few  issues.
The first of those is to highlight the point that the hon Hanekom made,  and
that is that South  Africa  is  drought  prone.  And  this  will  shape  the
agricultural sector for all time. There would be times that  are  worse  and
times that are less bad, but that we live in a drought prone area cannot  be
in dispute and the approach that  we,  therefore  take  to  businesses  like
agriculture become quite important.

In  many  respects  the  changes  introduced  since  1994  have  been  about
recognising that agriculture is a business, that what  parts  of  the  world
are doing in support of the agricultural  sector  by  way  of  subsidies  is
wrong and that Government must exercise choice and in exercising choice,  we
would not stand there to support farmers in all circumstances. But  clearly,
within the context and circumstances of severe drought or severe floods,  we
would have to look at it. That's why we are dealing with  this,  not  as  an
election ploy, but because the drought is exceedingly severe.

We said that we would examine this matter going forward and  that  we  would
look at the contingency  reserves  in  the  new  fiscal  year  and  evaluate
against that. Now, the hon member for Orania, Botha,  his  mind,  his  body,
his soul, is in the past. He wants a ``koffieraad'', a ``Cremora-raad''  and
a ``mielieraad'', but we  are  not  going  to  run  agriculture  like  that.
[Interjections.] We are not going to  run  agriculture  like  that.  Farmers
will stand essentially on their own feet. They  have  done  remarkably  well
over the past decade. We will deal with the issues when  times  are  severe,
and that is going to be the approach. When eventually,  maybe  in  the  next
century or so, the hon Botha represents a party that comes into  government,
they can change the policy. But I think we must not mislead people. We  must
say to all South Africans that this will be the approach of Government  that
is there after 14 April and they should not delude themselves.

The issue that the hon Botha can't understand, because he is  so  deeply  in
the past, is that in negotiations with AgriSA the  position  of  farmworkers
was taken into account with the full agreement  of  farmers.  So  you  don't
only help the farmers, but you recognise the  hardship  of  farmworkers  who
have nothing,  absolutely  nothing,  and  that's  a  change,  and  it  is  a
significant change.

I hope that one day the hon  Botha,  instead  of  shouting,  will  become  a
democrat, stop being a fool, join us in the new South Africa  and  recognise
that farmworkers are as important as farmers. [Applause.]

In conclusion I would like to join the other ... [Interjections.]

Daar is nie 'n vraag nie.  Die  enigste  vraag  is  dit  ...  [There  is  no
question. The only question is that ...]

Mr A J BOTHA: Jy kan hom nie antwoord nie. [You cannot answer my question.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Daar is nie 'n vraag nie. [There is  no  question.]
I wanted to say that I agree with hon Hanekom, that the hon Taljaard is  not
so bad. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, we move for adoption.

Mr V G SMITH: Chairperson, the Public  Accounts  Committee  recommends  that
this House adopts all the reports  as  reflected  on  the  Order  Paper.  We
believe, however, that it is important to highlight  a  few  general  points
listed in the various departmental reports.

Let us begin by stating  upfront  that  all  the  reports  were  unanimously
adopted by Scopa without a single one having to be  voted  upon.  Generally,
the committee is of the view that there is a marked improvement  as  far  as
the  departments'  adherence  to  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act   is
concerned.

However, there are certain areas of weakness that the departments will  need
to address urgently. Amongst these weaknesses, the committee identified  the
lack  of  internal  controls,  the  lack  of  proper  asset  and   inventory
management systems and a delay in the clearing of expense accounts.

Another very serious shortcoming, in our view, is the inability  of  certain
departments to provide the Auditor-General with supporting documentation  as
well as other departments appearing before  the  committee  and  challenging
the competence and the work method of the Auditor-General's staff.

In relation to specific department reports we would like  to  highlight  our
serious reservations and concerns about Report  111  -  Voortrekker  Museum;
Report 112 - Department of Public Works; and Report 118- Statistics  SA.  In
all of the above the Auditor- General was unable to express  an  opinion  on
the financial statements of the department. The audit opinion in  these  was
a disclaimer.

Another  problematic  department,  as  far  as  we  are  concerned,  is  the
Department of Water Affairs and  Forestry.  Of  particular  concern  to  the
committee was  also  Report  136,  listing  more  than  30  government/state
institutions that failed  to  submit  their  2001-02  financial  reports  16
months after the end of that financial year. The committee  recommends  that
Parliament acts urgently on these cases to ensure  that  accountability  for
all prevails.

A separate mention is warranted for Report 134, the Special  Report  by  the
Auditor-General pertaining to allegations on the  Joint  Investigating  Team
Arms Deal Report. Section C of the report recommends that  alterations  need
to be made to the now nonexistent Auditor-General Act. These  concerns  were
addressed in the new Public Audit Bill adopted by this House last  week.  In
as  far  as  reflections  upon  the  integrity  of  the  Auditor-General  is
concerned, the committee recommends that Parliament uses the  tools  at  its
disposal, such as the Rules and the Ethics  Committee  to  deal  with  these
allegations and that Scopa is not the appropriate  structure  to  deal  with
such matters.

Notwithstanding these areas of concern,  Scopa  recommends  that  the  House
adopts all these Reports in a similar fashion as  all  other  Scopa  Reports
have been adopted today.  That  is,  without  any  debate  on  any  specific
Report. If need be, we will elaborate on this  point,  as  can  the  various
political parties represented on Scopa. [Applause.]

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

 CONSIDERATION OF ONE-HUNDRED-AND-THIRTY-FOURTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE
                  ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS - JIT ARMS DEAL REPORT

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  we  move  that  the
Report be adopted.

The SPEAKER: The DA has requested an opportunity to make  a  declaration  of
vote. Before I put  the  motion  to  the  House  I  will  allow  parties  an
opportunity for declaration of votes.

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, when hon members are sworn in  we  all  pledge
an  allegiance  to  the  Constitution.  This  is  an   allegiance   to   the
Constitution  and  the  institutions  it   creates.   This   is   a   sacred
responsibility that binds us all.

Since  1994,  no  other  matter  has  exercised  our  democratic   oversight
structures,  our  Parliament,  courts,  the  fourth  estate  and  individual
consciences inside and outside of this House,  as  much  as  South  Africa's
strategic defence procurement. No  matter  has  tested  the  mettle  of  our
democracy and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts more. No matter  has
exercised the minds  abroad  in  France,  Germany,  Sweden  and  the  United
Kingdom as much in relation to unresolved allegations of corruption.

This matter even resulted in a motion of confidence debate  in  the  Speaker
of this House and in a special  Report  by  the  Auditor-General  which  the
Scopa Report deals with.

When the first allegations  against  the  Auditor-General  emerged,  the  DA
raised concerns about the possible unconstitutionality of Section 46 of  the
Auditor-General Act. In accordance with the Rules of this House, I  and  the
hon  Chief  Whip  of  the  Official  Opposition,   Douglas   Gibson,   moved
substantive motions expressing  concern  at  allegations  flowing  from  the
Promotion of Access to  Information  requests  before  the  courts  and  the
compliance by the Office of the Auditor-General with a court order  in  this
regard.

We called for a special committee of Parliament to probe  these  allegations
and reopen the probe of the Arms Deal in the light of  unanswered  questions
left untouched by the JIT Report and Scopa's Report on the JIT Report.

These substantive motions were all but ignored by  the  relevant  structures
of this House and this inaction hampered the ability of  members  to  engage
sufficiently with  the  issues  raised  pursuant  by  the  Auditor-General's
office releasing copies of the draft  JIT  Report  in  compliance  with  the
court order.

In its report on an unprecedented special  report  of  the  Auditor-General,
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in its  134th  Report  recommended
that paragraph 6 of the  Special  Report  that  deals  with  statements  and
motions in the  National  Assembly,  be  referred  to  the  Speaker  of  the
Assembly for such action as may be considered appropriate. While Rule 66  is
clearly aimed at protecting  the  integrity  and  honour  of  constitutional
institutions and Parliamentary conventions will evolve in this  regard  over
time, members of this House moved substantive  motions  in  full  compliance
with the Rules.

It is deeply regrettable that remnants of Section 46 of the  Auditor-General
Act remain lodged as Sections 18 and 22 of the  newly-adopted  Public  Audit
Bill.

Instead of recommending that the Speaker takes  action  against  members  of
this House that have raised legitimate concerns  about  Section  46  of  the
Auditor-General Act and consultations between the  Auditor-General  and  the
executive during the course of the Arms probe, Parliament should have  taken
considered and concerted action pursuant  to  specific  substantive  motions
that were moved in this House in full compliance with Rule 66 of the rules.

This Report is yet another narrative in the sad history of  the  devastation
that the Arms Deal has wreaked on South  Africa's  constitutional  oversight
structures. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam  Speaker,  the  Auditor-General  gave  evidence  on  this
special report. The report has been accused of  being  superficial  as  many
significant questions and concerns remain largely unanswered, and  the  ACDP
has registered its concerns.

The ACDP agrees with Gavin Woods, who was  the  Chairman  of  Scopa  at  the
height of this contentious issue, that given more serious  implications  for
social spending, the fiscus and the macroeconomy, the  rising  cost  of  the
SDP could hold. The public as far as possible should be informed as  to  how
much they as taxpayers will ultimately  have  to  pay,  and  in  what  other
negative ways they could be affected.

The significance of these tens of billions of rands is undeniably great.  It
is  also  unfortunate  that  the  JIT  did  not  address  the  key  question
concerning the basis used  to  compare  C2I2  and  competing  products,  and
stands accused of not taking into account much available  evidence.  Whether
or not new evidence will come to the fore remains to be seen.  However,  the
ACDP remains unconvinced as to whether or not we have got to the  bottom  of
the matter.

The ACDP is committed to using our best efforts and  all  avenues  available
to uncover the truth in the public interest, making  sure  that  criminality
is pursued vigorously and unethical  deals  exposed.  Ongoing  criminal  and
other investigations may well uncover issues which  still  need  to  surface
and the ACDP believes Scopa must  follow  up  on  these  investigations  and
monitor progress through regular reports to Parliament.

This matter cannot be quietly put to bed or wished away, and the  ACDP  will
not support this One-Hundred-and-Thirty-Fourth Report of  Scopa  as  justice
has not yet been seen to be done in the public interest.  The  ACDP,  unlike
the ANC, is committed to exposing and eradicating crime and corruption,  and
has an advantage over the ANC in  that  they  know  the  difference  between
right and wrong.

The ACDP is not squeamish when it comes to  appropriate  punishment.  Enough
is enough. It is time to vote ACDP, the party  that  offers  real  hope  for
this nation. Thank you. [Interjections.]

Mr B W KANNEMEYER: Madam Speaker, it's indeed regrettable that  we  continue
to see a continuation of a very desperate alliance clutching at  all  straws
that remain regarding the upcoming election. This request for  a  debate  on
this matter is nothing more than that. As is common cause now,  I  think  we
all know that at the height of  the  arms  procurement  saga  the  ANC  were
accused by, amongst other parties, the DA of polarising the Public  Accounts
committee along political lines.

It was exactly - and this is what is not told - at that time that  the  work
of the committee was indeed politicised and polarised, exactly  because  the
representatives of the DA at that time could not say aye or nay on  anything
unless they had consulted with their leadership,  so  much  so  that,  as  I
think and as we all know today, during the five  years  of  this  Parliament
the DA have changed their membership in the  Public  Accounts  committee  no
less than five or six times. [Interjections.] The  person  who  spoke  today
again here on the matter is  someone  who  has  never  been  in  the  Public
Accounts committee for the past couple of months. In fact she just  recently
returned from outside the country.

Hon members, Nigel Bruce and Brown Bell have stood and worked in the  Public
Accounts committee, and really with them there we've been  able  to  process
during this year 136  reports  that  have  been  discussed,  progressed  and
agreed upon by every single party, including the DA, in the Public  Accounts
committee. Therefore, it is clear that when we are  working  on  this  there
are special people in the DA who are hit persons. They  are  there  just  to
hit on certain things regardless of the truth and  what  it  means  for  the
country, so much so that the spokesperson of the DA  was  the  first  person
who led members of Parliament to walk out of the Public  Accounts  committee
at a very important committee meeting. They  undermined  the  work  of  this
particular Parliament in representing the people.

Not so long  ago  Scopa  discussed  the  wisdom  or  otherwise  of  debating
committee reports. Now, the representatives of  the  DA  who  were  in  that
meeting, Mr  Nigel  Bruce  and  Mr  Brown  Bell,  were  the  ones  who  were
supporting and pushing  that  we  do  not  discuss  these  matters  here  in
Parliament. Their motivation - not  the  motivation  of  the  ANC  -  as  DA
representatives in Scopa was  that  we  could  not  take  these  matters  to
Parliament because our parties  would  instruct  us  to  hold  a  particular
political line, and the work, work method and ethic that we were  developing
in Scopa would come under threat if we took matters  agreed  upon  in  Scopa
into Parliament for debate here. That was not said by the ANC, it  was  said
by the DA's own representatives. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr B W KANNEMEYER: Madam Chair, in conclusion, the ANC,  in  line  with  the
decision of this committee,  rejects  this  opportunistic  publicity-seeking
gimmick and moves that the House adopts this report in a similar  manner  in
which all other Scopa reports ... [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: That hon member  simply
ignores the Chair. [Interjections.]  Not  only  does  that  hon  member  not
address the subject, he also ignores the Chair.

The SPEAKER: Hon member, I did ask him to stop. Please,  could  we  proceed.
Hon members, order! Please, let us proceed. I put the motion  by  the  Chief
Whip of the Majority Party that the report be adopted.

Motion agreed to  (Democratic  Alliance  and  African  Christian  Democratic
Party dissenting).

Report accordingly adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

    ONE-HUNDRED-AND-THIRTY-FOURTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC
                       ACCOUNTS - JIT ARMS DEAL REPORT

                                 (Statement)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before adjourning, I wish to  make  a  comment  on
the One-Hundred-and-Thirty-Fourth Report of  Standing  Committee  on  Public
Accounts that we have just adopted. In  that  report,  the  Public  Accounts
committee recommends that the Auditor-General's concerns,  as  expressed  in
paragraph 6 of his special report about the possible transgression  of  Rule
66, be referred to me ``for such action as may be considered  appropriate''.
The Auditor-General also wrote to me directly to voice his concerns.

The purpose of Rule 66, a Rule  made  by  this  House,  is  to  protect  the
integrity and  independence  of  judges,  the  Auditor-General  and  office-
bearers of other constitutional structures, and to prevent  unwarranted  and
unsubstantiated attacks  in  this  House  on  their  honour  or  competence.
Parliament pre-eminently should be committed  to  upholding  and  protecting
the independence and standing of those institutions, which are  required  to
play a key role in our constitutional democracy.

If there are grounds for an investigation of the  conduct  of  such  office-
bearers, this House has available the mechanism  of  a  substantive  motion,
and procedures for such substantive motions still need to be worked out.

Although steps were taken by the Chair at the time to restrain members  from
transgressing Rule 66, various  members  were  disinclined  to  observe  the
letter and spirit of the Rule. This is both unacceptable and regrettable.

I would therefore strongly recommend that the next  Parliament  should  give
serious attention to all facets of the interrelationship between  Parliament
and the constitutional institutions supporting democracy, on the  one  hand,
to prevent those institutions from being undermined within  Parliament  and,
on the other hand, to establish effective accountability mechanisms.

I thank you for that. This ruling will be passed on to the next Parliament.

House adjourned at 16:36.
