        HIJACKING OF PARAMEDICS AT IMBALI TOWNSHIP, PIETERMARITZBURG

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock media reports that two paramedics were hijacked  and
       forced  to  have  sex  with  each  other  -  this   took   place   in
       Pietermaritzburg-Imbali Township;


  (2) notes with dismay that one of the culprits raped the female paramedic
       and robbed the paramedics of their belongings before driving away  in
       the vehicle;


  (3) notes that this was the ninth hijacking incident of an  ambulance  in
       eight months' time;


  (4)  believes  such  incidents  to  be  very  traumatic   and   degrading
       experiences for the victims -  they  show  the  level  of  the  moral
       degeneration and the  lack  of  respect  for  human  dignity  in  our
       society; and


  (5) appeals to the Department of Health to give the moral support  needed
       by these public servants and their families, and further  appeals  to
       the Department of Justice and Constitutional  Development  to  arrest
       the culprits and give them the most heavy sentences as  they  do  not
       deserve to be part of our communities.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to that motion? Is  that
an objection, Chief Whip?

The CHIEF WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  the  culprits  have  to  be
arrested and have  to  go  through  the  process  of  law.  We  endorse  the
sentiments, but I do not think that the resolution or the recommendation  is
appropriately phrased.

I would like to move as an amendment:


  That paragraph (5) be substituted by the following paragraphs:


  (5) appeals to the Department of Health to give the moral support  needed
       by these public servants and their families; and


  (6) further appeals to the Department of  Safety  and  Security  to  take
       swift and appropriate action to arrest the perpetrators, and believes
       that, if those arrested are convicted, a severe punishment should  be
       imposed on them.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mrs Vilakazi,  would  you  object  to  such  an
amendment to the resolution?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: The amendment is  just  within  the  scope  of  my  motion
without notice, so I take it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Is  there  any  objection  to  the  motion  as
amended? No objection.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely: -


  (1) notes with shock media reports that two paramedics were hijacked  and
       forced  to  have  sex  with  each  other  -  this   took   place   in
       Pietermaritzburg-Imbali Township;


  (2) notes with dismay that one of the culprits raped the female paramedic
       and robbed the paramedics of their belongings before driving away  in
       the vehicle;


  (3) notes that this was the ninth hijacking incident of an  ambulance  in
       eight months' time;


  (4)  believes  such  incidents  to  be  very  traumatic   and   degrading
       experiences for the victims -  they  show  the  level  of  the  moral
       degeneration and the  lack  of  respect  for  human  dignity  in  our
       society;


  (5) appeals to the Department of Health to give the moral support  needed
       by these public servants and their families; and


  (6) further appeals to the Department of  Safety  and  Security  to  take
       swift and appropriate action to arrest the perpetrators, and believes
       that, if those arrested are convicted, a severe punishment should  be
       imposed on them.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Minister of Finance on the delivery  of  a  prudent
       and well-balanced budget;


  (2) conveys its admiration for the sterling work done by the Minister and
       his staff in preparing a budget which again confirms  the  commitment
       of the current  Government  to  progressively  direct  the  country's
       public resources towards meeting the needs of the country's poor;


  (3) acknowledges that while no budget will ever satisfy  everybody,  this
       budget gives something for everybody under very difficult conditions;

       competitive advantage and will create conditions for faster  economic
       growth and job creation;


  (5) expresses its unreserved praise for the proposals  to  expand  social
       spending in areas such  as  housing,  water,  education,  health  and
       community services, and believes this will provide the masses of  our
       people meaningful relief from crushing poverty; and


  (6) believes the 2004 budget is a reflection of the massive  progress  we
       have made during the first decade of our freedom,  and  confirms  our
       conviction that by working together over the next ten years,  we  can
       and will do more to build a better life for all.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PASSED DURING THE CURRRENT TERM
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the motion printed in  my
name on the Order Paper:


  That the Council ratifies the decision  the  Joint  Subcommittee  of  the
  Joint Programme Committee adopted on 18 February 2004 in accordance  with
  Joint Rule 216(2), namely that the Division of Revenue Bill [B 4 -  2004]
  (National Assembly  -  sec  76)  be  fast-tracked  by,  where  necessary,
  shortening any period within which any step in  the  legislative  process
  relating to the Bill must be completed, in order to make it possible  for
  the Bill to  be  passed  by  both  Houses  during  the  current  term  of
  Parliament (Announcements, Tablings and Committee  Reports,  18  February
  2004, p 214).

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There is no speakers' list  on  the  motion.  I
shall therefore put the question. The question is that the motion be  agreed
to.  As  the  decision  is  dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast the votes of their  provinces.  I  note  that
all delegations indeed have members present.

In accordance with Rule 75, I shall first allow provinces an opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote  if  they  wish  to  do  so.  Is  there  any
province wishing to make a declaration of vote? There is none.

We proceed therefore to voting  on  the  question.  This  will  be  done  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads  should  indicate  whether
they vote in favour, against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

  CONSIDERATION OF NATIONAL GAMBLING BILL AND REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON
                    ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS THEREON

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you. Chairperson, hon  members,  I
am very pleased to be able to come  to  the  House  towards  its  end.  I've
always enjoyed my  appearances  here  despite  some  probing  questions  and
misleading information from the opposition, obviously, but it's always  been
great fun. [Laughter.]

Chairperson, the National Gambling Bill that is being tabled today  replaces
the National Gambling Act of 1996, which has served us  well  for  the  past
seven years. The  new  Bill  seeks  to  improve  on  our  joint  ability  to
effectively regulate this very large cash-based industry by introducing  new
measures  to  control  illegal  gambling,  clarifying  the  jurisdiction  of
national and provincial regulators, and enhancing co-operative governance.

It also  establishes  new  mechanisms  to  deal  with  potentially  negative
socioeconomic consequences of gambling in our communities.  The  Bill  is  a
product of close co-operation for the  national  and  provincial  government
and has resulted from extensive consultation.

The Constitution established gambling as an activity regulated  concurrently
by national  and  provincial  government.  The  decision  made  in  1994  to
legalise gambling was partially based on the potential benefits  that  could
flow from the industry. Four public policy objectives were identified  which
would be met by the industry. These objectives  included  the  promotion  of
black economic empowerment, the creation of employment, the creation of  new
fixed investments and infrastructure, and the generation of revenue.

The gambling industry today is an industry that generates about  R7  billion
worth of turnover, and is a significant employer, accounting  for  about  50
000 direct and indirect jobs. The industry contributes significant  revenues
to provincial coffers and has directly generated almost R12 billion  in  new
fixed investment and infrastructure.

These investments have yielded not only new hotels and  conference  centres,
but  also  the  upgrading  of  roads   and   other   social   and   economic
infrastructure in rural areas, with facilities such as community sports  and
recreational facilities, and arts and craft centres.

With the growth of  the  industry  and  its  contribution  to  the  economy,
however, we have also begun  to  see  some  of  the  negative  socioeconomic
consequences of gambling. The review of the National Gambling  Act  and  our
ability to address emerging challenges after seven years  of  implementation
have therefore come at the right time as we are testing and  evaluating  the
impact of this industry.

The National Gambling Act of 1996 was enacted at a time when the  principles
of the Constitution and  the  need  for  co-operative  governance  were  yet
untested. In 1996 the focus was on eradicating the  large  illegal  gambling
industry that had developed under the old regime.

While the illegal industry has been largely brought under  control,  we  now
face new  challenges,  namely  that  of  minimising  negative  socioeconomic
consequences jointly with the socially responsible industry, and  to  ensure
proper and effective oversight of an industry that is primarily cash-based.
Therefore, the new Bill seeks to address  some  of  these  issues.  The  key
issues that we are looking at is clarifying the roles between  national  and
provincial regulators, creating common norms and  standards  for  provincial
licensing activities, establishing mechanisms for  co-operative  governance,
implementing enhanced measures of  oversight  and  control,  and  addressing
proactively some of the negative socioeconomic consequences of gambling.

Let  me  briefly  touch  on  each  of  these  areas.   In   addressing   the
socioeconomic costs of gambling, the Bill introduces a  number  of  measures
to minimise the socioeconomic cost. In particular, it provides for  enhanced
protection of minors, prohibiting access to gambling  areas  and  access  to
gambling activities; restrictions on  granting  of  credit  to  gamblers;  a
scheme of exclusion whereby addictive gamblers can exclude themselves  or  a
court can order a person, upon request from  a  dependant,  to  be  excluded
from  access  to  gambling  activities;  restrictions  on  advertising   and
promotion of gambling activities in order  to  prevent  persons  from  being
induced to gamble, and the  setting  of  standards  for  gambling  premises,
including, for example, how the gambling  floor  should  be  separated  from
other activities and what notices must be posted.

These new measures are aimed  primarily  at  prevention,  but  also  provide
remedies. The Bill imposes an explicit obligation on the  National  Gambling
Board to monitor the negative socioeconomic impact  and  to  conduct  broad-
based education programmes  to  educate  the  public  about  the  risks  and
potential consequences of gambling.

These activities will provide the  basis  for  joint  policy-making  between
national and provincial Ministers at the National Gambling  Policy  Council.
Other measures to limit  the  potential  socioeconomic  costs  also  include
requirements for  licensing  decisions,  such  as  the  impact  of  proposed
gambling activities on the community.

Furthermore, in recognition of the potentially detrimental impact  that  the
introduction of limited payout machines, LPMs,  may  have  on  society,  the
Bill requires the phased implementation of these machines, with  each  phase
being punctuated by socioeconomic impact assessments.

The Bill further  requires  provincial  licensing  authorities  to  evaluate
commitments by industry to black economic  empowerment  and  to  combat  the
incidence of addictive and compulsive gambling when  considering  a  licence
or a licence renewal. The Bill also enables provincial regulators to  impose
additional conditions where these commitment have not been met.

The Bill introduces measures to enhance control over the gambling  industry.
These measures include the establishment of a national register of  gambling
machines, which will track every gambling machine throughout the  course  of
its  useful  life.  It  is  expected  that  this   mechanism   will   assist
significantly with the monitoring and control of illegal  gambling  and  the
use of illegal machines.

The national register of gambling machines  is  further  strengthened  by  a
prohibition on the possession or ownership of unregistered  machines  which,
in turn, will facilitate the confiscation of illegal machines by  provincial
regulators and the SAPS. In addition, the re-enactment  of  the  requirement
that  all  LPM  machines  are  linked  to  a  national  central   electronic
monitoring system will ensure that we are able to detect any tampering  with
the machines and  their  payouts;  and  ensure  the  accurate  statement  of
revenues for taxation purposes and also the detection of money-laundering.

Another key object of the Bill is to  clarify  the  roles  of  national  and
provincial regulators and to eliminate, where possible and  constitutionally
feasible, any duplication and overlap. In this regard, the  Bill  introduces
a scheme of national licences for manufacturers, testing agents of  gambling
equipment and employees in the gambling industry.

While the National Gambling Board sets the criteria  for  the  licences  and
the evaluation, the Bill provides for provincial  licensing  authorities  to
issue all licences, whether national or provincial.

The role of the National Gambling  Board  is  to  monitor  and  oversee  the
industry, its socioeconomic  impact  and  the  effectiveness  of  provincial
regulators, and to advise the National Gambling Policy  Council  on  matters
of concern and policy accordingly. Finally,  the  Bill  seeks  to  harmonise
provincial activities by introducing  norms  and  standards  for  provincial
licensing activities.

In Chapter 4 of the  Bill,  we  seek  to  give  expression  to  co-operative
governance by creating the National Gambling Policy Council. The council  is
an intergovernmental forum headed by the Minister  and  constituted  by  the
members of the executive council responsible for gambling in each  province.
The council's functions are to develop national norms and standards for  the
gambling industry, to develop national policy in  respect  of  the  gambling
industry, and to promote  intergovernmental  relations  in  respect  of  the
gambling industry.

The National Gambling Bill thus gives expression to the  objectives  that  I
have outlined at the beginning of my speech, namely, enhanced oversight  and
control of the gambling industry, improved co-operative governance  and  the
minimisation of the  negative  socioeconomic  consequences  of  gambling.  I
would like to express my sincere thanks to members of the  Select  Committee
on  Economic  and  Foreign  Affairs.  They  have  helped  us  to  steer  the
legislation to this point, and their valuable contributions in the  form  of
many technical amendments and adjustments have been of great merit.

I would also like to thank my provincial colleagues and their officials  for
their assistance and their inputs, and also the DTI team  and  the  National
Gambling Board for their hard work. I would like to pay  a  special  tribute
to many people in the industry and various social groups  that  have  really
gone out of their way to ensure that we address the economic needs  and  the
reality of this industry  while  ensuring  social  responsibility.  I  would
strongly commend this Bill to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon Minister and  your  Deputy  in  absentia,  hon
members, special delegates, ladies and gentlemen, as we bid farewell to  the
first decade of our democracy and prepare ourselves  for  the  dawn  of  the
next one, we proudly do so, elated that our Government has done well  enough
for our people so as to shame the  doubting  Thomases.  We  enter  the  next
decade, confident of the fact that the apartheid system, together  with  its
vestiges, finally reside in the museum of history,  alongside  the  spinning
wheel.

Prior to  1994,  gambling  was  a  legal  activity  in  the  then  so-called
independent homelands. While this activity brought untold suffering  to  the
poor in those areas, we were alive to the fact that it  also  created  much-
needed jobs. With the advent of democracy, Government  was  faced  with  two
choices: to legalise gambling in the whole of South Africa, or ban it,  even
in the parts of the country where it was a legal  activity  before.  It  was
decided then that gambling was going to be legalised, provided it  fulfilled
certain policy objectives, as the Minister indicated. The policy  objectives
were, firstly, that it must stop being a lily-white industry and conform  to
black economic empowerment principles; secondly, that it must  create  jobs;
thirdly, that it must create new fixed investments and  infrastructure;  and
lastly, that it must create revenue  for  the  country.  Government  further
recognised the potential damage gambling could cause to the country  if  its
proliferation was left unchecked, hence the need for its  proper  regulation
while fulfilling the above-mentioned conditions.

Since its legalisation in 1994, gambling has  to  a  large  extent  met  the
policy objectives set by Government. However, it also  became  evident  that
it also had and still has unintended consequences. A need arose for the  ANC
Government to further intervene with the  aim  of  mitigating  the  problems
caused by gambling. The most appropriate way of  intervention  would  be  by
way of strengthening legislation and by way of amendments  to  the  existing
legislation. However, in the process of doing so, it became very clear  that
there was a need for a new Bill which would contain both provisions  of  the
old one and new policy positions of Government. It is for this  reason  that
we have a new Gambling Bill in this House today.

A cursory look at the gambling industry today will reveal that about 43%  of
the industry is owned by black people. It has  also  created  about  50  000
jobs, as the Minister has indicated. However, we want to hasten to say  that
BEE empowerment in this industry is not yet widespread. It is always only  a
tiny minority of people who get empowered and sometimes  one  and  the  same
people are empowered. The House will be shocked to hear that not one of  the
casinos in both the Free State and North West has a BEE component.  We  must
call upon Sun International to operate in accordance with  policy  positions
of our Government.

The Bill itself is a genuine attempt by Government, through  the  Department
of Trade and Industry, to realise the lofty ideals of  bettering  the  lives
of our people without compromising the healthy social fibre of our  society.
Problem  gambling  is  a  serious  cancer  that  is  gradually  eroding  our
communities,  especially  those  that  are  in  the  proximity  of  casinos.
Research has shown that in countries where  gambling  is  legal,  for  every
problem gambler there are about  12  people  who  are  affected.  Those  are
family members and friends.

We are told that compulsive and addictive gambling is  on  the  increase  in
South Africa. This piece of legislation is meant to  curb  such  tendencies.
It provides for voluntary exclusion  by  people  who  have  a  problem  with
gambling. It further provides for court-ordered exclusion.  We  argued  that
court-ordered exclusions cannot happen in High Courts, as  the  majority  of
affected people are ordinary people who, more often than not, would  not  be
able to litigate in High Courts. Ordinary  magistrates'  courts  should,  as
the Bill now indicates, be empowered to do this as well.

We have in this country  countless  unlicensed  gambling  activities  taking
place. These activities take place in unlicensed premises and, to  crown  it
all, they also allow minors to participate.  When  this  Bill  becomes  law,
there will be an abrupt end to all these immoral activities. Our  thanks  go
to the department for this.

The Bill  also  introduces  national  standards  for  gambling  premises  to
address the whole question of overstimulation of gambling. The  location  of
ATMs within a casino is  a  serious  cause  for  concern.  These  ATMs  have
facilities to draw money only, and you cannot deposit money  in  them.  They
are therefore there to encourage people to use all  their  savings.  We  are
happy that when this Bill becomes law, ATMs will be disallowed on the  floor
where gambling is taking place so as to save our people  from  losing  their
hard-earned savings.

Limited payout machines are another sore spot on the gambling  industry.  It
is sore because they will be within reach of the poorest of the  poor,  even
in far-flung areas in our country.  These  people  were  hitherto  protected
from gambling because of the distance to casinos. It is our considered  view
that these people need to be protected,  hence  our  call  for  the  gradual
introduction of limited payout machines in  the  entire  country;  and  that
there should be a mechanism for an ongoing socioeconomic  impact  assessment
on the use of limited payout machines so that, if they have a very  negative
impact on the people, their introduction can either  be  stopped  or  slowed
down. To further strengthen control and supervision, these machines will  be
linked to a national central electronic monitoring system.

The  current  regulatory  framework  has  shortcomings  as  each  provincial
regulatory authority has its own legislation and,  as  a  result,  there  is
lack of coherence in regulating the industry nationally. The new  provisions
of the Bill seek to deal exactly with this problem. These  provide  for  the
interrelationship between provincial regulatory agencies  and  the  national
board,  and  introduce  uniform  licensing  norms  and  standards   in   all
provinces. The Bill, for the first time, introduces the system  of  national
licensing and a national  governmental  consultative  body  -  the  National
Gambling Policy Council.

We will remember that in some  instances  Parliament  has  been  accused  of
passing laws which are impossible to police. To ensure that there is  proper
policing and adherence to the provisions of this law, the Bill provides  for
the establishment of a national inspectorate to monitor compliance.

To conclude, this Bill promotes the principle of  fair  competition.  As  we
all know, fair competition is essential for proper economic growth  and  the
Bill supports that principle,  as  it  states  in  clause  54(1)  that  when
considering an application for a licence other than an  employment  licence,
a provincial authority must consider whether approving  the  application  is
likely  to  substantially  effect  competition  in  the  gambling   industry
generally, or in respect of the proposed activity  within  the  province  in
the case of a provincial licence, or within the  Republic  in  the  case  of
national licence.
As a select committee, we commend this Bill to the House as  it  will  go  a
long way in regulating  the  industry  in  order  to  bring  proper  balance
between it and the plight of our poor. We also want to  indicate  that  this
was not an easy Bill. I am sure that the Minister will attest to this.  Yes,
the department did a good job and we want to congratulate them. We ask  this
House to pass this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, hon Minister, we  in  KwaZulu-
Natal recognise the need for a new national gambling Bill  as  the  National
Gambling Act of 1996 was drafted at the introduction of regulated gaming  in
this country. Much has transpired since then.  As  this  industry  develops,
regulators need to re-evaluate its state of play.

We  welcome  special  aspects  of  this  Bill,  such  as  the   prohibition,
requirements and standards to reduce  the  harmful  social  consequences  of
compulsive and addictive gambling. It is unfortunate that in  attempting  to
achieve this goal, the department introduced draft 11 which,  in  attempting
to deal with these negative social impacts, seems to  have  been  misguided,
missed the mark and caused unnecessary delays in the implementation of  this
Bill and its passage through this House. We were hoping that we  would  have
got it through last year.

The other aspects which we should appreciate in the Bill  are  the  attempts
to limit the overstimulation of gambling. This is  a  serious  problem.  Not
only do we need to look at this Bill, but possibly  also  at  our  Lotteries
Act,  and  particularly  apply  similar  clauses  on  which  we  are  having
hearings. Here I refer to clause 15, the advertising clause.

Other welcome aspects are the measures  that  assist  provinces  in  dealing
with illegal gambling. I think this Bill goes  a  long  way,  certainly,  in
introducing uniform licensing norms. The particular one that we  support  is
the licensing of employees nationally, in accordance with  Chapter  2,  Part
E. This will certainly facilitate the movement of staff nationally.
This Bill, when it was originally introduced, encompassed the  horse  racing
industry and attempted to deal with it. We are pleased that it was  removed.
However, we would certainly appeal to the Minister that  when  dealing  with
horse racing, he should consider introducing a national  horse  racing  Bill
as separate from this Bill. We wouldn't like to see  this  Bill  become  too
convoluted and complicated,  as  the  horse  racing  industry  has  peculiar
characteristics of its own.

However, I must say that of concern to KwaZulu-Natal is that  in  attempting
to set norms and standards, the Bill tends to impinge or even  prescribe  to
provinces on matters that are regarded as provincial competencies.  I  refer
here to clause 26(1) which instructs the Minister  to  make  regulations  in
respect to clauses 26(2)(a), 26(2)(b), 26(2)(c) and 26(2)(d).

These clauses deal with the phased  roll-out  of  limited  payout  machines,
LPMs, and the establishment of a mechanism for ongoing socioeconomic  impact
assessments relative to LPMs. While we certainly support phased  or  gradual
roll-out, and we certainly  would  insist  that  an  assessment  and  impact
assessment on the negative social aspects be in place, we believe that  this
should be a provincial responsibility and trust that the  Minister  and  his
regulators will delegate this function to provinces.

Also of concern was the exemption in clause 50 of ``brothers  and  sisters''
as excluded family members. We have had explanations that this  impacted  on
certain provinces that had already  been  granted  licences.  We  felt  that
clause 51(2) would cater for that and offer those provinces  an  opportunity
to remedy the situation,  but  the  logic  behind  excluding  ``brother  and
sister'' escaped us.

Speaking of clause 51(2), we were concerned with the timeframe of two  years
given for a licensee to remedy an irregularity.  It's  the  time  period  of
three years that is really of  concern,  because  a  person  could  continue
profiting from a situation for three whole years, when he  should  not  have
initially been  entitled  to  a  licence  in  the  first  place.  We  didn't
understand that.

We appeal  to  the  Minister  that  he  should  find  an  amicable  solution
regarding the pending conflict between our province's  CMS  operator,  route
and site licences, and the National Gambling Board in respect of  clause  27
and specifically clause 27(4). Little purpose would be served if we  had  to
turn to either constitutional courts  or  courts  of  law  to  resolve  this
issue. I'm sure it can be resolved amicably.

Finally, I would like to say that, in supporting the Bill, we would like  to
also thank the staff of the department and, in particular, Ms Ludin for  the
co-operative and constructive manner in which  she  engaged  with  us  while
dealing with this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, comrades,  members,  special
delegates,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  this  year  of  celebrating  the   92nd
anniversary of our movement, the  10th  anniversary  of  democracy  and  the
first decade of freedom, is marked by the ANC as a very significant year.

In terms of the Freedom Charter, which says that the people shall  share  in
the wealth of the country; that  all  other  industry  and  trade  shall  be
controlled to assist the wellbeing of  the  people;  and,  that  all  people
shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, these are  exactly  what
the ANC-led Government is aiming to achieve through this Bill.

The  National  Gambling  Bill's  objectives  are  to  provide  for  the  co-
ordination of concurrent  national  and  provincial  legislative  competence
over matters relating to casinos, racing and gambling, and  to  provide  for
the continued regulation of those matters; establish certain  uniform  norms
and  standards  applicable  to  national  and  provincial  regulation,   and
licensing of certain  gambling  activities;  provide  for  the  creation  of
additional uniform norms and standards applicable  throughout  the  Republic
of South Africa; retain the National Gambling  Board;  repeal  the  National
Gambling Act of 1996; and, establish the national  gambling  policy  council
and provide for matters incidental thereto.

The impact of gambling on the social welfare of our families is a matter  of
serious concern. In a socioeconomic impact  assessment  study  on  gambling,
reported problems that were experienced included pensioners who gamble  with
the little money  they  have,  illegal  casinos  and  many  complaints  from
welfare organisations.

With our country's high unemployment rate of 29%, many people  believe  that
gambling is their salvation. The average gambler in South Africa is  between
30 to 50 years old, earns less than R2 500 per month and spends  on  average
10% of his or her income to win just R50. One in every seven  borrows  money
to gamble, whilst one in every four gambles with  money  normally  used  for
household  purposes.  The  impact  of  this  behaviour  on  the   poor   and
marginalised communities is devastating.

When we took over the responsibility of governing this country in  1994,  we
had  a  common  vision  and  clear  objectives  on  support  mechanisms.  We
constantly strived to  enhance  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurship,  a  civil
service  and  community  development  workers  that  would   reinforce   the
programmes of Government.

In his presidential speech, the President emphasised that, almost  10  years
after its liberation from a white minority rule,  our  country  still  faces
many challenges. Many of our people  are  unemployed.  Many  of  our  people
continue to live in poverty. Violence  against  persons  in  all  its  forms
continues to plague especially those sections  of  our  population  who  are
poor and live in socially depressed communities.

It is the responsibility of Government to protect its  citizens,  especially
the vulnerable. Although gambling premises are  situated  outside  townships
so that they are not easily reached,  pensioners  are  being  provided  with
transport and bused to casinos.

It is for these reasons that the Government has  come  up  with  a  Bill  in
order to be able to regulate the industry so as to avoid abuse  from  either
side. Society and the economy are protected against overstimulation  of  the
latent demand for gambling, and the  licensing  of  gambling  activities  is
transparent, fair and equitable.

Again,  when  considering  an  application  for  a  licence  other  than  an
employment  licence,  there  must  be  a  commitment   to   black   economic
empowerment or to  combating  the  incidence  of  addictive  and  compulsive
gambling. The committee urged the removal of ATM machines near the  gambling
venues. It was, however, not clear how far they would be  situated.  Another
problem with the ATMs, which has already been mentioned by my colleague,  is
that in casinos players can only withdraw money to play, but cannot  deposit
it into a machine.

Gauteng welcomes the fact  that  most  of  the  concerns  raised  have  been
addressed by the department, notwithstanding the fact that  a  few  of  them
were rejected. Gauteng supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and colleagues, hon  Minister,  the  gambling
industry in South Africa is still at  a  developmental  stage.  Most  impact
studies were conducted almost four years ago and  since  then  a  number  of
changes have taken  place,  such  as  an  increase  in  legalised  operating
casinos from 22 in the year 2000 to  31  currently.  Although  the  National
Lottery was launched in March 2000, it has since  increased  to  two  weekly
draws and, in  addition,  the  roll-out  of  the  so-called  limited  payout
machines was initiated in June last year.

It remains a pity that these one-armed bandits, as the Americans so  rightly
refer to them, were placed in operation with such undue haste,  without  any
countrywide research  being  available  on  how  they  would  really  affect
communities.

Current information available reveals that the gambling industry has made  a
considerable contribution to the  South  African  economy  in  the  form  of
direct  transfers  to  Government  and   by   creating   employment.   Money
transferred to provincial and  national  Government  ultimately  means  that
more  resources  are  available  for  service  delivery,  while   employment
directly benefits families and households.

However, it is easier to scientifically calculate the impact of gambling  on
the economy than determining  its  social  impact.  Determining  the  social
costs of gambling remains a challenge, and available research is  silent  on
the cost of treatment for compulsive gambling or the effect on  the  economy
of days missed from work due to gambling addiction.  In  particular,  little
information is available on the impact it  has  on  vulnerable  groups  like
children and the elderly. Research suggests that it is mostly middle to low-
income groups who frequent casinos,  spending  money  that  would  otherwise
have been used to purchase household necessities.

Between  January  and  December  2002  the  National  Responsible   Gambling
Programme helpline received 838 calls that needed  referrals.  Some  of  the
following  social  and  other  pathologies  are  outlined  by  the  National
Gambling Board as being linked to gambling, although not particularly  in  a
causal relationship:  a  relationship  between  problem  gambling  and  mood
disorders, such as depression, anxiety, guilt,  restlessness,  preoccupation
with gambling and loss of control, as well as  other  dependencies  such  as
alcohol and drugs; activities of  most  compulsive  gamblers  affecting  the
lives of family members and  friends,  while  evidence  exists  which  links
compulsive gambling to domestic  violence;  obsessive  gambling  leading  to
financial hardships for the problem gambler and family members, the  problem
being exacerbated by credit having been available for gambling.

The Bill being debated today attempts to address and rectify some  of  these
social problems and  also  others  which  I  have  not  even  mentioned.  It
proposes to abolish the National Gambling Act, Act 33 of 1996,  and  to  re-
enact many of its provisions  in  a  new  form,  while  adding  several  new
provisions. It introduces new  policies  for  the  concurrent  national  and
provincial regulations of casinos, racing, gambling and wagering. It  makes,
among  other  things,  provision  for  the  introduction  of   prohibitions,
requirements and standards to reduce  the  harmful  social  consequences  of
compulsive and addictive gambling.

The  Bill  prohibits  interactive  gambling,  that  is  gambling  over   the
Internet, except as authorised in terms of this Bill or  other  legislation.
It also introduces a scheme of voluntary and  court-ordered  exclusion  from
gambling of persons who may be at risk of addictive gambling.

Furthermore, it makes provision that gambling debt incurred by  a  minor  or
an excluded person,  or  incurred  by  anyone  in  the  course  of  unlawful
gambling, not be enforceable. Winnings of unlawful gambling will be  subject
to forfeiture by the state. The Bill aims to, inter alia,  provide  for  the
interrelationship  between  the  provincial  regulatory  agencies  and   the
existing National Gambling Board, and to  establish  the  National  Gambling
Council -  a  new  intergovernmental  consultative  body.  It  requires  the
gambling industry to  fund  broad-based  education,  training  and  research
programmes aimed at minimising the harmful effects of gambling.

Chairperson, the NNP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, I now  call  Ms  Witbooi,  the  MEC  for
tourism and gambling, Western Cape.

Me J WITBOOI (Wes-Kaap): Agb Voorsitter, agb lede en agb Minister, die  Wes-
Kaapse provinsie ondersteun in wese die wetsontwerp voor die Raad.

Omdat casino's, wedrenne, dobbelary en weddenskappe ingevolge Skedule 4  van
die Grondwet funksionele gebiede van meewerkende  nasionale  en  provinsiale
wetgewende bevoegdheid is, is ons terdeë bewus van die  nodigheid  om,  waar
enigsins moontlik, eenvormigheid te bewerkstellig onder  die  wetgewing  van
die onderskeie provinsies en wetgewing op nasionale vlak.

Insoverre die wetsontwerp op nasionale dobbelary daarop gemik is  om  gelyke
benaderings, standaarde en praktyke tussen alle provinsies daar te  stel  en
sodoende 'n eenvormige regulerende raamwerk vir die  dobbelbedryf  in  Suid-
Afrika daar te stel, word dit deur die provinsie verwelkom.

Soos ons weet, word dobbelary wêreldwyd streng gereguleer en beheer. In  dié
verband moet erken word  dat,  terwyl  dié  bedryf  baie  voordele  vir  die
ekonomie van die land en die onderskeie provinsies kan inhou, die  groei  en
welslae daarvan in 'n groot mate  afhanklik  is  van  openbare  vertroue  en
oortuiging  dat  dobbelary  en  wedrenne  eerlik,  kompeterend  en  vry  van
kriminele of korrupte elemente beoefen word.  Slegs  streng  regulering  van
alle persone, persele, praktyke en aktiwiteite met betrekking tot  dobbelary
en wedrenne sal openbare vertroue in die bedryf  verseker.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms  J  WITBOOI  (Western  Cape):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  members  and  hon
Minister, in essence the Western Cape province supports the Bill before  the
Council.
Because casinos, racing, gambling and wagering are, in terms of  Schedule  4
of  the  Constitution,  functional  areas  of  co-operative   national   and
provincial legislative competence, we are thoroughly aware of the  need,  if
at all possible, to establish uniformity, subject to the legislation of  the
various provinces and legislation at national level.

In as far as the National Gambling Bill is  aimed  at  establishing  similar
approaches,  standards  and  practices  between   all   provinces,   thereby
establishing a uniform regulatory framework for  the  gambling  industry  in
South Africa, it is welcomed by the province.

As we know, gambling worldwide is  strictly  regulated  and  controlled.  In
this respect one  must  admit  that,  while  this  industry  can  hold  many
advantages for the economy of the country and  its  various  provinces,  its
growth and success are to a large extent dependent on public confidence  and
the  conviction  that  gambling  and  racing  are  being  practised  fairly,
competitively  and  free  of  criminal  or  corrupt  elements.  Only  strict
regulation of all persons, premises, practices and activities in respect  of
gambling and racing will ensure public confidence in the industry.]

From a practical point of view, we are heartened by the  changes  that  have
been made to clause 14 of the Bill dealing with  the  exclusion  of  persons
from gambling premises. We believe that the procedure to be followed is  now
less rigid and more accessible, and  therefore  more  likely  to  serve  the
purpose for which it was intended.

Verder is die provinsie tevrede met die wysigings wat aan klousules  19  tot
23 van die wetsontwerp aangebring is. Die vrystelling van sekere  kategorieë
van dobbeltoestelle vir die doeleindes van  registrasie  word  verwelkom  en
sal  sinvolle  regulering  op   provinsiale,   sowel   as   nasionale   vlak
vergemaklik. [Furthermore, the province is  satisfied  with  the  amendments
effected to clauses  19  to  23  of  the  Bill.  The  exemption  of  certain
categories of gambling machines for the purpose of registration is  welcomed
and  will  facilitate  meaningful  regulation  at  provincial,  as  well  as
national level.]

As the province in which the National  Responsible  Gambling  Programme  was
pioneered,  the  Western  Cape  firmly  subscribes  to   the   notion   that
prohibiting the industry or outlawing certain  sectors  cannot  meaningfully
address the potential negative  socioeconomic  impacts  of  gambling.  These
can, however, be  effectively  managed  by  limiting  the  opportunities  to
participate in  the  licensed  industry,  regulating  licensed  participants
scrupulously and  ensuring  that  they  contribute  to  the  programme,  and
thereby heighten the  public  awareness  of  the  phenomenon  of  compulsive
gambling.

As a result,  we  support  the  views  expressed  by  the  Minister  at  the
portfolio committee hearings in respect of this Bill to the effect that  the
major policy goals of Government would be better  served  by  allowing,  but
strictly regulating, the limited gambling machine industry in this  country.
To this effect, we welcome the provisions in  the  Bill,  and  the  socially
responsible framework within which this legislation provides for the  phased
implementation of the limited gambling machine industry.

Finally, we anticipate that there will be certain  major  conflicts  between
the Bill and the regulations to be made in terms thereof, on the  one  hand,
and the corresponding provisions of provincial legislation on the other.  In
view of these conflicts, it is  foreseen  that  it  will  be  necessary  for
provinces to implement significant amendments to their existing  legislation
governing gambling.

Against this background, it is recommended that,  pending  the  finalisation
of the Bill, national regulations be drafted and provided to the  provincial
licensing authorities, allowing them sufficient time in  which  to  motivate
the necessary adjustments to their legislation to  the  relevant  provincial
parliaments.

It is, furthermore, strongly recommended  that  the  Act  and  the  national
regulations  should  come  into  effect  simultaneously  in  order  to  give
provincial licensing authorities enough  time  to  align  their  legislation
with the primary and subordinate legislation to be implemented  at  national
level. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  let  me
start off by saying that the ANC fully supports the Bill, as amended by  the
provinces and the committee, so I don't have to repeat what  has  been  said
already and bore you.

I must also add that you can see that noisemakers are absent from the  House
today. Everything is running smoothly. We've  all  agreed,  except  for  the
noisemakers who did not even participate ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Who are they?

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: I don't have to mention them.

I also want to say, because I don't  want  to  repeat  what  has  been  said
already, that in the context of the  high  unemployment  rate,  many  people
have become discouraged from looking for work and  are  tempted  to  believe
that gambling is their salvation. Millions of South Africans  face  grinding
poverty that is rooted in soaring unemployment and  low  wages.  Encouraging
or creating an environment in  which  gamblers  think  that  they  can  only
change their lives through luck, rather  than  helping  us  collectively  to
solve the challenges that we face, eventually leads to  the  destruction  of
these people's and their families' lives.

The most common forms of  gambling  are  card  games,  sporting  events  and
lottery tickets. One could have the illusion that gambling is  an  easy  and
safe way to make money. However, it is morally  and  ethically  problematic,
and the effects of a burgeoning gambling industry  are  detrimental  to  our
society.

It remains our duty to constantly investigate and ensure that  proper  means
should be found to restrict, monitor and control  gambling  to  ensure  that
the poor do not become the target market of the unscrupulous.
The Bill tabled before us today addresses three  main  issues:  measures  to
combat  addictive  and  problem  gambling,  the  need  to   limit   gambling
opportunities and the limited payout machines, the LPMs, and how  the  horse
racing industry should be treated.

Addictive gambling is considered to be a major social  problem,  similar  to
that of alcoholism. On this issue, we welcome  the  helplines  for  addicted
and problem gamblers which will be run through the  professional  institutes
and counselling sessions.

We hope that the counsellors will be able  to  assist  Government  and  help
diminish both the social and economic impact of gambling on our people in  a
quick and  comprehensive  manner,  as  the  existence  of  a  large  illegal
industry and the broader social economic impact  of  the  industry  are  yet
unclear in South Africa.

In recent times,  these  limited  payout  machines  became  part  of  a  new
gambling sector in South  Africa  in  the  absence  of  a  national  central
monitoring mechanism that could create synergy in regulating  the  roll  out
of slot machines in provinces. We welcome the commitment given  by  the  hon
Minister and members of our provincial legislatures  to  promote  mechanisms
that would give effect to co-operative governance. We therefore welcome  the
assurance by the department not to increase the number of casinos  from  the
current maximum of 40 000 to an envisaged maximum of 50 000 machines.

I understand that there are specific difficulties relating  to  gambling  on
the Internet, but I'm confident that the new  provisions  in  the  Bill  can
assist in confiscating the material gains of  illegal  gambling  operations.
In addition, they can  also  assist  us  with  the  new  envisaged  Internet
gambling legislation that will be developed in the near future.

We also acknowledge that horse racing is an industry that  is  dependent  on
gambling for its continued existence. It is not an ordinary  sport,  but  it
is a form of sport that was the only legal form of gambling and,  therefore,
had to be provided for separately,  since  policy  formulation  remains  the
domain of Government.

Similarly, we admit that problem gambling is a big issue, both in  terms  of
public perceptions and for Government in general. The  public  needs  to  be
educated in respect of the potential harmful  effects  of  gambling.  People
need to be taught that gambling was meant to be  a  form  of  entertainment,
and not something that could control their lives.

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  say  ...  nangona  ungcakazo   lusemthethweni,
kubalulekile  ukuba  sifundise  abantu  ukuba  bangaxhomekeki   kulo.   Into
eyenzekayo kukuba, abantu bathabatha nale senti yokugqibela,  yesonka,  kuba
beza kuzama-zama.

Siyi-ANC siyayibulela le ndlela uRhulumente azimisele ukwenza ngayo.  Ngoku,
nabo balala eGrand  West  banikwa  uphum'  aphele.  Enkosi,  Mam'  uSihlalo.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... that although gambling is legal,  it  is  important  for  us  to  teach
people not to get addicted to it. What often happens  is  that  people  take
the very last cent, meant to buy bread with, to try their luck.

As the ANC we are  grateful  for  the  Government's  new  approach  in  this
regard. Those who sleep over at Grand West are given their marching  orders.
Thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]]

The  MINISTER  OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Madam  Chair,  my  thanks  to  the
colleagues and to the provincial special delegates for the support that  the
Bill has received. I believe that we have acted wisely in this  matter,  and
consultation has been important.

Let me touch on a few issues that have been raised,  because  I  think  they
are important issues. There was a suggestion that  possibly  advertising  in
relation to the lottery was somehow easier, or the dispensation  was  easier
than that for gambling. I would like to stress that one of the tasks of  the
National Lotteries Board is, in fact, to address advertising. The  mechanism
is probably a lot easier than it is in the  Gambling  Act,  because  it's  a
direct condition of their licence  and  the  board  can  intervene  and  has
intervened on a number of occasions to address the  advertising  around  the
lottery.

As in the Lotteries Act, the intent is clear, that one  can  advertise,  but
not in the manner that in any way induces, through unfair representation  of
what's possible and what the prospects are. I will return to this matter  of
the conduct of the industry at the end.

Horse racing, for the reasons that many of the delegates have outlined,  was
taken out of the Bill. It would be my view that inevitably there  should  be
some national framework for this and we will  continue  the  dialogue,  both
with provinces and the industry. The structure of the industry, as  you  are
all familiar, is essentially national now. So we need  to  have  a  look  at
that.

With regard to the limited payout machines,  let  me  really  stress  a  few
points here: One is that evidence from other jurisdictions  makes  it  clear
that these machines are actually  and  potentially  the  areas  of  gambling
where addictive gambling can be most problematic by far.  I  think  our  own
caution with regard to the machines arose from the studies  that  were  done
in other jurisdictions. There were many problems with the provisions in  the
Act, and how these machines would be introduced, which have taken us a  long
time to try and resolve.

There's obviously  also  some  degree  of  tension  between  allowing  these
machines, which are a form of gambling, to proliferate outside  the  casinos
and then want to have the lottery as well as a form of  utilising  gambling,
if you like, to raise funds for good causes, and  this  balance  has  to  be
struck.

I want to stress, once again, that our  intention  in  insisting  that  each
machine is linked to a central system is not to take  away  any  power  from
provinces, it is to put in place what  we  believe  is  the  only  workable,
equitable and effective way of doing this. If each province wants to  go  it
alone or a few of the provinces want to pool their resources  and  have  one
system, the truth is that the costs for the smaller provinces rise, and  our
ability to monitor in those smaller provinces deteriorates and  our  ability
to have a national picture of what's happening deteriorates as well.

Now, it has been argued many a time that each province could  have  its  own
system and interface at  the  national  level.  Well,  that  is  technically
possibly feasible. However, every study we've done, everything we've  looked
at has shown that the technicalities of it are  problematic  to  the  degree
that it outweighs the far simpler, more efficient  and  more  cost-effective
mechanism of having one.

So it's my sincere hope that in KZN we can reach an accommodation  on  this.
We've tried our very best and I really think that  it  would  be  useful.  I
must say, as I have said time  and  time  again,  if  I  fail  to  reach  an
accommodation, I will push  the  rights  that  national  Government  has  to
enforce the law. However, I would prefer that we all come to our  senses  on
this matter. I really can't see the logic of each province trying to  get  a
separate system.

Let me also indicate, as the hon MEC suggested, that this experience of  the
new Bill has, I think, for the first time really led  to  a  very  good  and
effective relationship between the national and the  provincial  structures.
The Bill has benefited from that, there's no  question  about  it.  I  think
that it's indicated to us that actually we can regulate this  industry  more
effectively if we work together.

I think you're quite correct: There's  going  to  be  some  tension  between
existing Acts and regulations and what's there,  and  the  task  teams  have
been working already and we'll continue to work on that, because we do  need
to implement a clean system without too many contradictions and problems  in
it between the provinces and elsewhere.

Here again, as many members have stated, fundamentally, if we can  all  have
a common approach to this industry based on common sense, reality  and  care
for our people, we can make it a good industry, and that is, as many of  you
have said, we feel that to try and illegalise gambling  is  merely  to  make
criminals out of ordinary people and create criminality around  an  industry
when we shouldn't have that. So we need to make it legal and  we  must  then
regulate it in a manner that meets all of our objectives. I think we can  do
that.

I think it would be a mistake for the industry  -  and  I'm  sure  they  are
alive to this - to  underestimate  how  quickly  popular  feeling  can  rise
against this industry. There's  no  question  that  on  the  limited  payout
machines, if you'd ask for a vote in  both  Houses,  I  think  the  majority
votes would say:  ``Don't  introduce  them.''  I  think  that  the  industry
suddenly realised that, contrary to the Minister being  the  obstacle,  what
they had to understand was that this was perceived, by popular  opinion,  as
a potential threat to the wellbeing  of  our  peoples  and  communities.  So
again, we've reached a sensible compromise, which is to allow them,  but  to
phase them in.

I will certainly consult with provinces on the matter. I have no  intention,
as a Minister - and I'm sure it would be unwise for any  future  Minister  -
on a matter like this, to try and  impose  a  national  viewpoint  when  the
province  is  working  on  the  ground.  I  want  to   stress   this,   that
fundamentally the industry  is  best  regulated  by  the  structure  of  co-
operative governance  that  we  have,  because  you  cannot  deal  with  the
intricacies of gambling on the  ground  that  effectively  from  a  national
viewpoint as  you  could  from  a  provincial  viewpoint.  So  it's  a  good
partnership that we should keep going.

I'm  confident  that  the   organised   industry   is   cognisant   of   its
responsibilities - it has representatives here  today.  I'm  very  confident
that they are cognisant of their responsibilities and will  work  to  ensure
that members of the industry conduct themselves correctly  because,  if  any
one member doesn't, this popular pressure will  arise.  I  think  that  it's
important that we continue the kind of partnership that  we  have  with  the
industry and, where we've agreed, that in  fact  those  actions  taken  with
regard to dealing with problem gambling are dealt with by the industry on  a
voluntary basis.

The Act, I think, is more precise now as to what you must do,  and  I  think
that's good. However, we have a partnership with  the  industry  where  they
have to carry out the work, and I think that this is the  correct  approach,
which I hope we keep. It's my  hope  that  the  industry  will  continue  to
conduct itself in the manner  that  it  has,  and  apart  from  the  illegal
operators and one or  two  rotten  eggs,  I  think  that  the  industry  has
conducted itself well.

I would like to thank the National Gambling Board for all the  work  they've
done and wish the chairperson, Mr Chris Fismer, and Adv Moyake, as  a  chief
executive officer, well. They've got a lot of work to do  in  the  industry.
Good luck, and thank you very much  to  the  House  for  supporting  what  I
believe is a sound piece of legislation for this industry. [Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SC ON ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON SA CUSTOMS
   UNION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA, THE
  KINGDOM OF LESOTHO, THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
                        AND THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  I  thank  you  for  this
chance to make a statement. I realise that this is not a debate but  I  also
thank the chairperson of the select committee for allowing me  to  speak.  I
do it for three reasons, one is, once again, because it  will  be  the  last
formal chance I have to  speak  in  this  House,  and  I  have  enjoyed  the
environment and the conduct here.

Secondly, I do believe that this is an agreement  that  is  of  considerable
importance, not just for South Africa or the Customs  Union,  but  it  is  a
step in the right direction for Africa's economic integration.

The agreement, as you know, is in fact extremely old and was imposed by  the
British  imperial  and  colonial  powers  and  then  renegotiated  in  1969.
However,  the  agreement  that  we  inherited  had  three  very  fundamental
shortcomings: Firstly, it was  essentially  undemocratic  in  its  decision-
making. South Africa had all the power to make  decisions.  Secondly,  these
decisions made by South Africa did create  a  high  degree  of  polarisation
within the Customs Union and certainly the patterns of industralisation  and
development have been very, very uneven.

Thirdly, the revenue-sharing formula  had  begun  to  have  a  very  adverse
impact on South Africa because the formula allowed for payments  that  could
well have been in excess of what was brought in. There were years in  recent
times where the amounts that are to be paid jumped dramatically  without  us
being part of that at all.

The new agreement is really a major step forward in economic integration.  I
think it establishes very  clearly  a  common  structure,  common  decision-
making. It alters the revenue formula and  we  have  an  explicit  component
that deals with development for those economies that are  heavily  dependent
on the revenue coming from the Customs Union.

It  also  would  streamline  and  improve  a  lot  of  dimensions  of  trade
administration such as antidumping actions, issuing of permits  for  exports
and imports where that applies.

The agreement has also opened new and interesting  areas  of  potential  co-
operation. In industrial policy the prospect  of  competition  law  is  also
dealt with and is envisaged in this agreement. So, by ratifying it in  South
Africa, the agreement will come into force and it will allow us  to  proceed
onto some of these very interesting areas of our action  to  further  deepen
the  economic  co-operation  and  integration  between  the  Customs   Union
members.

There have  been  some  misgivings  as  to  whether  the  structure  of  the
agreement will mean that processes will  be  slower.  I  think  this  is  an
important challenge that we all face in establishing institutions together.

However, I must say that since we have started to work as a  common  Customs
Union in our trade negotiations, for example in  the  free  trade  agreement
negotiations with the United States, the negotiating team  is  a  SACU  team
and all member states participate, what we are finding is that by having  to
work together  in  these  extremely  complicated  agreements,  we  are  very
rapidly building tremendous capacity in the Customs Union. I am  very  proud
to be able to say that.

I think if you look around the world from the point of view of the  Southern
African Customs Union, you see Ministers  playing  a  very  important  role.
Minister Jacob Mathate from Botswana, has very, very ably  chaired  the  SCP
African-Carribean-Pacific. Minister Mphobadi from Lesotho has played a  very
critical role in all the big WTO meetings by assisting  the  chair  on  many
occasions and playing a very important role in the LDCs  or  least-developed
countries.

So, I think the type of capacity that we are building  by  working  together
is testimony to how constructive these kinds of co-operation agreements  can
be in achieving the goal that we all want to achieve in Africa, that is  our
joint African development.

So, I think it is a very historic agreement. It  is  an  extremely  advanced
form of economic co-operation and it is a matter of great pride to  us  that
we have been able to bring about this new agreement  in  the  Customs  Union
and have the support of Parliament in  doing  it.  Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I  want  to  believe
that this is also my parting shot as well, as I am standing  up  here  today
to speak, I think, for the last time in this term of this Parliament.

I think the Minister has actually said it all. Maybe I will  just  reiterate
some of the things that the  Minister  indicated  here.  The  South  African
Customs Union Agreement was signed for the first time in  1910  between  the
then  Union  of  South  Africa  and  the  then  so-called  High   Commission
Territories of Bechunaland, Basothuland and Swaziland.

When Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland  attained  their  independence  in  the
60s, a necessity arose for a review of the 1910 agreement. This resulted  in
the signing of a new agreement among these  four  states  in  1969.  I  must
indicate that in 1990 the independent Namibia also joined SACU.

We must hasten to say  that  the  two  agreements  referred  to  above  were
heavily loaded in favour  of  apartheid  South  Africa.  In  essence,  South
Africa then bulldozed these countries into these agreements  that  can  best
be  described  as  instruments  to  bridge  the  gap   between   politically
unfriendly neighbours that shared an integrated economy dominated  by  South
Africa.

In the meantime, the people of South Africa were  engaged  in  a  relentless
struggle to realise the lofty  ideals  of  freedom  and  independence.  That
struggle, as we all know, triumphed in 1994,  where  we,  on  the  ruins  of
apartheid, built for ourselves a united and democratic South Africa.

It would, therefore, be morally wrong for a free South Africa to  perpetuate
its dominance over  its  Southern  Africa  neighbours  through  that  unholy
agreement.

The new situation in Southern Africa necessitated the negotiation of  a  new
revenue-sharing agreement based on equity and  democratic  principles.  What
we are tabling today in this House is a new product  of  negotiations  among
the five SACU member states as equal partners.
The main objectives of the agreement, among other things, are to  facilitate
cross-border movement  of  goods  between  the  territories  of  the  member
states; create effective,  transparent  and  democratic  institutions  which
will ensure equitable trade  benefits  for  its  member  states;  facilitate
equitable sharing of revenue arising  from  custom,  excise  and  additional
duties  levied  by  its  member  states,  and  also  establish  SACU  as  an
international organisation open to other countries  that  subscribe  to  its
ideals.

The agreement provides for the  establishment  of  a  council  of  Ministers
composed of at least one Minister from each member state. This council  will
be the supreme decision-making body of SACU.  It  also  establishes  Customs
Union Commission made up of senior  government  officials  and  a  permanent
secretariat that will be responsible for the  day  to  day  running  of  the
organisation.

We all know that where there are different countries in an  organisation  at
different levels of development, disputes are bound to arise. To  this  end,
a tribunal is established to adjudicate whenever disputes arise  between  or
amongst these countries.

As a committee, we are  convinced  that  this  new  agreement  represents  a
victory for the people of our five countries. It  will  go  a  long  way  in
bettering the lives of, not only South Africans, but  those  of  the  entire
subregion.

It will encourage economic development and integration of the  economies  of
our five countries to the advantage of us all. This is also necessitated  by
the fact that history has  put  us  together  and  we  can  either  flourish
together as a region or perish together, for we are in the same boat.

We call upon this honourable House to ratify this agreement. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  that  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  Section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' vote. Are they all present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declaration of vote, if they so wish. Is  there  any  province
that wishes to do so? None. We shall  now  proceed  to  the  voting  on  the
question. I shall do this in alphabetical  order  per  province.  Delegation
heads must please indicate  to  the  Chair  whether  they  vote  in  favour,
against or abstain. Eastern Cape?

          INTEGRATED MEASURES FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AND FOOD SECURITY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson, hon members, ladies and gentlemen. Yesterday  in  the  NA,  the
Minister of Finance  tabled  the  Drought  Relief  Adjustment  Appropriation
Bill. This Bill enables us as Government to make available  other  financial
resources that will enable the various departments to respond to  challenges
that our communities are facing as a result of the current drought that  has
had a negative impact on our society's social welfare.

This Appropriation Bill follows another allocation that was  made  available
in the 2003 Adjustment Estimates of an amount of R250 million for  emergency
drought relief, as well as  for  other  disasters  that  have  affected  our
provinces. Today's debate will enable us as Government to  share  in  detail
with you, as public representatives of our people, on the measures  that  we
have taken thus far in responding to the drought situation  that  is  facing
us currently, as well  as  the  policy  environment  that  was  adopted,  in
dealing with disasters in general.

It will also be necessary, in  my  view,  to  also  touch  on  the  regional
situation with regard to the same issue and what we are  doing  as  part  of
the Southern African Regional Community - SADC.
Before we deal with what we have done, I want us to remember where  we  come
from as this democratic state, in relation  to  response  to  disasters  and
drought in particular. Lest we forget, in 1999 Cabinet  approved  the  White
Paper on Disaster Management. The Disaster  Management  Policy  pursues  the
Constitutional obligation as set out in terms of section 1(b), which  states
that all spheres of Government are required to secure the well-being of  the
people of the Republic. Part A of Schedule 4 of the Constitution  identifies
disaster  management  and  other  related  issues  as  areas  of  concurrent
national and provincial legislative competencies.

A further fundamental purpose of the policy is to advocate  an  approach  to
disaster management that focuses on reducing the  risks  of  life,  economic
loss and damage to property; especially in those sections of the  population
who are most vulnerable due to poverty and general  lack  of  resources.  It
also aims to protect the environment.

In short, the policy aims to do the following, if I may say so:  to  provide
an enabling environment for disaster management in our country;  to  provide
proactive and disaster management  risk  reduction  programmes;  to  improve
South  Africa's  ability  to  manage  emergencies  or  disasters  and  their
consequences in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner;  to  promote
integrated and co-ordinated disaster management through partnership  between
different stakeholders and co-operative relationship between all spheres  of
our  Government.  It  also  seeks  to   ensure   that   adequate   financial
arrangements are in place, as well as promote disaster  management  training
and community awareness.

This approach to the management of disasters involves a shift  away  from  a
perception that disasters are rare occurrences  managed  by  emergencies  or
rescue instruments  and  support  services,  but  rather  it  sees  disaster
management as a shared responsibility between  Government  and  its  people.
Therefore it  underlies  the  important  element  of  shared  awareness  and
responsibility that we need to create in order to reduce risk in our  homes,
communities, places of work and in society in general.

The question may therefore arise from you:  What  has  been  done  thus  far
after the adoption of policy? One of the immediate  things  that  Government
did was to ensure that we set up our instruments. We ensure that at  Cabinet
level, there is an ongoing interministerial Cabinet  committee,  chaired  by
the Minister for Provincial and Local Government, whose task  is  to  ensure
that all relevant departments participate in  a  co-ordinated  way  when  we
have to respond to disasters. It was  also  responsible  for  ensuring  that
both provincial and local governments set up the same committees  to  ensure
that there can be a speedy response. But it is true for all of us, that  the
most important structures are those at  a  local  level.  They  are  at  the
coalface of the challenges when they occur, but also, they are  most  closer
to our communities, should disaster arise.

These structures  help  us  with  information  gathering  and  dissemination
thereof, but also ensure that when there are relief measures put  in  place,
they can actually act as a distribution chain.  It  is  also  true  that  we
still need to do more, particularly in terms of technical support to  ensure
that these structures can undertake their long-term objective of being  able
to respond as quickly as possible.

If you look at what has happened, particularly in the first 10 years of  our
democratic Government, where we have had some  of  the  challenges  such  as
floods in 2001, Government was prepared, both  in  terms  of  its  technical
capacity as well as resources, to respond  immediately  to  such  disasters.
Budget has always ensured that it accommodates  through  contingency  funds,
resources for responding to any disaster, should it arise.

In looking at the current drought, one can  say  that  it  found  us  better
prepared because, as a country, we acknowledge that we  are  in  a  drought-
prone region. Therefore, our rains are sometimes scarce and erratic  in  the
different parts of our country. Also, it came to  us  when  we  were  better
prepared, because from 1999 onwards, we  were  aware  that  climatic  change
worldwide had resulted in an El Nino or La  Nina  events,  even  though  the
intensity and impacts may differ spatially. In certain parts  of  the  world
there have been severe floods, droughts and heat waves as well as  snow,  as
we know that in our country in parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape  and
the Free State, we had some snow at the wrong time of year. In our view,  it
was at the wrong time if we compare it to  our  climatic  conditions  as  we
know them.

It is also true that as early as 2002, the SA Weather  Service  had  already
forecasted that less rainfall will be realised in the year  2002-03  season.
However, this condition was also persistent in 2003-04 cycle. This led to  a
situation  where  particularly  the  Department  of  Provincial  and   Local
Government, as well as the Departments Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,  did
send some warning signals, particularly  to  our  farmers,  with  regard  to
these weather forecasts.

Farmers were informed on what they need to do  to  mitigate  the  impact  of
this drought. Livestock farmers in particular were advised to  reduce  their
stock to  enable  them  to  rotate  the  animals  between  camps  and  avoid
mortalities and overgrazing.

However, as we all know, some people do respond, but others take a wait-and-
see approach which, in some situations, has a worsening  impact.  Given  the
2002-03 summer rainfall figures, it was clear therefore that the  levels  of
our dams were going to be a bit lower if  no  rains  came  at  a  particular
time. It was also clear that, in terms of our moisture in the  soil,  if  no
rain came at a particular time, we would face some  challenges.  Indeed,  as
we  predicted,  last  year  by  April  the  province  of   Limpopo   started
experiencing some drought. Again, as Government, we acted swiftly to  ensure
that  we  assisted  particularly  those  districts  in  Limpopo  that   were
affected.

In our own analysis the 2002-03  summer  rainfall  conditions  had  affected
mostly the provinces of  Limpopo,  Mpumalanga,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Northern
Cape. As we know though, in other provinces, in the season  of  2003-04  the
situation also became worse.
We are also aware that those provinces which had  veld  fires,  particularly
towards October last year, also faced some challenges because  some  of  the
grazing land in their areas was affected. This has not only impacted on  our
farming communities. Our approach as Government has  been  to  look  at  the
overall the impact to a number of our sectors of society that were  affected
by this drought.

First and foremost, the majority of people, even those who are not  farmers,
were affected by the lower water levels in our dams.  In  some  areas  water
restrictions  were  actually  implemented  and  therefore,   in   the   2003
Adjustment Estimates, the Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  was
given money to ensure that they could respond to supplying  emergency  water
supplies, particularly to those communities that were already vulnerable.

We  were  also  aware  that,  because  of  the  challenges  in  the  farming
community, not only  farmers  were  going  to  be  affected,  but  also  the
farmworkers. Therefore, in terms of our response as Government,  we  ensured
that we would need to put some money aside so  that  those  communities  and
families who would  be  affected  may  actually  get  some  form  of  social
security grant in order to mitigate the impending problem.

We also appealed to our farming community that they should respond in a  way
in which it would not, in large measures,  result  in  a  number  of  people
being unemployed, particularly those who are farmworkers.

We were also aware that in most instances the challenges of drought do  have
an impact on the health conditions of our people, particularly as  a  result
of the diseases that usually occur during  droughts,  such  as  cholera  and
malaria in particular. Therefore, as part  of  our  integrated  approach  we
agreed that as our response to this job we will take  measures  with  regard
to health, water accessibility, both for human  consumption  and  livestock,
and at the same time assist some  of  those  farmers  who  still  had  their
livestock and did not sell them off or provide them with fodder so that  the
animals can have something to eat.

However, at the same time we should ensure that the way in which we  prepare
our water emergencies will assist with the boreholes,  and  we  should  work
with  municipalities  so   that   where   some   of   the   boreholes   need
rehabilitation, we can have some resources to do so.

However, we are all aware that the impact that may be  felt  in  the  short-
term now might actually take a little bit longer and therefore  a  long-term
recovery strategy is required on how we assist those communities to go  back
particularly in production and to normality.

It is for that reason that Minister Manuel yesterday in  his  Budget  Speech
highlighted that, should there be a need for resources  to  this  effect  in
terms of the medium and long-term aspects, we  should  have  some  resources
available, over and above the resources that have already been allocated.

We are also aware, in terms of our planning, that as it always happens in  a
number of situations where drought is usually followed by  floods,  that  we
need  to  work  with  the  Department  of  Housing,  both  at  national  and
provincial levels. This is to ensure that we are prepared, should  there  be
any impact that would affect some other people, for example in the  loss  of
their dwellings if a flood disaster should follow such a drought.

At  the  same  time,  in  terms  of  our   national   regulatory   services,
particularly  in  agriculture,  we  have  ensured  that  we  strengthen  our
capacity to respond to  some  of  the  animal  diseases  such  as  the  pest
diseases that usually follow any form of the drought when it  is  broken  by
heavy rains.

This, in our view, shows a holistic way in which  we,  as  this  Government,
are dealing with the drought situation  that  is  facing  us  currently  and
also, in general, the situation of managing disaster  in  a  way  that  will
reduce the impact to our communities.

As I said earlier, I will touch on the subject  of  the  SADC,  because  the
drought that we are experiencing in South Africa is also  being  experienced
by other members of our SADC community. The chairperson of  SADC,  President
Mkapa of Tanzania, has convened  an  extraordinary  summit  which  has  been
preceded by a ministerial meeting on 14 February, to deliberate and  discuss
strategies of what we would need to do as the region in order to  deal  with
this impact, particularly on a number  of  our  vulnerable  communities,  as
well as on our livestock.

It is our hope that the proposals that the Ministers have made in  terms  of
what would need to be done, would also be endorsed by our  heads  of  states
and governments, so that we, as  a  region,  are  able  to  respond  to  the
challenges of this drought and its impact on our society this time.

I also want to say that part of the rapid response has been assisted by  the
manner in which we have been  able  to  work  with  our  colleagues  in  the
provinces, as well as in local  government.  When  we  first  heard  of  the
challenges of the drought, the MECs responsible for managing  disasters,  as
well as those various  MECs  who  participate  in  the  disaster  management
committees, were able to ensure that we  do  an  assessment  as  quickly  as
possible, for us to be able to give resources that are required to  mitigate
this problem.

I would also like to thank organised agriculture for their  speedy  response
in working with us in trying to do  assessments  so  that  we  can  have  an
appreciation of the extent of the problem that we are  facing.  However,  it
is also necessary for  me  to  appeal  particularly  to  our  financial  and
commercial sector, for they would have to manage the debt, as  well  as  the
repayments that may be required at this stage, and they  would  need  to  be
sensitive, without reducing their responsibility or undermining it in  terms
of lending. They  should  take  into  consideration  the  impact  that  this
drought will have on the farming sector, in particular.

I would like to say that as  we  as  a  Government  are  going  forward,  we
continue to improve our response. At other levels the improvements  we  have
made with regard to varieties, particularly that of  seeds  and  plants,  as
well as animal improvements - to ensure that we can have better  herds  such
as  Nguni  and  Afrikaner  cattle  -  would  help  to  stabilise  positions,
particularly for the livestock farmers who are operating  in  this  drought-
prone region. Agricultural research will continue to be  done  in  order  to
ensure that the technological choices that we  make  as  a  country  and  as
farmers, would help us to better respond in such situations. [Applause.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
members of this House, I would like to greet  everyone  in  the  NCOP.  Rain
must fall and small rivers must fill big rivers, and the  big  dams  of  our
country should overflow with water.

Drought challenges  a  nation  to  clean  up  its  wicked  ways.  To  humble
ourselves before God and the Creator of  all  shall  bring  healing  to  our
country. There is a saying that when something  that  one  has  relied  upon
disappears, one should know that problems  have  arrived.  When  things  are
tough, a real mother is the one who stands  up  for  her  children.  Another
saying goes: Make hay while the sun shines.]

As someone coming from  the  North  West  province,  which  is  one  of  the
provinces hardest hit by drought, this debate  on  drought  relief  is  very
close to my heart. I have seen the suffering our people are enduring in  the
area due to drought. Therefore, I support the drought relief fund put  aside
by our  Government,  which  is  not  only  focused  on  one  sector  of  the
community, but is aimed at assisting all the people affected by drought.

Due to less rainfall experienced during the 2002-03 season, South Africa  is
experiencing a severe drought. The situation is not going to  improve  soon,
as rainfall is expected to be below normal for the 2003-04  season,  as  the
Minister has said.

We should not underestimate the impact of drought on the  economy  of  South
Africa. The impact will be drastic if measures are not taken  soon  to  deal
with the situation. It is estimated that 40%  of  the  country's  population
depends on agriculture-related industries.

Agriculture accounts for  4,5%  of  the  GDP  of  South  Africa,  while  the
agrofood complex accounts for  9%.  Macrocommercial  farmers  contribute  to
about 11% of total formal employment, and are  thus  providing  to  about  6
million family members. In addition, small  farmers  provide  livelihood  to
their family members and provide  occasional  employment  to  about  50  000
people. This information was obtained from Drought Update No 1, 22  December
2003.  All this shows that agriculture is  a  very  crucial  sector  of  our
economy.

Geeneen kan ontken dat droogte 'n  negatiewe  impak  op  die  produksie  van
mielies, sonneblomme, soja en suikerriet het nie. Dit skep  die  gevaar  van
groot voedseltekorte. Vee word dan ook geweldig geaffekteer.  Groot  getalle
plaaswerkers staan  'n  kans  om  hul  werk  te  verloor  indien  plaasboere
afdankings as hul enigste uitweg sien. Die stap sal lei tot 'n  verlies  aan
inkomste en, gepaardgaande daarmee, 'n verlies aan koopkrag vir voedsel.

Behalwe vir lae reënval,  affekteer  veldbrande  ook  die  weivelde  en  dit
beïnvloed damvlakke. Dit  werk  negatief  in  op  drinkwater  vir  vee.  Die
skaarsheid van water vir besproeiing,  sanitasie  en  menslike  en  dierlike
gebruik kan siektes tot gevolg hê, soos die Minister gesê het.
Ek wil graag die departement en die Ministerie  bedank  vir  die  aanvanklik
stappe wat deur hulle ingestel is en wat die kwessie  van  droogtes  ernstig
aanspreek om sodoende die lewensgehalte van alle Suid-Afrikaners, veral  die
armstes van die armes, te verbeter.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[No one can deny that drought has a negative impact  on  the  production  of
mealies, sunflowers, soya beans and sugar cane. It  creates  the  danger  of
huge food shortages. Livestock is also affected greatly then. Large  numbers
of farm workers stand a chance to lose their jobs if farmers  see  dismissal
as their only way out. This step will  lead  to  a  loss  of  income  and  a
concomitant loss of food buying power.

Apart  from  low  rainfall,  veld  fires  also  affect  pasturage  and  this
influences dam  levels.  This  negatively  impacts  on  drinking  water  for
livestock. The scarcity of water for irrigation, sanitation  and  human  and
animal use can cause diseases, as the Minister has mentioned.
I would like to  thank  the  department  and  the  Ministry  for  the  steps
initially  introduced  by  them,  which  seriously  address  the  issue   of
droughts, in so doing to improve the quality of life of all South  Africans,
especially the poorest of the poor.]

In response to the distress caused by the  continuing  drought  to  sectors,
such as agriculture and local government,  and  its  impact  on  poor  rural
communities, a comprehensive drought mitigation programme has  been  put  in
place by Government to assist the affected areas.  The  programme  has  been
drawn up by the Disaster Task Team, set up by the  Minister  for  Provincial
and Local Government, Mr Mufamadi, in September 2003.

The task team comprises the  Departments  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
Social Development and Agriculture, as well as the  National  Treasury.  The
Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  is   the   co-ordinating
department. This  shows  that  we  acknowledge  that  dealing  with  drought
disaster needs an integrated approach where all departments  that  can  help
pool all their resources and work together.

The role of the task team was to  review  the  impact  of  the  drought  and
measures taken to date to mitigate its effects. It  identified  agriculture,
drinking water supplies and municipal water  as  the  main  areas  requiring
intervention. It formed an Interdepartmental Disaster Management  Committee,
consisting of Ministers from identified departments, to  drive  the  process
of dealing with drought and other disasters.

Steps were  already  taken  last  year  by  the  Interdepartmental  Disaster
Management Committee to mitigate the impact of the current drought.  It  had
been monitoring the situation and consulting with relevant  stakeholders  on
interventions required. The  interministerial  task  team,  co-ordinated  by
Minister Mufamadi, has toured affected areas to  really  assess  the  damage
caused by drought to families and farmers in different provinces.

Last year an amount of R250 million was made available to  affected  sectors
and communities for drought relief measures. Part of this money was used  to
subsidise fodder for livestock and to drill new boreholes.  Money  available
to provinces, which is  70%  of  the  money,  was  distributed  as  follows:
Limpopo R33,3  million,  Western  Cape  R10  million,  Northern  Cape  R68,7
million, Eastern Cape R12,7 million and Free State R10 million.

With the situation not getting better, our President, Thabo Mbeki,  declared
some areas disaster areas in six of  the  country's  nine  provinces  on  16
January 2004. These were KwaZulu-Natal,  Eastern  Cape,  Free  State,  North
West, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga. This  declaration  will  allow  national
emergency funds to go to these areas. Thank you.

Ms E C GOUWS: Thank  you,  Deputy  Chairperson.  The  farmers  are  doing  a
praiseworthy and sometimes thankless job. They are  small  in  numbers,  but
have to feed over 40 million South  Africans  and  also  a  few  million  in
Southern Africa.

We are quick to criticise and moan about the prices of food  on  our  table,
but spare a thought for those who have to defy the elements and keep on  and
on despite floods, droughts, fire or snow. We, the thankless public,  should
rather laud these men and women and do  everything  to  support  and  enable
them in their struggle to feed the nation.

When I think of the farmers of our land, whether  they  are  small  farmers,
new farmers or commercial farmers, these words by Charles Kingsley  describe
these special people best:


  The men whom I have seen succeeded best in life have always been cheerful
  and hopeful men, who went about their business  with  a  smile  on  their
  faces, and took the changes and chances of this  mortal  life  like  men,
  facing tough and smooth alike as it comes!

Hats off to our brother and sister farmers. Our country is in the  grips  of
a  devastating  drought,  and  we  welcome  and  acknowledge   the   drought
assistance by the Government, but we  want  to  caution  the  Government  to
treat all farmers alike.

Our commercial farmers - let me highlight this - of all races are among  the
best in the world. They have to  contend,  as  all  small  farmers,  with  a
plethora of problems -  the  vagaries  of  the  weather,  constant  drought,
rising taxes and municipal levies, and excessively high toll road costs.

There were 20 000 job losses in South Africa in the first quarter  of  2003.
South Africa's third largest singular employer  group  is  the  agricultural
sector. It employs approximately 600 00 people -  more  than  400  000  down
since 1992. This figure will certainly continue on a downward trend  as  the
realities of the disasters strike our country.

As die elemente teen die boere draai, dan kry  alle  boere  swaar.  Uit  die
aard van die saak sal die klein boere en die nuwe boere  se  probleme  mense
se harte en verbeelding aangryp. Natuurlik, as 'n boer  se  hele  rykdom  10
beeste is en hy verloor alles weens  omstandighede  buite  sy  beheer,  moet
daar vir hom hulp kom. As 'n klein boer  met  een  hektaar  vrugtebome  alle
vrugte weens 'n haelstorm vertoor, moet daar hulp wees.

Kommersiële boere word ook deur die elemente en omstandighede getref.  Hulle
verloor  ook  alles,  maar  meer  mense  word  geraak.  Die  boer   het   'n
kontantvloeiprobleem, en  om  te  oorleef  word  onder  andere  plaaswerkers
afgedank. Dit veroorsaak 'n kettingreaksie wat baie mense sonder kos laat.

My party verwelkom werklik die bykomende droogtehulp van R250 miljoen,  maar
ons  wil  'n  beroep  doen  op  doeltreffende,  regverdige  en  spoedeisende
beskikbaarstelling.

Die behoefte  aan  'n  rampbestuurstrategie  op  die  lang  termyn  het  nou
onontbeerlik vir hierdie land geword.

Suid-Afrika kan nie langer geld en ander rampmaatreëls  so  lukraak  bestuur
nie.  'n  Strategie  vir  rampbestuur  met  'n  toepaslike  begroting   moet
voortydig gevestig word. Ons moet voorbereid  wees  vir  toekomstige  rampe.
Suid-Afrika is 'n land  waar  droogtes  en  natuurrampe  byna  met  gereelde
reëlmaat voorkom.

'n Aansienlike deel van die voorgestelde droogtebystand is bedoel  om  klein
boere wat geen oes gaan hê nie se  huishoudings  van  voedsel  te  voorsien.
Daar is geen fout daarmee nie; dit is prysenswaardig.  Die  vergunning  word
nou ook uitgebrei na plaaswerkers op kommersiële  plase,  hoewel  hulle  nog
steeds hulle volle salarisse ontvang.

My party glo egter dat benewens hierdie vergunning, die uitbreiding van  die
droogtebystand van so 'n aard moet wees dat werkgewers bygestaan word om  te
verhoed dat werkers afgedank word. Daar moet  voortgegaan kan word  met  die
daaglikse werksaamhede om sodoende  infrastruktuur  van  die  platteland  in
stand te hou.
Die huidige hulp aan boere en plaaswerkers is  werklik  'n  baie  korttermyn
projek. Dit gaan nou oor oorlewing, en ons moet dus kyk na  die  langtermyn.
Om nou kospakkies en lone te betaal, ook aan werkers  op  kommersiële  plase
wat steeds hul salarisse ontvang, lyk baie verdag, veral met  die  naderende
verkiesing.

Die Oos-Kaap Landbou-unie is dankbaar vir  die  R12,7  miljoen  droogtehulp,
maar glo dis nie naastenby voldoende nie. Die grootste probleem is  nie  die
bedrag nie, maar wel die effektiewe besteding daarvan. Landbouers  soek  nie
'n gebaar van simpatie nie, maar wel hulp om weer in produksie te kom.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When the elements turn  against  the  farmers,  then  all  farmers  suffer.
Inevitably the problems of  small  farmers  and  new  farmers  will  capture
people's hearts and imaginations. Naturally, if  a  farmer's  entire  wealth
consists of 10 cattle, and he loses everything due to  circumstances  beyond
his control, he has to get help. If a  small  farmer  with  one  hectare  of
fruit trees loses all his  fruit  due  to  a  hailstorm,  there  has  to  be
assistance.

Commercial farmers are also struck by the elements and  circumstances.  They
also lose everything, but more people are affected. The  farmer  experiences
a cash flow problem and in order to  survive  farm  workers  are  dismissed,
amongst others. This causes  a  chain  reaction  which  leaves  many  people
without food.

My party really welcomes the additional drought relief of R250 million,  but
we want to make an appeal for efficient, equitable and speedy availability.

The need for a disaster management strategy,  in  the  long  term,  has  now
become indispensable for this country.

South Africa can no longer manage money and other disaster measures in  such
a haphazard manner. A strategy for disaster management with  an  appropriate
budget must be established  beforehand.  We  must  be  prepared  for  future
disasters. South Africa is a country where  drought  and  natural  disasters
occur regularly.

A substantial part of the proposed drought assistance is  meant  to  provide
households of small farmers who will have  no  crops  with  food.  There  is
nothing wrong with that; it is  laudable.  This  grant  is  now  also  being
extended to farm workers  on  commercial  farms,  although  they  are  still
receiving their full salaries.

My party believes, however, that over and above this grant,  drought  relief
must such  that  employers  are  assisted  to  prevent  workers  from  being
dismissed. They have to continue with  the  daily  activities  in  order  to
maintain the infrastructure of the rural areas.

The current assistance to farmers and farm  workers  is  a  very  short-term
project. It is about survival now, and  we  must  look  at  the  long  term.
Distributing food parcels and paying wages at this time, also to workers  on
commercial  farms  who  are  still  receiving  their  salaries,  looks  very
suspicious, especially with the coming elections.

The Eastern  Cape  Agricultural  Union  appreciates  the  R12,7  million  in
drought relief, but believes that it  is  not  nearly  enough.  The  biggest
problem is not the amount, but  in  fact  the  efficient  spending  thereof.
Farmers are not looking for a gesture of sympathy, but  in  fact  assistance
to get back into production.] [Time expired.]

Mnr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:   Voorsitter,   baie   dankie.   Wanneer   droogtes
rampafmetings aangeneem  het,  dan  moet  die  ramp  bestuur  word,  en  die
masjinerie van die staat is op die oomblik baie beter geolie as wat  dit  in
die verlede was, maar daar is nog ruimte vir verbetering.

Dit is belangrik vir ons as kollegas hier om te verstaan wat die  impak  van
'n droogte is as jou hele voortbestaan daarvan afhang  om  te  kan  oorleef.
Wanneer ek met u praat, praat ek in  die  konteks  van  die  Noord-Kaap,  en
praat ek dan ook uit die perspektief van 'n veeboer.
Daar is twee goed waarvan jy seker is  in  die  Noord-Kaap,  sê  die  Noord-
Kapenaars, en dit is die dood en 'n droogte. Deur die genade  lewe  ek  nog,
maar ek het 'n paar droogtes ook deurleef.

Voorsitter, behalwe dat droogtes mense of jy 'n eienaar  of  'n  werker  is,
nader aan hul Skepper bring en hul gebede  meer  opreg  maak,  wys  dit  ook
karakter. Dit vorm nie karakter nie; dit wys karakter.

Ek onthou toe ek net op die plaas gekom het, was ek  in  die  koöperasie  en
oom Soon le Roux het na my toe gekom en gesê: Boet, hoe  gaan  dit  met  jou
hier op die plaas? En ek het gesê: Oom, dis vrek warm en baie droog. Toe  sê
hy vir my: Boet, kla oor goed wat jy kan verander. Jy kan die natuur en  die
klimaat nie verander nie.

Dit was 'n baie goeie les, maar ons kan egter pro-aktief  optree  sover  dit
natuurlik moontlik is, en daarna moet ons kyk. Ons moet rampe uitstel  sover
dit moontlik is. Ons moet duidelik verstaan dat 'n boer wat vee of  wild  op
sy grond het, boer nie met vee of wild nie. Hy boer met bossies of gras,  en
die vee of wild is waarde wat hy toevoeg tot die bossies  of  die  gras.  Hy
boer,  met  ander  woorde,  met  die  veld.  Dit  is  daarom  belangrik  dat
bewaringsboerdery aangemoedig moet word.

Oorbeweiding moet beheer  en  gestraf  word.  Die  veld  wat  in  een  maand
vernietig word, neem 10 jaar se goeie reëns om te herstel, indien  dit  ooit
wel herstel.

Wanneer droogtehulp voorsien word,  moet  veevermindering  aangemoedig  word
sodat die bron, die veld, vinnig  en  verseker  kan  herstel  na  die  goeie
reëns.

Om voer en vervoer van voer  te  subsideer  is  korttermyn  hulp  wat  boere
verwelkom, en wat ook baie nodig is. Dit it is egter die  aanspreek  van  'n
simptoom en nie die oorsaak nie.

Daar moet gekyk word na die vernietiging van veld in kommunale  gebiede,  na
die vernietiging van veld by restitusieboere wat  nou  op  grond  gekom  het
waar veld al byna totaal vernietig is. Ons moet onthou dat  daar  waar  veld
vernietig word, is daar 'n aanspraak op meer veld om te kan oorleef, en  dit
kan 'n bose kringloop word. Daarom het ons hier hulp nodig ten  opsigte  van
voorligting en die nodige inligting om mense op plase te hou.

Daar is van ons mense wat nou baie swaar kry, soos u gehoor het - mense  wat
op pad uit is en mense wat reeds uit is. As 'n mens nog nie deur 'n  droogte
was nie, as jy nog nie deur 'n droogte geleef het nie, kan jy dit nie  rêrig
verstaan nie. As jy met jou bakkie of donkiekar deur die veld ry,  en  skape
strompel agter daai bakkie of donkiekar aan met die hoop  dat  daar  nog  'n
mieliepit is, met die hoop dat daar 'n lusernhalmpie is, en  daar  is  niks,
want jy is gedaan - jou stoor is leeg en jou beursie is plat, en al  wat  jy
op daai bakkie of donkiekar het, is 'n bietjie kalk om op  die  karkasse  te
gooi - dan  verstaan  jy  wat  droogte  is,  en  dan  verstaan  jy  ook  die
noodsaaklikheid dat daar 'n goeie verhouding moet wees tussen die  staat  en
jou boerderygemeenskap, dat daar wedersyds begrip moet wees.
Wanneer jy egter deur so 'n droogte is, dan verstaan jy ook die vreugde  van
wanneer dit reën, wanneer jy die nat grond ruik,  wanneer  jy  die  haasgras
byna sien groei, en wanneer die droë stoppels van die gras en van die  ganna
daardie swart droë veld groen spikkel. Dit is  wonderlik.  Dit  is  werklike
vreugde.

Ek wil hê  dat  die  Minister  duidelik  moet  verstaan  dit  is  nodig  dat
plaaswerkers wat swaarkry, die armstes van die armstes soos my kollega  hier
gesê het, gehelp moet word. Wanneer dit egter  goed  gaan  in  die  landbou,
gaan dit goed met al sy mense, en daarom moet ons ook die  kommersiële  boer
op die grond hou.

In die Noord-Kaap het ons 'n gesegde  dat  elke  groot  droogte  deur  goeie
reëns verbreek word. Daar kom altyd uitkoms, en dan moet ons  die  mense  op
die grond hê wat kan voorsien in die voedselsekuriteit van hierdie land.

Terwyl ons egter risiko beheer en bestuur, is dit ook belangrik dat  ons  na
alternatiewe kyk; alternatiewe waaroor ons in hierdie Huis al  gepraat  het,
en waarna die agb Minister al gekyk het, asook die  agb  Moatshe.  Ons  moet
kyk na alternatiewe  waar  die  risiko  beperk  is  soos  met  akwa-kultuur,
visboerdery  in  die  binneland  en  aan  die  kus  ...   [Tyd   verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. When  droughts  reach
disastrous  proportions,  then  the  disaster  must  be  managed,  and   the
machinery of the state is currently in better working condition than it  was
in the past, but there is still room for improvement.

It is important for us as colleagues here to  understand  the  impact  of  a
drought when your entire existence depends on it  to  be  able  to  survive.
When I speak to you, I am speaking in the context of the Northern Cape,  and
also from the perspective of a stock farmer.

There are two things of which you  can  be  certain  in  the  Northern  Cape
according to the people from the  Northern  Cape,  and  that  is  death  and
drought. By grace I am still alive, but I have  also  lived  through  a  few
droughts.

Chairperson, apart from the fact that droughts bring people whether  one  is
an owner or a worker - closer to their  Creator  and  render  their  prayers
more sincere, it also reveals character. It does  not  shape  character;  it
reveals character.

I remember when I first arrived at the farm. I was in the  co-operative  and
Uncle Soon le Roux came to me and said: Son, how are you doing here  on  the
farm? And I said: Uncle, it is extremely hot and very dry. Then he  said  to
me: Son, complain about things  that  you  can  change.  You  cannot  change
nature and the climate.

That was a very good lesson, but we can, however, act  pro-actively  as  far
as is possible, of course, and we have to look at that. We  should  postpone
disasters as far as possible. We should understand  clearly  that  a  farmer
that has stock or game on his land, does not farm with  stock  or  game.  He
farms with bushes or grass, and the cattle or game  is  value  that  he  had
adds to the bushes or grass. In other words, he farms with the veld.  It  is
therefore important that conservation farming is encouraged.

Overgrazing must be controlled and penalised. The veld that is destroyed  in
one month, requires 10 years of good rains to recover, if it ever recovers.

When drought relief is provided, stock reduction must be encouraged so  that
the source, the veld, can recover quickly and certainly after good rains.

Subsidising fodder and transport of fodder  is  short-term  relief  that  is
welcomed  by  farmers,  and  is  also  very  necessary.  However,  this   is
addressing a symptom and not the cause.

The destruction of the veld in communal areas should be looked at,  as  well
as the destruction of veld by restitution farmers who have now come to  land
where the veld has been destroyed almost completely. We must  remember  that
where veld is destroyed, there is a  claim  on  more  veld  to  be  able  to
survive, and this may become a vicious circle. That  is  why  we  need  help
here with regard to guidance and the necessary information  to  keep  people
on farms.

There are some of our people who are now  really  struggling,  as  you  have
heard, people who are on their way out and people who are  already  out.  If
one has not been through a drought yet, if you have not yet lived through  a
drought, you cannot really understand it. When you are driving  your  bakkie
or riding your donkey cart in the veld, and the sheep are  tottering  behind
that bakkie or donkey cart in the hope that there might  be  another  mealie
kernel, in the hope that there might be a blade of  lucerne,  and  there  is
nothing, because you are finished - your store is empty and your  wallet  is
empty, and the only thing you have on that bakkie is a bit of lime to  throw
on the carcasses - then you understand what drought is, and  then  you  also
understand the necessity for a good relationship between the state and  your
farming community, that there should be mutual understanding.

However, when you have been through such  a  drought,  then  you  will  also
understand the joy when it rains, when you smell the  wet  earth,  when  you
can almost see the silk-grass growing, and when the  dry  patches  of  grass
and the lye-bush speckle the black dry veld with green. That  is  wonderful.
That is true joy.

I want the Minister to understand clearly that  it  is  necessary  for  farm
workers who are suffering, the poorest of the poor,  as  my  colleague  here
has said, to be helped. However, when it goes well in agriculture,  it  goes
well with all its people, and that is why we must also keep  the  commercial
farmer on the land.

In the Northern Cape we have a saying that every great drought is broken  by
good rains. There is always a way out, and then we must have the  people  on
the land who can provide the food security of this country.
However, while we  are  controlling  and  managing  the  risk,  it  is  also
important that we look at alternatives; alternatives as  we  have  discussed
in this House before, and the hon Minister as well as the  hon  Moatshe  had
looked at it. We should look at alternatives  where  the  risk  is  limited,
like with aquaculture, fish farming  inland  and  at  the  coast  ...  [Time
expired.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Chairperson,  hon
members, we have had fairly good rains in  some  parts  of  the  country  in
recent weeks, but there is no reason for us to  be  complacent  and  pretend
that all is well. South Africa is still in the middle of a  severe  drought.
The experts, the meteorologists and hydrologists,  estimate  that  it  would
take anything between three to five years of good rains to  get  us  out  of
this drought. Experts seem to agree  that  South  Africa  is  a  desert-like
country where rain is the exception rather than the rule.

Prof Hannes Rautenbach, head of the  University  of  Pretoria's  Meteorology
Unit, has been quoted as saying we are on the thirteenth degree of  latitude
south. It's a very  dry  degree  of  latitude.  In  both  the  northern  and
southern hemispheres it's the degree on which you find  the  great  deserts.
This drought has brought immense suffering to our economy,  environment  and
to the lives of our people, particularly those who live in  the  deep  rural
areas. You actually have to visit these areas - the rural areas -  to  begin
to fully understand the negative impact this drought is having on the  lives
of our rural poor.

The Ministers and Deputy Ministers were deployed in January and February  to
these drought-stricken areas to go and see for themselves, to listen and  to
report to communities on what actions  Government  is  taking  to  alleviate
their plight. What we have witnessed was  the  poor  conditions  our  people
have  been  living  under  for  many,  many  years.  These  conditions   are
aggravated by the ongoing drought, the lack of natural vegetation, and  this
includes the  grass  for  grazing,  the  arid  lands,  crop  failure,  dying
livestock, and we even had to witness livestock that was too weak  to  walk,
with bones protruding through their bodies. This was indeed a sorry sight.

However, we were also overwhelmed by the  resilience  and  humility  of  our
people under these trying conditions. They were full of  hope  knowing  that
our Government cares for them, listens to  them  and  responds  promptly  to
their plight. Experts say the current drought  is  the  worse  to  have  hit
South Africa in a century. This  act  of  God  is  a  normal  and  recurrent
feature of the  South  African  climate  and  has  resulted  in  significant
economic,   environmental   and   social   losses   all   highlighting   our
vulnerability to this natural phenomenon.

Drought normally occurs in cycles.  Recent  droughts  experienced  in  South
Africa occurred in 1982-83, 1991-92, 1997-98. Although the 1997-98  El  Niño
was comparable with the strong El Niño event of  1982-83,  the  country  was
fortunate in that the severe and adverse effects predicted at that time  did
not materialise. It was also reported that the 1991-92  drought  had  caused
serious harm to the economy. It was estimated that about 49  000  jobs  were
lost in the agricultural sector and about 20  000  jobs  were  lost  in  the
nonagricultural sector and this was in  1991-92.  It  also  had  a  negative
effect on the country's current account of the balance of payments.

The effects of the present drought are far worse than that of  1997-98.  The
dam levels are much lower and the forecast for the remainder of  the  summer
rainfall season suggests a persistence of an erratic rainfall pattern.  With
the winter season on our doorstep the impact  of  drought  on  our  people's
lives is expected to worsen, hence Cabinet in January  decided  to  allocate
the R500 million for the drought mitigation programme in the next  financial
year. This is in addition to the R250 million that was allocated  last  year
in October, and a further R250 million that was allocated  in  January  this
year for emergency relief.

The overall goal of this programme, amongst other things  and  as  mentioned
earlier, is to mitigate the impact of drought across  all  affected  sectors
of  society  in  the  country,  and  also  to  provide  assistance  to  both
commercial and subsistence farmers in order to curb job losses and  minimise
economic setbacks. We would like to emphasise here and  now  that  there  is
nothing in these allocations that suggests that it is only white  commercial
farmers  who  will  be  the  sole  beneficiaries  of  Government's   drought
mitigation programme. On the contrary, poor rural households  are  the  main
beneficiaries. We are doing this conscious  of  the  fact  that  it  is  the
poorest of the poor that are worst affected by the drought.

The R500 million budgeted for in the next financial year  is  for  long-term
interventions to limit people's dependence on grants and  aid.  We  need  to
make sure that our intervention strategies are sustainable  and  Government,
in partnership with all stakeholders, begins to revitalise the  agricultural
sector so that people can make a living. When our new democratic  Government
came into power in 1994, it realised that there were serious weaknesses  and
constraints in the disaster management  policy  of  the  previous  apartheid
government. Since then our Government has developed  policies  and  disaster
management strategies that can be implemented in a more proactive way.

After the June 1994 floods on the Cape  Flats,  Cabinet  decided  to  assess
South Africa's ability to deal with risk reduction and disaster  management.
This resulted in the  review  of  the  disaster  management  structures  and
approaches in Government. Drought is one of the natural disasters  that  are
often difficult to manage and cannot be tackled by  an  agricultural  sector
alone. The co-ordinated team efforts of a  number  of  role-players  are  an
essential part of the  management  of  drought.  It  is  very  important  to
understand  that  the  costs  of  mitigating  the  effects  of  drought  are
extremely high and thus the management of  resources  becomes  critical.  We
must therefore ensure that the management of resources is an  integral  part
of any plan or strategy to address the drought situation.

The Government's medium to long-term programmes will further strengthen  the
country's capacity to moderate the impact of drought.  These  include  asset
recovery through preservation of  breeding  stock,  distribution  of  seeds,
improving food and water security, raising awareness  and  capacity-building
at community level and introducing new agricultural,  water  management  and
harvesting technologies to mitigate the future impact of drought.

The Disaster  Management  Act,  Act  57  of  2002,  also  provides  for  the
establishment of an intergovernmental committee on disaster  management  and
a disaster management advisory forum comprising of representatives from  all
three  spheres  of  government  departments,   the   SA   Local   Government
Association - Salga,  business  and  various  nongovernmental  organisations
which meet regularly. A standing agenda on both these bodies should  be  the
presentation and discussion on predicted  weather  conditions  as  it  often
becomes necessary for  policy-makers,  agriculturalists,  business  and  the
general  public  to  be  provided  with  additional  information   regarding
rainfall for decision-making and planning.

From April last year the National  Disaster  Management  Centre,  under  the
Department of Provincial and Local Government, together with the  Department
of Agriculture, have issued a number of early warning systems to notify  all
those affected about expected weather patterns.  The  early  warning  system
allows the National Disaster Management Centre to forecast weather  patterns
and it has forecast normal and below normal rainfall for 2003 and 2004.  The
National Disaster Management Centre is  developing  an  electronic  database
that contains extensive information on disasters that occur or may occur  in
Southern Africa, including information on early warning systems.

The following early warning systems are monitored by our  National  Disaster
Management Centre, and information on the development of  tropical  cyclones
in the South Indian Ocean and early warnings are issued  to  areas  expected
to  be  affected:  the  National  American  Space  Agency  website  for  the
development of extreme weather patterns; and Net  Forecasting  for  specific
localised early warnings. The Fire Danger Index has been developed  for  the
monitoring of the possibility  of  veld  and  forest  fires  and,  in  close
liaison with Net Forecasting and the SA Weather Service,  quarterly  updates
on the possible development of an El Niño or La Niña are produced.

The Disaster  Management  Act  also  provides  for  an  integrated  disaster
management policy that  focuses  on  preventing  or  reducing  the  risk  of
disasters, mitigating the severity  of  disasters,  emergency  preparedness,
rapid  and  effective  response  to  disasters  and  postdisaster  recovery.
Disasters in the past were seen in the context of  emergency  responses  and
not as part of the long-term planning  and  development  programmes  of  the
Government. The concept of disaster management needs to be  integrated  into
our  development  strategies  as  vulnerability  to  disasters  can   create
development setbacks which result in the aggravation of poverty situations.

Our visits to the drought-stricken areas has also brought  home  to  us  the
stark reality of underdevelopment, serious backlogs of basic  infrastructure
and poverty in some of the rural areas. The  Minister  of  Finance,  in  his
Budget Speech, yesterday, referred to the adverse  impact  of  disasters  on
economic growth. He pointed  out  that  our  economy  has  expanded  for  20
consecutive quarters - the longest of continuous growth for over  50  years.
However, he said that the preliminary estimate  of  output  growth  of  1,9%
last year is rather lower than the 3,3% projected this time  last  year.  He
said, amongst other things, the factors that contributed  to  slower  growth
included a sharp decline in agricultural production as a result  of  adverse
weather conditions.

I should also mention here that the Cabinet has also agreed  that  the  Food
Price  Monitoring  Committee  should,  especially  in   this   period,   pay
particular attention to the changes in food prices to prevent any  unethical
behaviour in the  industry.  This  measure  will  also  go  a  long  way  to
mitigating the impact of drought on  our  consumers,  especially  the  poor.
Drought also affects the  work  we  are  doing  as  Government  in  building
sustainable rural  and  urban  economies  through  programmes  such  as  the
integrated sustainable rural development and urban renewal programmes.

Some of our poverty alleviation  programmes  focus  on  agriculture  and  it
means that when the drought strikes progress is hampered and  our  programme
of building sustainable rural economies is retarded. These projects  provide
a source of income in addition to food security, and once  disaster  strikes
the consequences are  negative.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  Government
decided that  the  focus  in  the  next  financial  year  should  be  on  an
agricultural recovery programme, amongst  others.  The  Disaster  Management
Act  also  provides  for  the  establishment  of  national,  provincial  and
municipal disaster management centres. This is  important  in  strengthening
our system of intergovernmental relations as well as the  partnerships  with
stakeholders which we are building and consolidating as we enter our  second
decade of freedom.

Partnerships extend  to  our  communities,  our  commercial  farmers,  small
farmers and subsistence farmers  whom  we  met  during  our  visits  to  the
provinces. In our interaction with them they also made proposals on  how  we
could tackle the drought question.  We  have  taken  their  suggestions  and
these will be considered as we implement our drought recovery  strategy.  We
would like to thank all the stakeholders and  all  our  partners  for  their
invaluable contribution.

In conclusion, let me say that the ongoing drought must also teach  everyone
of us to use and preserve whatever resources we have, be it water  or  land,
in a more efficient and prudent manner. We must start conserving  water  and
begin to appreciate what we have. We cannot survive without water.  We  need
the land. We must commend the interministerial committee referred to by  the
Minister  earlier  comprising  of  the   Departments   of   Water   Affairs,
Agriculture, Health, Social Development and Provincial and Local  Government
for the role they played in facilitating the prompt response  of  Government
across the three  spheres  of  Government  regarding  the  plight  of  those
affected by this drought.
If we all work together in an integrated way, we can minimise the impact  of
this drought. So far we have not  heard  of  excessive  job  losses  in  the
agricultural sector as a result of this drought. There may have been, but  I
have not  heard  of  any.  We  wish  to  thank  all  our  people,  organised
agriculture, subsistence farmers and other stakeholders  for  joining  hands
with Government to minimise the impact of  the  current  drought,  indeed  a
people united for a better South Africa and a better  world.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank  you  very  much,  Mr  Deputy  Chairperson  and  hon
colleagues.

Our approach to disaster management  in  general,  and  in  particular  with
regard to putting  in  place  the  measures  for  drought  relief  and  food
security, is informed by the principle of co-operative  governance,  coupled
with public  participation.  This  approach  allows  us  to  bring  about  a
conducive environment, and  the  protection  thereof,  for  sufficient  food
supply as well as protection of those  markets  to  which  we  supply  these
foodstuffs. This allows communities, and emerging farmers in particular,  to
realise  their  potential  as  well  as   engaging   in   fulfilling   their
responsibility of providing the food supply of the country.

Our approach to disaster management has enabled  us  to  manage  many  other
disasters that are inherent to this country, for instance the  inherent  and
prevalent potential disaster  in  managing  our  currency,  which  might  be
manipulated by external forces. I'm saying we find the  management  of  this
disaster easy because we've been  able  to  stem  the  tide  of  that  other
disaster I've mentioned.

The importance of food security  cannot  be  overemphasised.  To  illustrate
this, we have to reflect for a moment on  the  scorched  earth  policy  that
used to be implemented by  commanders  in  ancient  wars.  At  present  some
countries in  the  world  are  engaged  in  the  so-called  weapons-for-food
arrangement, because those countries are unable to have a sufficient  supply
to feed their people.

Reminiscent of our movement, we in the ANC are not only concerned about  the
food security or drought relief in our own  country.  As  the  hon  Minister
highlighted, we are also concerned about our  neighbouring  countries.  Just
to illustrate this point, we may just have to consider  how  much  grain  is
being  transported  to  neighbouring  countries.  I  happen   to   live   in
Mpumalanga, and on a daily basis I count no less than 10 full trucks  moving
across the border into Swaziland, supplying maize to that country.  This  is
illustrative of our concern for our neighbours.

We  must  also  unashamedly  declare  here  that  disasters  are  no  longer
completely unforeseeable, and this is not a  retributive  comment.  We  have
the National Disaster Management Centre whose advice and expertise is  noted
fully by all role-players in this country. That disaster  management  centre
has the advice and expertise to  foresee,  to  some  extent,  any  potential
threat,  be  it  drought  or  any  adverse  climate  conditions   that   are
forthcoming.

Over and above that, we have as a traditional method, namely  the  so-called
IKS way of forecasting disaster. We also have in  our  midst,  hon  members,
the so-called rainmakers that we can also rely on. It seems,  like  the  hon
Minister  highlighted,  we  do  not  sufficiently  take  notice   of   these
advantages that should assist us in order to  reduce  the  severity  of  any
adverse climate or temperature that might befall us.

One is also touched by the  comments  by  the  hon  Van  Niekerk  about  the
tragedy that is facing some farmers. Here I'm  also  referring  to  emerging
farmers, and also to some of the local economic  development  projects  that
are being prioritised by local government. In my mind I  have  a  strawberry
project in Carolina that  is  busy  breeding  other  projects  such  as  the
cultivation  of  vegetables  and  fruit,  thus  contributing  towards   food
security in that area.

One of the major agricultural activities that are  practised  in  Mpumalanga
is forestry. For our information it would  be  important  to  note  that  we
have, at Matimbas in Graskop, the  largest  sawmill  on  this  continent  of
Africa and the second largest in the  entire  world.  My  friend  who  works
there, when we discussed disasters,  especially  the  drought,  informed  me
that if the quality of trees in the forest continues to  deteriorate  as  it
is doing now, we  may  face  a  prospect  where  only  brown  paper  may  be
produced. [Time expired.]

Mr J  P  GELDERBLOM  (Western  Cape):  Mr  Chairperson,  only  30  countries
worldwide have less water per capita than South Africa.  We  therefore  rank
as one of the poorest  countries  in  terms  of  available  water,  and  the
Western Cape is no exception. In some areas of this province  2003  was  one
of the driest years in a century. The  northwestern  areas  of  the  Western
Cape receive winter rainfall,  but  the  catchment  water  diminishes  quite
drastically as summer approaches. During the critical  months  of  2003  the
winter rains did  not  materialise  and  this  contributed  to  the  current
abnormal situation.

The Karoo is mainly a  summer  rainfall  area,  except  around  Touwsrivier,
which falls in the winter rainfall  area.  In  some  summer  rainfall  areas
rainfall  has  been  diminishing  since  2000  and  the  effect   has   been
cumulative. Isolated occurrences of good rain were  completely  overshadowed
by the general picture. The bad news is that this year will probably  follow
the same route; in the Western Cape we expect a dry early winter  with  poor
rainfall predicted for the months of May, June and July.

In communities where agriculture is the dominant  activity,  the  prosperity
of local business depends on the agricultural  sector.  The  result  of  bad
times is that both the agricultural and business  sectors  experience  cash-
flow problems that, in  turn,  result  in  labour  cutbacks  on  farms.  The
jobless then flock to the towns or cities where unemployment contributes  to
a rise in crime, inadequate  housing,  sewerage  and  water  -  a  potential
socioeconomic flashpoint.

The direct consequences to agriculture are not only in the  short  term.  In
the long run, a severe drought has an extremely negative impact on the  next
lambing and/or calving season. In other words, the problems for the drought-
stricken farmers do not end after the first rains. The financial  impact  of
this drought will be clearer over the next 18 to 24 months.

The national Department of  Agriculture  has  made  more  than  R15  million
available for this financial year to assist farmers  who  suffer  most  from
the current drought  in  our  province.  A  working  committee  has  already
visited the relevant areas to determine where  the  need  is  greatest,  and
drought relief assistance will be in place as from Friday, 20 February  2004
for those farmers who have registered.

The cost of animal feed and the transporting of fodder  will  be  subsidised
at 75% to a maximum of 30 large stock units or equal to  more  or  less  180
small stock units. I would  like  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the
Minister that the relief that I have outlined has the  potential  to  assist
historically  disadvantaged  individuals  in  outlying   communities   where
livestock is often the main source of support.

However, the HDI farmers are most often not on the  normal  delivery  routes
and in terms of the rules they are not allowed to use  their  own  vehicles,
even if they have transport. The  cost  of  transporting  the  fodder  rises
sharply when farmers live in out-of-the-way places: for  example,  the  base
subsidy is 50 cents on R2  a  kilometre,  but  when  the  transport  company
charges R3 or more per kilometre every cent above the base  subsidy,  it  is
for the account of the farmer.

The balance of the cost of fodder amounts to about R90  per  large  unit  of
livestock a month, also payable by the farmer.  Taken  together,  the  costs
are quite simply beyond the reach of these farmers. We have  quantified  the
shortfall of about R1 million in the Western Cape, and we would be  able  to
meet this amount from our farmer settlement programme. However, this is  the
mandate of the national Department of Agriculture and we need your  approval
in this regard, Minister.
Die  Wes-Kaap  se  ministeriële  werkgroep  het  sekere   droogtegeteisterde
distrikte  omkring  en  die   boere   in   die   distrikte   wat   vir   die
droogtehulpprogram klassifiseer is reeds geïdentifiseer. Verskeie  omkringde
gebiede is deurgegee na die onderskeie  landboudistrikte.  Registrasie  word
so  spoedig  moontlik  afgehandel.  Voorheen   benadeelde   boere   in   die
droogtegeteisterde gebiede wat moontlik kwalifiseer, sal deur  die  beamptes
van die Wes-Kaap se departement van landbou besoek word wat hulle  sal  help
om die nodige aansoekvorms in te vul en  om  die  nodige  reëlings  vir  die
veevoer te tref. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Western  Cape's  Ministerial  working  group  circled  certain  drought
stricken districts and the farmers in these districts who  qualify  for  the
drought assistance programme are already identified. Various  circled  areas
were submitted to the various agricultural districts. Registration  will  be
finished as soon  as  possible.  Previously  disadvantaged  farmers  in  the
drought stricken areas who might qualify will be visited  by  the  officials
of the Western Cape's Department of Agriculture who will help them  to  fill
out the necessary application forms and to make the  necessary  arrangements
for the fodder.]

We also note  that  a  further  R250  million  has  been  allocated  by  the
Government to drought relief assistance in  disaster  areas  for  the  whole
country for the next financial year. Sixty million rand of this amount  will
be used in the  form  of  rebates  for  animal  feed  and  the  transporting
thereof. The Western Cape will motivate and  bargain  for  a  percentage  of
this amount at a meeting with the directorate on the 9th of March 2004.

Farmers must again regard droughts as a normal part of farming and learn  to
avoid debt in the fat years. In an ideal situation  farmers  will  create  a
nest  egg  for  the  lean  years  and  commit  themselves   to   sustainable
agricultural practices, for example by strictly adhering  to  the  standards
regarding the carrying capacity of land.

Ons behoort teen hierdie tyd te weet dat dit oneties sou  wees  om  met  die
wisselkoers te dobbel. Dit  is  net  so  onwys  wanneer  landbouers  of  die
Regering met die toekoms van landbou dobbel deur nie  daarop  voorbereid  te
wees dat natuurrampe van tyd tot tyd sal opduik nie.

Ek wil vandag hulde bring aan die kommersiële boere  wat  baie  ure  ingesit
het en baie moeite ervaar het oor hierdie droogtetydperk wat agter  die  rug
is  en  wat  nog  voorlê.  Ek  wil  dankie  sê  vir  ons  plaaswerkers,  vir
plaasvrouens wat hulle mans in hierdie tye bystaan,  vir  AgriWes-Kaap,  vir
die  National  African  Farmers  Union  en  vir   hulle   wat   in   hierdie
omstandighede die pad vorentoe voorberei vir ons landbou op die  akker.  Dan
wil ek dankie sê vir minister Thoko  Didiza  vir  die  wyse  waarop  sy  die
afgelope jare landbou gedien het en altyd  geluister  het  na  die  Wes-Kaap
wanneer ons met haar kon kommunikeer.

Ek sê namens landbou in  die  Wes-Kaap  dankie,  minister  Didiza,  vir  jou
positiewe benadering, vir jou  gefokusde  houding  wat  jy  teenoor  landbou
geopenbaar het.  Van  ons  kant  in  die  Wes-Kaap  wil  die  boere  en  die
landbouers, van plaaswerkers tot ander  fasette  van  landbou,  jou  eer  en
salueer vir hierdie tyd wat  jy  na  ons  geluister  het  en  ook  positiewe
bydraes gelewer het om landbou te bevorder.

Op dié wat negatief is wil ek vandag 'n beroep doen: kom  word  positief  en
help om landbou die ekonomiese krag te maak, nie net van die  Wes-Kaap  nie,
nie net van Suid-Afrika nie, maar van Afrika, waarin ons 'n volwaardige  rol
kan speel omdat ons hier gebore is en hier hoort.  Ons  het  nie  'n  tweede
paspoort nie. Ons is Afrikane van Afrika, en daarom het ons 'n rol  om  hier
te speel en dit wil  ons  doen.  Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We ought to know by now that it is unethical to gamble  with  the  exchange
rate. It is just as unwise when farmers or the Government  gamble  with  the
future of agriculture by not being prepared  for  natural  disasters,  which
will turn up from time to time.

Today, I want to pay tribute to the  commercial  farmers  who  put  in  many
hours and who experienced great difficulties  during  this  drought  period,
part of which is behind us and part of which is still to  come.  I  want  to
say thank you to farm labourers, women on farm, who support  their  husbands
during these times, to Agri Western Cape, to the National Farmers Union  and
to those who  in  these  circumstances,  prepare  the  road  ahead  for  our
agriculture on the acre. Then I also want to express a word of gratitude  to
Minister Thoko Didiza for the way in which she served agriculture  over  the
past three years and always listened to  the  Western  Cape  when  we  could
communicate to her.

On behalf of agriculture in the Western Cape, I say thank  you  to  Minister
Didiza for your positive approach, for your focused attitude, which you  had
towards agriculture. From our side in the  Western  Cape,  the  farmers  and
agriculturists, from farm workers to other facets of  agriculture,  we  want
to honour and salute you for this time, which you listened to  us  and  also
provided positive contributions to promote agriculture.
I would like to appeal to those who are negative: come let us  get  positive
and help to make agriculture an economic force,  not  only  in  the  Western
Cape, not only in South Africa, but in Africa, where we can  play  our  full
and equal role because we were born here and belong here. We do not  have  a
second passport. We are Africans of Africa, and therefore we have a role  to
fulfil here and that is what we want to do. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Thank you, Chairperson. I wanted to repeat the last  words
by Mr Gelderblom, but I'll do that in isiXhosa.

Abakhalazayo basazalwa nanamhla. Bakhona ke abantu  abafana  nomam'  uGouws;
abanganeliyo. Mhlalingaphambili, ndifuna ukuthi ... [People will never  stop
complaining, and people like Mrs Gouws are never satisfied.  Chairperson,  I
want to say ... ]

... bad weather, particularly drought, has resulted  in  acute  and  chronic
food shortages. Over the past 10 years this  has  been  a  major  source  of
concern for our Government.  As  the  ANC,  we  realise  the  importance  of
developing a holistic policy  approach  to  drought-related  calamities  and
linking  them  to  overall  development  strategies.  To  us,  this   is   a
fundamental requirement for increasing  food  security  in  a  drought-prone
environment such as our own. This approach is a  far  cry  from  the  poorly
designed policies of the previous regime  in  response  to  food  insecurity
caused by droughts.

In the past, very little effort  was  made  to  understand  the  coping  and
survival strategies of drought-affected households. In addition, too  little
attention  was  given  to  designing  policies   that   would   reduce   the
nonagricultural and economywide impacts  of  droughts.  The  net  result  of
these policies was an uneven application of drought relief, with  a  greater
focus on commercial farmers at  the  expense  of  the  most  vulnerable  and
poorest sectors of the farming community. With the advent of  democracy  and
the ascendance of an ANC-led Government with a proper focus, these  policies
naturally had to make way for drought  relief  policies  that  balanced  the
interest of all stakeholders affected by drought.

As part of our transformation agenda for the agricultural  sector,  we  have
devised  new  strategies  to  deal  with  drought-related  calamities.   The
strategic objective of the  new  policies  is  to  set  up  a  comprehensive
drought plan through a system  of  information  management,  monitoring  and
evaluation that will assist in determining vulnerableness to  drought,  both
biophysical  and  social.  This  will  minimise  the  impact  of   droughts,
improving and implementing  early  warning  systems,  and  establishing  and
implementing  priority  programmes  for   risk   reduction.   The   strategy
represents a marked departure from the old approach to  drought  monitoring.
Risk management and risk reduction is the core  principle  of  the  strategy
and  is  aimed  at  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  farming   communities,
especially the poor and the disadvantaged.

Our new approach signifies a shift away from the  disproportionate  emphasis
given to major disasters. The Government's intention is to  move  away  from
direct financial intervention and rather improve South Africa's  ability  to
manage emergencies or disasters, such as droughts  and  their  consequences,
in a co-ordinated, efficient and effective manner.

The  aim  of  our  Government  is  to  promote  a   shared   awareness   and
responsibility to reduce risk in our homes, communities, places of work  and
in society in general. In short, the policy  aims  to  provide  an  enabling
environment  for  disaster  management  that  promotes  integrated  and  co-
ordinated  disaster   management   through   partnerships   with   different
stakeholders,  through  co-operative  relations  between  all   spheres   of
government and the private sector.

As I indicated earlier, a key aspect of the new policy  is  the  integration
of risk-reduction strategies into development initiatives. To achieve  this,
we need to address the challenges posed by the  second  economy,  which  our
President mentioned during the state of the nation address. Many  people  in
our rural areas are still trapped in the second economy,  which  constitutes
the   structural   manifestation   of    poverty,    underdevelopment    and
marginalisation.

Over the past decade, the  ANC  has  developed  a  number  of  policies  and
programmes aimed at empowering our rural communities and creating a  people-
centred society. Of  particular  relevance  is  the  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Strategy which provides a blueprint for  the  creation  of
socially cohesive and stable rural  communities  with  viable  institutions,
sustainable economies and universal access  to  social  amenities,  able  to
attract and retain skilled and knowledgeable  people  who  are  equipped  to
contribute to growth and development. According to the President,  our  task
is to move vigorously and implement programmes such as this and ensure  that
we extricate our rural communities from conditions of poverty. This  is  the
context with which we need to look at the current drought that is  affecting
some of our provinces.

For us, this is not  merely  about  this  particular  drought.  We  need  to
intervene to mitigate  the  suffering  experienced  by  communities  in  the
affected provinces. We have done so, indeed. Government  has  allocated  the
amount mentioned by both Ministers here to deal with  the  effects  of  this
drought. It has appointed an interministerial  committee,  as  the  Minister
for Agriculture and Land Affairs, Mrs Thoko  Didiza,  has  stated.  I  don't
have to repeat this.

In conclusion, it is about accelerating development in our  rural  areas  so
that natural disasters such as drought will have a  minimal  effect  on  the
quality of life of rural communities in the future.

Hayi abantu abafana noomam' uGouws,  abangaswelanga  kodwa  abazenza  ngathi
baswele. Enkosi, Mhlalingaphambili.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  [Not  people  like  Mrs
Gouws, who pretend to be needy, whilst they are  not.  Thanks,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,  hon
Deputy Chairperson and hon members. I must indeed say thank you to the  wise
people of this National Council of Provinces who thought it  necessary  that
we should have this debate, because indeed it is a  topical  matter.  In  my
view, it is  also  a  matter  we  would  need  to  continue  to  engage  in,
particularly as we take leave and go to our  constituencies,  so  that  each
one of us can utilise the resources that we  have  to  raise  the  level  of
awareness of our people. This would enable us to be better prepared for  the
next situation.

There are certain issues that were raised by hon members to  which  I  would
like to respond. In the debate,  hon  members  have  clearly  indicated  the
importance of mitigating the impact of drought or any disasters before  they
occur. They have also raised the  need  for  a  speedy  response  when  such
disasters occur, and that for our machinery to be better capacitated  so  as
to respond quickly in the face of such challenges.

Again, I would like  to  reiterate  some  of  the  programmes  that  we,  as
Government, introduced to mitigate  problems  that  arise  as  a  result  of
disasters. The issue of our  natural  environment  was  raised  by  hon  Van
Niekerk.  You  would  recall  that  the  Department   of   Agriculture,   in
particular, put in place the land care programme which was as a result of  a
USA-South  Africa  binational  discussion,  together  with  the   Australian
government.  That  programme  placed  responsibility  for  land,  water  and
natural resource management on each one of us so that, as users of the  land
or its beneficiaries, we can take care of our  environment.  The  programmes
that were put in place by the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry
regarding Working  for  Water,  and  which  were  aimed  at  removing  alien
species, have helped to increase water retention. I know that  sometimes  we
become very sensitive when it comes to this matter, and I will  speak  about
my home city, Tshwane.

Many of  us  like  the  jacaranda.  The  jacaranda  trees  have  become  the
character of Pretoria. You can't have a Pretoria without the jacaranda,  but
the impact of the jacaranda, in terms of your water table, is enormous.  The
gum tree that you find in a number of our provinces is another species  that
is foreign, but also has an impact in terms of our water. We  have  designed
strategies to ensure that some of these trees, such as  the  eucalyptus  and
gum trees, because of their uses, can be planted in demarcated areas.

We also have  had  discussions  with  the  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry and Tshwane municipality to look at how we  could  have  demarcated
areas for jacaranda trees that would ensure that you  retain  the  character
of the city but, at the same, time limit the expansion.  I  am  using  these
examples because some of these programmes may look very  minimal.  Sometimes
we may argue about the importance of removing  some  of  the  alien  species
and/or believe that they may be messing up our environment as  we  know  it,
but the long-term benefit is that we would be  able  to  improve  our  water
quality.

Regarding farming systems in the agricultural sector, you would see that  in
a number of farms  even  farmers  have  moved  away  from  large  irrigation
infrastructure, such as centre pivots, to drip irrigation as  a  measure  of
maintaining the water resources of our country.

There are some programmes that have come from Water Affairs which have  been
amplified by municipalities and other Government departments  regarding  the
whole issue of water conservation. I know that sometimes when  we  are  told
about how we must utilise water, particularly for bathing  and  washing,  we
sometimes think that that is  just  unnecessary,  yet  it  is  an  important
element for ensuring that we inculcate the culture of saving such  a  scarce
resource in our society.

One other important thing regarding our farming sector is some of  the  work
that we have done through research to ensure  that  we  improve  our  animal
breeds. If one looks at the work that has been  done,  particularly  on  the
Nguni breeds and Afrikaner breeds, one  needs  to  take  into  consideration
that these hardy animals can survive much better in a  drought-prone  region
than any other herd. Therefore, we have looked at how we could improve  meat
quality, for instance, as well as better adaptation by these breeds  in  our
farming environment.

What  we  did  with  an  international  research  organisation,  the  CGIAR,
regarding the production of one of the grain  varieties,  the  Grace  maize,
was to ensure that one can deal with the issues of drought and that  such  a
crop can better resist drought, as well as reduce the  amount  of  pesticide
that one would use to kill the pests.  These,  I  think,  are  some  of  the
mitigating strategies that  we  will  have  to  continue  to  apply  without
waiting until a problem has occurred.  They  would  help  us  to  be  better
prepared in future.

Another issue that was raised, indeed,  was  our  responsive  mechanisms.  A
number of hon members acknowledged that we dealt well with that  issue,  but
that we do need to improve our capacity, and I  would  agree  with  them  on
that score.

I agree with the issue of transport costs, as raised by  my  colleague,  hon
Gelderblom. This is a matter we need to look at so that  we  do  not  create
another stumbling block while we  are  trying  to  resolve  a  problem.  Mrs
Gouws, just to allay your fears, at no stage  are  the  mechanisms  that  we
have put in place being made to be discriminatory in nature.

We have taken into consideration the views of the farmers  of  our  country,
small, medium  and  large-scale  farmers,  who  have  indicated  to  us  the
challenges they are faced with. Without exception, all the  farmers  of  our
country said that the immediate thing the Government can do to support  them
in this current crisis would be to assist them with  fodder,  livestock  and
water services.

However, what was very interesting for me was that during my  visit  to  the
Free State province in December, the Free State commercial farmers  said  to
us, as Government, that ``while you are doing everything you need to  do  in
support of the farming sector, particularly farmers, we appeal to  you  that
you take into serious consideration the plight of the farm workers.''  I  am
raising this issue because, contrary to the  belief  that  for  some  reason
Government decided to isolate the farm workers as an  important  element  in
this equation, farmers actually made this plea themselves. They  said,  ``We
don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we would have to  retrench
our workers, because they are an important element in our production  cycle,
but it is also necessary that the Government  meets  us  halfway  to  ensure
that there is food relief, because as we are not planting we  may  not  have
enough capital to pay them.''

So, it is important that we acknowledge that the measure that  we  have  put
in place as a means of support for farm  workers  is  actually  one  of  the
proposals  that  were  made  by  farmers.  Therefore,  we  have  taken  into
consideration that it is not everybody who does not benefit.

There  are  criteria  that  are  used  to  ensure  that  those   households,
particularly  farm  workers  and  other   neighbouring   communities   whose
livelihoods are intertwined with our farming sector,  would  benefit,  given
the scale of need. I know that that was a  point  of  concern,  particularly
when the President was in KwaZulu-Natal during an  imbizo.  There  was  some
concern that, while these assessments were correct and necessary,  questions
would sometimes be asked in our communities. If you give to MaZondi  because
her situation is worse off than that of Tat'uTshawe, the question  will  be,
``Why has Tshawe been left out of the equation, because he is  in  the  same
condition as the other person who would have been given assistance?''

Because of the limited resources at our disposal, we actually give to  those
who are most in need. The way our  Social  Development  departments  in  the
provinces and nationally have tried to work is such that  immediate  support
goes to those who are most in need. It is not that we disregard  the  levels
of need of people, it is just that we  think  it  is  important  to  cushion
those who are in dire straits. Therefore, I do not think  that  we  can  see
that as discriminatory in nature because it  takes  into  consideration  the
scale of the challenge that we have.

On the issue of the region, as raised by hon Mkhaliphi, indeed  it  is  true
that there has been a lot of purchases particularly of grain by  members  in
the Southern African region, given that they are also facing drought. It  is
for this reason that  Cabinet  made  the  decision  that  the  Food  Pricing
Committee must continue to monitor the trend of prices given  the  situation
that we are in. Even though when the drought  came  we  had  surplus  grain,
because of movements and requirements in the region,  South  Africa's  price
of grain  could  be  put  under  pressure.  Therefore  we  need  to  monitor
continuously to see whether there may not be  intervention  made  to  assist
our communities to deal better with the situation.

Hon Deputy Chairperson and hon members, I would like to  thank  all  of  you
for having participated in the debate and for  the  passion  that  you  have
shown. But, as Reverend R H Schuller said, ``Tough  times  never  last,  but
tough people do.''  I  trust  our  farmers,  farm  workers  and  communities
regarding  the  fact  that  the  situation  that  is  facing   us   is   not
insurmountable. We will go back to the land,  regardless  of  the  immediate
challenges. In the long term, this core  of  our  people  will  continue  to
produce food for food security of this  country,  as  well  as  ensure  that
agriculture remains a pillar of our economy. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 16:55.
