                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  Deputy  President,
Cabinet colleagues, hon members, Governor of the  Reserve  Bank  and  Deputy
Governors and MECs for Finance - I am  pleased  to  see  that  there  are  a
number of learners and students in the gallery this afternoon as well  as  a
number of trade union and  business  leaders  -  and  also  the  many  South
Africans at home and at work who join us this afternoon for  the  discussion
of this Budget Speech, good afternoon to all of you.


  The spirit of a people, its cultural level,  its  social  structure,  the
  deeds its policy may prepare - all this and more is written in its fiscal
  history, stripped of all phrases ... The public finances are one  of  the
  best starting points for an investigation of society,  especially  though
  not exclusively of its political life.

Those words were written by  a  renowned  commentator  on  economic  policy,
Joseph A Schumpeter.

We were rightly reminded by President Mbeki  in  his  state  of  the  nation
address of the vision and values that  were  so  clearly  stated  by  former
President Mandela a decade ago. Three  issues  stand  out  from  that  first
speech: creating a people-centred society, expanding the frontiers of  human
fulfilment, and extending the frontiers of freedom.

The Budget and its progressive evolution, as Schumpeter, one  of  the  great
commentators, said, is a powerful index of a society's  values,  not  merely
in its language and numbers, but in the lived experience of  its  impact  on
people, families, workers, businesses and organisations.

Development as freedom

We have made progress together, over the  first  10  years  of  democracy  -
South  Africans   of   all   ages,   colours,   circumstances,   lifestyles,
aspirations, occupations, with our individual strengths and weaknesses,  our
likes and dislikes, and even our quirks and oddities.

We have walked together one step at a time, on our journey  towards  growth,
towards  learning,  towards  reconstruction,  towards  solidarity,   towards
reconciliation, towards prosperity, towards development,  and  yes,  indeed,
towards freedom. We have walked together on this journey,  with  hope,  with
confidence, with humility, with  enthusiasm,  with  perseverance,  and  with
industriousness.

We have stayed together on this journey because we share  that  vision,  and
we will continue day by day and year by year to translate the  resources  at
our  disposal  and  the  opportunities   before   us   into   people-centred
development, human fulfilment and freedom.

Last year, in tabling the 2003 Budget, we reflected on Amartya  Sen's  brave
formulation of the central intent  of  economic  progress:  freedom  is  the
primary aim of development, and also the principal means  of  achieving  it,
he wrote. And we reflected on a formulation of that intent  that  goes  back
49 years to 26 June 1955, the Freedom Charter, and also  reminded  ourselves
that it  reflects  our  aspirations  for  political  freedom;  freedom  from
poverty; freedom to transform our  society,  its  culture  and  values;  the
freedom to explore our capabilities and the  freedom  that  will  grant  our
children choices that our parents did not enjoy.
This  is  a  freedom  that  opens  up  opportunities,   but   also   imposes
disciplines;  it  is  a  freedom  that  creates  capabilities,  but  expects
stewardship; it is a freedom that rewards enterprise, but clearly calls  for
accountability. It is a freedom we have used to build a new  society,  mould
a new culture and  create  hope  and  opportunity  for  future  generations.
Tlhabologo ke tokologo, uphuhliso yinkululeko. [Development is freedom.]

Budget priorities - past, present and future

This is the vision that has inspired us  for  the  past  10  years,  and  it
remains our guiding light for the decade ahead. Yet from  one  year  to  the
next we have to adapt our plans to the progress we have  actually  made  and
the changes in circumstance around us.

In 2002 we tabled a Budget in which R63 billion was added to our  three-year
spending plans; last  year  an  additional  R105 billion  went  to  national
departments, provinces and municipalities. This year we are able  to  add  a
further R44,5 billion  to  our  highest  priority  Public  Service  delivery
programmes. [Applause.]

Last year, we were able to  provide  R13  billion  in  personal  income  tax
relief. This year we can accommodate  more  modest  relief  of  R4  billion.
[Applause.] Last year, we projected a budget deficit of 2,4%  for  the  year
ahead; this year it will widen to 3,1%  of  GDP.  Economic  growth  in  2003
lagged somewhat behind our expectations, but  we  are  nonetheless  able  to
steer a course that builds on  the  spending  and  tax  plans  announced  in
previous years, and  we  can  take  several  significant  steps  forward  in
progressively meeting the social and economic development challenges  before
us.

Before turning to the specific proposals for the 2004-05 Budget and  beyond,
let me share with  this  House  some  of  the  thinking,  some  of  the  key
considerations that lie behind this Budget. Government's preliminary  review
of progress over the past decade, published as Towards a  Ten  Year  Review,
provides both an  instructive  account  of  what  we  have  achieved  and  a
reminder of the journey ahead. Cabinet's deliberations on budget policy  and
priorities have drawn on this work, and have also benefited  from  the  work
of the five cluster committees and their interdepartmental teams.

Reconstruction and development in review

It is important not just to look back at the journey we have walked, but  to
look back from the  perspective  of  the  aspirations  and  expectations,  a
decade ago, of our people; expectations that emerged from many thousands  of
meetings, consultations, iimbizo and people's forums in the lead-up  to  the
1994 democratic elections.

First among the aims of the Reconstruction and Development Programme was  to
meet the basic needs of all South Africans. And so successive  Budgets  have
progressively extended the resource envelope devoted  to  services  in  poor
communities:

-     1,6 million houses have been built;

-     700 new primary health clinics have been constructed, in  addition  to
  212 upgraded and 215 mobile clinics established; [Applause.]

-     potable water supplies have been extended  to  some  9  million  South
  Africans ... [Applause] ... and 6,4 million more people now benefit  from
  new sanitation facilities;

- about 4,5 million children  benefit  from  the  Primary  School  Nutrition
  Programme; and

- the number of social grant beneficiaries has increased  from  2,9  million
  to over 7,4 million, including recipients of the new child support grant.
  [Applause.]

I  think  the  numbers  speak  for  themselves.  But   we   recognise   that
vulnerability remains deep-rooted, exacerbated by  rising  unemployment  and
the long shadows cast by the social dislocation and exclusion of  the  past.
The fight against poverty will continue, focused increasingly in  the  years
ahead on creating work opportunities and  building  sustainable  communities
and safe residential neighbourhoods. [Applause.]

The second challenge of the  RDP  was  building  the  economy.  Following  a
decade in which average growth  was  just  1%  a  year  and  investment  and
productivity had steadily declined, the  challenge  of  building  a  dynamic
economy able to support rising living standards has been huge. For the  past
10 years, growth has  averaged  2,8%  a  year,  productivity  has  increased
strongly and many industries  have  successfully  adapted  to  international
competition.

-     Consumer inflation has averaged 7,3% since 1993, compared  with  14,3%
  over the previous decade.

-     Interest on public debt has fallen from 6,4% of GDP in  1996  to  4,7%
  last year.

-     Manufactured goods now comprise 38% of exports, up from 25% in 1994.

-     Private sector investment growth has averaged 5,4%  a  year  over  the
  past decade.
But we recognise that the pace of economic growth  has  to  be  accelerated.
Investment  in  industry  and  infrastructure  and  an  expansion   of   job
opportunities are critical  challenges  for  the  decade  ahead  -  both  to
underpin growth and to expand room for broad-based empowerment.

The third task we set ourselves was democratising  the  state  and  society.
Construction of a vibrant democratic state, founded on the rule of law,  has
been an unparalleled success of the past decade. Key  elements  include  our
constitutional order, rationalisation of the local  government  sphere  into
284   municipalities,   and   independent   agencies    with    well-defined
responsibilities - the  Constitutional  Court,  the  Public  Protector,  the
Human Rights Commission, the Gender Commission, and  the  National  Economic
Development and Labour Council, amongst other things.

Building on the work of the Growth and Development Summit held in June  last
year, Towards a Ten Year Review proposes an  ``encompassing  framework'',  a
partnership  that  better  integrates  the  activities  of  Government   and
harnesses the efforts of communities, labour, civil society and business  to
focus on the long-term development goals of our country.

Fourthly, we gave priority to developing  our  human  resources.  Education,
training and skills development are key foundations of social  and  economic
progress, and  preconditions  for  addressing  inequality  and  division  in
society. Over the past decade:

-     School education numbers have grown by 1,5 million to some  12 million
  learners, with broadly equal enrolment of  girls  and  boys,  and  marked
  reductions in out-of-age enrolment;

-     56 000 classrooms have been constructed;

-      a  skills  development  strategy  has   been   launched,   25   Setas
  established, 478  learnership  programmes  registered,  70  000  learners
  enrolled and an estimated 29% of workers underwent training in the fiscal
  year 2002-03;
-     the renewal of further education has begun with the  consolidation  of
  technical colleges into 50 new institutions;

-     the restructuring of higher education is under way,  with  a  view  to
  creating 21 consolidated institutions out of the former  36  universities
  and technikons.

Over the decade ahead, investment  in  the  quality  of  education  and  the
promotion of work-related training opportunities  will  remain  amongst  the
foremost priorities of Government.

The fifth RDP theme was  implementation  -  building  the  capacity  of  the
institutions to deliver. Progress on that front  underpins  everything  else
we have achieved. And again, we have to say there is more  to  be  done.  As
President Mbeki reminded us, our work is not complete until  the  spirit  of
Batho Pele permeates every administrative office, every magistrate's  court,
every clinic, every classroom and every licensing counter. [Applause.]

I  think  we  must  commit  to  this,  because  our  understanding  is  that
tlhabologo ke tokologo,  uphuhliso  yinkululeko  [development  is  freedom].
[Applause.]

Policy priorities for 2004 and beyond

Our achievements are not mere statistics; they tell a story  of  fundamental
transformation, on which all of us as South  Africans  can  look  back  with
pride. We  have  rolled  back  the  stumbling  block.  Our  path  is  clear.
[Applause.] We can celebrate the many ways in which we have pushed back  the
tide of poverty, and  pushed  forward  the  frontiers  of  our  freedom  and
humanity.

But as we look forward to the second decade of democracy  we  know  that  we
still have far to walk. Too many South Africans are trapped in the  ``second
economy'', characterised by poverty, inadequate shelter,  uncertain  incomes
and the despair of joblessness. And many of those  whose  circumstances  are
most vulnerable are young and marginalised.

A recent study of  household  dynamics  in  KwaZulu-Natal  illustrates  very
starkly how vulnerability is experienced in  impoverished  villages.  Income
security can be overturned in many unpredictable ways through the loss of  a
breadwinner's job, loss of livestock or  crops  through  disease  or  theft,
drought or flood, the impact of disease on family members, and  the  reality
of conflict and crime. Circumstances can change rapidly over time  and  vary
greatly between one community or neighbourhood and another. These  kinds  of
vulnerabilities hurt families and especially children, not just once but  in
recurring ways; not just through distress or hunger, but  in  wounded  minds
and fractured communities.

And so when we talk of development,  building  capabilities  and  empowering
our people, these are the lives, these are the experiences, that we seek  to
change. These are the reasons why the Growth  and  Development  Summit  last
year set a target of halving the unemployment rate by 2014.  These  are  the
reasons why President Mbeki has challenged us  to  increase  the  number  of
people in society who depend for their livelihood,  not  on  social  grants,
but on normal participation in the economy. But these are also  the  reasons
why we are progressively extending the social security system, with a  focus
particularly on the needs of children who cannot be expected to provide  for
themselves.

In reflecting on the challenges that lie ahead, Cabinet has had to  confront
difficult choices. Our task is,  simply  put,  to  accelerate  the  pace  of
growth  and  job  creation  and  extend  the  scope   of   development   and
empowerment. Our approach has four key priorities for the decade ahead:

-     we aim to increase the share of investment and saving out of  national
  income, to provide the infrastructure and  industrial  capital  formation
  required for sustained output growth. Our policies must aim to raise  the
  level of investment in the economy from its present 16% to  25%,  and  to
  halve the unemployment rate by 2014;

-     we will improve the  quality  of  education  and  access  to  training
  opportunities  to  ensure  that  skills  development   and   productivity
  enhancement contribute to expanding participation in social and  economic
  development;

-      we  will  diminish  the  inequalities  and  economic  divisions  that
  characterise our society through broad-based empowerment. We will  reduce
  poverty  by  creating  work  opportunities   and   building   sustainable
  communities, alongside consolidation of the social security system; and

-     we must, as a fourth objective, continue to build  sound  institutions
  competitive  markets,  support   for   emerging   entrepreneurs,   better
  governance and regulation, and rigorous  monitoring  and  measurement  of
  Public Service delivery.

Ten years from now, when we look back  on  what  we  have  achieved  in  our
second decade of freedom, what will we celebrate? What are the  values  that
future investigations of our society will  see  etched  in  our  social  and
economic history, and documented  in  the  records  of  our  programmes  and
policy implementation?
We will want to say that we have built a caring society.  We  will  want  to
say that we have reduced pain and extended joy. We will want to say that  we
have rewarded creativity and invested in capabilities. Indeed, we will  want
to say that compassion and industry have  overcome  greed  and  despair.  We
will want to say that those among us who enjoy the  privilege  of  power  or
riches have ploughed and not plundered our lands. The shape  and  trajectory
of the public finances will impact in important ways on this journey.

The 2004 Budget signals a clear direction. In the years ahead:

-     We will continue to expand housing, water  and  community  services  -
  the fastest growing categories of expenditure  over  the  past  decade  -
  because these are the investments that contribute  most  to  the  health,
  safety and comfort of our children and our children's children.

-     We will continue to extend and improve spending  on  health  services,
  which has grown in real terms by 4,3% a year since 1992-93.

-     We will continue to broaden the tax base  in  the  interests  of  both
  fairness and efficiency,  and  because  a  broad,  well-administered  tax
  structure is an important bulwark against unproductive  or  opportunistic
  forms of self-enrichment.

-     We will continue to  manage  the  public  finances  in  a  responsible
  manner that ensures that  debt  service  costs  decline  as  a  share  of
  expenditure and  of  GDP,  releasing  resources  for  productive  service
  delivery.

But there are  other  areas  in  which  we  will  need  to  seek  a  changed
trajectory, a more agile state and more vigilant institutions.  One  of  our
central achievements over the past years has been the reinforcement  of  the
social security net. In the period ahead we will complete the phasing in  of
the child support grant and will see continued growth in the  provision  for
those who qualify for old age and disability payments.

We propose to consolidate the grants  delivery  system  in  a  new  national
Social  Security  Agency.  Improved  food  security  and  partnerships  with
nongovernmental  organisations  are  also  ongoing   priorities.   Including
adjustments  for  inflation,  welfare  and  social  security   spending   is
projected to  grow  by  13,6%  a  year  over  the  MTEF  period.  Given  the
challenges we face, we have made these choices. But in the longer  term,  it
seems clear that we will need to seek a better  balance  between  growth  in
welfare  spending  and  our  investments  in  education  and  infrastructure
development.

In this Budget, we take several steps in this direction: an expanded  public
works programme through increased allocations for provincial  and  municipal
infrastructure; a renewed focus on learner support materials and  facilities
at disadvantaged schools; and further allocations for the  restructuring  of
higher  education  institutions.  These  are  orderly  and   well-considered
shifts, over time, in the structure of our public finances.  But  they  rest
on the same  fundamental  vision  and  values  that  underpinned  the  first
presidential lead projects announced just under 10 years ago.

In all of this we must seek not just improvements in the quality  of  Public
Service delivery, but also firmer partnerships with the business sector  and
civil society, drawing on the energy and capacity of all  our  people.  Itye
silisusile. [We have rolled back the stumbling block.]

Economic outlook

Let me turn to the outlook for the economy.

Global economy

The 2004 Budget is  tabled  against  the  background  of  a  global  economy
characterised by  extraordinarily  uneven  growth.  An  expansion  in  world
output is strongly driven by the recovery of the US  economy  -  underpinned
by  historically  low  interest  rates,  tax  cuts  and  unchecked   defence
spending. China continues to grow  rapidly  and  Japan  is  showing  greater
confidence after a long slowdown. However, most  of  Europe,  which  remains
South Africa's main trading partner, is still reporting growth below 1%.

While the recovery has gained momentum, there are imbalances  that  threaten
its sustainability. The United States' current account and  fiscal  deficits
and  the  weakness  of  the  US  dollar  have  led  to  immense  shifts   in
international  capital  flows,  including  attempts  by  Asian   and   other
countries  to  prevent  their  currencies  from  appreciating  by   amassing
dollars. This, in turn, impacts in unpredictable ways on the currencies  and
markets of emerging  economies.  South  Africa  has  benefited  from  rising
commodity prices and declining interest rates worldwide,  but  the  relative
strength of the rand and weakness of the dollar  -  the  currency  in  which
most of our  trade  is  denominated  -  have  impacted  negatively  on  many
exporters and import-competing industries.

Prospects for the domestic economy
Although exchange rate volatility  remains  a  concern,  the  South  African
economy is in a much better position  to  take  advantage  of  the  emerging
global economic recovery today than it was a decade ago. Sicenceshela  umthi
esautyala  ngo-1994.  [We  are  watering  the  tree  we  planted  in  1994.]
[Applause.]

We are now integrated into the global economy and we  have  diversified  our
trade by product and region. A healthier balance of payments position  means
that faster growth can be sustained without  the  boom-bust  cycles  of  the
past. We now have access to international capital markets,  allowing  us  to
source  long-term  foreign  capital  to  supplement  domestic  savings.   An
inflation-targeting framework has assisted in anchoring price  expectations,
while making monetary policy more transparent.

Wide-ranging reforms have reduced the vulnerability of  the  fiscus  and  we
have a well-regulated financial system  that  has  enabled  the  economy  to
withstand several shocks to the  international  financial  system  over  the
past decade. Within this  context  of  a  strong  macroeconomic  and  fiscal
framework, we have to streamline the operation  of  the  economy,  encourage
investment, address barriers to  business  development  and  invigorate  job
creation and labour market processes.

Key microeconomic reforms include:

-      Improving  the  efficiency  of  communication  and  transport  flows,
  including investment in ports, road and rail networks;

-     Easing the regulatory burden for small businesses;

-     Extending access to financial services;

-     Consolidating further education colleges and  expanding  training  and
  skills development opportunities;

-      Capacity-building  in  trade  administration,  regulation  of  public
  utilities and competition policy.
Our economy has expanded for 20 consecutive quarters -  the  longest  period
of  continuous  growth  for  over  fifty  years.  However,  the  preliminary
estimate of output growth of 1,9% last year is rather lower  than  the  3,3%
projected this time last year.

Factors  contributing  to  slower  growth  included  a  sharp   decline   in
agricultural production as a result  of  adverse  weather  conditions,  weak
demand in several trading partner countries and the impact of  the  strength
of the rand on industry and tourism-related sectors. Gross domestic  product
is expected to increase by 2,9% during 2004 and accelerate further  to  3,6%
and 4% in the next two years.

Expenditure, inflation and monetary policy

Gross domestic expenditure increased  by  an  estimated  4,4%  during  2003,
supported by monetary policy  easing  last  year  and  the  significant  tax
relief of the past two fiscal years. Despite the slowdown in  manufacturing,
capital formation remained robust and expanded by about 8% in  2003,  laying
a firm foundation for future output growth.

With  expenditure  rising  somewhat  faster  than  domestic  production,  we
recorded a rise in the deficit on the current  account  of  the  balance  of
payments. This is expected to increase moderately in the  years  ahead,  but
without unduly straining the overall balance of  payments,  which  benefited
from healthy capital inflows last year.

Inflation, as measured by CPIX, has slowed down significantly from its  peak
of 11,3% in October 2002. The tightening of  monetary  policy  during  2002,
the  stronger  rand  and  a  slowdown  in  the  food  price  trend  in  2003
contributed to the moderation in inflation. The CPIX is  now  firmly  within
the target range of 3% to 6%. Are you okay, Governor? [Laughter.]

With the producer price index indicating a decline  in  factory-gate  prices
year-on-year  to  December  2003   and   inflation   expectations   steadily
declining, our projection is that CPIX  inflation  will  average  4,8%  this
year and remain within the target band over the medium term.

Employment creation

Our shared vision clearly calls for more  vigorous  employment  creation  to
accompany improved  output  growth.  We  have  to  confront  this  challenge
forthrightly. In today's world fewer people till the lands, more  women  are
workseekers, technology advances rapidly and  there  is  fierce  competition
between poor, low-wage economies.  Thinking  people  across  the  globe  are
working to give  meaning  to  the  nature  of  work  and  sustainability  of
livelihoods in this changing environment.

Government cannot  tackle  this  problem  single-handedly.  Our  Growth  and
Development Summit last year, and the success of the Proudly  South  African
campaign, are  evidence  of  the  creative  power  of  joint  responsibility
between Government, employers, trade unions and communities.

Financial Sector Charter
This  spirit  of  working  together  also  characterised  the   process   of
developing the Financial Sector Charter, finally signed on 17  October  last
year. This important milestone in the  evolving  framework  for  empowerment
and broadening participation  in  the  economy  was  initiated  and  led  by
stakeholders in the sector, many of whom are in the  gallery  with  us  this
afternoon.

It sets out several specific transformation commitments for  human  resource
development, empowerment financing, procurement and enterprise  development,
broadening ownership and control and corporate social  investment.  It  aims
to extend financial services to 80% of lower-income people by 2008. A  draft
Code of Practice has already  been  published  for  empowerment  in  public-
private partnership projects, and other commitments of the Financial  Sector
Charter will lead to a balanced scorecard and a further  Code  of  Practice,
in terms of the Broad-based Black Empowerment Act.

When we look back in 10 years time, we will  measure  our  progress  against
these commitments. We will look for evidence not of a few who have made  the
leap to greater riches, but of a progressive broadening of  opportunity  for
all. Every step of the way we  will  remind  ourselves:  Sicenceshela  umthi
esautyala  ngo-1994.  [We  are  watering  the  tree  we  planted  in  1994.]
[Applause.]

We have to water this tree because it is ours. We cherish  it,  we  love  it
and it must provide for us in the future.

The Budget framework

For the fiscus and the Budget framework,  we  will  seek  assurance  that  a
progressive realisation of economic development and social rights  has  been
achieved without compromising sustainability and the legacy we  pass  on  to
our children's children.

Our fiscal policy is not engineered for short-term gain, but is directed  at
strengthening economic capacity and the resources  of  the  state  over  the
long haul. So, for example, we can point to  the  fact  that  whereas  state
debt costs have increased by less than  3%  a  year  since  1999,  education
spending has grown by 10% a year - and that has nothing to do with  where  I
squat.

The framework for the 2004 Budget is,  again,  able  to  provide  additional
resources to spend on our priorities. In  the  November  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement we revised downwards our revenue  projections  for  2003-04
by about R4,5 billion. The revised estimate for revenue this year is  R300,3
billion, marginally higher than the November number.

Taking into account a further appropriation  of  R250  million  for  drought
relief - a special Appropriation Bill for drought relief is being  tabled  -
and a reduction of R3,7 billion in debt service costs, the projected  Budget
deficit for 2003-04 is 2,6% of GDP. In keeping with the expansionary  fiscal
policy  stance  introduced  in  2001,  the  period  ahead  will  see  strong
increases in social spending and infrastructure  investment,  a  stable  tax
burden and declining debt service costs relative to GDP.
The Budget framework makes provision for an additional  R44,5  billion  over
the next three years relative to the  2003  Budget  forward  estimates.  The
main Budget provides for total expenditure of  R370  billion  in  the  first
year, rising to R439 billion by the fiscal year that ends on 31 March 2007.

Revenue increases from R327 billion to R394 billion over  the  same  period,
resulting in a deficit of 3,1% of GDP next year, declining to 2,8% by  2006-
07. After setting aside provisions for interest  payments,  Government  will
be spending over  R1  trillion  on  services  over  the  next  three  years.
[Applause.] In the light of so many economic sages ahead of  the  elections,
we should advise that R1 trillion has 12 zeros! [Applause.]

Our Budget framework makes provision for a contingency reserve. This  allows
for  unforeseeable  and  unavoidable  expenditure  in-year  and  for  policy
priorities in future years. If further resources are required for relief  in
drought-stricken  areas  -  they  will  be  expended  from   this   reserve.
Similarly,  the  taxi-recapitalisation  programme   and   further   critical
infrastructure projects in support of industrial investment will  be  funded
from the reserve if planning and project development  proceed  more  rapidly
than anticipated. Insha'Allah. [As God wills it.]

When looking at the spending of all three  spheres  of  Government,  several
trends are evident:

-     A larger proportion of the Budget  is  now  spent  at  provincial  and
  local  government  level  and  in  Government  agencies   and   entities,
  signalling  significant  progress   in   decentralising   budgeting   and
  accountability.

-      The  share  of  the  Budget  that  is  now  directly  transferred  to
  households increases by 7,3% a year  in  real  terms,  strengthening  the
  redistributive stance of the Budget.

-     Government expenditure on capital and infrastructure is  rising  as  a
  share of spending, contributing towards increased access to services  and
  facilitating economic development.
The evolution of a  stable  and  well-functioning  intergovernmental  fiscal
system has been  a  notable  success  of  South  Africa's  first  decade  of
democracy. In 1994 South Africa had fragmented administrations  designed  to
spend public resources and  deliver  services  along  racial  lines.  Budget
decisions were highly centralised and provinces, homelands and  black  local
authorities only existed as mere administrations  of  the  central  minority
Parliament.

That was ten years ago - some people  forget  that  that  was  the  starting
point of democracy. [Applause.]

Ten years later,  we  have  a  unitary  state  with  nine  sound  provincial
governments and  a  complete  set  of  municipalities  responsible  for  the
delivery of  basic  services  to  our  people.  Each  of  these  governments
determines its own budget, taking into account nationally-agreed  priorities
determined after consultations  through  forums  like  sector  Minmecs,  the
Budget Council and the Budget Forum, and culminating in an extended  meeting
of  the  Cabinet  where  Premiers  and  the  chairperson  of  the  SA  Local
Government Association are invited to participate.

Medium-term Expenditure Framework

Let me turn to our spending plans. In spite of our successes over  the  past
10 years, there is  further  room  for  improvement.  We  need  to  seek  an
improved  balance  between  the  expansion  of  social  services   and   the
reinforcement of investment  in  infrastructure  and  economic  development.
More work needs to be done to improve the quality  of  spending,  especially
in the areas of housing, health  services  and  school  education.  Although
improvements have been achieved in financial management, capacity  needs  to
be strengthened to realise better value for money.

Local government challenges include  improving  service  delivery  capacity,
maintaining and extending infrastructure, collecting revenue,  reducing  the
share of personnel expenditure, and  improving  accountability  through  the
timely submission of financial statements for audit.

Over the past decade, Government  has  made  concerted  efforts  to  redress
poverty and inequality through a substantial redirection of public  spending
towards key social and economic programmes. Spending on social services  has
grown from 44,4% of general Government expenditure in 1982-83  to  56,7%  in
2002-03. Spending on social security, health and housing and water  services
has  consistently  increased  over  the  period.  Education,   at   23%   of
noninterest expenditure, continues to make up the largest component  of  the
Budget. Most of our spending, particularly in social services,  is  targeted
towards poor and vulnerable  groups  as  a  basis  for  broadening  economic
prosperity through building human capabilities.

Next year, R195,4 billion of nationally raised revenue will  be  transferred
to provincial and local governments for  the  delivery  of  improved  public
services to all South Africans. This is about 62% of  the  national  revenue
after debt-servicing, and represents about 97%  of  all  provincial  revenue
and 14% of local government revenue.

Provinces and local government are the primary delivery channels  for  basic
services  and  will  receive   R30,2 billion   of   the   total   additional
R44,5 billion over and above that which we announced last  year.  This  will
see national transfers to provinces growing by 4,8% in real terms  over  the
MTEF while local government allocations will grow by  5,8%  in  real  terms.
Hon members may recall that we had a big debate because  some  of  the  MECs
last year said that we were just playing umrabaraba. This is a real  change,
and a significant one at that.

Provinces

In the  provincial  sphere  the  equitable  share  grows  by  an  additional
R19,7 billion over the next three years. This increase will  reinforce  pro-
poor social  services  spending  on  school  education,  health  and  social
security grants. Existing commitments  in  the  social  services  and  other
provincial  functions  including  housing,  roads,   transport   and   other
infrastructure will also be funded from this source.

Over the medium term, provinces and municipalities will  prioritise  labour-
based infrastructure projects as part of Government's Expanded Public  Works
Programme. Over the next five years, R15 billion will be channelled to  this
intervention in part through the  provincial  infrastructure  and  municipal
infrastructure   grants.   Together,   these   grants   receive   additional
allocations of R3,2 billion over the MTEF which will be partially  earmarked
for labour-based public works. Work opportunities will also  be  created  in
environmental programmes and in social development initiatives.

Provinces are expected to spend R65 billion  on  education,  R41 billion  on
health and R48 billion on social grants and  welfare  services  in  the  new
fiscal year. Much of the additional R26,3 billion allocated  over  the  2003
forward estimates will go to the comprehensive response  to  HIV  and  Aids,
further extension of social  assistance  to  the  poor  and  procurement  of
complementary inputs  such  as  textbooks  and  other  materials  in  school
education. [Applause.]

Provincial social development spending will rise by R6 billion  in  2004-05;
reaching a total of R47,8 billion in 2004-05  and  R62,4 billion  two  years
later. These amounts include R19,8 billion to  fund  the  extension  of  the
child support grant. In addition, provincial budgets provide  for  increases
in April of R40 in the pension and disability grant values to a  maximum  of
R740, and the child support grant increases to R170 a month. [Applause.]

Dear colleagues, we can only say wagwetywa ndlala! [Applause.] We're  saying
that a sentence has been imposed on hunger. Wagwetywa ndlala!

A further priority is  to  provide  comprehensive  agricultural  support  to
developing farmers, including those benefiting from the Land  Redistribution
for Agricultural Development programme. Through a  new  grant,  R750 million
will be transferred over the MTEF  to  provincial  agricultural  departments
for this purpose. [Applause.]

Local government

Minister Mufamadi, over the next three years municipalities will receive  an
additional R3,9 billion, taking  total  transfers  to  local  government  to
R47,3 billion. Through the local government equitable share, which  receives
an additional R2,2 billion,  Government  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  the
extension  of  basic  household   services.   Increased   local   government
allocations are intended to accelerate the delivery of  municipal  services,
especially water and electricity, to poor households. The  local  government
equitable share rises by 12,1% a year with a total budget  of  R28,5 billion
over the next three years.

Approximately R1,7 billion of the additional allocation of R3,9 billion  for
local government goes directly  into  the  Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant.
[Applause.] Thank you, Mr Carrim. This  enables  municipalities  to  address
backlogs in basic municipal infrastructure in a sustainable manner,  and  to
promote the creation of jobs through the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme.
Total grants for infrastructure increase to R5 billion in  the  first  year,
rising to R5,6 billion  and  then  R6 billion.  On  average,  infrastructure
transfers to municipalities increase by 13%  a  year  over  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. [Applause.]

Key financial reforms for the local sphere over the next  three  years  will
be driven by the implementation of the  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act,
which will take effect on 1 July this  year.  A  programme  for  the  phased
implementation of the Act will be issued shortly. It will  take  due  regard
of the uneven capacities of municipalities to implement  financial  reforms.
The legislation also  allows  for  a  municipality  to  borrow,  and  it  is
expected that these provisions  will  usher  in  new  players  in  the  bond
market.

Some large municipalities will be issuing municipal bonds very  shortly.  We
wish them every success, and we note that such borrowing will be  undertaken
without national or provincial government guarantees. [Laughter.]

National spending priorities

As part of the  broad  strategy  to  deepen  the  skills  base,  the  higher
education restructuring process receives  a  further  R1 billion.  Increased
support  for  curriculum  development  and   implementation   is   proposed,
particularly in the Further Education and Training sector.  Together,  these
initiatives will enhance the quality of education.

In health,  a  further  R2,1 billion  is  allocated  for  the  comprehensive
response  to  HIV  and  Aids,  including  the  provision  of  antiretroviral
treatment programmes by provinces through a conditional  grant.  [Applause.]
Health spending will also  include  implementation  of  the  new  rural  and
scarce skills allowances, which are aimed at improving  services  in  remote
areas and retaining highly skilled professional  groups  within  the  health
service.  Twenty  seven  hospitals  will  also  be  completely  upgraded  or
replaced as part of the hospital revitalisation programme,  over  the  MTEF.
[Applause.]

Fighting crime and streamlining the justice process continue to  be  central
priorities. The Budget allocates an additional R1,9 billion  over  the  next
three years for enhanced safety and security. [Applause.] In policing,  this
allows  for  the  recruiting  of  additional  personnel,   modernising   and
expanding the vehicle fleet and upgrading support systems.

To improve the efficiency of courts and reduce the  backlog  in  cases,  key
interventions are supported to streamline the  justice  process.  A  further
R475 million  is  provided  for  strengthening  court   administration   and
prioritising  services  to  vulnerable  groups,   particularly   women   and
children. [Applause.]  The  allocations  to  Correctional  Services  include
provisions for  establishing  new  remission  and  parole  boards  to  bring
community involvement into decisions to reintegrate offenders.
In pursuit of more equitable land ownership patterns, the  Land  Reform  and
Restitution programmes receive an additional R700 million. [Applause.]

Government is improving the coverage and  efficiency  of  core  services  in
Home  Affairs  by  deploying  67  mobile  offices   to   underserved   rural
communities.  [Applause.]  Provision  has  also  been  made  to  computerise
regional offices and to upgrade systems in general. These  initiatives  will
be  funded  through  additional  allocations  amounting   to   R850 million.
[Applause.]

As part of our  contribution  to  the  African  Union  and  Nepad,  Minister
Lekota, an additional R1,1 billion  is  allocated  to  support  peacekeeping
operations in Africa and R427 million to enhance  diplomatic  representation
abroad, Minister Dlamini-Zuma. [Applause.]

Revenue issues

We now turn to our revenue proposals. As our  economy  weakened  last  year,
similarly, our revenue collection has slowed. The revised  revenue  estimate
for the current fiscal year  -  that  one  which  ends  on  31  March  -  is
R300,3 billion, or R4,2 billion lower than  the  original  Budget  estimate.
The shortfall is mainly in company tax receipts. In recent  years,  our  tax
reforms have raised revenue from companies  significantly,  contributing  to
there being scope for personal  income  tax  relief.  This  has  unavoidably
increased the volatility of overall revenue trends somewhat.

Tax policy over the past  decade  has  been  completely  reshaped.  We  have
changed from a source-based tax system to  taxing  the  global  earnings  of
South African residents.  We  have  begun  taxing  capital  gains,  we  have
reduced  corporate  tax  rates,  we  have  made  substantial  reductions  in
personal income tax rates, especially for low and middle-income workers.  We
have zero-rated paraffin, reduced ad valorem excise taxes and  introduced  a
lower tax rate for small  businesses.  In  total,  we  have  announced  over
R72 billion in tax cuts since 1994. [Applause.]

Equally impressive is the change in tax administration. In  a  short  period
of time, the SA Revenue Service has overhauled many of  its  procedures  and
systems. We have created an environment that promotes tax  compliance.  This
is almost unique in developing countries.

The outcome of these policy changes and administrative reforms  is  that  we
have been able to reduce  the  deficit,  increase  resources  available  for
spending  and  give  considerable  relief  to  individuals.  These  factors,
including improved tax morality, have had an  immeasurably  positive  impact
on the economy.

Our revenue projection for the next fiscal year  is  R327 billion.  Although
economic performance is expected to rebound  this  year,  the  weak  revenue
performance obliges  us  to  be  more  prudent  with  tax  relief.  The  tax
proposals contain a moderate easing of the tax burden on individuals  and  a
somewhat higher tax incidence on tobacco products, alcoholic  beverages  and
fuels. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

I was going to ask for Hansard for those who are opposing this. [Laughter.]

Personal income tax relief

This year  we  propose  to  reduce  personal  income  taxes  by  R4 billion,
providing an adjustment that compensates taxpayers  for  inflation.  At  the
lower end of the income spectrum, there is some real relief.  Sixty  percent
of this relief will go to workers earning less than  R150 000  a  year.  The
primary rebate is raised to R5 800, increasing  the  threshold  below  which
people do not pay any income tax to R32 222. [Applause.] For people aged  65
and over, the threshold is raised to R50 000.  [Applause.]  Yes,  we  should
give the over-65s the opportunity to  applaud.  [Applause.]  Don't  pretend,
Kader. You may applaud when we say that. [Laughter.]

Interest and dividend income
To complement personal income tax relief, we  raise  the  domestic  interest
and dividend exemption threshold by 10% for those under 65 from  R10 000  to
R11 000, and for people aged 65 and older, from R15 000  to  R16 000.  These
proposals will take effect on 1 March this year  and  will  cost  Government
R62 million.

Transfer duty

The South African housing market has seen a notable recovery since 2000.  To
facilitate the acquisition of  houses  in  the  lower  end  of  the  housing
market, we  are  raising  the  exemption  threshold  for  transfer  duty  to
R150 000 from the beginning of next month. [Applause.]

Stamp duties on mortgage bonds and NCDs

To assist homebuyers  further,  stamp  duties  on  mortgage  bonds  will  be
removed from 1 March 2004 ... [Applause.] ... as this constitutes  a  second
levy in addition to the transfer duty. This measure will cost  R250 million.
Stamp duty on negotiable certificates of deposit will also be repealed  with
effect from 1 April, thereby completing the removal of  stamp  duty  on  all
debt instruments. Simultaneously,  measures  to  prevent  the  avoidance  of
duties on leases will be introduced.

Broad-based employee equity participation

We propose to encourage the broadening of equity ownership by employees.  An
issuance of shares to low-income employees at reduced or  no  cost,  subject
to a cap that will be announced, will not be deemed as income  for  purposes
of income tax if the shares are  held  for  a  prescribed  period  of  time.
[Applause.] These changes will facilitate long-term  ownership  by  workers,
facilitating  improvements  in   productivity   and   broad-based   economic
empowerment.

Excise duties

For the past seven years, excise duties  on  cigarettes  and  other  tobacco
products carried a total tax incidence of 50%. Evidence indicates that  this
policy has contributed to reducing consumption of  tobacco  products  almost
everywhere. The tax incidence will be revised upwards to 52%  for  the  next
three years, taking the tax on a packet of  cigarettes  up  by  64  cents  a
packet. [Applause.] Increases in tax on tobacco  products  will  raise  R800
million more.

The following adjustments to taxes on alcoholic beverages are proposed:

-     Tax on beer is raised by 4,3 cents per 340 ml can.

-     To calm the waters in the debate on  issues  relating  to  traditional
  leaders, there is no change in the tax on traditional  beer.  [Laughter.]
  [Applause.]

-     Tax on fortified wine rises to R2,33 per litre and on natural wine  to
  R1,17 a litre.

-     Ciders and alcoholic fruit beverages go up by 3,4 cents a 340 ml can.

-     Duties on spirits are raised by R1,76 for a 750 ml  bottle  to  R14,78
  cents. There is no distinction, Kader, between Irish and Scotch  whiskey.
  [Laughter.]

Tax increases on alcohol will raise a further R660  million.  These  excises
take effect immediately at 3 o'clock today. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Fuel taxes

The general fuel levy on petrol and diesel is raised by 10 cents a litre  to
R1,11 and 95 cents respectively, raising an  additional  R909  million  over
the next year. It's proposed that the Road Accident Fund levy be  raised  by
5 cents this year. Reform of the Road Accident  Fund  policy  framework  and
administration is  clearly  a  pressing  matter  for  the  year  ahead.  The
increases in fuel taxes take effect on 7 April this year.  To  offset  these
fuel levy increases, the diesel fuel rebate  is  increased  by  15  cents  a
litre, providing relief for the agricultural, forestry and mining sectors.

Ad valorem taxes

In the 2003 Budget, ad valorem duties on computers and  some  printers  were
removed. This year we propose the scrapping of these duties on all  computer
printers, recorded and prepared unrecorded media including  magnetic  tapes,
print film, photocopiers, certain cosmetic  products,  watches  and  clocks.
Why these things are there I don't know, but they are there.

Compliance, administration and further base-broadening initiatives

The filing campaign that the Revenue Service  launched  last  year  and  its
simpler returns have received very positive feedback  from  taxpayers.  This
year, additional work has been done to simplify returns and will  be  backed
by education around the filing process. Taxpayers are once  again  urged  to
assist in changing our compliance culture. The commissioner has  assured  me
that they, indeed, will.

Sars will continue to promote improved relations with taxpayers. A  taxpayer
charter spelling out the rights of taxpayers  is  now  being  discussed  and
finalised. New service offices will be opened during the next  three  months
in Pretoria East and Central Johannesburg.

In the past five years,  a  number  of  measures  have  been  introduced  to
support  small  businesses.  Reducing  the  regulatory   burden   on   these
businesses is  a  key  element  of  Government's  strategy  for  encouraging
employment creation. A working  group  will  be  established  this  year  to
review the compliance of small businesses.

In analysing corporate taxes, it's clear that the low  effective  tax  rates
in  certain  sectors  remain  a  cause  for   concern.   Sars   and   sector
representatives are meeting to discuss collaborative ways  of  dealing  with
this. Further analysis is also under way to look specifically at  structured
finance arrangements and  possible  reforms  in  the  mining  and  financial
service sectors. I am confident that  South  African  shareholders,  company
executives and boards will join us in seeking both  improved  tax  laws  and
full compliance, in keeping with good corporate citizenship. [Applause.]

I am also concerned about the tax loss associated  with  travel  allowances.
In the coming year, we plan to review the  taxation  of  the  motor  vehicle
allowance  and  the  ad  valorem  duty  structure  on  motor  vehicles.   In
conducting this review there  will  be  proper  consultation  with  all  the
relevant stakeholders so that all aspects can be taken into account.

In the area of mining Government will continue its work on the  Mineral  and
Petroleum Royalty Bill, which was initiated by  reforms  undertaken  by  the
Department of Minerals and Energy relating to the  control  and  development
of the country's valuable natural resources. As was announced  in  September
last year, Government plans  to  introduce  a  sales-based  revenue  royalty
charge. However, this charge will only take effect in  2009,  ensuring  that
the change in the tax regime does not  interfere  with  conversion  to  new-
order mineral rights  in  terms  of  the  Mineral  and  Petroleum  Resources
Development Act. These changes to the mining  and  petroleum  tax  structure
provide an opportunity to  review  the  industry's  tax  dispensation  as  a
whole.

Further steps in exchange control reform

Since 1995, South Africa has steadily eased exchange controls in  line  with
progress in achieving macroeconomic stability, strengthening of the  balance
of payments and financial sector development.

Companies' allowed use of South African funds to  finance  approved  foreign
direct investment currently stands at R2 billion per project for  investment
in Africa and R1 billion for projects  elsewhere.  These  limits  remain  in
place, but the percentage of the excess cost that can be funded  from  South
Africa is increased from 10% to 20%.

To improve their access to domestic credit in financing investment in  South
Africa or  domestic  working  capital  requirements,  foreign  companies  or
foreign-owned South African companies may now borrow locally up to  300%  of
the total shareholders' investment.

Measures will also be implemented during the course of this year  to  enable
foreign firms to list on South African capital markets, thus  allowing  them
to raise debt and equity finance on the JSE and  the  Bond  Exchange.  South
African individuals and institutional investors will be able to  participate
in such listings through their foreign investment allowances.

Lastly, in a further contribution to  the  aims  of  Nepad,  we  propose  to
develop a policy  framework  during  2004  to  promote  South  Africa  as  a
regional financial centre to cater more fully for the needs of  the  African
continent.  It's  envisaged  that  inward  listings  by  African  companies,
institutions  and  governments  should  be  encouraged  through  a   special
allowance for institutional investors, allowing them  to  invest  up  to  an
additional 5% of their total retail assets in African securities  listed  on
the JSE or Bond Exchange.
Exchange control amnesty

Last year, we announced an exchange control  amnesty  and  accompanying  tax
measures  to  deal  with  the  contravention  of   past   exchange   control
transgressions. The exchange control and tax amnesty  process  commenced  in
June 2003 with the appointment of an independent amnesty  unit.  There  have
been  several  refinements  to  the  regulations,  and  the   deadline   for
submission of applications was extended to 29 February  this  year.  By  the
end of January, 14 250 applications had been received.  The  House  will  in
due course be advised of the results of this  effort  to  increase  tax  and
exchange control compliance and the revenue receipts from the process.

Tips for Trevor

As in previous years, we invited  input  into  the  Budget  from  all  South
Africans. This year, we received over 2 200 Tips for  Trevor.  I  thank  the
contributors, who have helped me understand  many  taxpayers'  concerns  and
have added to the diversity of advice I have  had  to  consider.  There  are
many  wonderful  ideas  and,  not  unexpectedly,  a  few  which  make   very
entertaining reading. I want to respond to some  of  the  matters,  which  I
have grouped together because of their similarity.

Firstly, many contributors have raised what appears to  be  a  contradiction
in the system - workers are encouraged to save for retirement and then  live
off the interest earned. However, as the economy  improves,  interest  rates
decline and the incomes of pensioners shrink. The tax aspects of  retirement
provision are of great importance, and I have already asked a team from  the
National Treasury and Sars to look at the matter and report back.

Secondly,  there  was  a  surprisingly  large  number  of  ``tippers'',  not
tipplers, who asked that we  consider  scrapping  the  Personal  Income  Tax
system and hiking VAT to, say, 28%. The  first  part  of  this  proposal  is
clearly appealing, but sadly it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Such a  change
would not accord with the progressive nature of our  tax  system,  which  we
need  to  protect  because  of  the  huge  inequalities  in  society.  These
proposals will tend to discriminate heavily against the poor, and so  cannot
find a place in our system. [Applause.]

Thirdly, there have been representations for the abolition of VAT on  books.
Some time ago I requested a report on this matter, which I have  considered.
There are several problems. The  definition  of  a  book  for  tax  purposes
raises certain challenges - the case for reducing tax on, say, magazines  or
coffee-table publications, or Minister  Kasrils's  golf  magazines,  is  not
compelling. As it happens, the tax loss  would  be  large,  and  would  very
largely go to higher income households. With some personal regret, I  cannot
see how we could justify this change. I hope it  will  be  appreciated  that
recent revisions to the tax status of public benefit organisations  involved
in promoting literacy and reading provide a  more  efficient  and  equitable
fiscal contribution for this purpose.

Fourthly, there were many submissions on the idea of a basic  income  grant.
I have sympathy with the underlying intent. Government's approach,  however,
is to extend social security and income support through  targeted  measures,
and to contribute also to creating work opportunities and investing  further
in education, training and health services. [Applause.]  This  is  the  more
balanced strategy for social progress and sustainable development.

Madam  Speaker,  I  have  to  table  here  this  afternoon  nine   different
documents. The  Budget  Speech,  the  Estimates  of  National  Revenue,  the
Taxation Proposals in respect of Income Tax, the Division of  Revenue  Bill,
the  Budget  Review,  the  Appropriation  Bill,  the  Estimate  of  National
Expenditure, the Drought Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill,  and  the
Explanatory Memorandum  to  the  Drought  Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill. I do so now so that Parliament has a  record  that  I  didn't  pretend
that I did.

Over the past five years, President Mbeki has been  a  pillar  of  strength,
constantly providing leadership and vision. But  more  importantly,  he  has
challenged us to do  better  and  more  to  deepen  democracy.  We  are  all
profoundly indebted. [Applause.]

My gratitude also goes to Deputy President Zuma and my  Cabinet  colleagues,
in particular the members of the Ministers' Committee  on  the  Budget,  for
support and inspiration. Clearly, I have to thank  Deputy  Minister  Mandisi
Mpahlwa for sharing our duties in the way that he does  and  for  his  close
friendship. [Applause.]

I want to thank that impressive  gallery  up  there  -  the  nine  MECs  for
finance who have become known as "Team  Finance".  I  think  this  team  has
operated as a kind of dream team. I think we need to ask them  to  rise  and
take a bow for doing a sterling job under the circumstances. [Applause.]

I want to thank Governor Tito Mboweni and his team at the Reserve  Bank  and
I am glad to see that he is accompanied  by  the  Deputy  Governors  sitting
alongside him. They make our life  mainly  easier.  [Laughter.]   They  must
also rise. [Applause.] The President says he wants to see you Governor,  and
Jill and Ian. [Applause.] I also want to thank the members of the  Financial
and Fiscal Commission led by Mr  Murphy  Morobe  -  where  is  Murphy  -  Mr
Herbert Mkhize, the executive director of Nedlac; Barbara Hogan  and  Qedani
Mahlangu,  as  Chairpersons  of  the  Portfolio  and  Select  Committees  of
Finance; and, Tutu Ralane and Nhlanhla Nene, as Chairpersons  of  the  Joint
Budget Committee.  [Applause.]  I  also  want  to  thank  Pali  Lehohla  and
everybody at Stats SA.

Let me take this opportunity  to  introduce  to  this  House  the  brand-new
Director-General of the National Treasury, Mr Lesetja Kganyago.  [Applause.]
He has had a baptism of fire in the past two weeks,  and  friend,  it's  not
going to get any easier. Thanks also go to Maria Ramos who has  been  kicked
upstairs somewhere nd who served as director-general  up  to  November  last
year and oversaw much of the period  when  this  Budget  was  put  together.
[Applause.] Thanks also to Ismail Momoniat who served  as  acting  Director-
General for the National Treasury between  November  and  January.  Momoniat
did a sterling job in maintaining the  high  performance  standards  in  the
Treasury. [Applause.]
Special thanks go to Commissioner Pravin Gordhan for his wisdom, advice  and
support. [Applause.] We are deeply indebted to the thousands of  people  who
collect our revenue at the SA Revenue Service. [Applause.] Thanks  are  also
due to the staff of the National Treasury and the Ministry  of  Finance,  as
well as their families who share the burden.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for  their  support  and
for tolerating me during this crazy period. [Applause.]

One of South Africa's living treasures, the poet, Dr Don Materra, writes:


  This land, the whole land
  Will be healed, must be healed
  These feeding cornfields and faces of sunflower
  Sprawling farms scrawling grass and tree
  The jabbering jacaranda
  The pointing pine the partisan protea
  The vineyards the orchards
  Bursting fruit and grazing grain
  Defiant cactus in desert dunes
  Flashing swords against pretorian knaves
  These gifts of earth must be shared
  With all the caring it takes
  To heal a million hearts


  This land, the whole land
  Must be healed, will be healed

[Applause.]

This Budget seeks to express, in Schumpeter's phrase, the collective  spirit
of our people, and in Don Materra's words, the healing spirits. It charts  a
way forward in extending the frontiers of freedom, of human  fulfilment,  of
creating a people-centred society. But, the legacy  we  leave  must  not  be
told just in  the  numbers,  it  must  be  borne  out  in  the  values  that
characterise our time.

We will create a caring society. We will reduce  pain  and  extend  joy.  We
will reward creativity and invest  in  human  capabilities.  Compassion  and
industry will overcome greed and despair. [Applause.]
And, finally, so that our children can enjoy shade in  the  summer,  let  us
plant and nurture these indigenous trees. That is a  statement  of  what  we
want to do about a different South Africa.  Where  trees  grow  has  largely
been a statement of a dividing line  between  wealth  and  poverty.  Let  us
plant the trees for our children. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
