                  MOTION ON REVIVAL OF ANTI-TERRORISM BILL

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Hon  members,  I  was
informed that the Whippery has agreed that we won't have Motions  today.  We
will, therefore, proceed straight to the  Order  Paper.  Just  before  I  do
that, may I remind all members that we do have a very congested  day  today?
We will not be very lenient in terms of time allocated to you. At  times  we
become very lenient, but today we're going to be strict on time.

You had better look at your speech again and pick up what you think is  most
important, because the time allocated to you will be the time  allocated  to
you. If and when I say the time has expired,  you'll  have  to  respect  the
Chair, unfortunately, and sit down. We don't like to do it in the  NCOP.  We
normally give you some extra time to finish your sentence, but  we're  going
to be a little stricter today. If you don't know how many minutes  you  have
for speaking, can the provincial Whips please assist?  Let's  do  that.  The
Chief Whip is also available to  inform  other  people  regarding  the  time
allocated to them.

                          REVIVAL OF ANTI-TERRORISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL (Mr V V  Z  Windvoël):  Chairperson,  I
move:


  That, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly, the Protection
  of Constitutional Democracy  against  Terrorist  and  Related  Activities
  Bill, which was originally introduced  as  the  Anti-Terrorism  Bill,  be
  revived and consideration of the Bill be resumed from the stage where the
  Bill, in the version passed by the National Assembly, is  transmitted  to
  the National Council of Provinces for its concurrence.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): There is no  speakers'
list. I shall now put the question, and the question is that the  motion  be
agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are

heads present? They are.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. Is  there  any  province
that wishes to do so? None.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall do  this  in  an

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 14 - Arts and Culture

Debate on Vote No 18 - Science and Technology

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Just  before  I  call
the Minister, I want, on behalf of  the  Council,  to  thank  the  executive
members. You would realise that we have  clustered  our  committees  in  the
NCOP, and therefore the debates. This Parliament would like to be  clustered
and we are happy that we have acceded to this type of  a  cluster  also.  It
tells us a lot of things, because as the NCOP we then  begin  to  understand
that the two departments have to consult with each other, and when we go  to
the provinces, we are more informed as we do  our  oversight.  So,  on  that
score I would like to thank all of you, particularly the two  Ministers  and
their Deputies ...

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Deputy Chairperson, MECs here present  and
their Deputies, hon members of the NCOP, the nine provinces of  our  country
are blessed with a wealth  of  arts,  cultures  and  languages.  From  these
diverse components we have made a collective commitment to knit  together  a
new nation. That challenge stands at the core of the work of the  Department
of  Arts  and  Culture.  This  department   has   been   tasked   with   the
responsibility of being the custodian of  South  Africa's  diverse  cultural
and artistic heritage. And our  vision  is  to  harness  these  to  engender
social cohesion and to enhance nation-building.

In his state of the nation address, President Mbeki urged us to achieve ...


  ... further and visible advances with regard to the  improvement  of  the
  quality of life of all our  people,  affecting  many  critical  areas  of
  social existence,  including  moral  regeneration,  social  cohesion  and
  opening the doors of culture and education to all.

This department is uniquely placed  to  contribute  to  the  realisation  of
these goals. We  owe  our  achievements  over  the  past  10  years  to  the
Department of Arts  and  Culture's  predecessor,  the  Department  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology. The Department of Arts and Culture is  thus
a new department, created this year by separating out the arts  and  culture
functions from those of science and technology.

I want to acknowledge the sterling contribution of former Minister,  Dr  Ben
Ngubane, who oversaw many of the achievements in this sector over  the  past
decade. A new directorate, Arts and Culture in  Society,  has  been  set  up
within the department to steer the arts and culture on a  course  of  social
regeneration  by  providing  strategic  support  to  arts  institutions  and
organisations of civil society.  Addressing  the  issues  of  inclusion  and
integration, so as to end  resource  inequalities  in  the  sector,  is  its
central task. Inclusion of vulnerable groups such as  the  disabled,  youth,
women and children is one of its strategic imperatives.

Two sub-programmes contribute directly  to  social  development  and  social
cohesion. They will be directed at out of school youths, the  rehabilitation
of  prisoners  and  the  Moral  Regeneration  Movement.  Arts   and   Social
Development  is  responsible  for  initiating  and  managing  projects   and
programmes aimed at the youth, HIV and Aids, crime prevention, human  rights
and disability.

We  are  planning  a  project  in  co-operation  with  the   Department   of
Correctional Services: ``Arts in Prisons'', using the  arts  to  modify  the
behaviour of offenders serving time in prison. The ``Outstanding Inmates  in
Arts'' and ``Dramatists against  Crime''  projects  will  commence  in  July
2004.  During  2003  the  National   Heritage   Council   was   established.
Transforming our museums and art galleries is a  big  challenge  that  would
entail rigorous research to make them truly representative  and  to  correct
numerous  historical  distortions.  Four  of  nine  Pilot  Legacy  Projects,
approved by Cabinet in 1998, were completed  in  June  2003,  including  the
Women's Monument and Constitution Hill. The  Chief  Albert  Luthuli  project
will be unveiled in July 2004 once it has been completed.

A new portfolio of projects located in various provinces -  the  Mapungubwe,
eMakhosini Valley, Liliesleaf, Steven Bantu Biko, Robert  Mangaliso  Sobukwe
and Sarah Baartmann  projects  are  in  the  pipeline.  To  speed  up  their
implementation, the Department will  co-operate  with  other  implementation
agencies, non-governmental organisations and community-based  organisations.
Last year  Cabinet  approved  the  National  Language  Policy  Framework  to
promote the equitable use  of  the  11  official  languages  and  to  ensure
redress for previously marginalised indigenous languages.

In March 2004 the Department launched the  Language  Initiatives  Programme.
Of particular importance  to  the  provinces  is  the  setting  up  of  nine
Language Research Development Centres, one for each of South  Africa's  nine
indigenous languages, at tertiary institutions  situated  among  communities
where those languages are spoken. One of  the  National  Language  Service's
outputs for 2003 was the development, in collaboration  with  nine  tertiary
institutions, of mathematics terminology in all nine  African  languages.  A
mathematics terminology list, containing approximately  10  000  terms,  was
consequently launched in June 2004.

In the 2003-04 financial year, substantial progress was made  with  Declared
Cultural Institutions situated in six of the provinces.  New  councils  were
established for all 13 bodies and a transformation budget of R7 million  has
been distributed. These new councils face numerous challenges. They have  to
improve access to the museum infrastructure, develop new audiences,  develop
human  resources,  implement  an  affirmative  action  policy  by  training,
grooming and appointing a new generation of curators and managers  from  all
races,  implement  exciting   community   outreach   programmes,   introduce
acquisition policies that accord indigenous artefacts their rightful  place,
and integrate living heritage in the form of oral  tradition,  oral  history
and  indigenous  knowledge  systems  into  the   ambit   of   our   heritage
institutions.

Within the department itself, the targets set by the White Paper  have  been
exceeded. The White Paper had set a target in management of  50%  black.  It
now stands at 86% black. The target for females in  management  set  by  the
White Paper was 30%. It  now  stands  at  32%  female.  Overall,  the  staff
composition at present stands at 70% black, 30% white, 55%  female  and  45%
male. I think that is quite remarkable.
Service delivery in all our programmes has been good. Arts  and  Culture  in
society mainstreams the role of the arts and culture  and  supports  various
disciplines via grants disbursed by the National Arts Council. In  the  past
year  the  department  successfully  assisted  15  historic  community  arts
centres  with  their  funding   applications   to   the   National   Lottery
Distribution Fund. The R5 million  application  has  been  approved  by  the
Fund. The setting up of Provincial  Steering  Committees  and  the  National
Steering Committee for community  arts  centres  will  ensure  a  long-term,
transparent relationship between the department and the sector.

Collaboration with provincial departments is yielding gradual, but  positive
results. Eight provinces have received funding  for  their  projects,  which
involve all the major centres in each province. In total R1, 8  million  has
been invested in  regional  community  arts  centre  projects.  Through  the
Promotion of Arts and Culture in South Africa  subprogramme,  six  theatres,
three orchestras and a range of other artistic endeavours were funded.

The promotion of our new national symbols to the South African  public  will
begin  this  year,  2004-05.  Cultural  Development  and  International  Co-
operation, one  of  the  Department's  most  important  programmes,  is  the
gateway to economic and other developmental opportunities for South  African
arts and culture  at  provincial,  national  and  international  level.  Key
activities include supporting the cultural industries  and  the  development
of arts training, as well as maintaining 37 international agreements.

In partnership with the Flemish government, we are  developing  a  arts  and
education training  centre  in  KwaZulu-Natal  by  the  in  and  pre-service
training for artists and for art teachers. Arts education and  training  has
also held accreditation workshops  around  the  country  to  alert  training
institutions in both the formal and informal sectors to the requirements  of
the SA Qualifications Authority.

The establishment of Create SA stands out as arts education  and  training's
most important  achievement.  Through  Create  SA,  learnerships  driven  by
industry demand have been awarded  in  a  wide  range  of  areas,  including
music, design, crafts, arts management, heritage and  the  performing  arts.
Since  2003  approximately  2  000  learnerships   or   skills   development
programmes have been taken up.

Our Cultural Development and International Co-operation  programme  is  also
responsible for the Investing in Culture programme,  which  focuses  on  the
crafts, music, heritage and  cultural  tourism  sectors.  The  Investing  in
Culture  programme  aims  to  identify  and  use  existing   skills   within
communities and  among  individuals.  It  is  the  single  most  significant
intervention this department is making in the second economy.

To date, some 12 000 jobs have been created; some 22 000  people  have  been
trained; and 428 000 training  days  have  been  accumulated.  The  National
Treasury has recognised the contribution that the  Department  of  Arts  and
Culture  is  making  in  the  fight  to  eradicate  poverty  and  to  create
remunerative work. We want to appeal to this House to support us in  seeking
a bigger budget allocation which will enable us to do a great deal more.

The department's plans  for  2004-05  are  dominated  by  transfers  to  the
heritage institutions and to  the  arts  and  culture  institutions.  It  is
projected that such transfers will take  up  an  average  of  82,9%  of  the
department's expenditure over the  medium  term.  The  department  plans  to
continue the work outlined earlier, as  well  as  to  attempt  an  equitable
distribution  of  funds  to  ensure  the   sustainability   of   playhouses,
orchestras and the Moral  Regeneration  Movement.  Two  new  orchestras  are
projected for the financial year 2004-05.
We will also provide grants to programmes in the 24 community  arts  centres
where we are active, and fund 10 arts festivals. We  plan  to  increase  the
participation of the disabled in festivals and to enhance  their  access  to
arts and culture in general.

The sum of R93 million has been allocated to performing  arts  institutions.
Orchestras will receive R9 million. Promotion of Arts and Culture  has  been
allocated  some  R36  million,  and  the  National  Arts  Council  has  been
allocated R44 million. Arts and  Culture  in  Society  is  to  receive  R218
million or 19,11% of the department's budget.

Equity for indigenous languages, the heart of the language policy spelt  out
in  our  Constitution,  came  closer  to  realisation  when  the  department
unveiled  three  language   development   initiatives   at   the   Advancing
Multilingualism in a Democratic South Africa  conference  in  Durban  during
March 2004.

The department has provided  R9  million  in  its  budget  for  the  current
financial year for the setting up of the Language Research  and  Development
Centres and R5 million for a  bursary  scheme.  Sepedi,  Sesotho,  Setswana,
siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, isiNdebele, isiXhosa  and  isiZulu  will  each
have an LRDC to ensure their public use in important  fields,  ranging  from
law to education, and to encourage  and  support  language-related  research
that is relevant and responsive to  the  needs  of  the  speakers  of  these
languages. The centres will be set up and will work  closely  with  tertiary
institutions around the country with the respective  communities,  and  will
forge partnerships with nongovernmental and  community-based  organisations.
Of  all  their  tasks,  perhaps  the  most  immediately  important  will  be
providing interpreting and translating services  to  the  community,  either
directly or by referral.

Here I must point  out  the  application  of  the  principle  of  functional
multilingualism  or  linguistic  differentiation  that  will   ensure   that
communities located in close proximity to the  institution  have  access  to
both the production and consumption of knowledge. The need  for  translation
from and into foreign languages has, of course, increased  as  South  Africa
has become more involved in the international arena. This  finds  reflection
in this programme's budget.

We plan to establish 20  sites  for  a  telephone  interpreting  service  at
clinics and customer-care  centres  by  December  2004.  The  completion  of
terminology lists for science and technology is scheduled for completion  in
September 2004. Overall, the National Language Service  has  been  allocated
some R78 million, which amounts to 6,8%  of  the  department's  budget.  The
provision for the National Language Service includes a once-off  amount  for
implementing the National Language Policy Framework.

Cultural industries have been allocated some  R16  million.  Funds  will  be
transferred to support music, crafts, books  and  publishing,  film,  design
and other sectors. Cultural Development and International  Co-operation  has
been allocated 13,5% of the department's budget.

Of the Heritage Promotion  budget,  we  have  set  aside  R340  million  for
declared cultural institutions and  R175  million  for  capital  works.  The
National Heritage Council and Transformation received R21 million.  Heritage
transformation projects include the Oral History  Project,  the  results  of
which we plan to incorporate into a national register of oral sources.

The SA Heritage Resources Agency is of specific interest to  the  provinces.
Section 34 of the  National  Heritage  Resources  Act  of  1999  places  the
responsibility  of  granting  permits  squarely  with  provincial   heritage
resources authorities. This suggests that the provincial heritage  resources
authorities must be built up because they carry the sole responsibility  for
granting permits that are necessary for development  and  conservation.  The
challenge that the heritage sector has been facing is the slow  inauguration
of the provincial heritage resources agencies  in  some  of  the  provinces.
Even where they exist, they lack capacity to execute their functions.

In the budget, the SA Heritage Resources Agency is  allocated  R16  million.
With the participation  of  communities,  we  aim  to  declare  several  new
heritage sites by September 2004. A total of R593 million, or  52%,  of  the
department's budget has been  set  aside  for  heritage  promotion.  We  are
taking up the challenge to get down to work in a people's contract to  build
a better South Africa and a better world.

I want also to take this opportunity to thank, in  the  first  instance,  my
Deputy who will be speaking later in the debate,  the  director-general  and
his staff for the contributions that have been made  to  the  work  of  this
department. I also want to acknowledge  the  contributions  that  have  been
made to the success of the work of this department  by  the  various  Deputy
Ministers in Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. There  have  been  three
Deputy Ministers over the past 10 years. I don't think I need to  name  them
all; you are all aware of who they were.  I  want  to  thank  them  for  the
contribution they have made to building up  this  particular  sector.  Thank
you very much. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, hon MECs  present,  hon
members, our Ministry and department, as members may be aware, are  mandated
to realise the full potential  of  science  and  technology  in  social  and
economic development through the development of  human  resources,  research
and innovation.

I am honoured, therefore, to present to the Council,  for  the  first  time,
the Budget Vote on Science and Technology. The new Ministry of  Science  and
Technology is the result of a deliberate attempt by Government to renew  our
research and development  of  human  capital  as  a  means  of  growing  and
modernising our economy, and thereby improving the lives  of  our  citizens.
To underpin this intent, in his second state of the nation address  in  May,
the President announced Government's intention  to  increase  the  resources
for research and development.

The Department of Science  and  Technology  will  give  expression  to  this
social and economic development vision of Government by actively  supporting
the transfer and application of new technologies derived from  cutting  edge
research, to the benefit of all our people. This means that  the  Department
of Science and Technology will provide the  foundation  which  supports  the
delivery that ultimately takes place  in  different  sectors  and  different
departments of Government.

As already stated in our budget debate in the National Assembly  last  week,
the national research and development spending fell sharply  from  1,04%  to
0,75% of the GDP from 1991 to 1993, when the former  government  drastically
curtailed its strategic  technology-based  missions,  such  as  its  nuclear
capability  and  the  technology  platforms  underpinning   South   Africa's
military dominance in the  subcontinent.  This  had  a  profound  effect  on
research and development in our  country.  The  new  Government,  therefore,
inherited a science system that had its key  drivers  removed.  We  need  to
motivate  our  scientists  by  redirecting  them  towards  new  missions  of
national competitiveness and quality of life, and to  produce  a  cohort  of
young scientists that is more representative of South Africa's people.  This
is one of our biggest tasks because, as things  stand  at  the  moment,  the
vast majority of our scientists are ageing and are white.  Women  and  black
people need to be drawn in larger numbers towards  science,  technology  and
development.

Our expenditure on  research  and  development,  according  to  the  2001-02
survey, now stands at 0,76% of the GDP.  Over  half  of  this  research  and
development is conducted by the private sector,  indicating  the  increasing
role of innovation in the South African industry. However, we need to  raise
this level of investment to at least 1% of the GDP, which is the  target  we
set ourselves in the 2002 Research and Development Strategy.

In our estimation we are still about R2 billion  per  annum  short  of  this
target.  In  the  current  budget,  our  request  for  R1  billion  new  and
additional resources was trimmed in the ultimate allocation  to  around  one
tenth of the amount. Although this amount did not meet our expectations,  we
still made the following gains: We were allocated an additional R10  million
for the establishment of the new National Energy Research Institute  and  we
are also one of the departments that  were  granted  additional  funding  to
continue our poverty reduction projects to the  tune  of  R45  million,  R47
million and R53 million over the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  period
for the community level projects that use science and technology  to  create
employment and businesses on a sustainable basis.

We have also  realised  that  we  need  to  involve  all  three  spheres  of
Government  in  order   to   effectively   implement   policies   addressing
development,  poverty  alleviation  and  service  delivery  priorities.  One
programme  where  this  approach  has  been  successful   is   the   Poverty
Alleviation Project, where we have had positive outcomes in  businesses  and
co-operatives focused on, among others,  bee-keeping,  papermaking,  African
design incorporation in clothing and textiles based on natural  fibres,  and
indigenous  cattle  production.  These  projects  are  concentrated  in  the
poverty nodes as  identified  by  the  Government's  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural Development Plan, and have yielded over 2 899  jobs  employing  1  675
women, 862 youth and 68 people with disabilities.

Another area where we stand a better chance of increasing our  international
competitiveness  is  in  the  indigenous  knowledge  systems.  The   central
challenge for  governments  the  world  over  is  the  protection  of  their
indigenous knowledge systems. This is why the South African  Government  has
placed  great  emphasis  on  the  development  of  an  IKS  policy  and  IKS
legislation, which will significantly protect, develop and promote IKS,  and
help  improve  the  livelihood  and   economic   wellbeing   of   indigenous
communities by  ensuring  equitable  and  fair  benefit  sharing.  For  this
reason, we intend tabling the IKS policy before Cabinet very soon.

My  department's  commitment  in  recognising  the  indisputable  wealth  of
indigenous knowledge is validated in various projects which  include,  inter
alia, the drafting of the IKS policy and  Bill;  financial  support  of  the
Indigenous Knowledge Systems of South Africa Trust; the establishment of  an
interdepartmental committee on IKS; dedicated ring-fenced funding  from  the
NRF  for  IKS  research;  and  the  development  of  a  framework  for   the
establishment of the South African  Indigenous  Knowledge  Digital  Library.
This is  based  on  the  Traditional  Knowledge  digital  Library  completed
recently by India.

Implementation of the National Biotechnology Strategy is  continuing  apace,
with  substantial  portfolios  of  research  in  medical,  agricultural  and
industrial biotechnology taking place  mainly  through  research  consortia,
facilitated through the biotechnology innovation centres.

The key three centres to leverage biotechnology opportunities  according  to
specialisation in biotechnology are: the  Biopad  Bric  in  Gauteng  region,
which  focuses   on   animal   health   and   industry/environmental-related
biotechnology; the Ecobio Bric in  KwaZulu-Natal,  which  focuses  on  human
health  and  bioprocessing,  with  a  plant  biotechnology  focal  area   to
contribute to plant biotechnology; and the Cape Biotech Initiative  Bric  in
the Western Cape, which focuses on human health and bioprocessing.

The National Technology Transfer Strategy is now  in  its  final  stages  of
review and adoption, and should  be  implemented  intensively  from  2005-06
onwards. This strategy is premised by  the  critical  role  that  technology
plays in wealth creation and  social  development.  Technology  transfer  is
generally driven by imperatives  to  introduce  manufacturing  efficiencies,
value-added product developments, novel products for competitive  strengths,
efficiencies in service provision and quality of life improvements in  terms
of access to basic goods and services. In the current setting there are  two
Department of Science  and  Technology  interventions,  namely,  the  Godisa
Programme, an incubator and  technology  demonstration  programme,  and  the
Tshumisano technology stations at Universities of Technology that are  aimed
at business creation and support through technical improvement, product  and
process innovation.

The Godisa Programme was launched in 2001 to stimulate technology  transfer.
It is  currently  supporting  eight  technology  transfer  centres  in  five
provinces, which are Gauteng, the Free  State,  KwaZulu-Natal,  the  Eastern
Cape and the Western Cape, focussing on a multitude of technology  platforms
and  markets  such  as  biotechnology,  life  sciences,   medical   devices,
software, embedded systems, fine  and  performance  chemicals,  small  scale
miners and hydroponics for cut-flower exports. This technology transfer  has
very real local and  international  benefits  and  directly  leads  to  job-
creation,  increased  levels  of  competency  and   enhanced   international
competitiveness.

With  over  seven  hundred  small-scale  miners  and  almost   one   hundred
manufacturing SMEs supported so far, Godisa is set to double  the  level  of
services to SMEs in terms of technical support  over  the  next  two  years.
This year, the establishment of two further centres to support the  National
Public Works' Emerging Contractors Programme in  Limpopo  and  KwaZulu-Natal
and the Biodiesel Initiative in Limpopo are underway.

There are now nine Tshumisano stations operating out of the Universities  of
Technology  environment  in  specific  sectors  to   enrich   research   and
development, teaching and learning  activities  with  better  equipment  and
more realistic understanding of industry and its needs. The sectors  include
chemicals, textiles, electronics, metal processing,  mechanical  engineering
and food technology.  Members  might  be  aware  that  this  department  has
prepared a recipe book which is being used by  various  communities  in  our
country in order to enhance traditional dishes and, of course, also to  make
a living out of implementation of programmes related to food technology.

During the past year, Tshomisano doubled its SMME client base  from  206  to
just over 400 SMMEs with about a thousand development  projects.  This  will
grow to a target level  of  800  SMMEs.  Support  for  the  SMMEs  owned  by
historically disadvantaged individuals in the sectors outlined earlier,  has
also been increased by roughly 50%. In closing, I would  like  to  reiterate
my department's commitment to working with all  role-players  to  contribute
to the improvement of the lives of all  our  people.  We  certainly  need  a
governance approach which involves all three spheres of  government.  Deputy
Minister  Hanekom  will  elaborate  on  some  of  the  programmes  that  the
department is involved in, when he gets his chance later on. Thank you  very
much, Chair. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Thank you, Chair. At the beginning of this debate  you  made  a
remark about time, and I just want to tell you that I  have  been  given  10
minutes to speak and I am going to donate some of these minutes to  you  and
you can use those at your own discretion. [Laughter.] At  the  beginning  we
want to  congratulate  both  the  Ministers  and  their  Deputies  on  their
appointments in their respective departments. We have no doubt in our  minds
that they will discharge their responsibilities with distinction.

Over the past decades, and even during the past century,  the  world  saw  a
scientific and technological  revolution.  It  was  a  revolution  that  has
changed the productive forces  in  the  economies  of  the  developed  world
beyond recognition. The ability to create, distribute, reinvent and  exploit
knowledge has become a major source  of  competitive  advantage.  The  newly
industrialised Asian countries, which are today known as the  Asian  tigers,
are testimony to this. Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore  and
others, which not long ago were backward countries, are  today  an  envy  to
many nations in the world. They transformed  their  economies  by  improving
the technological performance of their industries through  well  thought-out
science and technological policies and strategies.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said about African countries. In  the  past
40 years or so, the economies of the African countries have either  declined
or stagnated. This is due to, among other  things,  the  fact  that  African
countries have not yet been engulfed by  the  scientific  and  technological
revolution we are talking about. The  challenge  therefore,  for  developing
countries in Africa and elsewhere, is to invest in  science  and  technology
if they are to be partners in this globalising world.

Our democratic Government has realised that we cannot  be  perpetual  buyers
of developing technology, but we must be developers of technology  ourselves
through scientific research. To be able to do so, we need to  develop  home-
grown scientists who will engage in research and  come  up  with  scientific
inventions that will go a long way in bettering the lives of our people.  It
is for this reason that our Government decided to establish a  fully-fledged
Department  of  Science  and  Technology.  This  department  will  focus  on
realising the fulfilment of science and technology in  social  and  economic
development  through  the  development  of  human  resources,  research  and
innovation, as the mission statement of the department indicates.

The department seeks to provide strategic direction and  support  scientific
research and technology, both in the public and private sectors, so that  we
can see new businesses and products in the market. We are told that this  is
already beginning to happen, but we need more. We say this  because  in  the
long run this department will be seen as a messiah to help us to solve  many
of our problems. It is good to call on other countries to  invest  in  South
Africa to help solve the  problem  of  unemployment,  but  it  is  not  good
enough. In the long run we must depend on our own  resources  to  solve  the
problem of unemployment. This can only be done through new businesses.

Here we are not talking about traditional businesses. We are  talking  about
businesses  at  tertiary  level.  This  department  is  at  the  centre   of
developing brains that will develop  such  businesses  while  the  education
system develops the work force that will access those high technology  jobs.
Our departments must not be  seen  as  watertight  compartments  which  have
nothing to do with each other or one  another.  There  is  interrelationship
amongst them. This is why this department, although it is now a  stand-alone
department, is connected like an embryo to the mother through  an  umbilical
cord, particularly to the Department  of  Education.  It  is  therefore  our
belief that science and technology must grip the minds of our  young  people
while they are still at school.
The school curricula cannot be complete if they do not include  science  and
technology. In this regard, I am always fascinated by the  Japanese  example
- and I have said this before in this House. In the 1960s, any product  that
came from Japan was said  to  be  like  Japan  itself  because  of  the  low
quality. However, since they went out to invest in science  and  technology,
their products rank amongst the best in the world today. As it is now,  they
even see raw materials in what other countries refer to as finished goods.

I have one good example here. In the 70s and  80s  Russia  used  to  produce
very big, thick steel trucks. The Japanese bought lots  and  lots  of  these
trucks, but the Russians did not see the trucks in the streets of Japan  and
they were wondering what the Japanese were doing with the  trucks.  At  last
they discovered that on arrival of these trucks, the Japanese took  off  the
wheels and threw them into the furnaces because they saw  the  raw  material
in the product of another country. We  are  saying,  therefore,  that  South
Africa must  strive  to  emulate  Japan  in  terms  of  production  of  high
technology products, and this can only be achieved if we put more  money  in
the department. We have heard the Minister indicating in no uncertain  terms
that the budget that the department has, does  not  address  their  problems
and they will not be in the position to address all that they  want  to  do.
It means something must be done. Of course, the President, in his  state  of
the nation address, alluded to this that more money  will  be  allocated  to
this department, and we appreciate that.

The Department of Arts and Culture is also a relatively  new  department  in
our country; new in the sense that it became  a  stand-alone  department  in
the year 2000. It is a department at  the  centre  of  preservation  of  our
history and nation building. A nation that does  not  know  where  it  comes
from will always be rudderless and it will not know  where  to  go.  We  are
therefore pleased to learn that the department will  do  everything  in  its
power to see  to  it  that  our  indigenous  languages  will,  in  fact,  be
developed and promoted.  We  are  heartened  to  hear  that  our  Government
departments will not be mistaken for some government  departments  somewhere
in Europe, because they will not be using only English as  a  language.  Our
people who are our clients will now  be  able  to  communicate  and  express
themselves freely using their own mother tongues in this department.

Many place names in our country still have colonial  names.  We  still  have
place names like Kafferkraal, Hotnotfontein and  many  others.  These  names
are an insult to us and  to  our  democracy.  We  therefore  call  upon  the
department, and the provinces in particular, to fast-track  the  process  of
changing place names in our country. I was pleased to  hear  the  other  day
that the name of the capital of my province is  going  to  be  changed  from
Nelspruit to something else. I just hope that the name that they  will  give
to the capital will unite the people of our province.

The economic potential of crafts, music, film and publishing cannot be  over
emphasised. We are pleased to see that our department is  hard  at  work  to
promote these through public and private  partnership  with  the  market  to
enhance these industries. We will all agree that these play a very big  role
in spiritual fulfilment and in addressing the big problem of poverty in  our
country. The establishment of the Freedom Park is one of the  milestones  of
this department for preservation of our history. It will go a  long  way  in
attracting both local and foreign tourists who  are  interested  in  knowing
the history of our country.

During the wars of liberation, some our finest sons and  daughters  perished
in foreign  fraternal  countries.  Our  dream,  therefore,  is  to  see  the
department looking at possibilities of repatriating their immortal  remains,
so that their next of kin and the people in general can go to  their  graves
to draw inspiration and recharge. If this  dream  proves  to  be  a  mission
impossible, let us erect a monument with their names  inscribed  on  it  for
posterity. We support both Budget Votes.

Ms N JAJULA (Eastern Cape): Hon Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers,  MECs,  hon  members,  I  will  attempt  to   craft   my   policy
presentation by first identifying the vision of the department, which is  an
Eastern Cape devoid of inequalities of the past, unified through  integrated
and sustainable economic, social and cultural  development;  thus  providing
an acceptable quality of life for  all  its  people  in  the  context  of  a
united, nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa.

The key strategic goals  encapsulate  the  following:  to  mobilise  artists
through awareness and development programmes; to conserve  and  promote  the
culture  and  history  of  the  province;  to  promote  multilingualism  and
increase  literacy;  to  facilitate  access  to  and  the  dissemination  of
information; to promote economic opportunities through the  optimal  use  of
natural resources and job creation; and to  facilitate  the  development  of
infrastructure  for  the  effective  implementation  of  arts  and   culture
programmes. All this is to take place in partnership with local  government,
municipalities,  the  private  sector,  Government  departments  and   other
countries.

The province is focusing mostly on the facilities that include the  theatres
for promoting the performance of excellence, especially in the  rural  towns
and areas which constitute 70% of the total land of the  province.  This  is
mostly within the former Transkei and Ciskei.

There is no constructive engagement with  the  Department  of  Education  so
far, but we are forging ahead with a partnership  with  arts  education  and
libraries, which is coming forth in a strong manner.

There is a limited cultural affairs budget of R41,4 million,  of  which  70%
goes to personnel and 10% to service delivery. To us it is a challenge.  The
budget for sports, arts and culture needs to  be  reviewed.  We  are  hoping
that the Minister will assist us  with  a  conditional  grant  in  the  near
future.

Through prioritisation and a focus on the key strategic areas for the  2004-
05 financial year,  we  are  considering  dealing  with  the  following:  to
actually pass the Bill  which  emphasises  the  translation,  promotion  and
development  of  five  provincial  languages,  namely   isiXhosa,   Sesotho,
Afrikaans, English and  isiZulu.  Training  will  be  offered  to  community
members in sign language, and we will train 120  community  members  and  50
officials in one of the languages  of  disabled  people.  In  terms  of  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, we are focusing on the next 100  days.  The
Mount Fletcher Library costs R860 000, and the  Peddie  Arts  Centre,  which
will take off next week Monday, is going to cost us R400 000.

The department will monitor learnership bursaries in relation  to  arts  and
academic  qualifications.  We  are  contributing  R595   000   towards   the
learnership programme this financial year.

The National Arts Festival, which is  a  provincial  and  national  flagship
project, will promote business to local communities in  the  township  where
800 beds in 120 houses will be available for tourists and guests - and,  hon
members, you are all invited. The festival is in Grahamstown and  starts  on
1 July. The department is behind the jobs that will be  created,  and  these
will contribute to the economy of Grahamstown an amount  of  R1  million  by
the end of the festival.

We are focusing on the provincial Film  and  Video  Foundation,  which  will
receive R750 000. There is promotion of minority cultures by developing  the
Coega tourism route where Sarah Baartman will be featuring as  an  icon  for
women-empowerment programmes. The promotion of the O R Tambo  tourist  route
is intended for the preservation and conservation  of  communities,  people,
and the culture and history of those areas. We  will  be  handing  over  the
Port St Johns Museum to the community within the next few months. This  will
empower the people of Port St Johns to be proud of their  artwork  which  is
in that area. The Mbashe and Bedford Amathole Heritage route will  be  taken
on board within this financial year.

An amount of R6,4 million has  been  budgeted  for  library  material  which
focuses on promoting indigenous languages in the province. By  the  way,  we
have started recording these on video and other  material  from  the  people
who cannot write or read so that we translate that into print  and  booklets
for our children in order to learn about the  history  and  stories  of  our
ancestors.

The film and video industry, the crafts industry,  the  music  industry  and
the publishing industry will take off this financial year. There  is  surely
no  doubt  that  the  department  will  ensure  that  the  central  cultural
industries flourish in the province.

We will ensure that all the provincial development programmes  are  in  line
with the plans of the province, and we are going to ensure  that  the  Moral
Regeneration  Movement  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  Arts   and   Culture
department, so as to ensure the resuscitation of  the  moral  fibre  of  our
society.

Moral regeneration will ensure that we promote awareness  of  the  following
diseases that are engulfing our society. We are going to ensure  that  there
is no child rape, women abuse, criminal  attacks,  liqour  abuse,  substance
abuse and that the scourge of  HIV/Aids  is  tackled  within  this  cultural
aspect. We take that as a power of moral regeneration.

We believe that we will bring about the systematic  eradication  of  poverty
and the development and manufacture of tourism with the infrastructure  that
has been spelt out above. Our communities will be able to get some jobs  and
sustain the economy of the province. We will be ensuring that  our  heritage
will be sustainable, that our society will be worth living in and  that  the
province will always be worth visiting. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms T MADIKANE (Northern Cape): Hon Deputy Chair, hon Ministers,  hon  Deputy
Ministers, hon MECs,  hon  members  and  distinguished  guests,  I  am  very
honoured and humbled today to  be  speaking  in  this  House.  I  will  chat
briefly about what the Northern Cape is doing and intends to implement.

Firstly, in the Northern Cape we have established  a  conservatoire  theatre
that will produce six quality dramas this year, using local actors who  went
through the departmental artistic  development  programme.  From  these  six
productions, the one about the  1952  Mayibuye  uprising  in  Galeshewe  has
already been performed. There is another production called, ``You  strike  a
woman, you strike a rock''. That production  is  in  the  process  of  being
rehearsed. The symbolic importance of these productions will  be  to  relive
our history and past experiences, and also to teach our youth the role  that
our province has played in the liberation struggle.

Many of our unemployed people are prepared to tackle  poverty  right  on  by
using their God-given talents. The department will continue this  year  with
the craft development  programme,  and  for  this  financial  year  we  will
construct and complete the Upington Craft  Centre.  The  main  partners  for
this project are the Upington Rotary  Club,  Xa-Rise  municipality  and  our
national Department of Arts and Culture. The centre will specialise  in  the
production of papier-mâché, quilting, sewing and embroidery, mosaic art  and
wooden products. A comprehensive  choral  music  development  programme  has
been developed to increase the standard of choral  music  in  the  province.
This programme will include capacity building for  conductors  and  training
on the composition of choral  pieces.  We  have  established  an  orchestral
development programme with the Kimberley Music Academy.

We are also accelerating the  programme  to  develop  and  promote  all  the
languages  of  our  country,  particularly  the   previously   disadvantaged
languages. To this end, the language unit in  the  department  will  conduct
research into African proverbs, folklore and  songs  in  Setswana,  IsiXhosa
and Nama, which would lead to a provincial publication. This  year  we  will
also see the continuation of a  very  successful  multilingualism  campaign.
High on our agenda this year is to get the  draft  language  policy  through
the legislative process in preparation  for  the  promulgation  of  our  own
provincial language policy. Through the heritage collection and the  African
writer's series,  library  services  have  ensured  that  previously  banned
materials are now available to  the  communities  throughout  the  province.
This year library services will  launch  the  political  history  collection
which will include books written by prominent  and  most  acclaimed  writers
and leaders of our continent. Some of the names amongst the collection  will
include names such as Solomon T Plaatje, Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko,  Nadine
Gordimer and Bessie Head. In other words, books that were previously  banned
can now be seen on our library shelves, allowing communities to have  access
to their heritage, as well as to foster respect  and  understanding  of  the
political and social history of our continent.

There is also another book that has been published called Enter  the  light.
This book  reflects  the  commitment  towards  preserving  the  culture  and
heritage of the indigenous Khomani San people  of  the  Northern  Cape.  The
publication of this book comes at an opportune time in the  history  of  our
country, shortly after the celebration of 10 years of  democracy.  It  is  a
reflection of how far we have progressed over  this  period,  in  broadening
our understanding of what we value in terms of human knowledge and  culture,
knowledge of the culture that now enters the light, in the same way  as  the
Khomani as an identifiable people have once again entered the light  in  the
10 past years. I just want to mention that this group of people are more  or
less on the verge of being extinct and we actually  have  less  than  20  of
them that are living today. So it is important that we capture  this  whilst
we still have the time. This book is intended to  be  used  in  schools  and
libraries throughout the Northern Cape, but also elsewhere, and it is  hoped
to be the beginning of a publication of a vast knowledge on the  Khomani  as
gathered by the communities over the past several years.

Over the next five years, library services will tend to take the process  of
access  to  information  services  further  by  expanding  on  the  Internet
services. This has already been implemented in 80 libraries, thus  upholding
one of the most important  principles  of  democracy,  that  is,  access  to
information.  Through  breaking  the  digital  divide  that  exists  in  our
libraries, the provincial library service will build on the  knowledge  base
that exists in our communities, by bringing information  to  the  fingertips
of its users. Improving the capacity of our community,  library  staff  will
go hand in hand with the ICT expansion, ensuring the sustainability  of  the
ICT service.

Archival records help us to understand who we are and where  we  come  from.
They give us information about the past, our  past,  and  thus  help  us  to
grasp our present. This information is as  important  to  a  nation  as  the
individual memory is to each and every person. Some of this information  may
make us proud of our past achievements and some will not, but  strengths  of
our past, great moments, times of conflict, decisions of  wisdom  and  areas
of judgment are woven together in a tapestry that is uniquely  ours.  It  is
this public record of past events that makes  us  distinct  from  all  other
nations, and something that all South Africans can share.  The  archives  of
the Northern Cape similarly distinguish us, the citizens of  this  province,
from people of other provinces, yet at  the  same  time  contribute  to  the
tapestry that makes us all part of  the  great  South  African  nation.  Our
biggest challenge in this  regard  is  the  establishment  of  a  provincial
archive repository, which is a Constitutional obligation. This  will  enable
us to claim and bring back what rightfully belongs  to  the  Northern  Cape.
This is the biggest challenge we have to face at this level  now,  but  then
the establishment of the archive repository  will  become  a  major  tourist
attraction for the Northern Cape. Historians and novelists will do  research
in the repository and market it abroad.

On International Museum Day, 18 May,  an  exhibition  to  celebrate  the  10
years of democracy was opened. This educational display can still be  viewed
at the McGregor Museum. It highlights  the  dramatic  process  laid  by  our
young democracy. It places the past decade into its historical  context  and
should be viewed as an educational tool by educators and learners. A  world-
class exhibition of the photographer Alfred  Martin  Duggan-Cronin  will  be
opened at the Duggan-Cronin Gallery on 15 July 2004.  This  exhibition  will
also form part of our 10 years of democracy  celebration,  and  will  be  on
display,  first  provincially  and  then  nationally.  The  restoration  and
digitisation of the Duggan- Cronin  photographic  collection  will  commence
this year. This conversation project of a million rand,  together  with  the
unique storage facility at the McGregor Museum,  places  our  province  well
ahead of other provinces.

Running concurrently with the Duggan-Cronin exhibition will be the De  Beers
Consolidate mines photographic exhibition of the work of  children  born  in
1994. This year we  will  also  see  the  commencement  of  a  R1,5  million
restoration project of  the  Duggan-Cronin  gallery  since  it  is  actually
falling apart. The gallery, once restored, will permanently  house  what  is
regarded as the world's top  10  photographic  collections.  Once  finished,
this will be world-class gallery that will also be made available to  local,
national and international photographers to showcase their talent, and  also
to promote photography as an art form. In this gallery, we have the  nucleus
- actually more than the nucleus - of a national repository of  ethnographic
photographs. We will be able then to exhibit and store safely  our  numerous
photographic collections.

We will also continue with our research into a tragic and sensitive part  of
our history and that will focus on the remains that have been excavated.  We
are also in the process of applying to make sure that  some  heritage  sites
are actually declared as such. So, there is quite lot of work  that  we  are
busy with. In conjunction with the Freedom Park, and the  whole  idea  of  a
Freedom  Park  in  the  Northern  Cape,  we  intend  to  have  a  garden  of
remembrance, as well as  a  provincial  monument  in  honour  of  heroes  or
heroines who selflessly laid  down  their  lives  and  contributed  to  this
democracy that we are celebrating today. The unveiling of  the  monument  is
earmarked for 16 June 2006. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms D ROBINSON: Hon Chair, hon Ministers and hon members,  I  would  like  to
congratulate the Minister of Arts and Culture on his appointment to  office.
I sincerely hope that his appointment will  mark  a  turning  point  in  our
cultural development, since arts  and  culture  have  always  tended  to  be
neglected in favour of sport.

Let me assure you that I am by no means hostile to the promotion  of  sport,
and my colleagues in the House will attest to that. I was  making  a  strong
case for sport in schools yesterday. It certainly has great value,  but  the
promotion of the arts has been sadly neglected within  our  society,  and  I
look forward to a renaissance of artistic and  cultural  endeavours  in  the
next decade.

Properly managed, the Ministry  of  Arts  and  Culture  can  be  a  powerful
instrument in reconciliation and healing - an asset to our national  psyche.
It is precisely the diversity of cultural backgrounds and  the  heritage  of
our many indigenous and immigrant communities that make South Africa one  of
the most exciting and richest nations on earth.

The specific  traditions  and  customs,  literature,  art,  performance  and
creative skills of each community are what make us unique and  proud  to  be
South Africans. Each of these traditions should be promoted to form  one  of
the rich threads of the great South African tapestry.

We have world-class singers being trained in our  Opera  School,  especially
founded by Angelo Gobbato to develop indigenous talent. Attend one of  these
concerts at the Artscape Theatre, hear their powerful voices  and  you  will
know why they are in such demand. I happen to know that the Opera School  is
largely funded by private patrons who love music and want to see  opera,  as
an art form, growing. The recent performance of  Fidelio  on  Robben  Island
was an outstanding opportunity for our talent to be showcased, and the spin-
offs of that were invitations to tour other parts of the world.

Overseas visitors are impressed by the energy, vitality and strength of  our
performances,  hence  the  invitations  pouring  in.  Our  local  talent  is
becoming an export commodity, creating more opportunities for our artists.

I believe that the time has come for the  Finance  Ministry  to  become  the
catalyst  in  creating  a  national  culture  of  giving,   of   encouraging
benefactors by offering even modest tax breaks directly to any  citizen  who
wishes to support a cultural enterprise of his or her  choice.  Even  if  an
upper limit of R1000 per taxpayer per annum were to be enacted  there  would
be a significant  degree  of  grassroots  financial  support  for  arts  and
culture, at no great loss to the exchequer. This could even be  extended  by
securing donations  and  sponsorships  for  other  cultural  activities  and
institutions such as museums and art galleries.

I was saddened when I discovered recently that the  Koopman  De  Wet  House,
Bertram House and Bo-Kaap museums are now all closed,  except  for  Mondays,
and then by appointment only. It is unfortunate  that  Iziko  has  not  made
this known to the wider public,  simply  announcing  this  in  the  internal
newsletter. These are all treasures of our past. No nation  can  go  forward
without acknowledging its past - good and bad. The depth of the  roots  will
determine the vigorous growth into the future. Perhaps  sponsorship  can  be
found for them, or perhaps tax relief can be given. Of course,  there  would
be a need for sound financial reporting.

Ek wil graag 'n paar  voorstelle  maak.  Daar  moet  beslis  daaraan  aandag
geskenk word om dit vir voornemende kunstenaars die moeite werd te  maak  om
'n loopbaan in dié rigting in Suid-Afrika te volg. Ek wil voorstel dat  daar
vir elke moontlike geleentheid of fees 'n Suid-Afrikaanse werk -  musiek  of
kuns - geskep word wat deur die Regering geïnisieer word. Daar kan pryse  of
borgskappe  daaraan  verbonde  wees.  Daar   móét   geleenthede   wees   vir
uitvoerende kunstenaars in Suid-Afrika om dit vir hulle aantreklik  te  maak
om hier te bly.

Daar moet baie  meer  beurse  beskikbaar  wees  sodat  jong  Suid-Afrikaners
hulself in die kunsterigting in Suid-Afrika kan bekwaam. Vergelyk  dit  maar
met sportbeurse.

Alle instrumente en bladmusiek moet van die buiteland ingevoer word,  en  is
vir ons Suid-Afrikaners baie duur as gevolg van die wisselkoers. Wat is  die
moontlikheid van belastingverligting op sulke items wat nie  in  Suid-Afrika
vervaardig word nie?

Die  finansiering  vir  ons  professionele  orkeste  is  drasties  gesny  en
daardeur is die moontlikheid van loopbane hier 'n geweldige knou  toegedien.
Trusts kan geskep word om kultuuraktiwiteite te ondersteun. Sulke  skenkings
behoort vrygestel te word van belasting. As ons van hierdie  voorstelle  kan
implementeer, sal ons musieksentrums, soos Hugo Lambrechts en  Beau  Soleil,
miskien kan oorleef. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to make a few suggestions. We should definitely pay  attention
to making it worthwhile for prospective artists to follow a career  in  this
field in South Africa. I want to suggest that for every  possible  event  or
festival, a South African work - music or art -  be  created,  initiated  by
the Government. Prizes or sponsorships can be attached to these. There  must
be  opportunities  for  performing  artists  in  South  Africa  to  make  it
attractive to them to stay here.

Many more bursaries should be available so that  young  South  Africans  can
qualify in the field of  art  in  South  Africa.  Compare  this  with  sport
bursaries.

All instruments and sheet music must be imported from abroad, and  they  are
very expensive for us South Africans as a result of the exchange rate.  What
is the possibility of tax relief on such items that are not manufactured  in
South Africa?

The financing for our professional orchestras has been cut  drastically  and
as a result the possibility of  careers  here  has  been  greatly  lessened.
Trusts can be created to support cultural activities. Such donations  should
be exempt from tax. If we can  implement  some  of  these  suggestions,  our
music centres such as Hugo Lambrechts and  Beau  Soleil  might  be  able  to
survive.]

I'm also thinking of the  Tygerberg  Children's  Choir  which  has  received
accolades and won many prestigious awards overseas. It does not receive  any
state funding and when one considers how accomplished  and  professional  it
is, and what opportunities it offers our young people, one cannot  but  hope
that some form of matching funding will be found to  assist  it.  It  is  an
enormous burden for parents and sponsors to bear alone.

The  Joseph  Stone  Auditorium  in  Athlone  has  been  monumental  in   its
contribution to culture throughout the dark days and in the present, and  we
must pay tribute to each of those artists.

A few years ago the tourism industry  was  a  Cinderella  industry.  It  was
ignored,  patronised,  underfunded  -  every  day  brought  a  struggle  for
recognition for funding, but today tourism  is  recognised  as  one  of  our
leading growth industries.

There's a  growing  recognition  of  the  importance  of  arts  and  culture
throughout the halls of government throughout the  world.  Support  for  the
arts and culture is sound economic  policy.  Internationally,  the  cuts  in
school arts funding have been reversed as it is recognised that through  the
arts students develop cognitive  and  physical  skills.  Arts  and  cultural
activities are also valued as a key  element  in  programmes  to  revitalise
decaying urban areas.

In the nations around the world, the poet Shelley's suggestion that  ``poets
are the unacknowledged legislators of the world'', is  finally  being  taken
seriously. The poet Roy Campbell so aptly described the struggle  that  most
artistic souls have within themselves, and in society, in  his  poem  Horses
on the Camargue. I quote:


  Still out of hardship bred,
  Spirits of power and beauty and delight
  Have ever on such frugal pastures fed
  And loved to course with tempests through the night.

May our contribution be to make the pastures less frugal and to  acknowledge
and support our artists and musicians. Ndiyabulela. [I thank you.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon  Ministers,  MECs,  special  delegates  and
members of the House, I  want  to  congratulate  the  Ministers  and  Deputy
Ministers on their appointments. I know that you will, and  shall,  do  well
in your portfolios.
We in South Africa really ought to be conscious of the moment in history  in
which we are called upon to do what we are doing.

Suid-Afrika het 'n hoë ongeletterdheidsyfer en etlike pogings om  daarop  te
verbeter, word reeds aangepak en juis  daarom  moet  daar  noue  samewerking
plaasvind  tussen  al  die  betrokke  departemente  om  ons  kunstenaars  en
wetenskaplikes van alle gemeenskappe  te  stimuleer  én  te  ondersteun,  en
andersyds, om optimale toegang tot  relevante  inligting  koste-doeltreffend
by elke aspirerende kunstenaar en wetenskaplike te kry. Die  NNP  steun  die
twee  begrotingsposte.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[South Africa has a high illiteracy rate and  several  attempts  to  improve
this have already been tackled, and for that very  reason  there  should  be
close co-operation amongst all the relevant  departments  to  stimulate  and
support our artists and scientists from all  our  communities  and,  on  the
other hand, to grant each aspirant artist and scientist  optimal  access  to
relevant information in a cost-effective manner. The NNP  supports  the  two
Budget Votes. I thank you.]

Mr T S SETONA: Hon Deputy Chairperson  of  Committees,  hon  Ministers,  hon
Deputy Ministers, hon members, fellow comrades, friends and colleagues,  let
me rise to join those who spoke before me  and  congratulate  the  Ministers
and  Deputy  Ministers  on  their  appointment  in  these  new   challenging
positions.

This Budget policy debate on Arts  and  Culture  takes  place  at  the  most
critical time in the history of our country. It is the first debate  in  the
second decade of democracy. It's taking place during  the  month  of  youth,
and three days before the 49th anniversary of the adoption  of  the  Freedom
Charter - our very blueprint for a new society that we seek to built today.

On the basis of the historic significance of the context within  which  this
Budget policy debate is  presented,  it  should  sound  warning  bells  that
remind all of us of who we  are,  where  we  come  from  and  where  we  are
destined to go as a country and as a nation.

Before the advent  of  colonialism  and  the  attendant  introduction  of  a
capitalist mode of production in South Africa, the  African  people  enjoyed
poetry and  music;  they  sculptured  pottery  and  danced  freely,  all  by
themselves and for themselves. For  them  poetry  had  nothing  to  do  with
books, hence, when a young man saw his bull of  choice  among  the  herd  of
cattle he recited  poetry,  which  was  an  artistic  medium  of  expressing
appreciation.

The same applied to music and dance. Although there were professional  poets
and musicians - that is, those recognised as more talented in the  community
- no sharp distinction could be drawn between artists and the  rest  of  the
community,  because  they  were  agents   of   social   cohesion   and   the
dissemination of moral values from one generation to the  other.  There  was
always a participatory relationship between the people and the artists,  who
also knew that they existed in order to serve the people.

The dawn of colonialism and racial  oppression  altered  the  character  and
purpose  of  the  South  African  cultural  and  artistic  expression,  thus
bringing to the fore two cultures in one country. Of course,  while  we  are
attempting to build one culture in this divided  society,  some  amongst  us
continue to speak and preserve the status quo of the dominant  culture.  The
dominant culture of the rich and  the  subdued  culture  of  the  oppressed;
these are the two currents of the  cultural  system  that  we  have  in  our
country today.

The profit motive of capitalist  relations  of  production  has  become  the
primary service point of cultural and artistic expression,  not  the  common
good of our society. As with other commodities in  the  capitalist  economy,
cultural and artistic products  also  pass  through  three  stages,  namely,
production, marketing  and  consumption,  thus  alienating  the  downtrodden
majority of our people in the cultural and artistic development and life  of
our society.

Our people never succumbed to this cultural subjugation and domination.  The
formation of ``Amandla'', the ANC cultural group, was part of  an  organised
response  to  this  subjugation  and  domination.  There   were   not   many
instruments at the time  -  several  pennywhistles,  an  occasional  guitar;
mouth organs and a few drums acquired  locally  were  the  meagre  resources
available to our people. However, they improvised  with  tin  cans,  bottles
filled with water to various levels,  and  just  about  anything  that  they
could grab.

Later,  new  songs  of  liberation  flowed  from  the  camps  of  liberation
movements in exile as more and more young people put  their  minds  together
to compose music. Whenever the ANC  gathered,  which  is  a  tradition  even
today, liberation songs were sung and cultural groups performed  in  concert
poetry, music and dance.

With our history of deep polarisation, hate and prejudice, arts and  culture
can play a critical role in the promotion of  nation-building,  development,
peace and a common identity, which is a  central  and  strategic  goal  that
should obsess all South Africans across class, racial and gender bases.

The transformation of our school curriculum, in particular,  as  it  relates
to the rewriting of our history, is indispensable  in  this  regard.  As  we
celebrate the decade of our democracy, generations to come  must  know  that
in  the  city  of  Mangaung-Bloemfontein,  more  than  90  years  ago,   two
architects of our  fledgling  democracy  were  born;  the  African  National
Congress and the then National Party.

As we see unity and diversity in action today, finding expression in the co-
operation  of  these  two  parties  to  forge  ahead  with   nation-building
projects, generations to come must know that  their  birthplace  is  in  the
heartland of our country, in the city  of  Mangaung.  It  therefore  becomes
incumbent upon the Department of Arts  and  Culture  to  then  preserve  and
promote these important historical sites, including the house where  comrade
Nomzamo Winnie Madikizela-Mandela  resided  during  her  banishment  in  the
early 1980s.

In support of this Vote, we therefore want to, on behalf  of  the  ANC,  say
that the beginning was in 1994, and in this  current  decade  of  democracy,
which is the second decade of democracy, the challenge for all of us  is  to
ensure that the programmes and the activities of the Department of Arts  and
Culture cut across all other departmental programmes. That is the  only  way
in which we can use this important instrument as an instrument  for  nation-
building, a common identity and for reconciliation. I thank you.
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Minister
Pallo Jordan, Minister Mosibudi Mangena, Deputy Minister Derek  Hanekom  and
all MECs present here, hon delegates,  directors-general  and  officials  of
the Department of Arts and Culture, as well as  the  Department  of  Science
and Technology, in  August  2002  the  then  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and  Technology  was  split  into  two  separate  departments.  This
resulted in the establishment of the Department of Arts and Culture, on  the
one hand, and the Department of Science and Technology, on the other.

However, these two departments remained for a while - until early this  year
- under one Ministry. It was only  in  the  third  term  of  our  democratic
Government, on 28 April, that our President, beloved  Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,
announced the establishment of a new Ministry of Arts and  Culture.  As  you
can guess, we are still in the process of setting up our brand new office.

Be that as it may, with the support of our  very  able  team  of  officials,
under the able leadership of our Director-General of Arts and Culture,  Prof
Mosala, as well as the  support  of  parliamentary  committees,  our  social
partners and stakeholders, we have been able to find our feet. Let  me  say,
here and now, that we will rely  heavily  on  the  active  support  of  this
Council, as well as the provincial  legislatures  and  local  government  in
executing our mandate.

At the official opening  of  the  first  session  of  our  third  democratic
Parliament,  our  President,  among   other   commitments,   committed   his
Government to, and I quote:

  ... move our  country  forward  decisively  towards  the  eradication  of
  poverty and underdevelopment in our country, taking care to  enhance  the
  process of social cohesion  and  also  to  achieve  further  and  visible
  advances with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our
  people, affecting many critical  areas  of  social  existence,  including
  health, safety and security, moral regeneration, social cohesion, opening
  the doors of culture and education to all, and sport and recreation.

These are the marching orders and, to achieve this, our Ministry's  and  our
department's mission is to realise the full potential of  arts  and  culture
in social and economic development, nurture creativity and  innovation,  and
promote the diverse heritage of our nation.

Arts and culture permeate all aspects of society and are  an  integral  part
of social and economic life. Arts and  culture  embrace  custom,  tradition,
belief, religion, language and all other forms of  art.  It  can  and  must,
therefore, play a crucial role in nation-building,  reconciliation  and  the
development of a new national identity and ethos which is reflective of  our
new  democracy.  It  also  has  great  potential  to  make   a   significant
contribution to poverty alleviation, job creation and  economic  development
in the context of a people's contract.

Before the advent of democracy in our country, the culture of  the  majority
of our people was neglected, distorted and stifled. Culture was  used  as  a
tool of suppression and discrimination. Our people and our communities  were
denied access to resources and facilities  to  exercise  and  develop  their
creativity  in  cultural  and  artistic  expression.   It   is,   therefore,
imperative for the arts, culture and heritage  sector  to  be  subjected  to
rigorous scrutiny and to be radically transformed.

In 1994, the first democratic  Government  of  National  Unity  adopted  the
ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme  as  a  policy  guideline  to
effect this transformation. The policy  statement,  as  articulated  in  the
White Paper on Arts, Culture  and  Heritage  is,  therefore,  based  on  the
following values, and I quote:


  Access  to,  participation  in  and  enjoyment  of  the  arts,   cultural
  expression and the preservation of one's heritage are basic rights;  they
  are not luxuries, nor are they privileges as we have generally  been  led
  to believe.

The Bill of Rights of our Constitution states that everyone  has  the  right
to freedom of expression, which includes  freedom  of  artistic  creativity;
and everyone has the right to use the language and  to  participate  in  the
cultural life of their choice. It is the role of  Government  to  facilitate
the optimum conditions in which these rights may be enjoyed and practised.

A fundamental prerequisite for democracy is  the  principle  of  freedom  of
expression. Rooted in freedom of expression and creative thought, the  arts,
culture and heritage have a vital  role  to  play  in  development,  nation-
building and sustaining our emerging democracy. They must  be  empowered  to
do so.

Humans are holistic beings. They not only need improved material  conditions
in order to have a better quality of life. Individuals  have  psychological,
emotional, spiritual and  intellectual  expression,  all  of  which  require
nurture and development for them to realise their full  potential,  and  act
as responsible and creative citizens.

Arts and culture play a healing role through promoting  reconciliation.  Our
approach to culture is premised on international standards in which  culture
is understood as an important component of national life which enhances  all
of our freedoms. Culture should not be used as a mechanism of  exclusion,  a
barrier between people, nor should cultural practices be reduced  to  ethnic
or religious chauvinism.

South Africa is now once more part of the international family  of  nations.
We not only  derive  benefits  from  such  acceptance,  but  also  have  the
responsibility to  pursue  and  implement  agreed  and  accepted  norms  and
standards in various sectors of our society, including arts and culture.

In this respect, our  Ministry  and  department  will  encourage  an  active
partnership with provincial and local government spheres,  as  well  as  the
private sector and other social partners, to facilitate  the  implementation
of the programmes which have already been referred to  by  the  Minister  of
Arts and Culture, Pallo Jordan.

I do not intend to repeat what he has already mentioned, save to  say  that,
in implementing these programmes, we must also  ensure  that  women,  youth,
people  with  disabilities  and  senior  citizens   are   central,   without
neglecting the issue of the interdependence of women and  men,  as  well  as
the issue of gender equity.

Another issue of importance is the narrowing of the urban/rural divide.  The
cities and metros have made tremendous progress in promoting  arts,  culture
and  heritage  over  the  past  10  years.  Our  greatest  challenge  is  in
accelerating the implementation of our programmes in  the  rural  areas.  We
will need to attend to this as a matter of priority.

Lastly, the importance of our  participation  in  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development, Nepad, is absolutely crucial if we want  to  make  the
concept of an African renaissance a reality. Our department has developed  a
position paper on arts, culture and heritage, which will be presented  at  a
collaborative workshop with the Nepad steering committee in  September  this
year.

The Ten-Year Review Report on the implementation  of  Government  programmes
noted that there has been an appreciable resurgence of local  self-assertion
in the areas of music, the arts,  literature,  dress  and  -  to  a  limited
extent - film and video. However, despite the progress made,  there  remains
a  counter-tendency  of   creating   poor   imitations   of   more   generic
international styles and expressions.

This budget, although it might be  inadequate,  gives  us  enough  scope  to
begin to implement the  programmes  already  outlined  by  Minister  Jordan.
However, it will require us to manage the available funds in a more  prudent
and efficient manner. At the same time, we will have  to  try  to  strike  a
balance between efficiency and equity.

We would like to pay tribute to our predecessors in the  Ministry  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology:  former  Minister  Ben  Ngubane,  Ministers
Brigitte Mabandla and Buyelwa Sonjica - the latter two were both  previously
Deputy Ministers of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology; as  well  as  the
Minister of Minerals and Energy who was acting Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology for a while after Minister Ngubane had  left  earlier
this year.

We acknowledge and appreciate the sterling  work  done  by  the  former  hon
Ministers, former hon Deputy Ministers and the former  Department  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology. They have laid a solid foundation  for  the
programmes of our department which have  enabled  our  smooth  take-off.  We
also thank them for their continued support.

Thank you also, Minister Jordan, for your guidance and support.  However,  I
would like to make a slight correction  to  what  you  said  earlier.  Since
1994, we have only had two Deputy Ministers of Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology. They are now Ministers Mabandla  and  Sonjica.  Minister  Jordan
and Deputy Minister Botha are the first in the brand-new  Ministry  of  Arts
and Culture. So we have made history.
May we also take this opportunity to congratulate the  new  Chairperson  and
Deputy Chairperson, the presiding officers of this NCOP  and  new  delegates
and members, as well  as  MECs  responsible  for  arts  and  culture  -  and
whatever  else  they  are  responsible  for  -  on  their  election   and/or
appointment.

Unfortunately, the Minister and I have not yet had an  opportunity  to  meet
formally with the MECs, but we look forward to  working  together  and  must
urge that we sustain the work already begun and ensure  that  we  accelerate
implementation of the programmes. By so  doing  we  would  be  assuring  our
people that we are truly committed to a people-centred and  a  people-driven
process of social transformation.

So, as commanded by our beloved President, Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki:  ``Let  us
get down to work in a people's contract to build a better South  Africa  and
a better world''. I thank you. [Applause.]
Mr M J MAFEREKA: Chairperson, hon Ministers, Deputy Ministers, MECs  present
here today, hon members of the NCOP -  permanent  and  special  delegates  -
ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the so-called globalisation,  those  of
us who are in the Third World are challenged to  rise  and  jealously  guard
against the death  of  our  cultural  heritage  and  artistic  creativities.
Surely, the global village does not imply the supremacy  of  other  cultures
which have somehow gained global  hegemony  over  others.  It  is  for  this
reason that I stand up today in this hallowed  House  to  give  wholehearted
support to the hon Minister's Budget Vote, which serves to  further  advance
our cultural heritage which is undoubtedly under siege as a  consequence  of
globalisation.

As a province, we are also firmly rooted in  this  principle  of  developing
our arts and culture, as espoused by the Minister  in  his  Budget  Vote.  A
total amount of  R35,036  million  has  been  made  available  for  cultural
affairs in the Free  State,  which  covers  arts  and  culture,  museum  and
heritage services  and  language  and  translation  services.  I  take  this
opportunity to outline to  this  House  our  programmatic  interventions  in
advancing this principle.

The programme on arts and culture in the Free State has  been  allocated  an
amount of R19,689 million, and covers visual and performing  arts,  as  well
as a  music  academy  and  three  community  art  centres.  The  Free  State
departments of sport, arts,  culture,  science  and  technology  and  social
development formed a partnership to establish  a  grass-weaving  factory  in
Phuthaditjhaba in Qwaqwa. This has been a very successful project,  creating
many jobs and securing a regular income for numerous people  in  the  Qwaqwa
area.

The Craft Development Programme, which is running over a three-year  period,
is mainly funded by  the  national  Department  of  Arts  and  Culture.  The
purpose of this project is to develop the variety and quality of  crafts  in
the Free State, to train crafters to reach their full potential and to  find
market outlets for their  products.  At  present,  a  total  of  12  poverty
alleviation projects in the province are funded by the  national  Department
of Arts and Culture. A total number of  437  people,  mainly  women  and  20
disabled people, are benefiting from these projects directly.

Moreover, the Performing Arts Division provided an amount of R1  million  in
funding in order to stage the Mangaung African  Cultural  Festival,  Macufe,
which focuses on visual and performing  arts  from  the  African  continent.
Macufe plays an  important  role  in  the  marketing  our  province  through
cultural tourism, while focusing on the celebration of the  African  culture
in the true spirit of the African Renaissance.

On the music front, the Free State Musicon  is  a  music  academy  providing
certified  music  tuition  in  all  instruments  of  the  standard  symphony
orchestra and  symphonic  wind  bands,  as  well  as  the  piano,  keyboard,
classical  guitar  and  traditional  percussion  instruments.  In  2003,   a
partnership between the Musicon, Pacofs, the International  Performing  Arts
Trust and the University of the Free State was  established  to  ensure  the
continued existence of the Free State Symphony Orchestra. I notice  that  in
the Department of Arts and Culture's budget, no allocation has been made  to
the Free State Symphony Orchestra. This is a challenge that we will need  to
address, since this orchestra is a training and  development  orchestra  for
musicians in the province.

To further advance the  performance  arts  in  the  province,  the  Mangaung
String Programme was established in 1997 with 18 students.  At  the  moment,
152 children are involved in the  programme  that  has  three  orchestras  -
junior,  intermediate  and   senior.   This   programme   is   targeted   at
disadvantaged children who  are  either  taught  at  their  schools  in  the
township,  or  are  collected  at  their  schools  and  transported  to  the
University of the Free State where  they  receive  music  and  music  theory
tuition. This is another side of the partnership  between  the  Musicon  and
the university to advance the arts in our province.

I want to stress that arts in the  Free  State  continue  to  gain  momentum
everyday thanks to the existence of three  community  arts  centres  in  the
province, based in the  Lejweleputswa  -  Thabong,  Northern  Free  State  -
Zamdela and Motheo - Thaba Nchu - districts. The functions of these  centres
include teaching, development, heritage preservation  and  service  delivery
in respect of drama, dance, music, art, sewing and quilting. Plans for  this
year include securing  partnerships  with  the  local  municipalities  where
these centres are situated, which will lead to better  service  delivery  to
the communities involved.

I have already noted that the need to  preserve  and  advance  our  cultural
heritage, in the face of the threats posed by globalisation on the  cultural
front, is essential. We can  show  our  seriousness  in  defending  what  is
historically ours through specific programmes that  are  funded.  Under  the
auspices of Heritage Promotion, the Museum  and  Heritage  Services  in  the
Free State have been allocated an amount of R14 273 million for the  current
financial year.

The National Museum Division consists of  the  National  Afrikaans  Literary
Museum, the National Sesotho Literary Museum and the  National  Theatre  and
Music Museum. These museums, given their respective  levels  of  operational
development, infrastructure and resources, render  services  of  a  national
scope and importance, promoting heritage awareness and a  fostering  of  our
collective literary, creative and artistic heritage.

Amongst other agencies  for  heritage  promotion,  I  want  to  mention  the
following in brief: The Basotho Cultural Village is a living  museum,  aimed
at promoting and preserving the cultural  heritage  of  the  Basotho  people
through exhibiting their art, architecture, traditions,  crafts,  indigenous
games and performing arts.

In terms of the SA Geographical Names Council Act No 118  of  1998,  a  Free
State Provincial Geographical Names Committee was  established  towards  the
end of last year. Its aim is to change about 5 000 offensive  names  in  the
Free State.

Language and translation services in the Free State have been  allocated  an
amount of R1,074 million - far too little for the  scope  of  work  and  the
importance of this service which is a direct effort in  nation-building  and
a way to work towards a people's contract to build a better life,  a  better
South Africa and a better world. The language unit has been instrumental  in
developing  a  draft  language  policy   in   collaboration   with   various
stakeholders. This draft policy, together with the SA  Languages  Bill,  was
used to produce the Free State Languages Bill, which will be tabled  in  the
Free State Legislature this year. Since Sesotho is the  language  spoken  by
the majority in the Free  State,  this  province  is  at  the  core  of  the
development of this language.  The  creation  of  a  trilingual  terminology
database - English, Sesotho and Afrikaans - is at this stage only  an  idea,
but with the right financial backing it will soon become a reality.

In conclusion, despite these advances, a  number  of  challenges  still  lie
ahead of us. Due to time constraints I will just summarise a  few.  Firstly,
there is a need to investigate the possibility  that  the  function  of  the
National Afrikaans Literary Museum be transferred from us  to  the  national
Department of Arts and Culture. We are going to need about  R8  million  and
we have no funds. Secondly, the need to transform  displays  in  museums  to
become more representative of  all  communities  is  very  urgent.  Thirdly,
outreach programmes and heritage awareness, as well as the  provisioning  of
information and the marketing of museums, are vital.

I have already mooted the idea of the establishment of a  communication  and
marketing  directorate  in  the  department  to  address  this   and   other
communication and marketing gaps. Lastly, funding to  implement  section  23
of the National Heritage Resources Act remains a challenge to us.

I want to take this opportunity  to  further  express  my  support  for  the
Minister's Budget Vote.  It  takes  us  in  the  right  direction  in  these
challenging times. I still have to meet with the Minister, so that  when  we
come here, there would be a bond between the Free  State  and  the  national
department. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,
Deputy  Ministers,  MECs,  hon  members,  let   me   just   start   off   by
congratulating members, many of whom have come back to this House, on  their
election to this House. To the many new members  who  are  sitting  in  this
House today: Congratulations on being here. We look forward to working  with
you.

Minister, you might be relieved that I am not going to contest  the  numbers
of Ministers or Deputy Ministers that preceded  you,  because  you  are  the
first Minister of Science and Technology and I  am  the  very  first  Deputy
Minister of Science and Technology.  [Laughter.]  So  there  is  no  dispute
about that.

In his state of the nation address, the President highlighted  and  stressed
the importance of science and technology. If we are  going  to  achieve  the
objectives that we have set ourselves of economic growth, of  improving  the
living conditions of all our people, the role of science and  technology  is
absolutely imperative; it's vital. We will not achieve our  economic  growth
objectives,  for  example,  if  we  don't   have   substantially   increased
investment in research and development and if  we  don't  have  science  and
technology to back up our endeavours in the various sectors of our  economy.
For example, technologies  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  improved  mining
techniques and investment in improved  communications  infrastructure,  etc,
are all vital to ensuring that we have sustained economic growth.

However, it is not only about that; it's  also  about  the  second  economy,
about the quality of lives of our people and, there  again,  the  work  that
has been done and funded by Science and Technology, for example  in  medical
research, is quite critical to the improvement of the quality  of  lives  of
our people. For example, as we speak there is a lot of work going  into  the
development of an  Aids  vaccine  and  into  many  other  areas  of  medical
research which will ensure the improved health of our people.

We also have technologies to reduce  pollution.  Now,  we  might  see  these
things as unimportant, but actually they  are  linked  to  each  other.  The
health of our people is  fundamentally  affected  by  the  water  that  they
drink; the air that they breathe. And the technologies  designed  to  reduce
emissions from vehicles for example,  to  have  improved  waste  management,
ensure that we live in a  healthier  environment  with  less  pollution  and
therefore we are less prone to disease, for example. Science and  Technology
therefore  cuts  across  many  sectors   and   affects   our   lives   quite
fundamentally.

The Minister said that I would expand on the work of the department  and  on
some of the many things that he has said. I will try to do  so.  I  have  to
say to you, Chairperson, that what  I  am  presenting  to  you  today  is  a
slightly cut and paste job, because much of what I  was  going  to  say  has
already been said and I don't want to burden  this  House  with  repetition.
So, don't get the people from Hansard to ask me for a copy of my  speech  at
the end of this. It will be confusing.

I should just say something about the  Minister  which  might  interest  the
House. Some years ago he spent some time in jail.  Not  long  after  he  was
released, I spent some time in jail. When I was in jail,  I  came  across  a
person by the name of Rob Adam  who  is  now  the  Director-General  of  the
Department of Science  and  Technology.  So,  be  warned,  this  is  not  an
academic department; it's headed by three former jailbirds. [Laughter.]

In elaborating on some of the points made by  the  Minister,  I'm  going  to
start off with an area which he hasn't really covered, and that is the  area
of astronomy. Astronomy is about the planets, the stars  and  the  moons  in
our skies. The President mentioned in his state of the nation  address  that
we are developing Southern Africa as a global hub  for  astronomy.  This  is
part of a broader strategy to develop critical areas in which  South  Africa
has a global niche advantage and can  provide  a  service  in  research  and
development at a more competitive rate than is available elsewhere.
Astronomy is one of the obvious examples here, with a huge effort  currently
underway  to  position  the  subcontinent  in  all  the  relevant  areas  of
astronomy - what they call  the  electromagnetic  spectrum,  from  radio  to
optical to gamma rays. Now, probably  none  of  us  really  understand  what
these things are. Don't worry; they are about studying  the  stars  and  the
planets more effectively.

The best optical and gamma-ray observatories of their kind have  been  built
in Sutherland in  the  Northern  Cape  and  in  the  Gamsberg,  in  Namibia,
respectively, largely with international funds,  but  with  very  favourable
terms for South Africa or to African astronomers. We have now put in  a  bid
to build a telescope, and I must say  that  once  again  this  involves  the
Northern Cape. Let me not be accused of favouritism simply because it is  my
constituency province.  These  things  happened  before  I  was  given  this
responsibility, so I take no credit or blame.

What we call "the mother of all telescopes" is to be built in  the  Northern
Cape. It is called the Square Kilometre Array.  This  will  be  the  biggest
telescope of  its  kind  in  the  world  and  possibly  the  most  ambitious
scientific instrument ever built. This involves approximately  US$1  billion
in investment, so it has huge significance for our  country.  I  would  say,
for fear of treading on the toes of  those  who  are  promoting  the  sports
sector, that this bid is as important, if not more so, than the  soccer  bid
that we recently won.

The question is often asked why the international  scientific  community  is
prepared to spend so much on these instruments, these telescopes. Well,  the
simple answer is that human progress has always been driven  by  our  desire
to know more - from the earliest days of our ancestors seeking  explanations
to the wonders  that  surrounded  them.  The  signals  picked  up  by  these
instruments can be described as faint whispers from the early years  of  the
universe, billions of years ago. When  we  pick  up  these  signals,  it  is
almost like a trip backwards in time. We're picking  up  signals  that  came
billions of years ago, and this gives us some answers to the origins of  our
universe. In fact, even more tantalisingly, this starts  giving  us  answers
to the destiny of our universe.

In one of our more applied areas, the Medical Research Council has just  won
a bid  to  host  the  European  and  Developing  Countries  Clinical  Trials
Partnership  Programme.  This  is  a  700-million  Euro  programme,  and   a
significant proportion of these  funds  is  now  likely  to  flow  into  our
medical research programmes. This will give a  huge  boost  to  our  medical
research capacity and will assist in the development  of  treatments  for  a
range of infectious  diseases,  like  tuberculosis,  malaria  and  HIV/Aids.
There will be positive spin-offs for our research institutions in  that  the
R&D associated with the programme will be carried out by them.

The key in these very large global ventures is to know  your  own  strengths
and how  to  match  them  with  the  world's  needs.  These  needs  and  the
associated opportunities clearly extend right across the  research  spectrum
- from pure basic research in astronomy to experimental development  in  the
health programme.

Minister Mangena spoke about the DST poverty alleviation programmes, so  I'm
not going to repeat what he said, except perhaps to also emphasise that  the
key role that the Department of Science and Technology will be  expected  to
play, and where there will be a shift in future, will be  to  add  value  to
the work of other departments essentially, and other projects.  This  is  so
that the projects run by various departments achieve better results  through
the application of the best of technology and innovation. So, while  we  are
running and funding very important programmes or  projects  at  the  moment,
these will continue,  but  there  might  be  a  shift  in  emphasis  towards
supporting projects that are initiated and run by other departments.

A great  deal  of  the  work  done  by  researchers  and  scientists  is  in
laboratories and out of the public eye. It is often painstakingly  slow  and
the benefits to society are not always that immediately  apparent,  but  hon
members should be assured that the science councils that are funded  through
the budget of the DST are driven by  the  same  agenda  that  drives  us  as
members of Parliament, and that is to  ensure  a  real  improvement  in  the
quality of the lives of our people in a sustainable way.

One of the challenges already mentioned by the Minister facing our  national
system is the attraction of  young  researchers,  particularly  young  black
people, to sustainable  careers  in  science,  engineering  and  technology.
Amongst the set of interventions that the department has  embarked  upon  to
address this issue is the launch of the Centres of Excellence  Programme  in
partnership with the National Research  Foundation  later  this  month.  The
Centres of Excellence that will be funded in this first round are  aimed  at
focusing strongly  on  excellence  in  human  resource  development  at  the
cutting edge of global science.

These centres will also play a role in popularising science in South  Africa
and across the African continent. Our focus on  human  resource  development
is rooted in the dual need to radically increase the  number  of  women  and
young black people entering and remaining in the sciences and, at  the  same
time, to maximise the achievement of excellence. It is no accident that  the
R446 million that is transferred to the National Research Foundation,  South
Africa's  premier  agency  for  human  resource  development   in   science,
engineering and technology, now constitutes the single largest item  on  our
budget.

The Minister has spoken about technology transfer. I suppose we should  just
highlight the fact that even with the best technology in the  world,  unless
it is effectively made available to the users of such technologies,  to  the
many  people  engaged  in  our  economy,  and  unless  such  technology   is
effectively  transferred,  it  won't  really  have  the  benefits  that  are
intended.

Finally, let me speak a little bit  about  the  department's  organisational
structures and the budget. We put an effective department in place.  In  the
past financial year,  2003-04,  the  department  spent  over  99,8%  of  its
budget. So, it is quite clear that the department does have the capacity  to
absorb new resources and to direct them towards our goals, and that the  DST
has competent financial management.

Essentially, the department has agreements with many other  departments.  It
has seen the CSIR, for example, being transferred from the DTI to  the  DST.
More recently, there has also been the transfer of the  science  portion  of
the SA National Antarctic Programme from  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism  to  the  Department  of  Science  of  Technology.  This
programme helps us in monitoring climate change  in  South  Africa  and  the
world  with  appropriate  early-warning  systems.   This   is   particularly
relevant, given our experience of periodic  floods  and  droughts,  and  the
devastating social and economic impact  of  these  events.  This  makes  our
membership of the Group on Earth Observations more relevant  and  beneficial
to our country, our region, our continent and the entire world.

The  Minister  also  mentioned  something  concerning  indigenous  knowledge
systems. Once more, something that the Northern Cape can  take  note  of  is
the hoodia plant, also in the Kalahari, which has  long  been  used  by  the
same Khomani San communities referred to by the MEC. Their  traditional  way
of life included days of not necessarily having access to food, hunting  and
gathering, and this particular plant acted as an  appetite  suppressant  and
enabled them to spend those days on their own economic activities.  Many  of
us in this room today are quite keen on reducing a bit of  our  weight,  and
this knowledge that was held by the Khomani San is  going  to  be  of  great
value to some members of this House, but I  don't  want  to  mention  names.
[Laughter.]

The point is that so much knowledge is held by the indigenous people of  our
country, knowledge that is not valued, knowledge about  which  not  much  is
known. This endeavour in promoting indigenous knowledge is therefore a  very
important aspect of the work of the Department of  Science  and  Technology,
again in collaboration with other departments. I think I have  said  enough.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr F VAN HEERDEN: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. It is for  me  a  particular
privilege to congratulate the Minister of Arts and Culture,  Dr  Jordan,  on
his appointment. I remember many years ago, Madam Chair, that  is  prior  to
1994, that we were engaged in a television debate.

Ons is baie bly dat  die  agb  Minister  hierdie  portefeulje  behartig.  As
historikus  glo  ons  hy  is  die  regte  persoon  om   hierdie   spesifieke
portefeulje met sukses te behartig.

Agb Voorsitter, die Vryheidsfront Plus het met  tevredenheid  kennis  geneem
van die debat van die agb Minister en steun die aspekte wat hy geopper  het.
Ons  as  Vryheidsfront  Plus  is   natuurlik   hoofsaaklik   Afrikaanstalig-
georiënteerd en daaroor sal ek ook die res van my kort bydrae  in  Afrikaans
lewer. Ons  neem  ook  positief  kennis  daarvan  dat  ook  die  ander  tale
mettertyd en geleidelik, nie alleen in die Parlement nie, maar  ook  in  die
land gelyk beregtig sal word.

Ons handhaaf die veeltaligheid van hierdie  land  en  is  dankbaar  vir  die
duidelike suggesties van die kant van die Ministerie met betrekking tot  ook
die ander tale, benewens Engels en Afrikaans.

En as ek net kan verwys na die Vrystaat waar ek vandaan kom, waar  die  drie
hooftale Afrikaans, Sotho en Engels is.  Baie  Engels  word  gepraat  terwyl
Engels een van die minder gebesigde tale in  die  Vrystaatse  provinsie  is.
Afrikaans en Sotho en Xhosa is die tale  wat  meer  gebesig  word.  Wat  die
Vrystaat betref, kan ek getuig  dat  die  Vrystaat  inderdaad  veeltaligheid
handhaaf.  Ons  steun  die  debat.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[We are very glad that the hon Minister is handling this  portfolio.  As  he
is a historian, we are convinced that he is the right person to manage  this
specific portfolio successfully.

Hon Chairperson, the Freedom Front Plus took note with satisfaction  of  the
debate of the hon Minister and supports the aspects which he raised.  We  as
the Freedom Front Plus is of course mainly Afrikaans-oriented and  therefore
I will be delivering the rest of my  short  contribution  in  Afrikaans.  We
also take positive note of the fact that the other languages  will  also  in
time and gradually, be treated equally, not only in Parliament, but also  in
the rest of the country, as well.

We uphold the multilingualism of this  country  and  are  grateful  for  the
clear suggestions from the Ministry's side with regard  to  other  languages
also, in addition to English and Afrikaans.

And if I may just refer to the Free State, where  I  come  from,  where  the
three main languages are Afrikaans, Sotho and English. A lot of  English  is
spoken while English is one of the less used languages  in  the  Free  State
province. Afrikaans  and  Sotho  and  Xhosa  are  the  languages  used  more
frequently. As far as the Free State is concerned, I  can  attest  that  the
Free State upholds multilingualism indeed. We support the debate.]
Mr N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Ngiyabonga kakhulu  Mphathisihlalo.  [Thank  you
very much, Chairperson.]

I see you've given me an additional first name. My initial is N  Singh,  but
my wife is M. I think she has some influence here in this House.  I  noticed
the other day when I spoke in the Tourism debate as well, that my  name  was
indicated as M N Singh, but I thought it was an error. I think she's made  a
few telephone calls here.

Let me start off by congratulating the hon  Minister,  Minister  Jordan,  on
his appointment, and also the  hon  Deputy  Minister  Botha.  I've  had  the
pleasure of working with Minister Jordan in the past when  he  was  Minister
for Environmental Affairs and Tourism. At this  initial  stage,  I  want  to
thank him most heartily for visiting KwaZulu-Natal on Friday  last  week  to
assess the progress of a legacy project which will  ensure  that  the  Chief
Albert  Luthuli  Museum,  the  church,  and  all   allied   facilities   and
infrastructure in his house are officially opened in a few weeks' time.

I also wish to take this opportunity to  congratulate  Minister  Mangena  on
his appointment - I also worked with him when  he  was  Deputy  Minister  of
Education - as well as my colleague, Derek Hanekom. We  worked  together  in
agriculture when he was Minister for Agriculture.

Chairperson, in the eight minutes allocated to me, I'm sure  I'm  not  going
to have enough time to go into detail on some of the  issues  that  the  hon
Minister dealt with, but I think I  will  flag  some  of  them  for  further
debate and discussion by this House.

I want to agree with my colleague Jajula from the  Eastern  Cape  who  spoke
about moral regeneration.  I  think,  Chairperson  and  hon  Minister,  it's
extremely important that we moot a moral, spiritual and cultural  revolution
in our country, and we can do this through arts, both performing and  visual
arts. We can do this by promoting and supporting cultural diversity  in  our
province and our country, and we  can  also  provide  support  to  spiritual
organisations, because through them  and  through  other  partners,  we  can
ensure that our youth learn about alcohol and substance abuse,  learn  about
what HIV and Aids is all about, and I think  through  arts  and  culture  we
have this opportunity.

Chairperson, today's debate is a Budget Vote debate and,  therefore,  before
you count me out for time, I think let me speak about  the  budget  and  the
amounts that are allocated to Department of Arts and Culture.  Let  me  also
add that I'm heading a new  department  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  which  is  arts,
culture and tourism, unlike  the  other  departments,  which  are  generally
arts, culture, science and technology, and sports  and  recreation.  In  the
past five or six weeks since my appointment, I found that there is  quite  a
nexus between arts, culture and tourism. When we promote people and  develop
them, we ensure that we have different kinds of art forms  in  our  province
and our country. When we discover heritage sites  we  go  back  in  history,
like we did on Sunday past, when the hon Deputy President, His  Majesty  the
King, the Chairman of the House of Traditional Leaders and our  hon  Premier
met at Kwaceza where on this day, that is  22  June  1888,  Prince  Dinizulu
prayed for God's wisdom to end civil wars among the Zulus.  It  was  a  very
interesting day that we had, and we have decided as a province, through  the
injunction of our Premier, to build a museum on  that  site  and  to  ensure
that the roads are improved. We can also turn  this  heritage  site  into  a
tourist destination, so I'm very pleased about the nexus.

Having said that, Chairperson, I wholeheartedly support the hon Minister  in
his quest to persuade Cabinet and Treasury to  provide  more  funds  to  his
department, and I think this House also needs to  support  him.  I  do  know
that in provinces, generally, there is a focus on the  social  sector,  that
is education, health and welfare, and while arts and  culture,  science  and
technology, you know, are the Cinderellas.  However,  I  think  we  need  to
support the hon Minister, so that there can be reciprocal support for us  in
our provinces to persuade our own treasuries and our Premiers  to  put  more
money towards arts and culture.

At this stage, Mr Minister, I would also like to thank  the  department  for
the kind of  funding  that  they  are  able  to  source  from  international
partners. Last week I saw that there was  some  fund  from  Sweden.  There's
also a partnership with the Flemish government.  We  in  KwaZulu-Natal  have
MOUs with the Flemish Government, with Baden  Guttenberg  in  Germany,  with
Reunion Islands and with the region of Walonia  in  Belgium,  and  I'm  sure
with the  help  of  your  department,  we  in  KwaZulu-Natal  could  exploit
opportunities and make sure  that  these  MOUs  are  not  just  fancy  words
written on paper, but something tangible that we can see and witness.

Chair, I would also like to talk about the National Arts Council, because  I
do know that a number of people involved in  the  arts  sector  do  complain
about the kind of funding that we provide  to  them.  Whilst  they  have  to
realise that the funding we provide  is  within  the  financial  constraints
that we are all exposed to, I think we've  got  to  ensure  that  for  every
Rand, we get R2 worth. I would like the hon Minister and the  department  to
ensure that the funding to the National Arts Council is done in such  a  way
that we as a Council here can be proud of the fact that we have  a  National
Arts Council that's running its affairs in a very effective manner.

Having said that, Chairperson and hon Minister, we do know that with one  of
our organisations in KwaZulu-Natal,  called  the  Playhouse  Group,  we  are
having some problems. There is evidence of alleged maladministration and  we
hope that between your department and our department, which also  funds  the
Playhouse to the tune of R5 million per annum, we could get  to  the  bottom
of this and ensure that there are better control mechanisms.

I'm not as yet responsible for libraries, archives and museums,  but  that's
a domestic matter and I'm sure that our Premier will sort that  out  in  due
course.

However, another issue that I think we need to tackle, hon Minister, is  the
question of the constitutional impasse when it  comes  to  the  function  of
libraries. At the moment there is a grey area.  It  is  not  a  function  of
local authorities; it's our function, but we don't have the kind of  funding
to be able to sustain all these libraries, so  I  think  that  is  something
that we need to look at.

On the question of languages, hon Minister, we always talk  about  promoting
indigenous languages, which is something that we wholeheartedly  support.  I
think KwaZulu supports it and everybody else supports  it.  However,  a  few
months ago a startling reality came to my attention when I visited  an  area
called Greytown, where three children were killed when they were  travelling
in a bakkie. Nineteen of them were in a  bakkie  and  they  were  travelling
from the school back to their homes. I met the  parents  of  these  children
and I discovered that there were at least four or five  schools  in  between
the 50 kilometre single journey that these children take every day.  I  then
asked: Why do you send your children at great risk, financial risk as  well,
to a school in Greytown? They said: ``Well, we want to send our children  to
an English-medium school, otherwise when it  comes  to  getting  jobs,  they
cannot get jobs.'' So, hon Minister, while  we  look  at  the  promotion  of
indigenous languages, we've got to also devise mechanisms of  ensuring  that
in our schools where Zulu is the first language, we have teachers  in  place
who can teach our children English, because it  is  an  accepted  fact  that
English is the commercial language of the world, and I think  we've  got  to
look  at  it  that  way,  as  well.  Thank  you  very  much,  hon  Minister.
[Applause.]

Mr M MASUKU (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, thank you for the time that has  been
given to me. Hon Minister and the members of this House, I want  to  express
my thanks for the opportunity to deliver my maiden speech in  the  NCOP.  We
in Mpumalanga take the issue of arts and culture very  serious,  because  we
believe that South Africa has come from a gloomy past,  as  Deputy  Minister
Botha has mentioned. We have come from a racially fragmented  past,  a  past
where the culture of the majority were suppressed; an apartheid  past  where
the moral fabric of the society was seriously ravaged, just  as  many  souls
from those who were aspiring for a South Africa, such  as  the  one  we  are
living in today, have been forced to depart  unduly;  a  past  that  limited
South Africa  from  fully  displaying  its  rich  heritage  and  talent  and
exploiting it for its economic benefit.
What we are saying is being said within that context. So, whatever arts  and
cultural programme we have, we should take it into  account.  Unfortunately,
while I was looking at the definition of what culture is, I  came  across  a
definition that said: ``Culture can be simply defined in terms  of  our  way
of life.'' However, our way of life, at the same time, needs to  be  derived
from our historical past and our cultural heritage.

The question that comes to mind is: What sort  of  historical  heritage  can
you derive from an apartheid past, its division, its hatred and so  on  and,
therefore, if you have to derive it from  that  particular  past,  it  means
that there would have to be a lot of  engineering.  That  is  why  sometimes
when we practise our art, which is a creative display of what  this  way  of
life is supposed to be like, you find in most cases in my province there  is
a great difficulty to bring  together  people  from  different  and  diverse
backgrounds. That is why culture has been downplayed as just  the  mere  art
of entertainment. It has actually  been  relegated  to  the  background  and
taken for granted and kept right on the periphery.

It is my fervent  belief  that  arts  and  culture  do  not  belong  on  the
periphery of social development, but  are  integrated  parts  thereof.  They
contribute immensely to  socioeconomic  and  political  transformation.  The
role arts and culture  play  in  instilling  a  sense  of  common  identity,
belonging and patriotism cannot be overemphasised, as has been mentioned  in
this House. This House has gone a long way in building  bridges  across  the
boundaries of race, language, religion, culture and creed.

The physical renewal of our country, while important and essential,  is  not
the only influential prerequisite for sustaining the  social  transformation
process. What  is  equally  important,  as  members  have  mentioned,  is  a
spiritually and morally healthy  social  being  who  embraces  attitudes  to
uphold human dignity and respect and  tolerance  towards  others,  a  spirit
that is at peace with the unfolding process of social progress and  justice.
It is in this spirit that we welcome the arts and  culture  programme,  with
specific  focus  on  the  previously  disadvantaged  and  youth,  which  the
national department  has  already  started.  For  our  part,  we  have  also
initiated programmes that are going to address this,  and  that's  something
we are going to discuss when we have an opportunity to meet the Minister.

Sir Seretse Khama once mentioned that a nation without  a  past  is  a  lost
nation, and a people without a past is a people without a soul.  We  believe
that the Department of Arts and Culture is mandated by the  Constitution  to
promote a consciousness that celebrates this diversity of culture, and  that
will shape  our  common  future  where  democracy  is  enhanced  by  vibrant
artistic practices and culture of life. I am saying that it is  within  this
spirit that we welcome the work in progress that the national department  is
engaged in, namely the establishment of new heritage  sites.  In  Mpumalanga
we are going to ensure the resource agency is going to be  made  functional,
and we will add more numbers to those new heritage sites that  the  national
department has identified.

In 2005 we are going to host an International Gold  Panning  Competition  in
Mpumalanga. This International Gold Panning Competition is going to be  held
at the historical gold town, Pilgrim's Rest. We feel historical gold  mining
will very soon be promoted as a national heritage. We are  planning  to  use
this gold panning as a way of displaying the heritage of South  Africa,  and
all our programmes that we are going to focus on this year is  to  build  up
towards that.

Our next target will be 2010,  because  we  are  saying  that  gold  panning
should be a springboard which can help us  display  our  cultural  heritage,
our art, craft and music to the whole world,  and  we  will  be  looking  at
improvements on these. Come 2010, because Mpumalanga is part  of  those  who
want to host it,  we  want  to  finish  up  by  showcasing  this  particular
activity. We therefore  welcome  the  initiative  that  the  department  has
already taken in the  craft  industries,  and  which  has  resulted  in  the
creation of jobs and the training of people. We are going  to  piggyback  on
these trained people in order to build a future.

Last weekend I went to Mozambique, but before I went there the  Premier  had
just addressed the legislature and said that our province was littered  with
a lot of mampara names. This did not ring a bell on what is it that you  can
call a mampara name, but when I drove out of town there were names  all  the
way to Mozambique that, when I looked at them, made me think of the  past  -
the past divisions and so on. When I went into Mozambique, I  drove  through
a street called 23 July, and then I drove in roads with  street  names  like
Julius Nyerere, Kwame Nkruma and Albert Luthuli. Whilst  I  was  looking  at
these names, my mind became a giant  telescope,  and  I  began  to  pick  up
signs, and within myself my soft voice was  beginning  to  sing,  all  these
....

``bonke laba abakhululi bethu.'' [All these are our liberators.]

All these people had been our leaders, and I  had  a  feeling  of  being  an
African. We  are  also  committed  that  when  you  talk  about  this  moral
regeneration and the African renaissance, we are going  to  make  sure  that
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev E ADOLPH: Thank you, hon Chairperson. I want to congratulate  the  newly
appointed Ministers of Science and  Technology  and  of  Arts  and  Culture.
Owing to time constraints, I'll be very  brief  and  focus  on  Science  and
Technology only.

We would all agree that the Department  of  Science  and  Technology,  as  a
newly  established  department,  is  underfunded.  This  is  not  acceptable
because we have to compete on a global scale  with  people  who  have  First
World budgets and economies.

I am concerned that more than 90% of the budget is  being  spent  externally
from this department, and the ID  are  very  mindful  of  the  problems  and
challenges facing this department. Coupled with this, we  have  the  problem
of national and international investment trends. It is  quite  evident  that
the GDP is not growing, therefore there is no effective movement in  Science
and Technology because the two are closely interlinked.

We want to commend and re-emphasise the  President's  announcement  that  he
will  increase  resources  for  human  resource  development  and   research
programmes. We, as ID, appreciate the newly launched centres  of  excellence
which were established to  popularise  science  and  technology,  especially
among black and women scientists. There  is  a  shortage  of,  and  a  major
problem with skilful black and women scientists, and we  are  grateful  that
these institutions of excellence tackle the problem of the  lack  of  people
with substance who can compete on a global  scale  in  terms  of  the  ever-
changing new developments in science and technology.

We also want to congratulate  the  department  for  community  intervention,
projects such as Godisa, as well as Tirisano. We  would  challenge  them  to
cascade them down to the  three  spheres  of  government,  particularly  the
local level, and want to encourage them to do  the  same  with  the  poverty
reduction programmes. I thank you, Chairperson, sir.

Mr B BOSHIELO (Limpopo): Chairperson, after a thorough consultative  process
which ended in 1994, the people of our country  produced  a  document  which
was titled the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).  In  defining
the problem statement within the area of Arts and Culture, the RDP had  this
to say:


  ... that under colonialism and apartheid, the culture of the majority  of
  South Africans  was  neglected,  distorted  and  suppressed.  Freedom  of
  expression and creativity was stifled. People and communities were denied
  access to resources and facilities to exercise and develop their need for
  cultural and artistic expression. Illiteracy, lack of effective education
  system and extreme poverty compounded this cultural deprivation ...

In search of solutions, and as a way of setting the  way  for  the  incoming
Government, the document went further to say this about the RDP of arts  and
culture: ``...  that  the  new  Government  should  strive  to  promote  the
development of a unifying national culture representing the  aspirations  of
all South Africa's  people.''  This,  they  said,  cannot  be  imposed,  but
requires educating people in principles of non-racialism, non-sexism,  human
rights and democracy. They went further to commit us to  "conserve,  promote
and revitalise our national cultural heritage so it  is  accessible  to  all
communities ..."

It is these challenges, as outlined  above,  which  influence  our  thinking
around the reinvention and development of our  arts  and  cultural  heritage
and nation-building exercise. For us, therefore, a fundamental  prerequisite
for a democracy is the principle  of  freedom  of  expression  and  creative
thinking. Arts and culture and heritage play a pivotal role in  development,
in nation-building and in sustaining our democracy.  Over  and  above  that,
arts and culture industries offer potential employment  and  wealth-creation
opportunities.

It therefore holds, Chairperson, that a deliverable programme of  investment
in arts and culture  is  a  direct  response  to  the  challenges  that  the
Government has committed itself to dealing with  in  our  second  decade  of
democracy, which is the eradication of poverty and creation  of  employment.
To this end, the province is forging ahead in  exploring  arts  and  culture
areas which were formerly beyond  the  reach  of  black  people,  especially
Africans. In this regard, our province will put more emphasis  on  the  area
of film, video and theatre industry. A film and  video  kgoro  [meeting]  is
being organised for later this year to  pursue  this  objective.  We  remain
convinced that  with  the  involvement  of  our  stakeholders  and  our  own
determination, we will change the face of this industry.

In this regard, we  are  inspired  by  one  of  the  youngest  leaders  this
continent has ever produced, the late Comrade President  Thomas  Sankara  of
Burkino Faso who, despite the fact that he led one of  the  poorest  nations
in the world, developed it into one of the biggest  film  producing  nations
which ultimately kick-started economic development as a result  of  economic
growth.

We acknowledge the fact that libraries constitute an integral  part  of  our
nation. However, we are keenly aware that the erection and stocking  of  our
libraries will not necessarily meet our objective of establishing a  reading
nation and knowledgeable society. In this regard,  we  require  a  concerted
effort which will take our people out of clubs and pubs and  into  libraries
to read.

We conclude by urging that we should, in  our  lifetime,  acknowledge  those
who stood firm during the  dark  days  to  preserve  our  cultural  heritage
through pen and paper and other means.  These  include  the  likes  of  Prof
Ndebele, O K Matsepe, Wally Serote, Fatima  Meer,  Philip  Tabane,  Gomolemo
Mokae  and  many,  many  others.  These  children  of  the  soil  should  be
recognised while they are still alive.

We support this budget and wish you success with its implementation.

Mr M SULLIMAN: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Hon  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,
allow me to follow in the footsteps of my  colleagues  to  congratulate  our
Ministers and Deputy Ministers on  their  respective  appointments,  and  we
would like to assure them of  our  commitment  and  our  support  throughout
their term of office.

As the ANC we are indeed pleased to have this important Budget  Vote  before
this House today. Because it  seeks  to  demonstrate  the  extent  to  which
Government and the department have moved towards ensuring our  technological
progress and innovation in the science field, it has become a  major  source
in improving the quality of life of our people.

As is the  case  with  all  our  programmes  and  policies,  it  is  perhaps
appropriate that we have a review of our  achievements  over  the  past  ten
years. Chairperson, as we all  should  know,  the  Department  of  Arts  and
Culture  launched  its  flagship  project,   the   National   Research   and
Development Strategy in 2002. Its core objective is to identify the need  to
pay greater  attention  to  human  resource  development  as  a  wealth  and
employment creator,  and  to  bring  innovation  to  the  fore  in  all  the
department's activities and to facilitate performance across Government.

Moreover, it has established the reference group of  women  in  science  and
technology, aimed at creating an  environment  in  which  women  contribute,
participate and share benefits equally with their male counterparts  in  the
science, engineering and technology fields.

In 1996 it launched the Science and Technology Agreements Committee  through
the offices of the  National  Research  Foundation  to  effectively  service
intergovernmental  science  and  technology  agreements   and   multilateral
activities.

To us in the ANC, this  budget  is  clearly  geared  towards  the  high-tech
demands  of  the  21st  century,  however,  with  an  emphasis  on   African
development. To achieve this goal, this budget has  clearly  stipulated  and
measurable objectives. Accordingly,  it  is  underpinned  by  the  following
programmes:  administration  technology   for   development,   international
corporation and resources, the Government science and technology system  and
science and technology for competitiveness.

As we are celebrating 10 years of democracy,  this  Budget  Vote  is  indeed
people-centred and is in line with our people's contract to create work  and
fight poverty. For this reason, the department has established  the  poverty
reduction  programme,  focusing  on  the  agro-processing  area,  with   big
potential for achieving sustainable reduction in poverty levels,  especially
in the rural area and peri-urban areas. Its mechanism is  the  establishment
of  small  and  micro  ventures  within  targeted  communities  once  skills
transfers has taken place.

The programme emphasises the transfer of skills,  the  utilisation  of  low-
cost labour-intensive  technologies,  stimulating  demand,  securing  orders
within the South African domestic market and  establishing  and  maintaining
product  quality  standards  and  the  practice  of  general  good  business
management.

This programme has established a  variety  of  projects.  For  example,  the
department has funded the cost of training communities  across  the  country
to keep honey bees and to make  honey,  sweets  and  candles  from  wax.  In
addition to that, the programme has also led to  the  production  of  crafts
and other products such  as  handcrafted  containers  for  honey,  bees  wax
candles and making of protective clothing. It was implemented  in  35  rural
areas across South Africa  and  projects  were  implemented  in  Stinkwater,
Muldersdrift and Atteridgeville in Gauteng. Products were proudly  showcased
during the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

The National Research Foundation is responsible for managing  five  national
research facilities of which one is located in the  town  of  Sutherland  in
the Northern Cape, where I come from. The telescopes at the observatory  are
used for optical and infrared observations.  It  provides  an  international
facility for research in astronomy in Africa and educates the community.  At
present, an 11 metre optical telescope is in construction, and I believe  it
will be operational during the end  of  this  year.  Needless  to  say,  the
potential in terms of tourism and the related economic benefits  are  indeed
great. Moreover, it will certainly inspire our youngsters from the  Northern
Cape province to pursue careers in this fascinating field of study.

Chairperson, hon Minister, you will agree with me that the science field  is
one of the serious wars we have to wage as a nation. Having  said  that,  we
must acknowledge the role, the  expertise  and  contributions  made  by  the
previously advantaged in the science sphere in  our  country.  However,  the
political objectives of access to the field of science  needs  to  be  fast-
tracked as a matter of urgency.

Taking cognisance of this objective, as spelled out  clearly  in  our  human
resource development strategy, we in the ANC will  work  together  with  the
Department of Science and Technology to extend assistance  to  this  sphere.
Moreover, this will enable us to effect  the  necessary  changes  to  ensure
that we have the people with the right skills in the right places.

Many reasons are put forward as to why unemployment and poverty  persist  in
our society when there is still so much to be achieved. Not all the  reasons
have to do with the capabilities  of  people.  Many  have  to  do  with  the
unequal distribution of science skills in our  society.  It  is,  therefore,
critical that we push back the frontiers of ignorance  amongst  our  school-
going population, and remind them that we have  been  historically  deprived
of the opportunity to study in these career paths.

Moreover, we believe that current initiatives and joint  programmes  between
the Departments of Science and Technology  and  Education  will  ensure  the
sufficient publication  of  scientific  literature  in  simple  language  of
innovations and interventions. This, we believe,  will  create  a  sense  of
curiosity amongst our young people and will encourage them to  emulate  some
of the recorded scientific achievements,  but  most  importantly,  it  might
just  produce  the  first  Einstein  from  Africa.  With  those  few  words,
Chairperson, the ANC supports this Budget Vote.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Chairperson, I want to thank all  the  hon
members who have participated in the  debate.  I  have  noted  some  of  the
remarks that have been made and some  of  the  very  sound  suggestions  put
forward and proffered by hon members. We  shall  be  following  up  some  of
them. I am not going to respond to every contribution that was made,  but  I
will pick some that I think were particularly useful.

Firstly, I would like to address the problem that was faced  by  hon  member
Robinson, about the Iziko house  museums.  I  think  the  hon  Robinson  was
perhaps a victim of bad timing. The temporary closure  of  the  museums  she
referred to had in fact been announced in the  printed  media  here  in  the
Cape, so on the day she went there she was just  unfortunate.  Since  April,
with the exception of the Natale  Labia  Museum  in  Muizenberg,  the  other
museums have been open three days a week and that too was announced  in  the
Cape-based media.

We  are  currently  working  on  a  feasibility  study  for  more  effective
management of these museums and this will be completed  in  September.  That
too, interestingly, was in the media. Please bear with us. We  will  get  it
right. As I have said, by September we should have  a  management  plan  for
the more effective management of these museums. Everyone has emphasised  the
role that arts and culture can play in the  process  of  reconciliation  and
nation-building, and also in the process  of  engendering  a  new  sense  of
South African patriotism. All these are absolutely very true.

However, I think we shouldn't lose sight of  the  other  side  of  arts  and
culture. A musician who died too  young,  Albert  Ayler,  once  referred  to
music as the great healing force in  the  universe.  Another  musician,  who
wrote a song called Alexandra's Right Time Band, has as one of the lines  in
that song that they play the national anthem in such a way  that  you  would
want to go to war. So it can heal, but it  can  also  do  a  great  deal  of
damage.

So let's start to romanticise arts and culture. It can be  a  healing  force
in the universe and it can also be a very damaging force  in  the  universe.
We, of course, want to emphasise the healing dimension of arts and  culture.
In that process of healing, we find that we  have  to  undo  a  lot  of  the
damage that was also done by arts and culture in the past. I am  pleased  to
see that many of the hon members are very aware of  that  sort  of  problem,
because there were many references made, for example, to  misrepresentations
and distortions that we have in many of our museums, art  galleries  and  at
our heritage and legacy sites. This is  something  that  the  department  is
addressing. We will need the cooperation of the  provinces,  especially  the
MECs responsible for these areas in repairing a lot of damage that has  been
inflicted through arts and culture in the past.

There  was  a  specific  reference  made  to  the  promotion  of  indigenous
languages and the problem which my hon colleague, Mr  Singh,  from  Kwazulu-
Natal has about the  promotion  of  indigenous  languages  and  perhaps  the
neglect of English,  which  is  universally  recognised  as  a  language  of
international commerce. I would say that there is  nothing  wrong  with  the
promotion of English. What has been  wrong  in  the  past  is  that  certain
languages have been promoted at the expense of others. That is part  of  the
damage that one is trying to repair.

At this moment in time you will find many parents saying that it  is  better
for their children to learn English than their  mother  tongue,  because  in
our own society the balance of forces is such that if you are proficient  in
English, you have an advantage over someone who is proficient  only  in  his
mother tongue. I think that too will change in time as we  begin  to  repair
this damage that has been inflicted by past practices.

Equally, on the issue of issue of geographical names,  let's  remember  that
South Africa, contrary to some of the damage that  has  been  done,  not  by
arts and culture in this time, but by another discipline, history,  was  not
an empty land. Every place in this country  which  has  a  name,  either  in
English, Afrikaans, German or French, had a previous indigenous  name.  Many
of those are maybe lost and some might be forgotten, but there  are  certain
areas where I suppose it is relatively easy to correct that sort  of  damage
that has been done.

I visited a place last September in Limpopo province. On all the maps it  is
called Tzaneen. I kept asking myself what language was  that.  Until  I  got
there to discover, after speaking to the Africans  in  the  area,  that  its
name was Tsaneng, but it has always been  referred  to  as  Tzaneen  on  the
maps, because that is the corruption of the  original  African  name.  There
are many instances like that. That one, I suppose,  is  relatively  easy  to
correct, but there would be other areas where it  would  be  a  little  more
difficult. Let's remember also when we correct names  or  rename  places  to
resurrect an original African name that it is quite  costly.  It  is  not  a
cheap exercise. It might be cheap for me in the  sense  that  I  would  say:
Give it that name or that other name, but every map in the world  will  have
to be changed. Remember that. Every map in South  Africa  will  have  to  be
changed. All our road signs will have to be changed. It is  quite  a  costly
exercise. It is not something we embark on lightly, but one  recognised,  of
course, the need to rectify some of that which has happened in the past.

Equally, on the issue of the  graves  of  the  fallen,  this  department  is
charged with looking after the  burial  sites  and  graves  of  the  fallen,
either after the wars South Africa had waged  in  Europe  and  the  rest  of
Africa, or those who have had fallen in the struggle for  liberation.  There
is no plan, nor is there a budget at this point,  for  the  repatriation  of
the remains of anybody. Let us not raise false  hopes  in  our  communities,
because there  are  no  such  plans.  What  there  is  a  plan  for  is  the
identification of ways and  means  of  preserving  those  burial  sites  and
graves of our fallen, in various parts of South Africa and in  the  rest  of
the world.
I also want to thank the hon members for  the  suggestions  that  they  have
made. I want to assure them  that  where  there  are  important  historical,
heritage and possible legacy sites, the department will take that  on  board
quite seriously. However, we also need the  assistance,  especially  of  hon
members in the provinces. If you take, for  example,  a  province  like  the
Free State, mention was made that it was the site of  the  founding  of  the
ANC and of the NP. As far  as  I  know,  the  House  where  that  first  ANC
conference was held is still standing in  Mangaung  in  Bloemfontein.  There
are also other sites in that province that could  very  well  become  legacy
projects, but we would want the hon members from that province  to  identify
them and also to point them out to us.

Yes, the cultural industries are a very important and perhaps a  potentially
strong area of economic growth for South Africa. I  have  seen  a  statistic
somewhere that, in terms of its exports, one of the  chief  exports  of  the
United States, for example, are various  cultural  products.  We  need  only
turn on the radio or television to realise that we are  particularly  strong
in the area of performing arts as South Africans, especially, when it  comes
to music, song and dance. We have a very keen  interest  in  developing  the
South African film industry, and I am pleased to say that our  participation
in various festivals, especially the Cannes Film Festival,  has  enabled  us
over the years to  establish  both  memoranda  of  understanding,  but  also
cooperation agreements with various other nations  in  the  world  that  are
engaged in that line of business.

The concerns that the hon members have raised in relation  to  the  National
Arts Council, the Playhouse,  the  libraries,  yes,  I  think  that  we  are
following these very closely. We shall be handling them  in  due  course.  I
think we will have answers to some of the problems that we have been  facing
in the National Arts Council within the next few days, because  that  matter
has been attended to.

I want to thank the hon members for their participation and we will  try  to
make sure that we follow up some of their suggestions. I thank you.

The  MINISTER  OF  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Hon  Chair,  may  I  start  by
apologising for crossing the line. I should have gone to the other  side.  I
had no deliberate intention of undermining your power and your privilege  in
this House.

When I came into the House and looked  at  the  speakers'  list,  especially
from the provinces, I noticed that all the delegates who are MECs  are  MECs
of arts, culture or sport, and only the Free State  has  an  MEC  for  arts,
sport, science and technology. I thought that when the time comes for me  to
reply I would say: "Haak, Vrystaat!", because it is the only  province  that
realised where we need to go. [Laughter.] But, "Haak, Vrystaat!",  they  did
not utter a single word about science and technology. [Laughter]. Now, I  do
not know what to say.

In fact, for the greater part of the debate, we wondered whether we were  in
the wrong debate or in the wrong House, because we  were  either  completely
ignored or boycotted - it could be any one of those words.

This happened most probably because most members  do  not  feel  comfortable
when talking about science and technology. It is an area for obscure  people
in laboratories in dustcoats  who  must  deal  with  such  issues,  and  yet
science and technology rules our lives. Everywhere we go, in this House  and
elsewhere,  as  well  as  in  our  homes,  the  microwaves,  the  TVs,   the
refrigerators, the soap we use in the morning - and  we  are  so  clean  and
smell nice - the chemicals that we put under our armpits  this  morning  and
the polish on the fingers of  our  beautiful  ladies  are  all  products  of
science and technology, research and development.

At all times in the industries there are people in laboratories who are  not
just satisfied that they have a piece of soap, but they are  always  looking
for ways and means of improving that soap, producing it faster and  cheaper.
That is what science or research and development is  about  in  the  private
sector in particular.

The cars that all of us drove to come here this morning, the cell phones  we
have, such as Nokia, Samsung and others are the same names you find on  your
microwaves, refrigerators, televisions and  music  systems  in  your  homes.
This system that I am using  here  is  a  Phillips  product,  from  a  Dutch
company, and I am just wondering how much we  put  in  it  as  South  Africa
before we use it, before we consume it in the manner that we  are  consuming
it. Will there be a day when we will  have  a  state-of-the-art  cell  phone
made in this country, a Nokia or  Samsung  of  our  own?  Because,  what  is
happening now is that we are importing all  our  refrigerators,  cars,  cell
phones and everything else. We also import computers and other products.  We
are consuming the work of other people and unless we increase  research  and
development, we will fall far behind in as far as the modernisation  of  our
society and the economy is concerned, because you cannot compete as long  as
you depend on other people.

Countries that are powerful, such as Japan, Korea and others,  are  economic
giants and we are buying from them because they have invested a  hell  of  a
lot  in  research  and  development.  They  dominate  us  economically   and
technologically. The US  does  the  same,  but  also  militarily.  They  can
``klap'' [strike] anybody they want at any time because they  have  invested
in science, technology and development. We cannot stand up to them  even  if
we disagree with whatever they do. We must ``thambela  mthetho''  [obey  the
rules]  because  they  can  ``klap''  [strike]  us.  So,  it  is  absolutely
important that we as hon  members  must  become  comfortable  talking  about
science and technology.

Earlier on I saw kids in the gallery over there. We hope in  due  course  to
invest, not only in the laboratories, in the science  councils  and  others,
but also in our school system, where we can make  available  facilities  for
our nation, for our kids to develop and to love science. The  Department  of
Science and Technology  wants  to  establish  science  centres  in  all  the
provinces, and we hope that the provinces  will  support  this  and  perhaps
even help us to build more centres so that kids can enjoy and  love  science
and technology. If they do so, then we will have the knowledge, the  science
workers and the technology workers that  we  need  in  order  to  take  this
country to the level where it is supposed to be. However,  as  things  stand
at the moment, we are not doing well at all. What is even  more  disturbing,
is that we are not doing  well  at  school  level  in  terms  of  maths  and
science.
Once  kids  have  maths,  they  can  do  anything  related  to  science  and
technology. The alarm bells should ring, especially among  the  majority  of
black people, because that is where the problem is, and  we  know  what  the
issues and reasons are. All of us must  go  out  and  solve  some  of  those
problems, because you cannot have a situation  where  the  majority  of  our
population are not comfortable with this area and the minority  is,  because
we will never be able to build the kind of society that we want.

I keep telling people that I have this little  paper  here  -  men's  shirts
with their pockets on the left are useful because it means that this  little
paper sits next to my heart - but it shows that we have not, as  a  country,
been able to develop the majority, as far as I am  concerned,  that  is  the
African component of our population.  Because  of  history,  the  facilities
that exist in the townships  and  the  villages,  and  the  poverty  of  the
schools and the universities, etc we have not  been  able  to  develop  that
component of our population, and therefore we will not get researchers  from
that component of our population. As things stand now, let me tell you  that
the African component of our population constitutes 79%  of  the  population
of this country, but they  constitute  only  2,4%  of  all  engineers.  They
constitute only 7,5% of all medical doctors. They constitute  only  1,6%  of
dentists and only 2,4% of actuaries. Actually,  the  number  is  12  in  the
entire country. That tells you  that  the  education  system,  the  research
establishment in industry and everywhere,  is  not  able  to  tap  into  the
majority of the people in our country. So, we will never have our own  Nokia
and our own South African car. We do not have it. All cars are  manufactured
elsewhere and if we do make them here, we make them under licence.  We  will
never have those things and we will never do them on our own. We face a  big
challenge, so let us have science at the centre of our  lives  and  we  will
become a better country, a more  powerful  country,  able  to  compete  with
others on an equal footing. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers and special delegates, that concludes the business  for  the  day,
and before I can call on hon members to depart,  I  just  want  to  make  an
observation that indeed our approach  of  clustering  debates  has  been  of
great significance, not only to  us  as  a  House,  but  also  in  terms  of
promoting one  of  the  cornerstones  of  our  Constitution,  which  is  co-
operative governance. Through this kind of cluster debate, we are  not  only
learning from the experiences of the provinces and Ministers  are  not  only
learning from the experiences of the provinces, but they  are  beginning  to
have a sense of how other issues  in  other  departments  are  impacting  on
their own work as different departments, so in that sense the  whole  notion
of an integrated approach to development  is  beginning  to  be  taken  more
seriously.
I want to thank the Ministers and special delegates for taking  these  kinds
of debates seriously. This is a national duty that all of us  must  continue
to build on.

That  concludes  the  debate,  and  I  want  to  remind  hon  members   that
proceedings will be suspended until we resume after lunch. Thank you.

Business suspended at 13:06 and resumed at 14:05.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 15 - Health;

Debate on Vote No 20 - Social Development:

USIIHLALO WAMAKOMIDI: Malungu ahloniphekile, angithathe leli thuba  ngibonge
ukuba  khona  koNgqongqoshe  kule  Ndlu  namhlanje.  Sibonga   ukuba   khona
kukaNgqongqoshe  wezeMpilo  umhlonishwa  uManto  Tshabalala-Msimang,  iPhini
lakhe  uNozizwe  Madlala-Routledge  kanye  noNgqongqoshe   wezokuThuthukiswa
koMphakathi. Siyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, let me  take  this  opportunity
to  thank  the  Ministers  for  their  presence  in  this  House  today.  We
appreciate the presence of the Minister of  Health,  hon  Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang and her Deputy,  Nozizwe  Madlala-Routledge,  and  the  Minister  of
Social Development. We thank you.]

The  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Chairperson,  Minister  Zola  Skweyiya,   Deputy
Minister of Health, MECs present, Deputy  Minister  of  Social  Development,
hon members of the NCOP, I wish to dedicate this speech to the late  Comrade
Aggrey Klaaste, the former editor of Sowetan. The  late  Mr  Klaaste's  life
and dedication to nation building should be an inspiration to all of  us.  I
wish to convey my sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to  all
of us who will miss him.

It is a pleasure for me to address this House on my budget  vote  today.  It
is a pleasure because the electorate has demonstrated its confidence in  the
policies and programmes of the two successive  ANC-led  Governments  by  re-
electing the ANC with such a great majority. It is  a  pleasure  because  we
can collectively take credit for our achievements in the first ten years  of
our democracy. It is also a pleasure because, by sharing  this  budget  vote
with my colleague, Minister Skweyiya, we are illustrating in concrete  terms
the extent to which integration  in  Government  works.  It  is  a  pleasure
because, despite many obstacles, we are well on our way to transforming  the
delivery of social services in our country.

In the process of electioneering, in particular, I travelled many  provinces
and was told repeatedly by our people how much they appreciate the  services
provided by this Government. When one hears this and tries to  reconcile  it
with the newspaper headlines, one should  realise  that  the  poor  and  the
marginalised people of our country do not  have  access  to  the  media  and
therefore cannot tell their true stories.

One also realises that the policies  that  we  have  adopted  are  making  a
difference.  The  marginalised  are  benefiting  from   our   policies   and
programmes. If they did not, they would not have voted for the ANC  in  such
overwhelmingly large numbers.

Of course, those parts  of  our  society  that  were  reaping  extraordinary
benefits at the expense of the poor are beginning to feel the pinch.  If  we
want to broaden access to social  services  to  make  health  services  more
affordable, equitable and sustainable, we have no  choice  but  to  regulate
those  issues  that  impact  negatively  on  the  provision  of   equitable,
affordable and high quality  services  to  the  historically  disadvantaged.
This is not to say we are in the process of throwing the baby out  with  the
bath water. We have a coherent plan and an internationally  benchmarked  and
respected set of policies. What we do need is your active support to  ensure
successful implementation.

Before I speak about the budget and what we hope to focus  on  in  the  next
year, permit me to focus on some of our key achievements in  the  past  year
or so: We have improved child health care in our country;  our  immunisation
coverage has improved to 74%, with no deaths of children from measles  since
1999; we have trained at least one health  care  worker  per  facility  that
provides child  health  care  in  the  integrated  management  of  childhood
illnesses strategy; we have developed and are phasing in the  implementation
of a school health policy; our tobacco control policies, combined  with  our
health  promotion  activities,  have  resulted  in  fewer  youth  taking  up
smoking. I think we need to applaud  this.  Please,  do  so  on  my  behalf.
[Applause.]

With regard to the issue of malaria, we  have,  in  collaboration  with  our
neighbours - Mozambique, Swaziland and lately with Zimbabwe -  enhanced  our
malaria control programme, which has resulted in significantly  fewer  cases
in the past five years, as well as significantly fewer deaths. I'm proud  to
announce that we have succeeded in lowering the  death  rate  to  below  the
target set by the  World  Health  Organisation.  I  therefore  ask  members,
especially from KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga to both  send  letters
of appreciation to our health personnel in these provinces  and  to  support
our continued efforts to reduce the impact of malaria on our communities  in
the coming years, as outlined by the President in his state  of  the  nation
address.

In a similar vein, I wish to convey to this House another  very  good  piece
of news - our immunisation coverage has increased since  1998  from  63%  to
74% in 2003, and I'm sure we can do  better  this  year.  Whilst  there  are
still provinces that are lower than the  national  average,  this  level  of
coverage has resulted in no death from measles in all the provinces  in  our
country, with no  deaths  of  children  since  1999.  In  addition,  we  are
confident that we will be certified polio free by the WHO next  year.  I  am
therefore  pleading  with  members  of  this  House  to  please   take   the
immunisation  campaigns  very  seriously.   In   order   to   increase   our
immunisation campaign, we will embark on a national  immunisation  with  our
counterparts and compatriots in the SADC member states. We  hope  that  such
collaboration will enhance our collective efforts  to  prevent  disease  and
promote health.

With regard to the issue of HIV/Aids, we have expanded  our  prevention  and
care and support programmes in all provinces. This has been  accompanied  by
a significant increase in resources that this Government has made  available
to provinces and NGOs. I shall return to this issue when  I  deal  with  the
budget. We are working with other Government departments to ensure  that  we
all have policies and programmes that compliment each  other  in  our  fight
against the spread of HIV and the impact of Aids on our country.

Despite our efforts, we are not doing very  well  with  regards  to  TB.  We
have, however, expanded the Dots programme to ensure that every  TB  patient
has a supporter who ensures that the patient takes  her  or  his  medication
and completes the course, but our cure rates are still  well  short  of  our
targets. So, again I wish to request that members of this  House  assist  us
in this regard. We need greater commitment from  patients  and  communities,
including community leaders to  ensure  that  this  programme  delivers  the
results that you want. I, therefore, urge hon members to take  this  message
to their constituencies and to work tirelessly to convince  communities  and
local leaders to work  with  the  health  personnel  to  strengthen  our  TB
control programme in each and every district.

The provision of health services is labour intensive. This  is  positive  in
the sense that the provision of health services creates  work.  However,  it
also  requires  that  we  are  able  to  manage  our  human  resources  very
effectively by providing appropriate training, the right mix  of  incentives
and the management of training, recruiting and  retaining  health  personnel
in all parts of our country, but especially in our rural communities.

As part of our contribution to work creation, we will expand  the  community
health worker programme that already exists in the country. This cadre  will
be the interface between the communities and the formal health sector.  They
will assist communities to take over some of  the  burden  of  families  who
have to cope with caring for family members who  are  ill.  They  will  also
assist communities to remain  healthy  by  spreading  the  health  promotion
messages.
In addition to expanding the community  health  worker  programme,  we  have
initiated a range of other measures to strengthen  and  support  our  health
personnel. These include the implementation  of  a  mid-level  cadre  for  a
range of health professions; the provision of scarce  and  rural  allowances
since  July  2001;  the  strengthening  of  community  service  for   health
professionals via the use of telemedicines, for example. I  must  also  tell
this House that as of January, we will have community service for nurses.

To counter the high recruitment of our health professionals by agencies  for
placement in developed countries, we have  signed  a  number  of  agreements
with government departments of the United Kingdom and with the  Commonwealth
to regulate the migration of health professionals. We will be  working  with
other countries to do the same, notably Canada and Australia. In fact, as  I
speak to this House today, officials are already in Canada  to  ensure  that
we sign yet another agreement with Canada.

We also need to ensure that the health services provided in the  public  and
private sectors are affordable. We have  known  for  some  time  -  this  is
reflected in the National Drug Policy that we  adopted  in  the  first  five
years of our  democracy  -  that  there  are  a  range  of  incentives  like
discounts and rebates in the  health  market.  In  order  to  address  these
issues, we have introduced legislation that will provide for a  single  exit
price for medicine.

On the issue of quality we have introduced  legislation  that  will  require
all  those  health  professionals  who  wish  to  dispense  to  complete   a
dispensing course and to obtain a dispensing licence from the Department  of
Health. My colleagues in the health sector have known about it since a  year
ago, so I would have expected that they would have taken responsibility,  if
they were so interested in providing and protecting  the  interests  of  the
patients, and would have done this dispensing course  and  completed  it  to
ensure that they could obtain a dispensing licence from the department.

Let me reiterate, the first measure is to reduce  the  price  of  medicines,
and the second is to improve the quality of dispensing  of  these  medicines
in our country. I really want to know if there is anybody in this House  who
would say: No, we don't want the reduction in the price  of  medicines,  and
we don't want to ensure that we improve the quality  of  the  dispensing  of
these medicines.  I will therefore rely on my colleagues in  this  House  to
help us to help our communities to actually understand what this  Government
is trying to achieve.

There have been suggestions  that  this  Government  wants  to  destroy  the
private health sector. Nothing can be further from the  truth.  However,  we
are committed to ensuring that the private and public  health  sectors  work
in synergy to provide the most affordable and best quality care for all  the
people of our country. I think we really have to do this. There  is  no  way
we cannot do this, and again I plead with  the  members  of  this  House  to
ensure that we really  communicate  the  correct  message  to  the  doctors,
pharmacists and everybody out  there  who  are  feeding  people  with  wrong
information. We are beginning to get memos that indicate  that  we  want  to
destroy the private health sector. That is far from the truth.

Given our values we cannot be  complacent  when  the  public  health  sector
spends between R627 and R922 per person, whilst the  private  sector  spends
R6 231 per person. I do not think I can rest in peace, even  on  my  bed  at
night, with those figures. Hon members, I am sure you  will  agree  with  me
that this is totally unacceptable. I am sure it is unacceptable  to  all  of
us. Given that I have begun to touch on the health financing issues, let  me
turn to the budget for 2004-05, and then I will close with a few  paragraphs
on our priorities for 2004-05.

Of the R8,7 billion that the department received in  the  2004-05  financial
year, R7,7 billion, or if you like, 88,5%, is in  the  form  of  conditional
grants which are largely allocated to the provinces. Conditional grants  are
for the integrated nutrition programme; the HIV and Aids  programme,  and  I
am hoping that people are listening very carefully - it is HIV and Aids;  it
is not HIV/Aids - the transfer of South African Police  Services  mortuaries
to the provincial departments of  health;  the  national  tertiary  services
grant;  the  health  professional  training  and  research;   the   hospital
revitalisation programme and the hospital management grant.

A major  increase  in  conditional  grant  funding  for  the  HIV  and  Aids
programme has been provided for, as I have said. Conditional  grant  funding
increased from R333 million in 2003-04 to R781  million  in  2004-05.  These
funds are to be  used  to  finance  the  comprehensive  HIV  and  Aids  Care
Management and Treatment Plan. I wish to stress that it is not a rollout  of
ARVs. It is the comprehensive HIV and Aids  Care  Management  and  Treatment
Plan  for  South  Africa.  I  urge,  therefore,  the  MECs  for  health,  in
particular,  to  ensure  that  these  funds  are  spent  appropriately   and
efficiently. I again stress: it is not the rollout of ARVs, and  I  rely  on
this House to tell our citizens what it is. It is a  comprehensive  HIV  and
Aids care management and treatment plan for South Africa. Let me  emphasise,
however, that the implementation of the  plan  must  strengthen  the  health
system as a whole.

I am sure that hon members would also like to understand how the  provincial
departments of health are funded. Provinces obtain the bulk of  their  funds
from the national fiscus. The division is done through a  formula,  a  block
grant, which is called an equitable share, which is given to each  province.
Provinces  then  divide  the  funds  among  their   different   departments.
Guidelines are provided to provinces about what  percentage  of  the  budget
should be used for social services; and what percentage should be  allocated
for each social  service,  namely  education,  health  and  social  welfare.
However, sadly, what provinces are finding is that the percentage  allocated
to health is decreasing, whilst  the  allocation  to  social  development  -
largely for the grants -  has  been  steadily  increasing.  Some  provinces,
therefore, are underbudgeting for health services.

In the 2003-04 financial year, provinces  collectively  overspent  on  their
budgets by 0,5%. However, three provinces overspent by a very large  margin.
These are Gauteng, North West  and  the  Northern  Cape.  This,  it  may  be
argued, reflects the extent of underbudgeting.

When one compares the allocations to provinces  for  the  2004-05  financial
year, one finds that on average that the budget increase is 8%, compared  to
2003-04. The increase of 8% is about 2% better than inflation. However,  the
additional funds are largely earmarked for the comprehensive  plan  for  HIV
and Aids. It is, however, heartening to note that some  provinces  with  the
lowest per capita health budget, like Limpopo, North West and  the  Northern
Cape, will get increases that are higher than the national average of 8%.

Whilst the allocation of funding for HIV and Aids has been growing,  we,  as
South Africans, must not forget that we suffer from certain  other  diseases
and die from a  range  of  diseases,  and  that  we,  therefore,  must  make
suitable provision for noncommunicable diseases like  asthma,  hypertension,
osteoporosis,  diabetes  and  unnatural  causes  of  death,   like   traffic
accidents, suicides and homicides.

The National Treasury, I understand, is currently  reviewing  the  equitable
share formula which is used to allocate funds to provinces. I  urge  members
of this House to actively participate in this review  process.  Let  me  now
turn to the provision of selected services.

As members  know,  we  embarked  on  an  ambitious  hospital  revitalisation
programme at which 27  hospitals  are  currently  enrolled.  This  programme
will, over the next 20  years,  ensure  the  revitalisation  of  all  public
hospitals that need improvement. I hope you can support us  in  this  regard
when we ask for additional resources. What members might not  know  is  that
the programme targets physical  infrastructure,  equipment,  improvement  of
management and quality of care.

Provinces  choose  the  hospitals  that  they   wish   to   enrol   in   the
revitalisation programme  each  year  -  as  funds  are  made  available  by
National Treasury. However,  members  are  urged  to  ensure  that  in  each
province  psychiatric  hospitals  are   included   in   the   revitalisation
programme, as well. The state of psychiatric  hospitals  and  mental  health
care in general really leaves much to be desired, and I want  to  commit  my
department to  work  more  vigorously  with  provinces  to  ensure  that  we
strengthen mental health care in all our nine provinces during  this  coming
year. In this context we  will  be  exploring  how  we  can  strengthen  our
collaboration with the Ministries of Social  Development  and  Education  in
particular.

As I end, permit me to share with this House  some  of  our  priorities  for
this year, and in the term of office of this Government. We need to  sharpen
the implementation of our policies. As you  are  all  aware,  implementation
takes place within provinces and within municipalities.  This  implies  that
the three spheres of Government - national, provincial and municipalities  -
must work together to ensure that social services reach  those  in  greatest
need.

Many of our people who are in the greatest need live in rural areas  and  in
informal housing in the urban areas. We must be able  to  plan  and  deliver
services so that these South Africans are also  reached.  We  shall  do  our
best by increasing resources allocated to these  areas,  by  increasing  the
number of community health workers  who  provide  preventive  and  promotive
health services in these areas, and  by  increasing  the  number  of  health
workers who are allocated to the clinics that  are  built  in  these  areas.
National and provincial government must work closely with  local  government
to increase our ability to reach those most in need of these services.

By ensuring better collaboration between various  departments  that  provide
social services, we will improve both the quantity and quality  of  services
to the marginalised and  the  historically  disadvantaged  in  our  country,
particularly  the  poor.  This  will  be  our  collective  contribution   to
restoring the dignity of our people. Clearly, we will continue  our  efforts
to reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria, cholera, TB, HIV  and  Aids,
but we shall also  focus  on  noncommunicable  diseases  like,  as  I  said,
asthma, diabetes, osteoporosis and so on. We will therefore also  focus  our
efforts on the promotion  of  healthy  lifestyles  and  initiate  a  healthy
lifestyle campaign which we can encourage all  our  members  to  participate
in.

I was very proud when I  was  at  the  World  Health  Assembly,  because  we
chaired  a  commission  that  looked  at  healthy  lifestyles  and  physical
exercise, and we were able to influence the resolution  that  was  taken  by
the  WHO.  This  campaign  will  also  include  interventions  to  emphasise
responsible alcohol  use  and  the  reduction  of  tobacco  use,  especially
amongst the youth. As I stand here before you, we have a delegation that  is
going to Geneva to actually begin to discuss and strengthen our approach  to
tobacco abuse and its reduction.
Research and our own assessment reveal  that  non-natural  causes  of  death
from inter-personal violence, traffic accidents and suicides,  many  related
to substance abuse, are increasing at an alarming rate.  Together  with  our
colleagues in the social  sector  cluster  -  the  Ministers  of  Education,
Social  Development  and  Transport  -  we  will  develop  a   comprehensive
intervention strategy. However, Government cannot work  alone.  I  therefore
implore members of this House, the private sector  and  the  communities  to
work with us to deal decisively with these issues.

We have much work to do. We will only succeed if  Government  works  as  one
cohesive  unit  at  national  level  and  with  the  provincial  and   local
government. In  addition  to  the  Government  working  in  synchronisation,
dealing  with  social  problems  requires  social   mobilisation   and   the
involvement of all sectors of society. We must, therefore, commit  ourselves
to working together to ensure a better life for all our citizens.
In conclusion, permit  me  to  thank  my  colleagues,  the  MECs,  who  were
responsible for providing the stewardship of the national health  system  in
the past five years and to welcome the newly appointed MECs. I am sure  that
we  will  work  together  effectively  to  ensure  that  our  policies   and
programmes are implemented in ways that benefit  all  our  people.  In  this
regard, I also want to welcome my colleague  Nozizwe  Madlala-Routledge  who
has just joined us, and I am sure we will work together very well to  ensure
the implementation of policies.

I also wish to place on record my personal thanks to the former  chairperson
of the Select  Committee  on  Social  Services,  Loretta  Jacobus,  and  the
members of the committee.  I  also  wish  to  welcome  the  newly  appointed
Chairperson, Ms Rejoice Masilo, and her new committee,  and  I  pledge  that
the Department of Health will closely work with  them  to  ensure  that  the
oversight that they provide sharpens implementation. I hope you will  really
do good oversight so that we can implement the very good  policies  that  we
have developed over the years.

Finally, I wish  to  thank  the  officials  at  the  local,  provincial  and
national levels for the sterling work that they have done in the  past  five
years, and encourage them to rededicate themselves to serving the people  of
this great land, South Africa. I have also given them instruction that  when
they go to the provinces, I do not expect them to be interacting  only  with
the officials;  they  must  really  go  to  the  people  so  that  they  can
understand the needs of those to whom we want to deliver excellent,  quality
health services. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The  MINISTER  OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I   would   like   to
acknowledge all the new members of the National  Council  of  the  Provinces
and request that they, together with all the  hon  members  of  this  House,
emulate the previous NCOP and maintain  a  clear  and  sharp  focus  on  the
mandate given to us by our people.

We have been given a mandate to fight poverty and  unemployment  and  ensure
that all South Africans, especially those living in poverty  or  confronting
all vulnerabilities, are fully able to exercise their constitutional  rights
and enjoy the full dignity of freedom.

Today  we  are  requesting  that  you  support  the  Department  of   Social
Development  in  building  a  caring  and  integrated   system   of   social
development service that facilitates  human  development  and  improves  the
quality of life of all our people.  This  applies  especially  to  children,
women, older persons and people with disabilities.

In my last address to the previous NCOP, before the close  of  the  term,  I
spoke of social assistance and the SA Social Agency Bills. I am  pleased  to
report that the establishment of the National Social Security Agency is  now
well underway, and it was announced by the President that  it  would  be  in
place by April of 2005.

This task requires urgent completion of the provincial inputs necessary  for
the finalisation of the budgets for social grants over the MTEF  period.  It
also  requires  that  each  province  and  its   government   reinvest   and
subsequently  separate  the  social  grants  function  from  other  services
provided by the  provincial  departments  of  social  development.  It  also
requires  a  reorganisation  of  the   provincial   department   of   social
development to put a greater and more comprehensive focus  on  other  social
welfare responsibilities.

Our strategy is to transform and enhance  the  social  welfare  services  by
encompassing the following initiatives: Firstly, the retention strategy  for
social workers of the department and the development  of  associated  social
services professions; secondly, the upgrading of the salary  levels  of  the
social work professionals; thirdly, the proposed introduction of  incentives
to professionals working in rural areas; and fourthly,  the  development  of
an appropriate service  delivery  model  and  a  policy  framework  for  the
granting of financial awards to nongovernmental  organisations  that  render
statutory welfare services.

As the National Council of Provinces  is  aware,  this  matter  has  been  a
matter of ongoing concern. The existing policy is antiquated  and  does  not
channel adequate resources to  the  welfare  institutions  that  need  their
assistance the most, especially those  working  with  children  and  in  the
rural areas.

Many welfare institutions, in  particular  those  created  in  the  past  10
years, are underfinanced and do not have the necessary trained  staff.  Many
institutions, civil society and faith-based  organisations  find  themselves
unable to cope with the need and demand for their services. We  are  working
on putting into place an all-encompassing framework that  will  assist  this
framework  institutions,  civil  society  and   faith-based   organisations,
especially those who care for orphaned and vulnerable children.  I  am  sure
that members of the NCOP are aware that  all  the  partners  in  the  social
developmental  sector  are  currently  conducting  a  campaign  to  register
children of up to the age of 11 who qualify from the  first  of  April  this
year for a child support grant.

As we intensify our campaign to register  all  eligible  children  under  14
years by the year 2005-06, we expect an additional 3,2 million  children  to
also receive the child support grant, thereby bringing the total  number  of
children in the system to over 7 million.  While  significant  progress  has
been  achieved  in  extending  basic  social  assistance,  there  is   still
outstanding work that needs to be done to  ensure  that  we  strengthen  our
contributory arrangement for comprehensive social security.

The  most  important  elements  of  this  work  is   the   finalisation   of
negotiations between the National Treasury and  the  Department  of  Health,
social health insurances and the development of  an  integrated  implemented
framework for social health insurance and  the  Road  Accident  Fund.  These
elements will be completed by September this year. As part of the  provision
of basic social assistance services, we will do further work to improve  the
understanding of the composite value,  distribution  and  targeting  of  the
social wage. We will report to Cabinet  on  this  matter  by  November  this
year.

On the legislation front there is still some  unfinished  business  that  we
are requesting the NCOP to address  with  urgency.  Government  presented  a
package of four Bills to the previous Parliament.  The  research,  drafting,
public participation progress and redrafting of these four  Bills  had  been
going  on  for  more  than  four  years  prior  to  their  presentation   to
Parliament. It  is  time  to  ensure  that  issues  regarding  children,  as
addressed in all the present Bills, are properly considered and  that  these
Bills are speedily passed  by  Parliament.  As  we  celebrate  10  years  of
democracy, it is time to ensure that children and older persons are able  to
fully exercise their constitutional rights and enjoy  the  full  dignity  of
freedom.

As the Older  Persons  Bill  is  a  section  76  Bill,  I  have  accordingly
requested the Leader of Government Business, big business and Parliament  to
reintroduce the Older Persons Bill in the NCOP for referral  to  the  Select
Committee on Social Services. The overall goal of the Bill  is  to  maintain
and increase the capacity of older persons  to  support  themselves  and  to
contribute to the wellbeing of those around them.

The many and varied stakeholder organisations  working  in  support  of  the
active aging of our older persons have  participated  in  the  process  that
will lead to the appeal of the  Aged  Persons  Act  of  1967  and  the  Aged
Persons Amendment Bill of  1998.  They  are  also  keen  to  have  the  Bill
properly considered and speedily passed by Parliament.

The priority elements of the Government programme of  action  of  this  year
have been clearly articulated by the President in his state  of  the  nation
address to Parliament. They are underpinned by the joint  programme  of  the
various sector clusters in Cabinet, and I would  like  to  spend  some  time
elaborating on some of the key development components of  the  programme  of
the Cabinet cluster for this year.

Firstly, the national food emergency scheme that is part of  the  integrated
food  security  and   administration   programme,   uses   Statistics   SA's
categorisation of poor households in South Africa of five bands  based  upon
the levels of expenditure on basic domestic essentials per  month.  To  date
food emergency schemes have focused only on the  poorest  households,  those
are households in band A which spend less than R200 on  domestic  essentials
and which do not have household member who receive a social assistance  fund
in excess of R200. In other words, the only  poor  households  that  qualify
for this food relief are  those  in  band  A,  whose  only  form  of  social
assistance is a child support grant.

According to the research conducted by Statistic SA, the majority  of  these
households are geographically concentrated in the nodes  of  the  integrated
sustainable rural development programme and  the  urban  renewal  programme.
Some of the households are also located in the provincial  poverty  pockets.
Despite the urgent human needs and the logistical challenges  faced  by  the
national food emergency scheme, things have generally gone well,  but  there
have been some problems. Although committee organisations have  assisted  in
the identification  of  needy  families  and  child-headed  households,  the
noninvolvement  of  civil  society  structures  has  in  some  cases  raised
problems.  Service  providers  have  by   and   large   co-ordinated   their
distribution of food parcels with some traditional leaders  and  faith-based
organisations, but a more inclusive approach could have been used and  could
have been better.

During this year the department will be working to standardise  the  use  of
stakeholder forums in their identification of households to receive in  kind
emergency  food  aid.  The  department  will  also  be   investigating   all
contractive service providers to ensure  that  the  food  parcels  that  are
distributed contain foodstuffs that are of good and nutritious  quality  and
with the right value. We have found cases where this has not been the  case,
which raises questions about the ethics  and  practices  of  some  of  these
services providers.

The department is working with other  social  welfare  cluster  departments,
its provincial counterparts and other  stakeholders  to  review  the  entire
programme in order to make it more effective and efficient,  and  to  ensure
that it is both  implemented  correctly  and  reaches  the  most  vulnerable
members of our society.

It is also necessary, in  order  to  ensure  the  sustainable  and  ultimate
independence of the beneficiaries of food parcels, that the registration  of
social fund  beneficiaries  who  receive  agricultural  starter  packs  take
place. In that way the household to food production initiative will  receive
attention.

Government recognises that not all qualifying households have  the  capacity
to prepare food for themselves. Therefore, designated drop-in  centres  have
been established to provide prepared meals and  nutritional  supplements  to
child-headed families, frail older people,  TB  patients  and  frail  people
living with HIV/Aids.

The second joint programme of the Cabinet  cluster  that  I  would  like  to
bring to the attention of the NCOP is the Expanded Public  Works  Programme.
Government's Expanded Public Works Programme, under the  leadership  of  the
Department of Public Works, is also in the social cluster and  it  is  aimed
at  expanding  social  services,  enhancing   skills   and   creating   work
opportunities. In the short term, the programme focuses on  enhancing  early
childhood development services and the  provision  of  home  and  community-
based care services.

With respect to early childhood development services, it  was  estimated  in
2000 that only 16% of the children under  the  age  of  six  years  old  had
access to these services. In addition, 85% of the caregivers  at  these  ECD
facilities required further training.  We  will  endeavour  to  sustain  our
interventions by linking them to the national food emergency scheme and  the
school nutrition programme, with the ultimate  objective  of  ensuring  that
all children attend school and receive at least one  meal  a  day.  In  this
regard we applaud the priority that the new Minister  of  Education,  Naledi
Pandor, is assigning to preschool education.
With respect to existing home and community-based  care  facilities,  it  is
estimated that they are staffed by approximately 2 500  fulltime  caregivers
and 20 000 volunteers. Only a quarter of these volunteers  receive  stipends
of any kind. Government has made a special allocation  of  R70  million  for
the department to support and increase the number  of  home  and  community-
based care sites. Increased  support  for  the  establishment  of  community
child-care forums is also envisaged. The department  is  also  co-ordinating
an umbrella research project on the effects and  impact  of  HIV  on  social
service provision in Government.

Before I conclude, allow me to return to the issue of the  mandate  that  we
have been given by  our  people.  Youth  are  central  to  the  Government's
commitment to fighting poverty and unemployment. During the month  of  June,
which is Youth Month,  we  are  rededicating  ourselves  to  this  task  and
intensifying our efforts to address the challenge faced by young people.  In
this  regard  our  sector  will  focus  on  developing   skills   and   work
opportunities for young people.

We are working with the Department of  Labour  to  ensure  that  the  Sector
Education and Training  Authorities  increase  the  number  of  learnerships
available in our sector. We will work through  not-for-profit  organisations
to enhance  the  utilisation  of  the  Umsobomvu  Fund  and  to  ensure  the
broadening of the base of the black economic empowerment process.

At this point we would like to acknowledge the new  board  of  the  National
Development Agency, led by its chairperson,  Bishop  Malusi  Mpumlwana,  and
commend them for their strategic initiatives that not only  strengthen  good
governance, but also ensure that  project  assistance  reaches  the  poorest
communities in our society.

As part of our work to building a caring society, we are also  attending  to
qualitative issues such as the role and place of the family, societal  value
systems  and  moral  regeneration,  especially   during   this   year,   the
International Year of the Orphan.

Members of the NCOP, it has to be said that while this work progresses,  the
scourge of drug and substance abuse continues  to  ravage  our  communities,
families and youth. What is even more worrying,  is  that  this  problem  is
starting to crop up in schools and amongst children.

Working together with all spheres of Government and all sectors of  society,
we will give this issue priority attention in the coming year.  We  have  to
reduce this scourge  and  promote  healthy  lifestyles.  We  will  therefore
intensify  awareness  campaigns  that  contribute  to  moral   regeneration;
finalise the norms and standards for the  treatment  and  rehabilitation  of
drug addicts; and ensure that treatment centres are registered, function  in
accordance with the Constitution and  the  law,  respect  human  rights  and
operate in terms of good governance principles.

In this regard, I take this opportunity to announce  that  we  have  decided
not to grant the Noupoort Christian Care Centre permanent registration,  but
rather look towards its closure. This follows the recommendations of a  task
team established by the  director-general  that  found  violation  of  human
rights; a lack of compliance with legislation, such as the  Child  Care  Act
and the Drug Treatment Act; and a lack of compliance with the set norms  and
standards for such centres in this country. This is despite  the  fact  that
the management of the centre had been given more than two  years  to  relook
its own act.

We granted the centre temporary registration for a period of over two  years
after a number of parents had requested that the centre not  be  closed.  We
also went further and made proposals on  how  the  centre  could  bring  its
service in line  with  the  Constitution,  pertinent  legislation  and  good
governance principles. The report  that  I  have  received  shows  that  not
enough has been done to this effect. We  as  Government  cannot  allow  this
situation to continue endlessly, and we would like to urge the  parents  and
communities to co-operate with us in addressing this matter.

Our effort at social  integration  also  requires  that  we  pay  particular
attention to services for people with disabilities.  The  department  is  in
the  process  of  redeveloping  national  norms  and  standards  on  service
delivery to people with disabilities. This year, together  with  the  Health
Department and the Presidency, we will be finalising the procedures for  the
granting  of  the  disability  grant,  based  on  a  common  definition   of
disability that encompasses the  elements  suggested  by  the  World  Health
Organisation.

Across the  entire  spectrum  of  the  work  of  the  Department  of  Social
Development,  the  attainment  of  our  objectives   requires   co-operative
governance  and  effective  collaboration  with  civil  society.  We   will,
therefore, engage civil society organisations in  our  country  and  on  the
African continent to develop a common  platform  of  action  this  year.  In
order for us to succeed in elaborating upon these hallmark principles of co-
operative governance and implement our plan of action, we  urge  members  of
the NCOP  to  support  the  Budget  Vote  of  this  department.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms J MASILO: Ke a leboga modulasetilo. [Thank you very much, Chairperson.]

Madam Chairperson, hon  Ministers,  hon  Deputy  Ministers,  MECs  from  the
provinces,  senior  officials  of  the  departments,  provincial  delegates,
special delegates and hon members of this House, as the  acting  chairperson
of the Select Committee on Social Services, I am very  happy  to  have  this
opportunity to address both the Minister  of  Health  and  the  Minister  of
Social Development  on  their  respective  Budget  Votes.  I  also  want  to
congratulate them on their reappointments. Even  though  I  have  been  with
this committee for a very short time, I  am  fully  aware  of  the  enormous
responsibilities that these two Ministries are facing in the road ahead.

With regard to Vote  No  16:  Health,  the  overall  responsibility  of  the
Department of Health is to ensure that our nation's health does not  decline
and that all our citizens are afforded access to health services where  they
live, at the facilities at their disposal and at a price they can afford.

Indeed, the protection of the wellness of our country's  people  is  one  of
the most fundamental services that  our  Government  can  perform.  This  is
especially important in a global environment where diseases have no  respect
for man-made boundaries, as was manifested by the  Sars  virus  which  first
struck in China and then crisscrossed the globe. It then found  its  way  to
our shores, albeit on a very small scale. Without  the  prompt  intervention
of the Department of Health, we could potentially have had  a  21st  century
version of the black plague.

Through the transformation of the health care system, a mammoth  task  which
began  by  merging  the  fragmented  health  system  that  practised  racial
discrimination in all facets of health service delivery, to a  situation  in
which there was quality primary  health  care  for  all  across  the  racial
divide, the Ministry of Health has steadfastly stayed committed to  bringing
quality health care to all people.

Some public hospitals and clinics were notorious in provinces, being  health
hospitals - legae la baswi - places where people went in sick  and  did  not
come out alive, regardless of the level of seriousness  of  their  ailments.
Conditions, particularly in rural communities and townships, were  terrible.
With patience, after a long day spent waiting for  a  doctor  to  see  them,
they would be turned away at close of  business  only  to  begin  the  whole
process again the next morning.

The Department of Health can hold its head high for ensuring that there  has
been  a  change  in  the  distribution  of  health  resources  through   its
deliberate  redistribution  of  funding  resources   to   provinces.   Those
provinces that had been historically  disadvantaged  found  themselves  with
bigger funding sources where these sources had been inadequate before  1994.
Clinic services and preventative  health  programmes,  through  a  focus  on
primary health care, were helped along by a deliberate allocation of funds.

Substantial funding has also being  set  aside  to  implement  the  hospital
revitalisation  programme.  A  total  of  27  capital  projects  and   other
infrastructural projects have been  budgeted  for,  such  as  those  at  the
Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban and the Nelson Mandela Hospital  in
Umtata.

Even our providers of  professional  services  such  as  doctors,  dentists,
pharmacists  and  other  health  professionals,  found  themselves,  through
mechanisms set up by the Department of Health, being relocated in  order  to
provide services in areas where the need was the greatest. The total  number
of professionals who have done community service is as  follows:  doctors  6
700; dentists 602; pharmacists 1 527; and other professionals 2 740.

The Department of  Health  has  also  entered  into  agreements  with  other
governments such as Cuba to send doctors to our country, especially for  our
rural provinces, the North West being one of them.  To  date,  approximately
640 Cuban doctors have served our people with dignity. What this  has  meant
in real terms is that people in provinces who saw doctors  only  rarely  and
who had to travel many hundreds of kilometres to  get  to  service  centres,
now have the services of community service doctors  or  foreign  doctors  to
bring healthcare to their communities.
Over and above professional health practitioners,  nonprofessional  workers,
for example community health workers, have lent their support in  addressing
their communities' healthcare  needs.  Some  community  counsellors  assist,
especially in the HIV/Aids voluntary counselling and testing programmes,  in
TB management through Dots and in the ARV roll-out plan, but the  department
is aware that one should not take advantage of  the  voluntary  services  of
community  workers.  They  have  already  investigated  the  possibility  of
volunteers receiving a stipend of R1 000 per month.

The relationship between the Department of Health and NGOs  is  a  sensitive
one, but one that must be carefully nurtured. NGOs depend  on  support  from
the department to continue with their vital  community  project  work.  With
regular funding, NGOs can be empowered to  form  a  complementary  workforce
for professionally trained healthcare staff.

Many countries on the  African  continent  are  still  vigorously  combating
potentially crippling diseases such as polio, measles and malaria.  We  have
been fortunate in South  Africa  in  that,  owing  to  routine  immunisation
programmes  in  childhood,  polio  has  been  eradicated  since  1989.   Our
immunisation coverage has increased from 63% in 1998 to 78% in 2002.

The multinational Lubombo Spatial  Development  Initiative,  partnered  with
Mozambique  and  Swaziland,  has  succeeded  in   lowering   malaria   cases
substantially. Of the 3 777 cholera cases reported in 2003, there were  only
40 fatalities. This all bears testimony to the fact that the  Department  of
Health is vigorous in its attempt to control  these  various  diseases.  Our
neighbours are not as lucky. Our responsibility, however, through Nepad  and
our  commitment  to  an  African  renaissance  lead  our  polio  and   other
contagious disease programmes with our neighbours, and together we  hope  to
eradicate these diseases from our continent.
In view of the department's commitment to health care for  all  its  people,
this Select Committee is happy to support the Health budget, Vote No 16.

On Vote  No  19:  Social  Development,  South  Africa  has  always  had  two
economies in one  country,  and  the  Ministry  that  is  charged  with  the
alleviation of the pain of the second economy  is  the  Ministry  of  Social
Development. In fact, the department has  had  a  special  programme  geared
specially  towards  poverty  alleviation  that  is  now  being  phased  out.
Instead,  the  department's  poverty  alleviation   activities   are   being
incorporated  into  the  new  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  that  will
integrate all social sector poverty relief programmes.

Despite the phasing out of the  poverty  alleviation  in  terms  of  special
programme  funding,  the  department  still  has  the   administration   and
distribution of social security grants as its  largest  poverty  alleviation
initiative  during  this  MTEF  period.  According   to   the   department's
estimates, there are  currently  over  8  million  beneficiaries  of  social
grants, and of that group over 50% are children living in abject poverty.

The new Social Assistance Bill and the South African Social Security  Agency
Bill, which were passed in February this year, have direct implications  for
the way provinces distribute social grants. In fact, a new  national  social
security agency, established through the passage of the  Bill,  has  as  its
primary task the  improvement  of  service  delivery  with  regards  to  the
provision of social security. The agency will be fully operational by  March
2005, and the inspectorate should be ready by April 2005.

All of us in the provinces have  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  corruption,
maladministration and general misappropriation of grant moneys  that  exist.
It is therefore no surprise that  the  focus  of  this  agency  will  be  on
improving the effectiveness of, and efficiency in grant  management  and  on
reducing fraud and  corruption  and,  most  importantly,  on  restoring  the
dignity of our people receiving grants  through  the  enhancement  of  Batho
Pele principles in the delivery of quality of service.

The impact of the national social  security  agency  means  a  new  way  for
provinces to allocate provincial budgets. Previously, budget allocations  to
provinces included social security funding, which took up approximately  80%
to 90% of provincial budgets. Now provinces  have  the  potential  to  focus
funding on developmental welfare services. We hope  that  workers  currently
employed in the directorate of social security  across  all  provinces  will
have the assurance that their services will continue in  the  new  envisaged
restructuring  process,  because  provinces  will   be   relieved   of   the
responsibility of administrating grants. They will have the  opportunity  to
focus on welfare services.

The transformation of  welfare  services  means  that  social  workers  will
become more prominent in the department.  This  change  in  focus  can  only
benefit the  department,  especially  social  workers.  Hopefully,  the  end
result will mean  that  they  will  no  longer  be  the  worst  paid  public
servants, but that they will have a salary package  corresponding  to  their
skills.

Despite their heavy emotional and  physical  responsibilities,  and  despite
the fact that they have degrees that require the same  number  of  years  of
training as  their  counterparts  in  other  faculties,  their  remuneration
leaves much to  be  desired.  It  therefore  becomes  a  challenge  for  the
Department of Social Development that requires  skilled  human  capacity  to
implement its programmes. Without  a  review  of  the  salary  packages  for
social workers, the work of the department may very well grind  to  a  halt.
In addition to human resources, the department will also be  able  to  focus
on older persons. An audit of the state of old-age homes  is  long  overdue,
as is the service to disabled persons.

In conclusion, young people  are  extremely  vulnerable  when  it  comes  to
substance abuse. Increasingly,  schools  are  reporting  drug  addiction  in
young learners. These days it is not uncommon for primary schools to  report
that their learners are addicted to hard drugs.  We  are  pleased  that  the
department has developed a policy framework on the prevention  of  substance
abuse and on rehabilitation. These are the kinds of programmes in  terms  of
which provinces will increasingly find their attention focused.

The select committee is  pleased  to  support  the  Budget  Vote  of  Social
Development, Vote No 19. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs L JOHNSON (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, Chairperson. We have noticed  with
appreciation that, compared to the past, there is a steady increase  in  the
national health budget. This year the increase stands at 4,8%. We have  also
noticed with even greater appreciation that  KwaZulu-Natal  is  getting  the
attention that it deserves. It has the  biggest  health  department  in  the
country, with some of the biggest health problems. Some  even  call  it  the
epicentre of the Aids epidemic. We  are  grateful  for  the  attention  that
KwaZulu-Natal is getting. We are hopeful  that  we  will  quickly  lose  our
unofficial status as the Cinderella province. Not only is  the  increase  in
the health budget evident at the national level, but this is generally  also
the trend in other provinces.

The slice that we are getting from the national department  will  enable  us
to implement  and  strengthen  many  of  our  programmes,  particularly  the
primary health care programme. This programme has  become  the  backbone  of
our health service delivery. We have recorded many successes in  this  area.
Through the district health system approach, our  department  has  continued
to enhance the primary health care services, with special  emphasis  on  the
underserved areas of our  province.  This  has  been  achieved  through  the
provisioning of  clinics  and  community  health  care  centres  which  were
required to improve the  access  of  medical  facilities,  to  those  people
living in the deep rural areas.

Funding has been directed from the higher level,  from  the  more  expensive
service levels to the less expensive,  but  more  important  primary  health
care levels, thereby enhancing  and  enabling  more  people  to  access  the
available  health  care  facilities.  The  steady  progress  made   by   the
department in this respect is reflected in the  growth  of  head  counts  at
clinics and community health centres. This has increased from  approximately
12,7 million in 1999-2000 to some 19,2 million patients in 2003- 2004.  What
this means is that the burden on hospitals is lessened, and this  translates
to shorter waiting times and  better  conditions  for  both  the  staff  and
patients.

Having said this, a lot of work still remains to be done. For  example,  the
province will require 200 clinics and community health centres and over  the
current MTF, but we are confident that with  the  support  of  the  national
department, we are up to the challenge. We  have  made  further  strides  in
increasing access to  our  health  services  through  our  community  health
worker network,  and  also  through  the  MSC  outreach  programme.  We  are
reaching more people  than  before,  and  striking  a  balance  between  our
primary health care and our curative services.  The  Inkosi  Albert  Luthuli
Central Hospital is a testimony to  this.  This  hospital  has  demonstrated
that our department is capable of being a leader by breaking  the  frontiers
of science and technology in order to enhance patient care and  support.  It
is the first public-private partnership health project in South Africa,  and
is already proving to be a success and landmark. It has given hope  to  many
people, and has shown that it is possible to get  world-class  state-of-the-
art health care in a Government institution. It is the most fitting  tribute
to Inkosi Albert Luthuli, one of our country's bravest sons. We are using  a
conditional grant from the national department to fund this facility.  As  a
good training facility it is an asset, not only to the  people  of  KwaZulu-
Natal, but also to those in some parts of the Eastern Cape and, indeed,  the
whole country. Thank you [Applause.]

Ms H LAMOELA: Hon Chair, hon Ministers, hon members  and  guests,  when  you
stand on the ground, you cannot see what shape the  earth  is,  but  if  you
were an astronaut in a spacecraft, you would be able to see that  the  earth
is round. I am sure we do not  want  to  be  astronauts  in  spacecrafts  to
identify from the sky the problems facing our country, but we  would  rather
like to believe what those on the ground predict. Therefore,  hon  Chair,  I
beg of you and the hon Minister Skweyiya to  please  consider  my  input  on
issues concerning child grants, foster care, disability grants and  old  age
pensions, especially in rural areas.

Agb Voorsitter, die welsyn van  al  ons  landsburgers  is  vir  die  DA  van
kardinale belang. Tot groot misnoë moes  ek  weer  eens  vind  dat  afsprake
rakende mediese  verslae  vir  aansoekers  by  plaaslike  distriksgeneeshere
reeds tot November 2004 vol bespreek is. Hierdie toedrag van sake is  uiters
kommerwekkend  en  veroorsaak  eindelose  ongerief  en  swaarkry   vir   die
aansoekers. Baie  van  hierdie  aansoekers  sterf  selfs  voordat  hulle  `n
toelaag  ontvang.  In  sommige   gevalle   word   toelae   gekanselleer   of
oorbetalings geskied sonder kennisgewing. Heraansoeke  veroorsaak  eindelose
probleme, soos lêers wat wegraak omdat alle kantore nog  nie  van  rekenaars
voorsien is nie.

Verdere implikasies is dat  agterstallige  gelde  wat  na  maande  uitbetaal
word, groot bedrae van byna R15 000 op `n keer beloop. Misbruik van  hierdie
geld vind op groot skaal plaas. Wetgewing bepaal dat toelae nie gebruik  mag
word om lenings by geldskieters aan te gaan nie, maar wel om mense  uit  hul
armoede te help. Ongelukkig verval mense dieper in armoede weens  die  groot
bedrae wat na maande uitbetaal  word,  omdat  geldskieters  uiteindelik  die
Regering  se  verantwoordelik  maande  lank  moes  dra.  Meer  doeltreffende
wetgewing rondom betaalstelsels wat deeglik gemonitor  of  gekontroleer  kan
word, moet ingestel word. Korrupsie in die departement behoort dan  ook  tot
`n groot mate uitgeskakel te word.

Wat  betref  pleegouersorg   en   kinderondersteuningstoelae,   maatskaplike
werkers neem veels te  lank  om  pleegouersorg  af  te  handel.  Uitgerekte,
tydrowende  prosedures  word  gevolg  en  uiteindelik  neem  selfs   hierdie
traumatiese proses maande om afgehandel te  word.  Maatskaplike  werkers  se
geduld word hier tot  die  ergste  graad  getoets,  en  dit  met  soms  baie
beperkte middele tot hul en die betrokkenes se beskikking.
In landelike gebiede word plase nie genoegsaam gedek nie, omdat areas  groot
is en `n beperkte aantal beamptes nie altyd toegang tot  sommige  plase  kan
bekom om sodoende geregtigheid aan betrokkenes te laat geskied nie.

Verlede jaar se instroming van bykans 48 000 persone  uit  ander  provinsies
na die Wes-Kaap oefen groot druk op die bestaande begroting vir welsyn  uit,
sowel as uitputting van amptenare wat sonder ekstra hulp  groot  werkladings
moet hanteer. Miskien moet hier na  bepaalde  oplossings  rondom  instroming
gekyk word wat kan verhoed dat die Wes-Kaap se  begroting  ernstig  uitgeput
word.

Die tydsduur vir goedkeuring van toelae moet  verkort  word.  Implementering
van wetgewing in provinsies moet gemonitor word om te verseker  dat  dienste
in al die provinsies toeganklik en van gehalte is om  sodoende  te  verseker
dat  instroming  na  bepaalde  provinsies  beperk  word,  want  dit  het  `n
uitwerking op hul begrotings.

Kindertoelae was `n paar jaar gelede tot die ouderdom van  18  en  selfs  in
sekere  gevalle  tot  21  jaar  betaalbaar,  sou  kinders   nog   skoolgaan.
[Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek  wil  my  verstout  om  te  sê  dat  ons  `n   kleiner
persentasie werkloosheid ervaar het - en vir u aandag, ek is nie `n  witmens
nie - en meer skoolgaande kinders gehad het. Ek herhaal, ek wil my  verstout
om te sê dat ons `n kleiner persentasie  werkloosheid  ervaar  het  en  meer
skoolgaande kinders gehad het.

Kindermishandeling en misdaad het onlangs geweldig toegeneem  en  daar  word
dus `n  beroep  gedoen  om  nou  reeds  te  kyk  na  `n  verhoging  van  die
ouderdomsgroep  vir  kindertoelae  vanaf   16   tot   18   jaar   vir   alle
bevolkingsgroepe sodat staatstoelaes  voorkoming  van  vroeë  skoolverlaters
kan  bewerkstellig.  Noudat  die  speelveld  van  kinderondersteuningstoelae
gelyk gemaak is,  moet  beter  beplanning  rondom  toeganklikheid  uitgewerk
word. Daar moet spesifiek gekyk  word  na  kinders  wat  aan  die  hoof  van
huishoudings  staan  wat,  omdat  hulle   minderjarig   is,   geensins   vir
ondersteuningstoelae kwalifiseer nie.

Verdowingsmiddels is besig om  ons  jeug  heeltemal  te  vernietig.  Dit  is
duidelik `n saak van dringendheid om die  voorkoming  van  hierdie  situasie
aan te spreek. Wat van 'n twee-en-'n-halfdag werkswinkel  van  die  Regering
se kant, in  samewerking  met  kerke,  skole  en  gemeeskapsorganisasies  om
hierdie probleem aan te spreek? Hierdie moet as `n uitroep van  gemeenskappe
aan die Regering gesien word sodat ons die jeug tot orde kan  roep,  voordat
ons  leiers  van  môre  totaal  vernietig  is.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, the wellbeing of all  of  our  country's  citizens  is  of
cardinal importance to the DA. To my dismay I once again had  to  find  that
appointments concerning medical reports  of  applicants  at  local  district
surgeons are already fully  booked  up  to  November  2004.  This  state  of
affairs gives great cause for concern and creates endless inconvenience  and
suffering for the applicants. Many of these applicants even die before  they
receive their grants. In certain cases grants are cancelled or  overpayments
take place without notification.  Reapplications  create  endless  problems,
like files getting lost because not all  offices  have  been  provided  with
computers yet.

Further implications are that overdue fees that are paid  out  after  months
amount to large sums of almost R15 000 at a  time.  Misuse  of  these  funds
takes place on a grand scale. Legislation determines that grants may not  be
used to make loans with moneylenders, but in fact  to  help  people  out  of
their poverty. Unfortunately people fall even further into  poverty  because
of the large amounts that are paid out after  months,  because  moneylenders
eventually  had  to  carry  Government's  responsibility  for  months.  More
effective legislation around  payment  systems  that  can  be  monitored  or
controlled properly must be introduced. Corruption in the department  should
also be eradicated to a great degree.

Regarding foster care and child support grants, social  workers  are  taking
far too long to conclude foster care. Drawn-out,  time-consuming  procedures
are being followed and eventually even this traumatic process  takes  months
to be concluded. Social workers' patience is being  tested  to  the  highest
degree, and this with often limited resources  available  to  them  and  the
people involved.

In rural areas farms are not sufficiently covered,  because  areas  are  too
large and a limited number of  officials  cannot  always  obtain  access  to
certain farms in order to do justice to the relevant parties.

Last year's influx of around 48 000 people from  other  provinces  into  the
Western Cape put a great  deal  of  pressure  on  the  existing  budget  for
welfare, and exhausted  officials  who  had  to  handle  enormous  workloads
without any extra assistance. Maybe specific solutions should be  looked  at
in this regard to prevent the Western Cape's  budget  from  being  seriously
exhausted.

The duration for the approval of grants must  be  shortened.  Implementation
of legislation must be monitored to ensure that services  in  all  provinces
are accessible and of quality in order to ensure that the influx to  certain
provinces is limited, because it affects their budgets.

A few years ago child grants were payable up to the age of 18  and  even  in
certain cases up to 21 years, provided the children were  still  at  school.
[Interjections.] I want to make so bold as to  say  that  we  experienced  a
smaller percentage of unemployment - and for your  attention,  I  am  not  a
white person - and had more children attending school. I repeat, I  want  to
make so bold as to say that we had a smaller percentage of unemployment  and
had more children attending school.
Child abuse and crime have recently escalated tremendously and an appeal  is
being made now already to look at an increase in the  age  group  for  child
grants from 16 years to 18 years for all population  groups  so  that  state
grants could curb the early school leavers. Now that the  playing  field  of
child  support  grants  have  been  made  level,  better   planning   around
accessibility should be worked out. Specific attention  should  be  paid  to
children who are heads of  their  households,  and  who,  because  they  are
underage, do not qualify for support grants at all.

Drugs are destroying our  youth  completely.  Clearly  it  is  a  matter  of
urgency to address the prevention of this situation. What about a two and  a
half-day workshop by the Government, in co-operation with churches,  schools
and community organisations to address this problem? This should be seen  as
an outcry from communities to the Government so that we can call  the  youth
to order, before our leaders of tomorrow are completely destroyed.]
Prevention of drugs should not only become headlines  during  the  month  of
June, but every minute of every day. One of the critical areas  will  be  to
enhance access by the youth to opportunities and poverty relief  programmes,
especially those that are focused on early childhood development, and  home-
and community-based care  for  those  infected  and  affected  by  HIV/Aids.
Registering disabled children and adults for social  grants  is  a  critical
part of the overall  strategy,  for  improving  the  lives  of  people  with
disabilities. Allow me to congratulate Minister Skweyiya when he said,  "Our
democracy will only have meaning if it takes care of  the  most  vulnerable,
including people  with  disabilities".  So  often  we  tend  to  forget  the
difficulties they encounter day after day. We should lend a hand  to  ensure
that people with disabilities have adequate access to services  like  social
grants and job opportunities, and make  sure  that  the  stigma  that  still
exists  regarding  disabilities  is  removed.  The  abuse  of  the  elderly,
especially  pensioners,  at  pay  points  is  of  great  concern.  Kan   die
verskillende  departemente  miskien  vir  ons  aandui  watter  projekte   of
strategieë in plek is om ons bejaardes met meer  waardigheid  en  respek  te
hanteer en bedien? [Could  the  various  departments  possibly  give  us  an
indication of what projects or strategies are in place for dealing with  and
serving our elderly with more dignity and respect?]

What happened to the commission - and I speak under correction  -  that  was
appointed in 2000 or 2002 to look at  challenges  and  opportunities  facing
the Department of Social Development? If we were to look critically at  what
the Government claims to have achieved, and if we were to face  the  serious
problems that still remain, we would at least be aware that  mere  word  and
symbolic gestures are only a tiny step forward. However,  I  would  like  to
take the opportunity of congratulating our Minister on the progress  already
made. Sustainable human development requires building the capacity of  human
beings, and  providing  opportunities  for  them  to  access  resources  for
development.

The Democratic Alliance is committed to policies that provide the people  of
our country with the best possible  health  care  because,  along  with  the
opportunities to work, protection of persons  and  property  and  access  to
quality education and health  care  are  essential  to  the  creation  of  a
healthy society and country. Accordingly, I commend  the  Minister  and  the
department  on  their   achievements,   particularly   on   increasing   the
immunisation coverage for all, eliminating death as  a  result  of  measles,
the progress that has been made towards South Africa being  declared  polio-
free and on the successful campaign against malaria. Well done, Minister!

The Government promised in November last year that 53 000  people  would  be
receiving antiretroviral treatment by March this year. March came and  went,
and according to a response to a Parliamentary question asked,  a  total  of
only 3 667 people were receiving  antiretrovirals.  The  greatest  challenge
which is facing the public health  care  sector  today  is  the  attraction,
training and retention of skilled health care professionals.  Should  we  be
lucky enough to enjoy a perfect legislative framework, health care  delivery
on the ground is impossible without motivated committed and skilled  people.
One would hope that our Government does not implement the system purely  for
the sake of delivery, but would look at a unique system that could work  for
the better  distribution  of  our  services  so  that  health  care  can  be
accessible to all citizens of our country. I thank you. [Applause]

Dr B GOQWANA (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  members  of  the
NCOP, delegates and colleagues, as a new  old  MEC,  I  want  to  thank  our
Minister for and congratulate her on the way in which we have  been  working
for the past five years. It is indeed a privilege and an honour  to  address
you on behalf of the department of health in the Eastern Cape.  It  is  very
fitting to scan the road that we have travelled during the  past  10  years.
Yet, I must be quick to say, though I am going to mention  the  things  that
we have achieved during the past 10 years,  we  have  not  yet  reached  our
destination. There are definitely still many challenges ahead.

In the Eastern Cape we combined three administrations,  which  actually  led
to a situation where our administration was affected in a negative way  with
a lot of backlogs that we had to look into. However, for the first  time  in
the past 10 years, the department of health in the Eastern Cape  managed  to
get an unqualified audit report, which revealed to  us  that  our  financial
management is actually very good, and that we managed to  live  within  what
we had been given - not that I want to say that everything  was  right,  but
what I'm saying is that we managed to stay within what we were given.

We have dealt head-on with the inequities in the province, and this we  have
achieved by actually building more than 153 clinics  in  areas  where  there
have never been facilities before.  This  has  changed  the  situation  from
where we had one facility per 100 000 people, to a situation where  we  have
one facility per 10 000 people, which is according to the  standard  of  the
World Health Organisation. However, I must  be  quick  to  say  that  though
we've got one facility per 10 000 people, we still have a  problem,  because
most of the clinics are actually concentrated in urban areas. So,  we  still
have a very big challenge in actually making sure that some  facilities  are
moved out to rural areas.

We have been working on building clinics and getting  into  areas  where  we
were not able to go to before, but according to our statistics it  seems  as
if we are worse off than before. This is not  because  things  are  becoming
worse, but because people who were not  part  of  our  statistics,  are  now
coming forward and becoming part of our statistics.  We  think  some  things
are definitely going to change after some time.

Probably, the analogy to this is that when a practitioner treats  a  patient
with an amoebic liver abscess. The first week that  one  gives  him  or  her
laser  treatment,  the  amoebic  liver  abscess  becomes  big;  and  as  one
continues to treat him or her, within a week, it  then  starts  going  down.
So, if you're somebody who does not have confidence in  what  you're  doing,
you might think that things are getting worse when they're actually  getting
better.

In the Eastern Cape we've  tried  to  do  away  with  the  racially  divided
institutions and we've managed to put them together. A very good example  is
the PE complex where we have one complex, where whites and  Africans  go  to
the hospital nearest to where they live, and the services  are  given  in  a
way that would satisfy the population, rather than  satisfy  certain  racial
groups.
We've employed chief executive officers at our  institutions.  These  people
are not medical professionals. These people were appointed because they  are
able to manage those institutions, and that has  actually  borne  some  good
fruits. We've done away with emergency  services  that  were  controlled  by
urban-based local authorities, and we have made  it  a  provincial  task  to
make sure that those ambulances belong to the province. Though  it  has  its
teething problems, we are actually doing well.

I'm sure you're very much aware that Eastern Cape is one  of  the  provinces
that has experienced circumcision deaths since 1995, not  that  it  has  not
happened before, but this ANC-led Government took note  and  has  made  sure
that it is not going to happen again. It has been haunting  us  since  1995,
but since we have had the Application of  Health  Standards  in  Traditional
Circumcision Act, Act 6 of 2001, the statistics have started decreasing.  It
does not mean that we're happy when one child dies, or when one child  loses
his  manhood,  but  we  are  saying  that  the  statistics  have  definitely
decreased.

Still in the Eastern Cape,  we've  managed  to  control  diseases  that  are
related to poor sanitation and lack of water. We've managed to control  them
despite the  fact  that  we  still  have  many  backlogs  as  far  as  these
conditions are concerned. As has  been  mentioned  before,  the  new  Nelson
Mandela Academic Hospital has been completed and  has  started  functioning.
We are only waiting for it to be officially opened. In Mount Frere there  is
a big hospital that is about to be completed, and that  has  been  built  by
this Government. [Applause.] In Tsolo there is  a  hospital  that  is  being
improved. We are actually trying to revamp the old hospital that  is  there.
There is no doubt that this would make the lives of our  people,  especially
in the rural areas, far better than it was before.

Obviously, the more we manage our budget properly, the  more  it's  becoming
clear that there is a bit of underfunding on what we are actually doing.  We
need to have some norms and standards as to how to fund this  while  looking
at the institutional backlogs that we have in the Eastern Cape.

I must mention that our infant mortality rate in the Eastern Cape  is  still
the highest in the country, but it's not very difficult to  understand  why,
because if one looks at  the  fertility  in  rural  areas,  it  is  actually
higher. If you look at those rural areas, that's where most of the kids  are
looked after by the mother  only,  where  the  father  is  actually  working
somewhere else, or is not even part of the family. Another  factor  is  that
we have extended families, where kids are born elsewhere  and  sent  to  the
rural areas. These are some of the things that  are  actually  haunting  us.
There is no doubt that these are the things that we are looking at.

The other challenge that we do have in the Eastern Cape is  that  we  are  a
labour-reservoir province. By this I mean that when young men and women  are
contributing to the economy, they go and work in the richer  provinces,  and
when they become inactive, they are sent back.  I  am  being  reminded  that
some of them are  sitting  here.  [Laughter.]  When  they  become  sick  and
inactive they are sent back to the Eastern Cape, and  we  actually  take  on
that burden of looking after  them.  Obviously,  they  would  be  using  the
public health facilities. [Laughter.] That's why we  are  building  so  many
hospitals in the Eastern Cape, and that's the reason why I  am  quite  happy
with our Minister and the relationship that we've had.

However, we still have the problem of staff shortages but, as  the  Minister
has said, there is going to be community service, even for nurses. We  think
this will go a very long way in assisting  us,  especially  in  those  rural
areas where nobody wants to go.

We need to look at interprovincial inequities. Laws should not just be  made
without regard to the rural character of our province, as it is the  key  to
actually make sure that people are taken care of.

After revamping our clinics and rebuilding our hospitals,  what  has  become
very clear is that the quality of care that is given in  those  institutions
is not up to standard. We have noticed it,  and  we  are  devising  ways  of
making sure that it is going to be managed properly.

We still have a very big challenge regarding the stealing of drugs,  but  we
do have strategies to make sure that that is going  to  be  controlled.  The
fact that we have managed to move thus far,  despite  the  rough  road  that
we've travelled, means that even the challenges that I've mentioned are  not
going to be a problem for us. We will make sure that we sort them  out.  All
that is needed is patience and an understanding of the direction into  which
we are trying to move. Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, MECs, special delegates and  hon
members of the  House,  I  want  to  congratulate  the  Ministers  on  their
reappointments and the Deputy Ministers and MECs on their appointments,  and
also our chairperson of the select committee. I know that they will do  well
in their portfolios, and I wish them strength during their terms of office.

Min mense sal met my verskil wanneer ek sê dat goeie gesondheid 'n  mens  se
grootste bate is. Dis  iets  wat  ons  soos  'n  kleinood  moet  beskerm  en
vertroetel. Daar is natuurlik ook duisende mense wat nie die voorreg het  om
goeie gesondheid te geniet nie. Dit is veral  vir  hulle  wat  'n  goeie  en
beskikbare gesondheidsdiens noodsaaklik is.

Mense vra hoekom ons  dan  so  'n  groot  TB-probleem  het.  Dit  is  vandag
blykbaar nog nie heeltemal duidelik nie, maar dis waarskynlik  te  wyte  aan
'n hele paar oorsake. Deel van die oplossing lê by die mense self. Dit  blyk
dat mense in Suid-Afrika om die een of ander onverklaarbare rede  meer  laks
is om hulle as teringlyers aan te meld. Dit plaas 'n geweldige  las  op  die
gesondheidsdiens, want hoe langer mense  versuim  om  hulle  siekte  aan  te
meld, hoe meer mense word besmet. Nog 'n probleem  is  dat  teringlyers  nie
die herstelprogram van ses tot agt maande voltooi nie.  Mense  wat  nie  die
kursus voltooi nie, hoofsaaklik omdat hulle al ná enkele maande beter  voel,
kan 'n terugslag beleef en weer van vooraf die siekte versprei.

Dis 'n onbenydenswaardige taak wat op die skouers van  ons  gesondheidsdiens
rus en dis die plig van al ons mense in die land om meer teringbewus  op  te
tree en hulle by die eerste  tekens  van  moontlike  tering  by  die  naaste
kliniek aan te meld. Ingeval mense nog huiwer, kan  ek  net  sê  dat  tering
behandelbaar is, dat die behandeling gratis is en dat dit maklik genees  kan
word indien mense  hulle  by  die  voorskrifte  hou.  As  die  tekens  egter
verontagsaam word, word dit soos 'n veldbrand deur die teringlyer  versprei,
en gewoonlik onder die mense vir wie hy of sy die meeste omgee.

Ons almal weet dat armoede orals 'n negatiewe  invloed  het,  veral  op  die
gebied van maatskaplike ontwikkeling. Alkohol maai die meeste onder ons  arm
mense, waar dit die grootste negatiewe invloed het.  Daar  is  verskeie  arm
gebiede, insluitende informele nedersettings en plattelandse  gebiede,  waar
veral seisoenwerkers 'n bestaan probeer  maak.  Dit  gaan  nie  net  om  die
verbrokkeling van huisgesinne of die nog groter  verarming  van  mense  nie,
maar veral oor die maatskaplike probleme wat dit skep. Baie  van  ons  mense
kry hierdie staatstoelae van die Regering, maar sodra hy of sy dit  ontvang,
gaan dit aan die smokkelaar of geldlener,  en  die  kinders  of  familie  ly
daaronder.

Ek wil die Ministers en LUR'e vra om nie  ook  hierdie  grootste  uitdagings
wat op antwoorde en oplossings wag te vergeet nie.  Ordentlike  voeding  vir
ons mense  is  noodsaaklik.  Arm  mense  kan  dit  die  minste  bekostig  om
staatstoelaes aan drank en dwelms  te  bestee.  (Translations  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Few people will disagree with me when I  say  that  good  health  is  one's
greatest asset. It is something that which  we  should  protect  and  pamper
like a treasure. There are, of course, thousands of people who do  not  have
the privilege of enjoying good health. It is for those,  particularly,  that
a good and available health care service is necessary.

People ask why do we have such a big TB problem. It is  apparently  not  all
that clear today, but it  could  probably  be  attributed  to  quite  a  few
causes. Part of the solution lies  with  the  people  themselves.  It  would
appear that people in South Africa, for some or other  inexplicable  reason,
are more negligent in declaring themselves  as  sufferers  of  tuberculosis.
This places a tremendous strain on the  health  care  service,  because  the
longer people take to report their illness, the greater  number  people  are
infected. Another problem is that tuberculosis patients do not complete  the
recovery programme of six to eight months. People who do  not  complete  the
course, mostly because they feel better after a few months, could  suffer  a
relapse and can spread the illness all over again.

It is the unenviable task that rests on the shoulders  of  our  health  care
services and it the duty of all our people in the country to be  more  aware
of tuberculosis, and to report to their nearest clinic at  the  first  signs
of possible tuberculosis. If people are still hesitant, then may I say  that
tuberculosis can be treated, that treatment is free and that  it  is  easily
cured if people keep  to  the  prescriptions.  If  the  signs  are  ignored,
however, it spreads  like  wildfire  throughout,  and  usually  amongst  the
people for whom he or she cares the most.

We all know that poverty has a negative influence  everywhere,  particularly
in the area of social development. Alcohol takes a heavy  toll  amongst  our
poor people, where  it  has  the  greatest  negative  influence.  There  are
several poor areas including informal settlements  and  rural  areas,  where
particularly the seasonal workers try to make  a  living.  It  is  not  only
about the crumbling of  families  or  the  even  greater  impoverishment  of
people, but especially about the social problems that it  creates.  Many  of
our people receive these social grants from the Government, but as  soon  as
he or she receives it, it goes to  the  merchant  or  moneylender,  and  the
children or family suffer because of this.

I want  to  ask  the  Ministers  and  MECs  not  to  forget  these  greatest
challenges that await answers and solutions. Proper feeding  of  our  people
is essential. Poor people can least afford to spend their  grants  on  drink
and drugs.]

It is clear that the Ministers and MECs have a tough  job  to  do  and  that
they not only need our full support, but also the support of the  public  to
deliver on the people's contract for a better South Africa for all. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Dr  B  T  BUTHELEZI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy
Ministers, members of this honourable House, ladies and gentlemen,  KwaZulu-
Natal  welcomes  the  implementation  of  the  R500  million  scarce  skills
allowance, which is aimed at  retaining  doctors  and  other  scarce  skills
health professionals in the public sector, especially if this allowance  can
become a permanent part of a new salary package for health professionals.

The increment of 22% in the annual salaries of health professionals  working
in rural areas, as much as 37% more for those in  deep  rural  areas,  is  a
major step in the right direction, although it will not solve  all  problems
overnight. However, certain groups of health workers are excluded  from  the
scarce skills and rural allowances granted to public-sector  employees.  The
department would do well to include  more  categories  of  professionals  to
benefit from these allowances and to clarify the position  of  professionals
who fall in the senior management services group. This  is  because  various
provinces  interpret  the  agreement  with  respect   to   the   SMS   group
differently. For instance, Gauteng and the Western Cape have indicated  that
health professionals in the SMS category  who  perform  clinical  work  will
definitely receive scarce skills allowances.

The department, which is  the  biggest  employer  of  health  professionals,
should  address  the  new  legislation  disallowing   public-sector   health
professionals from claiming tax rebates  for  registration  fees,  indemnity
premiums and other subscriptions through negotiations with  the  SA  Revenue
Service and the Finance department.

According to the state of the world's population report released in  October
2003, neglect and  underfunding  of  adolescents'  sexual  and  reproductive
health needs are some of the problems perpetuating the spread  of  HIV/Aids,
other  STDs  and  early  pregnancy.  The  report  explores  the   underlying
assumptions about HIV/Aids showing that youths who have lost  parents  owing
to HIV/Aids, are themselves particularly vulnerable to  infection.  This  is
of particularly serious concern in KZN where most  families  are  headed  by
children, and educational programmes, such as LoveLife,  need  some  serious
funding. This report also recommends that more money  should  be  channelled
into reproductive health programmes.

The department should also  consider  offering  financial  support  for  the
national HIV/Aids database, such as the one that is being  compiled  by  the
Centre for HIV/Aids Networking at the University of  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the
Centre for Health Systems Research and Development at the University of  the
Free State. Once complete, this database will provide Government and  donors
with information on HIV/Aids-related activities in South Africa.

As the Minister said in her speech, the department should actively  consider
recruiting foreign qualified health professionals to fill the vacant  posts,
especially in rural areas such as those  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  The  department
should also provide  up-to-date  information  on  the  new  pay  progression
incentive policy and a uniform performance measurement tool for use  by  all
provinces.

We support the introduction of a new level of  health  care  workers,  which
was agreed to on 8 January 2004 at the Minmec, with  the  aim  of  selecting
the first students in September 2004 and enrolling them in 2005.
The aims of the mid-level medical worker  for  South  Africa  are  supported
because  young  people  from  rural  areas  who  completed  matric  will  be
recruited and trained to serve their communities.

We also welcome the efforts by the department to introduce  telemedicine  in
hospitals, because this has proven to be an  effective  tool  in  attracting
health professionals to rural areas such as Nkonjeni Hospital in KZN,  where
doctors can access academic teaching from  such  institutions  as  the  King
Edward VIII Hospital and Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital.

The department is  doing  a  sterling  job  on  the  expanded  programme  on
immunisation. Meeting the deadline  for  the  declaration  of  South  Africa
being polio-free by 2005 will be an example of  this  achievement.  However,
the recent outbreak of polio in neighbouring Botswana  should  encourage  us
to be vigilant enough and support health care professionals who are  at  the
forefront of the war on polio in terms of immunisation.

KwaZulu-Natal is proud to have put  together  a  proposal  for  funding  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S T BELOT (Free State):  Chairperson,  Ministers  of  Health  and  Social
Development, members of the National Council of Provinces, hon  members,  as
we proudly celebrate 10 years of  democracy  and  freedom,  I  am  proud  to
announce that the  Free  State  Health  department  has  again  taken  great
strides to improve access to quality health services, despite the  challenge
of rising health costs and increasing demands for health care.

Poverty,  the  lack  of  shelter,  the  lack  of  safer  water,  a  lack  of
sanitation, poor nutrition and the lack of education expose  our  people  to
ill health. Unhealthy people cannot contribute to the economy. The  role  of
the health system is to provide a better health status  for  the  community,
in fairness and with  access  to  health  services  based  on  the  people's
expectations. Health services are not  just  about  curative  services,  but
also about health promotion, prevention of ill health and rehabilitation.

Many positive advances have been made in health  care  in  the  province.  I
wish to share with this House that our people enjoy better access to  health
care than ever before. The achievements are as  a  result  of  thorough  and
proper planning by both the national and the provincial health  departments.
Allow me to share some of the achievements of the Department of Health,  and
let me remind the members that as we celebrate, the celebration  of  the  10
years are based on what we said to the people of South Africa 10 years  ago.
We said in our manifesto that we would promote safe motherhood  and  play  a
major role in  caring  for  the  nation's  children  through  programmes  of
immunisation, nutrition and free health care for children younger than  five
years. We also said we would  introduce  measures  to  make  medicines  more
affordable. We also said we would direct major resources  at  combating  TB,
Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases, cancer and other  plagues.  We
also committed that we  would  facilitate  the  integration  of  traditional
health practice. After the 1994 elections, the national and  the  provincial
departments did not hesitate to take up  these  challenges.  The  policy  of
primary health care was implemented, free health  care  for  pregnant  women
and children under five was implemented, and we have  seen  that  the  first
step towards accessible comprehensive primary health care services was  also
introduced. Free health care for all was available by July 1996.

The primary school nutrition programme was launched as a  presidentially-led
programme in 1994, with a total of R321 million spent in our  province.  The
immunisation  programme  was  expanded  and  changed  to  be  in  line  with
international trends. Immunisation  campaigns  were  conducted  annually  to
prevent mortality and morbidity due to preventable diseases.  Through  these
interventions, we in the Free  State  province  are  now  at  the  point  of
declaring the province polio free. Prevention campaigns to  combat  HIV/Aids
were implemented. A  new  tuberculosis  control  programme  was  introduced.
Bacteriological diagnosis of tuberculosis was introduced. The policy on  the
syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections was  introduced  and
it resulted in lower rates of neonatal syphilis.

The province, in partnership with the Cancer Association  of  South  Africa,
implemented a mobile  service  to  screen  women  for  cervical  and  breast
cancer. The province and the Department of Health  commenced  a  process  to
organise traditional healers in the province.

In 1999, we committed ourselves to speed up the delivery of basic needs.  We
promised to develop a  comprehensive,  affordable  and  accessible  national
public health system. This will be financed  in  part  by  a  social  health
insurance programme. We promised that the Government  would  improve  health
care by improving the availability of  doctors  and  nurses,  especially  in
clinics  and  the  rural  areas.  We   committed   ourselves   to   ensuring
availability of affordable medicines in line with our national drug  policy.
We agreed to improve the management of hospitals and clinics with  community
participation. We  said  we  would  act  decisively  to  attack  preventable
illnesses through, among others, our immunisation  programmes  and  measures
to combat TB and develop campaigns against drug, tobacco and alcohol  abuse.
In partnership with all sectors of society, we said  that  Government  would
continue to give absolute  priority  to  HIV/Aids  programmes  by  increased
efforts to mobilise popular awareness of the seriousness of the epidemic.

The province has achieved these objectives.  The  department  has  increased
the number of doctors and health professionals, especially  in  rural  areas
by expanding the  Cuban  doctors'  programme  and  implementing  a  one-year
community service programme for doctors and dentists, which was extended  to
10 professional occupational groups.

The province spent R4,6 million for the first phase of  implementing  salary
parity for primary health care workers  employed  by  local  government,  to
encourage them to stay in small towns and in rural areas. A rural  allowance
and a scarce skill allowance to  recruit  and  retain  health  professionals
were introduced in July 2003 at  a  cost  of  about  R18  million.  We  have
improved the availability of medicines by  introducing  the  essential  drug
list, training  primary  health  care  nurses  in  drug  supply  management,
training pharmacy assistants and outsourcing the distribution of  medicines.
Hospital management was improved by the  implementation  of  the  Provincial
Hospital Act, resulting in the appointment of chief executive  officers  and
the establishment of hospital boards.
The hospitals were grouped into complexes and those  that  required  focused
attention, such as the Mofumahadi, Mmanapo, Mopedi and  Katle  hospitals  in
Qwaqwa,  successfully  underwent  organisational   performance   improvement
interventions.

The integrated  management  of  childhood  illnesses  was  implemented.  The
immunisation  coverage   increased   to   78%   last   year.   Through   the
implementation of the Dot-system, the  new  senior  positive  TB  cure  rate
doubled to more than 70% last year. The department established  the  alcohol
and drug abuse research  and  prevention  centre  to  combat  the  abuse  of
alcohol and drugs. Educators and high school  learners  were  provided  with
training on the combat of alcohol and drug abuse.

I wish to share with this House that the Free State province has  again  met
all the commitments it made. I need to share just a few of these: we in  the
province aim to reduce the death of women during pregnancy  and  childbirth,
because these deaths can largely be avoided. The confidential  enquiry  into
maternal deaths and  the  notification  of  any  death  of  a  woman  during
pregnancy and childbirth were made  compulsory.  Treatment  guidelines  were
developed and implemented  to  deal  with  the  common  causes  of  maternal
deaths, as reported in the saving mother's report.  Studies  were  conducted
on the causes of deaths of  pregnant  women  while  under  anaesthesia.  The
availability  of  emergency  drugs  and  blood  was   improved.   Additional
equipment has been procured, and medical officers are being trained  in  the
provision of spinal anaesthesia.

The 150 reported maternal deaths in 2003 are higher than  the  107  reported
in 2002. This is due to better reporting of such deaths, and the  impact  of
the  HIV/Aids  pandemic.  With  regard  to  infrastructure  ...  Thank  you,
Chairperson. We support the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon Ministers, Deputy Ministers, MECs  present
here today, the ANC has  been  concerned  for  quite  some  time  about  the
widespread implications of HIV/Aids pandemic. In fact, on  the  occasion  of
the 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in  1997,  we  as  an  organisation
felt compelled to formulate and adopt a strongly worded  resolution  on  the
pandemic. We noted, for example, that over 2 million people in South  Africa
were HIV-positive; that it constituted about 10% of HIV infections  in  sub-
Saharan Africa; that HIV/Aids is linked to the socioeconomic status  of  our
communities,  in  particular  poverty,  the  lack  of  decent  housing   and
unemployment, and that  secrecy,  ignorance  and  myths  about  the  disease
contribute to its spread.

At the time the  ANC  was  also  concerned  that  the  Aids  epidemic  would
massively impact on  our  economy,  and  would  impact  socially  with  more
orphans and loss of breadwinners - and on the health services.  We  resolved
then, amongst other things, that the ANC at all  levels  would  support  the
efforts and programmes of Government for the prevention  of  the  spread  of
the disease. Particularly in the life skills  training  programme  aimed  at
schools, the ANC will design and lead a programme on Aids  awareness,  which
includes spreading  correct  information  about  the  disease,  training  of
counsellors, helping to overcome the stigma  associated  with  the  disease,
work against the stigmatation and discrimination of people with HIV/Aids  in
all spheres of life and support the Cabinet decision on  notifying  partners
and family, as well as the anonymous  notification  of  HIV-positive  status
for statistical and planning purposes.

In 2002, at our 51st Conference, we again passed a  resolution,  essentially
confirming our 1997 resolutions, and  adding  the  need  to  strengthen  and
accelerate the implementation of the national Aids  strategy,  as  amplified
in the Cabinet statement of 17 April 2002. We emphasised again the  need  to
root out discrimination and stigmatation, but we did not limit it  to  those
who were infected, but incorporated those who were affected, Our  resolution
took on  board  the  value  of  psychosocial  support,  providing  essential
medical care, providing support to families caring for  people  living  with
Aids, as well as orphans and developing effective workplace programmes.

The role of the community was not neglected in that we built in the need  to
develop community capacity to respond to  the  pandemic  through  home-based
care initiatives  and  by  strengthening  broad  antipoverty  and  community
development programmes. The Department of Health, through the Medicines  and
Related Substances Control Act,  has  been  attempting  to  bring  down  the
prices of medicines, especially the vital antiretrovirals needed  to  assist
in the control of HIV/Aids. This  transformative  legislation  unfortunately
caused large pharmaceutical organisations  to  fight  very  expensive  legal
battles with the department in an attempt to preserve the patent  rights  to
medication and, in turn, to maintain their profits to the detriment  of  the
health of the HIV/Aids sufferers.

The most recent  attempts  by  Government  to  control  the  exit  price  of
medicines through regulations in terms of sections 22(g)  of  the  Medicines
and Related Substances Act have met with a  similar  outcry  as  a  parallel
importation debate. An amount of R4,4  million  was  allocated  to  the  new
pharmaceutical  functions   contained   in   the   implementation   of   the
comprehensive HIV/Aids care management and treatment operational plan.

In the meanwhile the research to find a cure to Aids  continues  to  require
funding in the race against time for those infected and already  dying  from
the syndrome. The SA Medical Research  Council  is  currently  conducting  a
number of leading vaccine  development  research  programmes  together  with
international partners. An amount of R9,6  million  will  be  set  aside  to
upgrade the building of the medical bureau for occupational  diseases.  More
indirectly there has been a host of challenges from those who  believe  that
the department is not doing anything or taking too long to deliver  on  Aids
drugs, treatment and care. The most dramatic of this has  been  the  intense
debate in the media about the root cause of  HIV/Aids,  with  all  political
parties and interested groups getting on the bandwagon of what to do,  where
to do it and how fast to do it.

In our robust South Africa political system, even bad press is good  because
it serves to bring the serious issue of a killer disease  to  the  forefront
of people's minds and forces them to face the pandemic head-on, rather  than
hidden in the back closets in the privacy of people homes.

The ANC is particularly impressed with the roll-out  of  the  antiretroviral
treatment  at  public  facilities  because  it  significantly  extends   the
Government's HIV/Aids prevention, treatment and care  programme.  Strategies
in  the  comprehensive  progress  include   mother   to   child   prevention
programmes. In view of our own belief in  the  importance  of  removing  the
stigma of HIV/Aids, the ANC applauds the  fact  that  voluntary  counselling
and testing is available at approximately 2 000 sites across all  provinces.
Needless to say, the  department  is  to  be  commended  for  its  increased
allocation  to  the  fund  to  implement  the  comprehensive  HIV/Aids  care
management and treatment  operational  plan.  In  the  2004-2005  Budget  an
allocation of R300  million  will  be  given  to  the  provinces  through  a
conditional grant and will increase to R600 million in  the  year  2005-2006
and to R1 billion in 2006-2007.

We believe that as the ruling party we are still on  track  to  ensure  that
the framework outlined  in  our  conference  resolutions  are  implement  by
Government. Other Government departments, such as the Department  of  Public
Service and Administration employing  about  1,1  million  public  servants,
initiated the impact and action project in January 2000 as  a  comprehensive
plan to manage HIV/Aids in  the  Public  Service  and  had  at  least  three
indabas since then. Similarly,  the  Department  of  Transport  has  had  an
HIV/Aids programme on the transport sector, discussing issues such  as  risk
behaviour of truckers and  the  regularity  of  condom  usage,  among  other
things.

The ANC is not prepared to take a back seat in  the  face  of  the  HIV/Aids
pandemic. We believe in everyone getting involved in solving  this  problem.
We support the Minister of Health and the Minister of Social Development  in
their initiatives  to  bring  relief  to  the  people  suffering  from  this
pandemic. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms S E LUCAS (Northern Cape):  Dankie,  agb  Voorsitter,  agb  Ministers  en
Adjunkministers hier teenwoordig, agb LUR'e, lede  van  die  Nasionale  Raad
van  Provinsies,  dames  en  here  ...  [Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson,  hon
Ministers and Deputy  Ministers  present  hre,  hon  MECs,  members  of  the
National Council of Provinces, ladies and gentlemen ...]  it  is  indeed  an
honour to participate in the debate on social  development  and  to  present
this House with the developments that are  taking  place  in  this  critical
sector in the Northern Cape province. However, before I  begin,  I  have  to
acknowledge the role our national Minister and his  department  are  playing
in alleviating the burden of poverty in poor and disadvantaged communities.

This Government has, over the past decade, taken steps to  bring  equity  to
the social security system to ensure that our officials and  other  partners
serve our people with dignity and respect. The Northern Cape is the  largest
province and it has a thinly-spread population of 822 000 inhabitants.  This
scenario makes service delivery extremely costly and  challenges  Government
continuously to strengthen its commitment to bring services to the people.

The economy of the province is largely  based  on  mining  and  agricultural
activities. A large portion of  our  population  depends  on  Government  to
provide services such as health care, social services,  basic  services  and
other related social services. This has, over the past decade,  put  a  huge
strain on the services of government and its budget - which is the  smallest
of all the nine provinces. Social delivery has, for the past decade, been  a
priority of this Government, and R20 billion has been spent on  this  sector
since 1994 and up to 2003.

The department of social services and  population  development  has  made  a
policy shift since 1994 in making  services  more  available,  as  mentioned
earlier. To this end, we moved away from just  providing  curative  services
to also providing developmental services.  Forty  district  offices  and  20
satellite offices were established to realise this aim. Through  partnership
with Transnet, we were able to establish three more sites, which brings  the
total to 23 satellite offices. Communities like Delportshoop, Brandvlei  and
Phuthanang will now have access  to  services,  thanks  to  the  efforts  of
Transnet and our national Minister.

The department, through other strategic partnerships, has  obtained  various
benefits for the poor and the vulnerable. Eskom  has  donated  food  to  the
needy and, as  already  mentioned,  Transnet  donated  containers  worth  R7
million to be used, not only as offices, but also as drop-in centres in  the
whole  of  the  Sol  Plaatjie  municipal  area.  We  are  also  engaged   in
partnerships with Correctional Services.  They  are  supplying  the  drop-in
centres with vegetables and raised R15 000 for  poverty  alleviation,  which
they donated to the department.

The twinning  agreement  with  the  Swedish  government  to  exchange  best-
practice models for residential care  is  progressing  well.  These  include
information management  systems,  therapeutic  and  specialised  programmes.
Over the next five years, we need to address  some  of  the  new  challenges
that have emerged in our society. Some of these relate  to  income  security
whilst others relate to the wellbeing of  families  and  the  individual  in
society.

Over the next decade, we will work together with our partners in the  social
sector in repairing the social sector of  our  society.  Together  with  the
moral regeneration movement, we will promote basic moral  values  among  all
our inhabitants in the province. We must  remember  that  moral  values  are
embedded in society by family values. The  department  will  thus  focus  on
rebuilding the family and will ensure  that  rebuilding  the  lives  of  the
youth and vulnerable families is a priority.

As  part  of  this  commitment,  the  province   will   also   oversee   the
establishment of an in-patient treatment facility for  substance  abuse.  We
all know that the  Northern  Cape  faces  serious  challenges  in  terms  of
alcohol  and  substance  abuse,  and  also  child  abuse  and  interpersonal
violence. The 10-point plan of the department will be  the  policy  paradigm
within which all programmes will be implemented. The rebuilding  of  family,
community and social relations can only occur when children are nurtured  in
a wholesome environment and are taught norms and  values  by  the  community
and family in which they live.

The family is a place where the rights of the  child  are  given  focus  and
content, after  all.  Today,  the  opposite  is  happening  -  families  are
disintegrating. This year we are celebrating the International Year  of  the
Family. A provincial summit will be held to  develop  a  long-term  strategy
for families in collaboration  with  the  Moral  Regeneration  Movement,  in
order to ensure that  we  embark  on  specific  programmes  to  achieve  our
objectives.

This year, also, the department will embark  on  a  roll-out  of  community-
based child protection programmes for which R22 million has been  allocated.
Family preservation and parental guidance will also be implemented. For  the
first time we will be embarking on parental guidance programmes,  especially
reaching out to younger parents. Fifteen more  early  childhood  development
centres will be established to add to the already 164  funded  centres.  The
province is also increasing the subsidy  to  daycare  centres,  as  well  as
services centres.

In terms of an integrated poverty eradication strategy,  we  all  know  that
that is dependent on an integrated economic development  strategy.  We  have
to ensure that our people become self-sustainable. Poverty alleviation is  a
short-term strategy. Our poverty  eradication  strategy  is  integrated  and
comprehensive. It allows for the  establishment  of  drop-in  centres,  food
emergency schemes and economic  empowerment  programmes.  Forty-one  drop-in
centres have been established so far and 25 new ones will be established  in
this financial year.
The establishment  of  a  comprehensive  security  system  must  reduce  the
dependency on noncontributory cash payments. We welcome the  fact  that  the
compliance unit has been established in  the  national  department  to  deal
with high levels of fraud. The province will be implementing its own  fraud-
prevention plan that will see the removal of undeserving beneficiaries  from
the system. Not only will this result in efficiency gains, but it will  also
make more money available.

Violence against women and children,  older  persons  and  other  vulnerable
groups is another priority for this  government.  The  department  needs  to
strengthen its intervention capacity, and will  appoint  probation  officers
for the implementation of probation services,  crime  prevention,  diversion
and  home-based  supervision  programmes  for  which  R9  million  has  been
budgeted. A multipurpose centre for the elderly will be established  at  the
Resthaven Centre in Kimberley. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, may I join  other
colleagues in congratulating our Ministers. The HIV/Aids pandemic  continues
to be the defining factor in the Health budget. Whilst one is pleased  that,
finally, ARV medication is beginning to be rolled out, we  would  wish  such
roll-out to take place at a far more urgent rate than it  is  proceeding  at
present. We have a huge task  in  this  regard,  but  failure  to  act  with
maximum effect today will increase costs  in  future,  and  will  result  in
unnecessary loss of lives.

We need to address the issue of nurses who leave the country  in  droves  to
take up more lucrative opportunities in other countries. We cannot  continue
to train nurses only to have them leave us once they are  trained.  We  need
to look at the  packages  offered  to  them,  and  also  the  decision  that
requires nurses to complete a year of compulsory community service.  Whether
this may hasten the departure of some nurses or not, we certainly need  them
in the community.

We are pleased that new urban hospitals are  being  built,  such  as  Inkosi
Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. We must, however,  express
concern around the task of progress made in building  more  rural  hospitals
and in equipping those already in existence, which, in many cases, are in  a
state of poor maintenance. In this regard, we  also  need  to  be  aware  of
cross-border use of hospitals. In  KwaZulu-Natal,  many  people  from  other
neighbouring provinces, and even neighbouring states such as  Swaziland  and
Mozambique, use our health facilities. Funds allocated  to  these  provinces
need to take this into account.

Engikubona ezibhedlela  nasemtholampilo  ngakithi,  KwaZulu-Natal,  ikakhulu
ezabelweni,  ukuthi  umthwalo  osemkhulu   lapha   ngowokwanelisa   izidingo

kanzima.  Akusimangalisi  kakhulu  uma  sizwa  amaphutha  enzekayo  kwezinye
izibhedlela, indlela abasebenza ngayo inengcindezi.

Isabiwomali somnyango  sibhekene  nesimo  lapho  kudinga  kuvinjwe  ukuhamba
kodokotela  nabahlengikazi.  Ezabelweni  azande  izibhedlela  ngoba   abantu

ngikhuluma ngezabelo ngempela.  UMnyango  wezeMpilo  udinga  isabelo  esithe
xaxa.  Egameni  le  IFP,  siyavumelana   nesabiwomali   esethulwe   umnyango
njengamanje - uMnyango wezeMpilo.

UMnyango wezokuThuthukiswa koMphakathi usabhekene nobunzima  bokunika  wonke

ke  lokhu  kuNgqongqoshe  wezaseKhaya.  Siyethemba-ke  ukuthi  isimo  sizoya
ngokuya siba ngcono.

Kanjalo futhi nemali kadekle isaphuza ukutholakala. Asazi ukuthi uma  umuntu

ngenxa yodaka. Kuthi-ke abahola impesheni nemali kadekle  bangaholi  ngaleso
sizathu. Yinkinga-ke le ephathelene nezemigwaqo.

Enye inkinga yalabo abahola lo dekle ukuthi  abathandisisi  ukuhola  ebhange
noma  eposini.   Egameni   le-IFP,   siyasesekela   isabiwomali.   [Kwaphela
isikhathi.] [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, what I see in hospitals and clinics in my  area,  KwaZulu-
Natal, especially in rural areas, is that there's still a lot to be done  in
terms of fulfilling the needs of the community. The existing  hospitals  are
overcrowded, given the fact that diseases are rife, and also  the  destroyer
(HIV/Aids) is not taking a back seat. Doctors and nurses are  emigrating  at
an alarming rate, and those left behind are working very hard.  We  are  not
surprised at all if mistakes happen in some of these  hospitals  because  of
the pressure doctors and nurses are working under.

The budget faces a situation whereby there is a need to stop the  emigration
of doctors and nurses. Hospitals should be increased in rural areas  because
people experience problems when they go to these clinics. How much  more  if
they  have  to  go  these  hospitals,  which  are   difficult   to   access,
particularly to the people who come from rural areas  -  I'm  talking  about
the real rural areas.  The  Department  of  Health  needs  to  increase  the
budget. In the name of the IFP, we support this budget  the  department  has
presented - the Department of Health.

The Department  of  Social  Services  is  still  facing  the  difficulty  of
providing money to all children who need the child support  grant.  The  big
problem is with grandmothers  who  are  left  with  these  children  without
papers  that  prove  children's  births.  This  problem  is  caused  by  the
nonexistence of Home Affairs offices nearer to the  majority  of  people  in
rural areas, so that certificates that are needed  by  the  social  services
are obtainable more easily.  We  reported  this  to  the  Minister  of  Home
Affairs and we hope the situation will improve.

At the same time, the social grant takes long to  be  accessed.  We  do  not
know what is the hold-up for a person who has already  registered,  but  who
is not getting his/her grant for almost a year. There is a problem in  rural
areas when it is raining; roads are slippery.  It  is  impossible  to  drive
there because of the mud, and as a result people end up  not  getting  their
grants. This is the transport department's problem though.  Another  problem
is that those who get social grants do not like  to  get  paid  through  the
bank or the post office. In the name of IFP, we support the  budget.]  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]

Ms N MOERANE-MAMASE (Eastern Cape): Hon Chair,  hon  Ministers,  hon  Deputy
Ministers, hon  MECs  from  different  provinces,  hon  members  and  senior
members of staff, good afternoon.

I rise to support the Social Development budget, but I am going  to  confine
myself to the social grants  administration  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  People
align the Eastern Cape with  maladministration  of  social  grants,  because
they see ugly pictures in both the printed and electronic media. I  need  to
give hon members some background information on the actual reasons that  led
to these problems in the Eastern Cape and the manner in  which  we  disperse
funds that are allocated to us.

First of all, the Ministry in the Eastern Cape  was  historically  separated
from the Department of Welfare. We were just a vote  within  them.  We  were
left without any financial  and  human  resources,  and  this  affected  the
process of grant administration. This was further strengthened by  the  fact
that in 1996 there was a declaration  that  a  social  security  agency  was
going to be established. It was declared in 1996  that  this  was  going  to
take place in  the  next  financial  year.  This  exacerbated  the  problem,
because there were no staff members employed in the  Eastern  Cape.  Because
of this, the administration has had problems.

During the past year, R7,3 billion was allocated to us. Out  of  this,  R6,9
billion was allocated for the administration of grants. The rest, which  was
R400 million, was for administration. We spent all those funds,  because  we
embarked on different campaigns to ensure that there was  access  to  social
grants in the Eastern Cape. We were complying with the call by the  national
Government that there needed to be access to social  grants.  In  accordance
with that call we established seven  districts,  and  in  24  towns  of  the
Eastern Cape we established area offices. We further ensured that there  was
access, even in rural areas. We have about 96 offices  in  the  province  to
ensure that grants are accessible.

Furthermore, we realised that we  were  facing  enormous  problems.  Amongst
these was  the  problem  of  people  who  did  not  possess  valid  identity
documents to enable them to access social grants. Hence we ended up  with  a
deficit, because those people were  never  provided  for  in  terms  of  the
budget of R500 million.

The past year has been an eventful but rewarding one. The  most  significant
process  that  the  Department  embarked  on   was   the   formulation   and
implementation of a turn-around strategy for the  department  to  deal  with
certain recurring service delivery problems. The plan  sought  to  stabilise
the department, to turn it around and to support the  change  process.  With
that  turn-around  process  we  achieved  milestones.  Amongst   those   are
improvements to the social grant administration  itself.  We  established  a
social grants task team and through that we ensured  that  we  expanded  the
social security safety network through the  expanded  child  support  grants
scheme, in accordance with the targets set by the  national  department.  We
ensured that there was management of the payment  contractors  in  order  to
improve payments at paypoints. We also established a helpdesk  at  paypoints
where the beneficiaries could make enquiries  regarding  where  they  should
collect their grants. There has  been  a  tremendous  improvement  with  the
introduction of these facilities. The beneficiaries now know where they  can
collect their grants.

We also ensured the implementation of internal  controls  to  prevent  fraud
and corruption  through  the  establishment  of  an  electronic  filing  and
management system. With that we managed to capture about 1,8 million  files.
It is easy to access information wherever one is in terms of our offices.

There were clear service delivery outputs that we realised as a  department.
In March  of  this  financial  year  we  had  enrolled  about  1,77  million
beneficiaries, but unfortunately they now stand at 1,2 million.  The  reason
for this decline is that most of those people, as  the  MEC  of  Health  has
elaborated, have been working in other provinces. Because we  are  a  labour
reservoir, people seek work in other provinces, mainly in the  Western  Cape
and Gauteng. When they return they sometimes are  not  well.  All  of  these
people have since passed away. As I address this House,  we  are  left  with
1,2 million beneficiaries.

We have problems with regard to  some  types  of  grants.  Among  these  are
disability grants, care dependency grants,  foster  care  grants  and  child
support  grants.  We  are  increasingly  inheriting  child-headed   families
because of the scourge of HIV.  We  have,  therefore,  increased  the  child
support grant extension campaigns, and we have ensured the  introduction  of
the management information system. We have ensured that all our  offices  in
the six centres use this type of system. We did not end there.

We also ensured that there is customer care. As a  result  we  have  ensured
that our officers access formal training through the  various  institutions.
We have sent 44 officers to receive formal  training  at  RAU.  Hundred  and
fifty officers were trained to operate the system of  grant  administration.
We also wanted to ensure  that  other  people  are  able  to  interpret  the
legislation and treat our customers with care in line with  the  Batho  Pele
principles, so 130  officers  were  trained  and  40  were  trained  in  the
registry function which is done electronically.

As we speak, we have been  allocated  a  budget  of  R8,6  billion  in  this
financial year. The biggest portion of that is for the  extension  of  child
support grants for children from 9 to 11 years. R902  million  is  meant  to
capture all the children between the ages 9 and 11. With  that  the  Eastern
Cape government is trying to ensure that  we  eradicate  illiteracy  in  our
province. We have embarked on a back-to-school  campaign  and  enrolled  all
those children at schools. We have moved  from  school  to  school,  talking
about  these  grants  to  ensure  that  we  eradicate  the  fraud.  We  have
discovered that some parents exchange children. For  example,  five  parents
would "own" one child for the purpose of  accessing  child  grants.  We  are
trying to eradicate all of this. There are a number  of  challenges  besides
the administration of the  grant  system,  and  we  are  making  significant
progress.

Some challenges are due to the unacceptable levels of poverty, HIV and  Aids
itself, and the new challenge of child-headed  households  and  orphans  who
need to be taken care of. We need to establish closer partnerships with  all
sectors of society to work together in a more  integrated  and  co-ordinated
manner. We  have  a  lot  of  challenges  in  the  form  of  other  national
departments, such as the Department of Home  Affairs.  In  my  own  province
there  is  little  co-operation  from  this  department,  except  if,  as  a
department, we coerce them to co-operate. Hopefully the Minister  of  Social
Development is going  to  encourage  them  to  co-operate  in  this  regard,
especially with regard to the  provision  of  the  turn-around  of  identity
documents.

There are still people who are  in  possession  of  what  we  call  the  old
Transkei identity documents. We call them double  nine  double  nine.  These
identity documents encourage fraudulent activities, because people  can  use
them to access grants at various paypoints. We still have this problem  that
is not of our own  making.  We  do  not  have  access  to  other  Government
agencies, such as the SA Revenue Services. We know there are people who  are
earning money in the form of private companies. There is no way we  can  get
this  information.  We  are  faced  with  these  particular  challenges.  We
therefore call on national Government to assist us concerning this matter.

As I have elaborated, as a department we  are  trying  to  fight  fraud  and
corruption,  especially  with  regard  to  the  child  support  grants   and
disability grants. This is one source that people prey  on  because  of  the
high levels of unemployment. However, as a  department,  we  are  trying  to
improve customer relations to enhance the dignity of all our  people.  As  a
result of that, we have resorted to constructing about 20 paypoints in  this
financial year to ensure that people are paid  under  decent  circumstances.
They should not be exposed to bad weather conditions. We welcome the  advent
of  the  social  security  agency,  but  we  realise  that  there  will   be
challenges, as we had to  face  initially,  with  the  separation  from  the
department of health with regard to the distribution of  resources.  I  hope
this is not going to adversely affect the provinces.

As a department we have established an inspectorate  unit  that  focuses  on
the management of risks, fraud and  corruption  in  social  security  grants
administration. Despite all the critical challenges that I  have  mentioned,
we have managed to recover a lot of monies  on  our  own  as  a  department,
without the assistance of the private sector or consultants. We are  in  the
process of recovering a lot of monies. We  are  also  venturing  into  areas
that in the past we would never have ventured into. We are  now  challenging
our professionals, such as our doctors and lawyers. We are  in  the  process
of recovering a lot of money  that  has  been  defrauded  by  these  various
professionals.

With these words we support the Budget Vote  of  the  Department  of  Social
Development. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev E ADOLPH: Hon Chairperson, Ministers and members of this House, I  would
like to congratulate the Minister of Health on  her  reappointment  to  this
very important portfolio. It is evident that the President and  his  Cabinet
have confidence in you, your director and your  Ministry  for  delivering  a
health service that is so much needed in this country.

As the ID, we welcome and support the provision of affordable medication  by
reducing prices, but also by delivering  a  quality  service  by  dispensing
medication to the poorest of the poor.

Coming  to  the  issue  of  affordability,  we  are  concerned   about   the
affordability of anti-retrovirals to the  most  needy  victims  of  HIV  and
Aids. We are very mindful of the complexity of the HIV and  Aids.  It  is  a
difficult disease to  combat  and  to  deal  with,  and  therefore  needs  a
comprehensive and holistic plan and approach.

I'd like to challenge each and every South African at this  point  in  time,
black or white, it doesn't matter,  to  declare  war  on  HIV  and  Aids  by
becoming involved. We are all victims of HIV and Aids because the future  of
our country is at stake. I think you will agree with me that  this  disease,
this pandemic, has killed more people on  the  African  continent  than  the
Second World War. Therefore, it is time for us to  take  responsibility,  as
South Africans, in the spirit of Ubuntu.

We care and we share the tribulations of our people. We  have  to  implement
the prevention strategy and to promote health. It is time  that  we  stopped
blaming Government. You cannot blame Government  if  you  contract  HIV  and
Aids by recklessly involving yourself in sexual intercourse, and  that  type
of thing. It is time that we stopped blaming the Government  and  went  back
to basics.

We as a community, as parents, should teach our  children  to  refrain  from
unhealthy sexual behaviour and teach them the right and healthy way. If  one
is infected  with  HIV  and  Aids,  Madam  Chair,  one  should  not  receive
medication only, because as important  as  medication  and  anti-retrovirals
are, so is a healthy diet that will sustain one's health. Therefore we  call
on each and every South African to assist us  in  our  battle  against  this
pandemic.

Furthermore, we want to raise our concern at  the  restrictions  imposed  on
traditional healers. It is about time that they were  also  incorporated  in
the world or formal system of medication, to  be  recognised  for  the  role
they play, the practices and the products they present  to  our  people,  in
our effort to heal the nation as a whole.

We  are  also  concerned  about  the  medical  aid  schemes  that  are  just
escalating their fees, because our people cannot afford medication  anymore.
We are very glad and we are  grateful  to  the  department  for,  at  least,
promising us that there will be a psychiatric hospital  in  each  and  every
province of the country. To come back to the basics ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, I'm afraid your time has expired.

Rev E ADOLPH: Thank you. We support. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy
Minister, MECs, hon members, I rise  to  support  the  Budget  Vote  of  the
Minister of Health. I want to say here that I'm very delighted to  join  the
health team. I want  to  do  my  best  to  support  the  programmes  of  the
department. Policies are in  place,  all  that  is  required  of  us  is  to
accelerate delivery.
The vision of the Department of Health is to  create  a  caring  and  humane
society in which all South Africans  have  access  to  affordable  and  good
quality health care. This vision can be realised only if all of us  roll  up
our sleeves and get down to work in the spirit of a  people's  contract  for
health care delivery.

Health is a key Ministry in the Government's commitment to  achieving  human
security, equity and dignity for all. It is a key indicator of  success  and
failure as a nation.

In his state of the nation address in  May,  President  Mbeki  outlined  the
Government's priorities for  this  year.  Many  of  these,  though  not  the
responsibility of the  Department  of  Health,  affect  the  health  of  the
nation. These include the  elimination  of  poverty  and  unemployment;  the
provision of basic services such as water, sanitation and  electricity;  and
the provision of social services and housing.

More than 80% of our people depend on the public health sector.  This  means
that Government has a major responsibility to  provide  stewardship  of  the
health system and deliver quality health care. When a  person  is  ill,  hon
members, regardless of their economic status, they hope for the best  health
care. Much progress has been made to improve the  quality  of  care  at  all
levels of the health system.

As the Minister has indicated, we have built  over  1  300  clinics  in  our
effort to bring health care services closer to our people. The expansion  of
facilities and the free  primary  health  care  policy  have  increased  the
number of visits per person to our primary health care facilities. This  has
increased the pressure on our health personnel.

The clinical services  in  rural  areas  are  provided  almost  entirely  by
nurses. Some  of  the  major  problems  include  high  vacancy  rates,  high
absenteeism, high  turnover  of  staff,  ageing  staff  and  the  increasing
demands of new policies. Many people do an amazing job  with  the  resources
available, but morale is generally not good.

I want to use this opportunity to express appreciation for the work done  by
our frontline health workers. I will be working closely  with  the  national
deputy director-general  for  human  resources,  our  provincial  and  local
government, as well as  civil  society  to  ensure  that  these  issues  are
addressed, especially in the underserved areas.

Our ability to reach every  household  depends  on  community  mobilisation.
Community health  workers,  Dots  and  HIV  and  Aids  community-based  care
workers provide an invaluable service. We  will  be  paying  much  attention
this year to such issues  as  stipends,  training,  supervision  and  career
guidance. We will  ensure  that  the  support  services  required  for  good
clinical care are stepped up.

Issues of management, infrastructure, transport, communication,  electricity
and roads will be  addressed  through  the  social  cluster  and  under  the
hospital revitalisation programme. Imagine the  nature  of  the  work  of  a
nurse who works in a rural clinic where the telephones don't work, or  where
there is no electricity and no running water. Imagine how much  better  such
a nurse would feel about her job if she was in a position to send an  e-mail
to order her supplies or to reach a tele-medicines service.

President Mbeki shared a story once of a village in the Eastern  Cape  which
was transformed almost overnight through  the  installation  of  electricity
and computers. Suddenly the community nurse could send a  digital  image  of
the cases on which she needed help with diagnosis and treatment advice.

Chairperson, we must deal with the issue of the  differences  in  conditions
of service and salaries for health care  personnel  paid  between  different
municipalities and between municipalities and  provinces,  as  well  as  the
differences between the community  health  workers  and  the  new  community
development  workers.  These  differences   contribute   to   fragmentation,
inefficiency and, above all, inequity.

A nurse employed in a rural local municipality earns much less for the  same
level of responsibility compared  to  her  counterparts  in  a  metropolitan
municipality. A nursing supervisor responsible for five  clinics  and  fifty
staff in a city can visit every clinic every morning and still have time  to
do other things. By contrast, a  nursing  supervisor  responsible  for  five
clinics and only 25 staff in a rural area spends hours travelling  over  bad
roads to visit clinics. This is one of the major reasons provinces  have  to
remain, for now, the major employers of primary health care staff.

Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi's department is working  on  a  framework
for a single Public Service.  There  will  be  some  tough  negotiations  to
ensure that it is easy  for  people  to  move  between  posts  in  national,
provincial and local government. I look forward to seeing a draft  framework
in 2005 and legislation in 2006. We intend to show that we care for all  our
frontline  health  workers,  and  particularly  for  those  with  the   most
difficult jobs. As we care better for our health  care  providers,  we  know
that they will feel better about themselves and will  give  better  care  to
our people.

The Patients' Rights Charter, which was launched by the Minister  of  Health
in November 1999, and which clearly outlines the rights of patients and  the
complaints  mechanism,  enhances  the  delivery  of  quality   health   care
services. In 2001, a  national  policy  on  quality  was  launched  and  all
provinces  now  have  their  own  policies  and  have  established   quality
assurance units.
The Kimberley hospital complex has won the Premier's Gold Award for  service
excellence for two consecutive years. Twenty-three hospitals  in  the  North
West province were enrolled into an external accreditation system that  uses
international norms as a benchmark. I hope to work closely with  members  of
this House, provincial legislatures and municipalities to ensure that  these
policies result in the delivery of quality health care.

A year ago,  hon  members,  we  passed  the  Mental  Health  Care  Act.  The
regulations will be published this year. This progressive law  takes  mental
health services out of the rigid custodial care.  Suicide,  homicide,  child
and spouse abuse are on the increase. We know that often these problems  are
precipitated by stress, unemployment, drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  and  other
mental  health  problems.  We  will  strengthen  mental  health  and  social
services to ensure that we see visible declines in the next five years.  The
social   cluster   of   directors-general   must    develop    comprehensive
interventions and I pledge to play a leading role in support  of  activities
to address these issues.

On 1 July this year, environmental health care services will become  a  core
function of metropolitan and district municipalities. In  addition,  primary
health care  will  form  the  core  function  of  provinces.  Provinces  may
delegate  this  function  to  municipalities  by  agreement  and  with   the
necessary  resources.  This  new  decision,  which  clarifies   powers   and
functions, will result in clear role definition and will result in a  single
health authority for each health district, thus eliminating duplication  and
fragmentation of service delivery. We are convinced that this decision  will
strengthen the role of developmental local government  in  the  delivery  of
basic services and that the  health  of  our  citizens  will  improve  as  a
result.

Tackling  these  issues,  hon  members,  requires  new  approaches  and  new
thinking. Social mobilisation is a very important element  of  our  national
strategy for accelerating delivery of health care. My first public event  as
Deputy Minister of Health saw me  launch  a  public-private  partnership  in
Standerton, Mpumalanga, on World Candlelight Memorial  Day,  to  honour  and
remember the loved  ones  we  have  lost  to  Aids.  Organised  through  the
Khomanani programme, this event demonstrated the amount of goodwill  in  our
communities and their willingness to join national campaigns.

Once the National Health Bill  comes  into  effect,  we  will  have  a  more
coherent legal framework for the establishment  and  functioning  of  clinic
and  district  health  committees  and  hospital   boards.   Through   these
committees, communities will play a direct role in making sure  that  health
care workers are putting people first.  We  expect  the  youth  to  play  an
active part in these structures to ensure that health  services  are  youth-
friendly.

I urge you, members of this  House,  to  get  the  lists  of  hospitals  and
clinics in your constituencies and make a point of  visiting  them.  Ask  to
review the minutes of meetings of clinic  committees  and  hospital  boards.
Mobilise communities to take pride in these services,  and  to  protect  the
personnel and to work with management to ensure that the staff respects  the
users of the services. It is only by combining  our  efforts  that  we  will
strengthen service delivery.

In conclusion, hon members, I wish to pledge that as a member of the  health
team, I will work closely with other  departments  in  the  social  cluster,
with provinces and  local  government,  and  with  our  social  partners  to
strengthen the delivery of services to  our  people,  thus  restoring  their
dignity.  I  will  ensure  that  we   strengthen   our   communication   and
relationship  with  the  media  so  that  they  report  the  good  news  and
achievements of our department.

I realise, hon members, that in order to fulfil all these  difficult  tasks,
I need to be fit, both physically and mentally. Long hours,  travel,  hectic
schedules, poor diet and lack of exercise all contribute to poor  health.  I
call on you, hon members, to join me as I  embark  on  a  fitness  campaign.
[Applause.] Hon members, pick up your running shoes and  let  us,  together,
strive to get physically and mentally fit, fit to govern. [Applause.]

Mutshami wa Xitulu, Inkomu buti, inkomu.  (Translation  of  Xitsonga  speech
follows.)

[Dr B MABASO: Chairperson, Mrs Joyce Kgoali, I praise and greet all of  you,
especially our Ministers Dr Skweyiya, Dr Manto Msimang-Tshabalala and  their
deputies. I start  by  supporting  this  Vote  of  Social  Development  that
strengthens families and children. When people are hungry, they  feel  their
minds are telling them to go to Johannesburg. Being  in  Gauteng,  some  are
local and some are from neighbouring countries, all of them think that  they
will secure employment. Therefore I say that it is not surprising  that  the
population growth of Gauteng has increased by 20% in total. I do  understand
when some of our people  say  that  we  in  Gauteng  have  absorbed  skilled
workers. However, I also want you to know that those who come to us are  not
employed yet, but make applications on arrival.
The dignity of the Africans will be  strengthened  through  education,  when
people of working age start working for themselves. In this way we shall  be
respected. The reason why Gauteng is successful  in  job  creation  is  that
they believe the Sepedi saying "Mphe-mphe e a lapisa motho, o  kgona  ke  sa
gagwe." [It is better to have your own things than to have to ask others.]

Based on this Sepedi saying, we say that our objective is to make sure  that
everyone ends up working for himself or herself.

Be aware that HIV/Aids, a disease visited upon scores of the  poor  that  we
are supposed  to  assist,  has  destroyed  the  living  conditions  of  many
parents, leaving the orphans scattered all  over.  You  are  malicious,  you
HIV/Aids. You cause us to have many destitute people and orphans.  You  make
us run short of the food parcels that are supplied by the Minister,  but  we
are trying to make sure that the family of the poorest of the  poor  receive
these food parcels.

What we are fighting against with all our might, is a crime  that  is  being
committed, and that is child abuse by criminals. This crime  kills  parents,
leaving  children  without  any  parents.  We  follow  your  objective,   Dr
Skweyiya, when you feel pity for the children, the youth and  the  disabled.
Even though we are not a department that creates jobs, we  are  prepared  to
try here and there to create jobs bit by bit. We will work  with  the  whole
community and also with business people to alleviate poverty.

We are prepared to join hands with you, the national  Government,  we  being
the province and also the municipality. There is an adage  that  goes:  "Two
heads are better than one." We, the Gauteng government,  are  with  you,  Dr
Skweyiya. We are showing respect by improving our  service  in  offices.  We
are teaching public servants to respect the public who  comes  to  them  for
help. We must always know that jobs are scarce, more  especially  for  women
and the youth.

We will fight poverty till we win by means of what we  are  doing.  We  will
build houses. There will  be  schools,  hospitals  and  places  for  various
sporting codes, including "muchongolo"  (Tsonga  traditional  dance).  Those
who will not be reached out to, when  the  department  tries  to  help,  are
those we decide to give food parcels to. All those  things  we  do  for  the
poor, those who are hungry, and are  knocking  at  the  grave;  we  will  be
thinking of them by giving them these food parcels.

Even Public Works is here with us to offer assistance.  If  it  is  to  give
social grants to the poor, we shall do that job at full steam; we  are  busy
doing it. By the beginning  of  September  we  will  have  a  single  window
through which we will help all, so that learners can wear uniforms, be  able
to receive social grants and receive treatment in hospitals while  they  are
still young. This will be done through a single window, rather  than  having
multiple queues at many windows.

Children are South Africa's future. We will do everything to  support  them,
from the time they are in  crèches.  We  will  try  to  work  together  with
learnerships in order to eradicate poverty.

Let me conclude by saying our trust is in the municipalities,  because  they
are the ones who know poverty-stricken families. Let me conclude  by  saying
we know that there is poverty throughout our country, but we  request  that,
even if we are poor, we do not ask ourselves which family is the poorest  of
the poor amongst us, so as to be chosen for the  grant.  We  don't  have  to
compete for the social grant.

I conclude by saying we are happy to announce that youths should  apply  for
the Sekulula Card, meaning "easy card", which is  an  ABSA  card  for  their
payments to be paid into. This will mean  that  they  receive  their  grants
through the ATM, rather than being charged inside the bank. This  will  mean
that pensioners, both women and men, would be the  only  ones  remaining  in
queues. By so doing, there won't be long queues, because the youth are  able
to use the ATM.

We congratulate you, Madam Kgaoli,  for  being  chosen  to  be  our  leader.
[Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  I thank you, brother. Thank you.]

Nkskz A N D QIKANI: Mama uSihlalo,  aBaphathiswa  bonke  abakhoyo  namalungu
ahloniphekileyo onke akhoyo, masiqale samkele  uMphathiswa  njengoMphathiswa
wezeMpilo kule Ndlu. Impilo yethu sonke ixhomekeke kweli sebe uliphetheyo.

Okokuqala, masibulele izicwangciso  zakho  zikazwelonke  nge-HIV/Aids,  kuba
intsholongwane   kaGawulayo   yeyona   igqiba   abantwana   bethu,   abadala
nabancinci.

ISebe  lezeMpilo  kufuneka  liwuqwalasele   kakhulu   umcimbi   wezibhedlele
neekliniki ezilalini. Kukho iindawo ekusahanjwa  kuzo  imigama  emide  ukuya
kufuna uncedo lwezempilo.  Bathi  bakufika  kuzo  abantu  bafumane  kungekho
gqirha okanye mayeza, yaye kunqongophele nabongikazi.  URhulumente  kufuneka
abajonge  oogqirha  abancinci   namanesi   aphuma   ezikholejini.   Kufuneka
abakhuthaze ngokubanika imirholo emihle  ukwenzela  ukuba  bangathi  bephuma
esikolweni bafune ukuzivulela  iisejari  zabo  okanye  bawele  baye  kumazwe
aphesheya ukuya kufuna amarhiwa aluhlaza.

Makuqwalaselwe ukubonelelwa kwezigulane  ngeengubo  nokutya  okufanelekileyo
kwizibhedlele  zikaRhulumente  kuba  abantu  basezilalini  abanayo  le  mali
yokuya kwizibhedlele zabucala  ukuze  bafumane  uncedo  oluphezulu  namayeza
afanelekileyo.

Oomatshini basezilondri kufuneka bajongwe  ngoba  oomatshini  abaninzi  bezi
zibhedlele abasebenzi, loo nto itsho luqhwalele uncedo kwizigulane.

Okokugqibela,  kukho   izigulane   zesifo   sephepha,   i-TB.   Siyavumelana
nezicwangciso zakho, kodwa Mphathiswa, kukho nto ekufuneka  khe  iqwalaselwe
kwizigulane zesifo sephepha, ezi zamaqabaza, ii-Dots.  Ngathi  kufuneka  khe
ujongwe kakuhle umbandela wee-Dots kuba abantu bazo  abazithathi  ngendlela,
kungenjalo umntu utshintsha indawo yokuhlala  ze  ahlale  engazifumani,  nto
leyo  ke  embuyisela  umva  ngokwasempilweni  kuba   namanesi   okubahambela
emakhaya anqongophele okanye engenazithuthi zokubandwendwela.

Kukho amayeza amaninzi awasuswayo kuluhlu lwamayeza asezikliniki, kodwa  loo
mayeza ubani uyawafumana ekhemisti xa ewafuna. Iyeza  lokukhohlela,  i-cough
mixture, ngumizekelo waloo mayeza. Loo  nto  ilungiselela  abantu  abanemali
kuphela, abasezilalini ke  bafa  namthanyana.  URhulumente  bakajonge  ukuba
ukuba la mayeza ndithetha  ngawo  ayapheliswa,  makapheliswe  nasezikhemesti
ukuze wonke umntu angalifumani.

Mandibulele, Mphathiswa ngamaphulo  ogonyo,  ngakumbi  eMpuma  Koloni,  apho
ndisuka  khona.  Ndiyincoma  kakhulu  loo  nto   kuba   amanani   okusweleka
kwabantwana atsho ehla kakhulu.  Nditetha  ngento  endiyaziyo  kuba  ndisuka
kweli candelo.

Ukhuseleko  lwamanesi  ezilalini  malujongwe  kuba  yinto   ebangela   ukuba
angafuni ukuya kuhlala kuzo. Iindlela nazo mazilungiswe kuba zimbi  kakhulu.
Nditsho  kuwe  ke  Mphathiswa,  Gqirha   Goqwana.   Enkosi.   [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Mrs A N D QIKANI: Madam Chairperson, all hon Ministers  who  are  here  and
hon members present, let us first welcome the Minister of Health who  is  in
the House. Our health depends on the department that you lead.
Firstly, let us thank you for your national  HIV/Aids  plans,  because  this
virus is the greatest killer of our people, both old and young.

The Department of Health should  really  concentrate  on  the  situation  at
hospitals and clinics in rural areas. There are  areas  where  people  still
walk very long distances to get medical help. When they arrive there,  there
is neither a doctor nor medicine, and there is also a  shortage  of  nurses.
The Government should look at the issue of  young  doctors  and  nurses  who
have just graduated from colleges. They must be encouraged  by  being  given
attractive salaries so that they could be  discouraged  from  opening  their
own surgeries just after graduating or  from  going  overseas  to  look  for
greener pastures.

Let us look at the issue of supplying patients with  blankets  and  suitable
food in Government hospitals, because in rural areas  people  cannot  afford
to go to private hospitals for quality  medical  help  and  the  appropriate
medicine. Washing machines for laundry also need to be looked  at,  as  they
are never in  working  order,  which  creates  problems  when  it  comes  to
assisting the patients.

Lastly, there are TB  patients.  We  are  happy  with  your  programme,  hon
Minister, but there is a problem with the TB  patients  on  Dots  treatment.
This Dots problem really needs urgent attention because most people  do  not
handle this correctly. These patients  sometimes  change  their  residential
addresses, as a result of which they do  not  get  their  medication,  which
delays their getting better. There is also a  shortage  of  nurses  visiting
patients at home, and  sometimes  those  who  are  there  do  not  have  the
transport to do so.

There are some medicines which have been removed from the medicine lists  at
clinics, but which are available at chemists.  For  example,  there  are  no
longer cough mixtures. This is fine for people who are  not  poor,  but  for
rural people it is unfortunate, since they are  poor.  The  Government  must
make sure that if these medicines  are  not  supposed  to  be  available  at
Government hospitals, they should not be available at chemists either.

Let me thank you, hon Minister, for immunisation, especially in the  Eastern
Cape where I come from. I really applaud this, especially  since  there  has
been a significant decline in the death  of  toddlers.  I  know  what  I  am
talking about, since I worked in this department.

The issue of the safety of nurses in the rural areas should also  be  looked
at because that is one other thing that makes  them  resist  going  to  live
there. The  roads  are  also  in  a  bad  condition,  and  that  also  needs
attention. In saying that, I am talking to you, Minister, Dr Goqwana.  Thank
you. [Applause.]]

Mr P UYS (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Ministers,  hon  Deputy  Minister,
hon members,  I  want  to  congratulate  the  hon  Minister  of  Health  for
presenting us with a budget that continues to expand  access  to  equitable,
affordable and good quality health services to  all  our  people.  The  past
decade has seen huge progress by  Government  in  bringing  health  services
closer to the people, especially the poor.

In supporting the Budget Vote, I want to assure  the  Minister  that  health
services in the Western Cape will continue to do its part  to  promote  this
progress. Currently, 72% of the Western Cape's 4 500 000  people  depend  on
state health services. In addition, it is estimated  that  90  000  patients
from other provinces will receive highly specialised care at Groote  Schuur,
Tygerberg and Red Cross hospitals. This year our province  expects  to  have
12 million patient contacts at primary health care level.

Voorsitter, net soos ander provinsies, is die Wes-Kaap in 'n stryd  gewikkel
met   'n   veelvuldige   las   van   siektes   en   trauma   weens   geweld,
voertuigongelukke,  brandwonde,   chroniese   siektes   soos   diabetes   en
hipertensie en oordraagbare siektes soos tering en MIV en vigs. Ons het  die
hoogste voorkoms van tering  in  Suid-Afrika  en  'n  lae,  maar  toenemende
voorkoms van MIV en vigs. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, like other provinces, the Western Cape is  fighting  a  battle
against numerous diseases, trauma owing to violence,  motor  car  accidents,
burns, chronic  diseases  such  as  diabetes  and  hypertension,  contagious
diseases such as  tuberculosis  and  HIV  and  Aids.  We  have  the  highest
incidence of tuberculosis  in  South  Africa,  and  a  low,  but  increasing
incidence of HIV and Aids.]

In effectively dealing with the  burden  presented  by  these  diseases  and
building on the 10-point plan for the public health  care  sector  mentioned
by  the  Minister,  the   Western   Cape   province   continues   with   the
implementation of its health care 2010 plan. This plan  will  provide  equal
access to quality of health care for all our people. It will also  allow  us
to apply our  resources  to  maximum  effort  and  keep  expenditure  within
budget. The health care 2010  strategy  rests  on  four  pillars:  services,
people, facilities and money.

This year, health in the Western Cape has been allocated a budget  of  R4,74
billion, and that amounts  to  just  over  25%  of  the  provincial  budget.
Conditional grants constitute 33% or R1,5 billion of  our  national  budget,
with the National Treasury services grant making up R1,076 billion.  We  are
grateful for the funds received. For our part,  we  are  pleased  to  report
that the projected revenue reflects a significant  increase  over  the  MTEF
period from R98 million in 2000-2001 to a projected  R156  million  for  the
2004-2005 financial year.

Spurred on by goals, we are making our budget allocation go a  long  way  in
the provision of quality health services. Some  of  the  highlights  of  the
Western Cape health budget include the  following:  R1,2  billion  has  been
allocated for district health services, with additional funds  for  HIV  and
Aids of almost R58 million in terms of the increased conditional  grant.  In
this regard, I would like to commend the Minister for the major increase  in
the conditional grant funding for the care, management and treatment of  HIV
and Aids patients reflected  in  the  national  health  department's  Budget
Vote.

Regarding steps to enhance the experience of patients  at  community  health
care centres in the Cape metropole - which is the focus of  many  complaints
-  various  measures  are  being  taken  to  reduce  the  waiting  times  to
acceptable levels at our facilities. We are also  striving  to  improve  the
supply  of  medicines  so  that  patients  are  not  turned   away   without
medication.

Wat die voortsetting van die omvattende bestuur, versorging  en  behandeling
van MIV en vigspasiënte betref: die program vir die voorkoming  van  moeder-
tot-kind-oordrag  is  ten  volle  geïmplementeer.  Geriewe  vir   vrywillige
berading  en  toetsing  is  op  344  terreine  beskikbaar.  Anti-retrovirale
middels is by 19 funksionele sentrums dwarsdeur  die  provinsie  beskikbaar,
en teen die einde van hierdie finansiële jaar verwag  ons  om  sowat  6  000
mense by  36  sulke  sentrums  te  kan  bedien.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[With regard to the continuation of the comprehensive management,  care  and
treatment of HIV and Aids patients: the  programme  for  the  prevention  of
mother-to-child transmission has  been  fully  implemented.  Facilities  for
voluntary  counselling  and   testing   are   available   in   344   fields.
Antiretrovirals are  available  at  19  functional  centres  throughout  the
province, and at the end of this financial year we  expect  to  be  able  to
serve about 6 000 people at 36 such centres.]
Regarding measures to tackle TB cure rates, this year will see  the  further
introduction of a new four-drug combination treatment  which  will  lead  to
improved cure rates. In addition, more strenuous efforts  will  be  made  to
reduce interruption rates.

Streekhospitale wat  as  die  ruggraat  van  provinsiale  gesondheidsdienste
beskou word, sal versterk word. [Regional hospitals,  which  are  considered
as the backbone of provincial health services, will be strengthened.]

Eight hundred nurses and 100 oral health professionals will  be  trained  in
the province this year. I share the Minister's concern  regarding  the  loss
of health professionals and welcome the steps announced in this  regard.  In
particular, I welcome the proactive steps taken with the United  Kingdom  to
regulate the movement of health professionals between our countries.

Die opening  van  die  Wes-Kaapse  rehabilitasiesentrum  in  aanbou  op  die
terrein van die Lentegeur-hospitaal, sal ook  vanjaar  'n  hoogtepunt  wees.
[The opening this year of the Western Cape rehabilitation  centre  which  is
being built  on  the  site  of  the  Lentegeur  Hospital,  will  also  be  a
highlight.]

We would also like to thank the Minister and  national  Government  for  the
funding we have received to upgrade  our  hospitals.  Three  major  hospital
revitalisation  projects  are  progressing  very  well.  Projects  for   the
upgrading of George Hospital at R79  million  -  it  is  almost  complete  -
Worcester Hospital at R147 million, and Vredenburg Hospital at  R48  million
are in full swing. The department is also developing  a  business  case  for
the building of a new hospital in the Khayelitsha/Mitchells  Plain  area  to
the extent of R110 million.

The conclusion for this is that co-operation and mutual support between  the
different spheres of government and various departments is key to  achieving
the all-important goal of a better and healthier life for all our people.  I
would like  to  thank  the  hon  Minister  of  Health  for  the  initiatives
announced in the budget speech regarding support and  communication  between
the department and provinces, and  within  Government  and  the  communities
that we serve.

In die Wes-Kaap glo ons dat dit noodsaaklik  is  om  gesondheidpersoneel  te
hou waar hulle benodig word, en om nuwe talent na die  departement  te  lok.
Daarom het ons ons verbind tot die opleiding en verbetering  van  beide  die
bestuurs- en pasiëntsorgvaardighede van  ons  pasiënte.  Ons  verwelkom  die
groter klem wat die Minister plaas op die behoud van skaars  vaardighede  in
openbare gesondheid, asook onderhandelinge met  ander  lande  om  regulering
met betrekking  tot  die  beweging  van  mediese  personeel  daar  te  stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the Western Cape we believe that it is essential to  keep  health  staff
where they are needed, and to attract new talent to the department. We  have
therefore committed ourselves  to  the  training  and  improvement  of  both
management and patient care skills of our patients. We welcome  the  greater
emphasis placed by the Minister on the  preservation  of  scarce  skills  in
public health, as well as negotiations with  other  countries  to  establish
regulation with regard to the movement of medical staff.]]

As for the Minister's call  to  help  ensure  that  the  healthy  lifestyles
campaign is spread far and wide, I want to assure her that  in  the  Western
Cape, we will continue to put  more  effort  into  effective  and  practical
preventative health programmes. These will be aimed not only  at  increasing
awareness amongst the public, but also at promoting healthy lifestyles.

In conclusion, I wish to  assure  the  Minister  of  our  support  from  the
Western Cape in achieving the objectives of the national health system.  The
Western Cape is part of the system, and we will play our  part.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr E M SOGONI: Thank you, Chairperson. Comrade Ministers and Comrade  Deputy
Ministers, congratulations on  your  appointments;  congratulations  to  our
MECs as well! Special delegates and colleagues, I will read the  speech,  as
the programme shows, of the MEC for health of  Gauteng,  Dr  Ramokgopa,  who
has not been able to attend today due to unforeseen circumstances.

Just before I read the speech, I would like to comment on what  hon  Lamoela
said. Ministers of Health and Social Development, you heard  for  yourselves
that with people such as the hon member Lamoela, you could do  whatever  you
want to do, but they will never see  what  you  are  doing.  They  are  just
prophets of doom. However, the electorate returned  the  ANC  to  rule  this
country with a bigger majority than 1999, which shows that the  people  have
hope and that they see a difference between 1994 and today.  Therefore,  hon
Lamoela is one of those  people  whom  we  can  just  ignore.  Though  their
leader, when responding to the President's  state  of  the  nation  address,
said that he would like to work with the Government, we in this  House  have
yet to see that happen.

I now come to the speech, as prepared by Dr  Gwen  Ramokgopa.  The  past  10
years have been most challenging for the public health sector. As  we  begin
the second decade of democracy, we are pleased with  the  progress  we  have
made in turning the challenges that we inherited into opportunities.  Today,
we can boldly declare that we have placed our health system  on  the  growth
path.

I would like to thank the Minister for her leadership and vision during  her
past term of office. The  10-point  plan  that  she  introduced  guided  our
action and ensured that we work in a coherent manner towards  achieving  the
national goal of improving the health of our people.

Our success in building a responsive and affordable health  care  system  in
Gauteng was confirmed by the social survey we undertook  in  2002.  In  that
survey, 82% of the  people  who  had  used  our  health  facilities  in  the
preceding 12 months said they were satisfied with the changes  we  had  made
in the clinics and hospitals.

The past 10 years have particularly been beneficial  to  our  children,  the
people on whose shoulders the future  of  our  country  is  going  to  rely.
Whereas in the past children used to die from infectious childhood  diseases
such as measles, today cases of measles are rare and children are no  longer
dying of this disease. Since 1994 we have  carried  out  a  series  of  mass
immunisation campaigns to eliminate polio  and  measles,  with  the  aim  of
having our country and our province declared polio-free  by  2005.  We  have
increased the immunisation coverage to about 80%, and we are confident  that
we will be declared polio-free by December next year.

Our clinics have experienced a phenomenal increase in patient  visits  since
1994. The total number of visits per year has grown from one million  to  10
million. At the same time, hospital admission has increased to over 720  000
patients per year and the outpatient visits  have  increased  to  over  four
million.

We have paid close attention to  improving  the  quality  of  care  that  we
provide. We have established a quality assurance directorate  to  follow  up
all complaints and ensure improved  quality  of  care,  and  hospitals  have
quality teams that ensure adherence to quality standards. We also  appointed
an outside body,  the  accreditation  committee,  to  monitor  adherence  to
standards.
We are currently finalising our strategic plans  in  consultation  with  all
stakeholders. These plans will build on the achievements we have made.  Most
importantly, however, they will result in a fundamental paradigm shift  from
planning and policy formulation to  actual  implementation,  monitoring  and
evaluation of programmes that will make a difference in  the  lives  of  the
poor - women, children, the disabled and the vulnerable.

In the next five years we will  streamline  our  systems  and  processes  to
achieve  greater  service  delivery.   We   want   to   combat   corruption,
inefficiency and poor performance, and continue  to  promote  the  ethos  of
care and  accountability  through  our  Patients'  Rights  Charter  and  the
service pledge.

We will continue to pay special attention to the quality of service  at  all
public hospitals, clinics and other health care facilities. We do  not  wish
any patient to leave any  of  our  facilities  unhappy.  Together  with  the
communities,  we  will  monitor  the  quality  of  service   and   undertake
corrective action where services do not meet acceptable standards.  We  will
expect every unit, every manager and every employee  to  comply  with  norms
and standards. We will  act  decisively  to  improve  services  and  protect
patients' rights. At the centre of all our plans is  the  desire  to  ensure
that the poor live a better life in our province and our country.

We will focus on training our  frontline  employees  in  customer  care  and
reward those who  do  us  proud  through  our  Khanyisa  service  excellence
awards. Our major focus will be on preventing, management and  treatment  of
diseases  of  poverty,  trauma  and  violence,  and  chronic   diseases   of
lifestyles, such as hypertension and diabetes. Obesity rates are  very  high
in our province, and this is  regarded  as  one  of  the  risk  factors  for
developing hypertension, diabetes  and  other  lifestyle-related  illnesses.
Healthy  eating  practices  and  exercise,  as  the  Deputy   Minister   has
indicated, will receive most attention in dealing with these risk factors.

In line with the decision of  national  Government  to  introduce  community
health workers, the province will introduce  3  000  well-trained  community
health workers over the next three years. [Applause.] The programme will  be
launched at the end of July this year, and will be implemented in phases.

Improving access and care for the poor will remain our top priority in  this
term. Access is affected  by  the  availability  of  affordable  drugs,  and
bringing staff and health care facilities closer  to  the  people.  In  this
regard, we support  the  medicine  pricing  regulations  introduced  by  the
Minister and her endeavours to retain skills in the public sector.

We have also made a firm undertaking to recruit more  staff  in  the  coming
five years to address increasing pressures on our  services  and  to  ensure
our capacity to provide quality health care services to all our people.

To ensure that we bring services closer to where people  live,  we  plan  to
build 10 new  clinics.  These  clinics  will  be  built  in  Soshanguve  and
Eersterus in Pretoria,  Orange  Farm  and  Eldorado  Park  in  Johannesburg,
Randfontein, Atteridgeville, Everton,  Orlando,  Boikhutsong  and  Cullinan.
Three new clinics will be built in Mamelodi, Zola and the Kathorus  area  in
the coming five  years.  The  construction  of  the  new  Pretoria  Academic
Hospital is nearing completion, and I want to thank  the  Minister  for  her
support in ensuring that we have this modern facility.

HIV and Aids continue to place a heavy burden on families,  communities  and
the health sector. There is still no cure for the disease and we are  called
upon to respond to this epidemic in  a  comprehensive  manner,  focusing  on
education,   prevention,   counselling,   testing,   care,   treatment   and
management.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr E M SOGONI: Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson,  Ministers  of
Social Development and Health, hon members, MECs for Social Development  and
Health, leaders and members of civil society, distinguished  guests,  ladies
and gentlemen, I am honoured to take the podium and address this  House  for
the first time in my capacity as Deputy Minister of Social  Development  and
in support of Budget Vote No 19.

In the short period since my  appointment,  I  have  had  the  privilege  of
interacting with Social Development  MECs  and  have  visited  some  of  our
provinces to receive a briefing on this sector. I take this  opportunity  to
acknowledge the efforts of our provincial  governments.  Indeed,  your  work
and the work of  this  Chamber  remains  critical  to  the  integration  and
implementation  of  a  comprehensive  social  protection  system  that  will
ultimately realise the mandate of a better life for all.

We are well aware that for us to speedily  address  our  contract  with  our
people, we must provide for a thorough and concerted departure away  from  a
dependency-based welfare system to people-centred development. This  people-
centred approach implies that we  must  build  on  the  solutions  that  our
people have on the ground. I have, in these few months, been struck  by  the
resilient spirit of our people who, despite  these  challenges,  have  risen
and developed their own projects  and  programmes  that  have  ensured  that
their destiny is in their own hands.

Madam Chair, I take this opportunity to recognise the gallant spirit of  the
cadres who participate in initiatives such as the Bokamoso  Life  Centre  in
Winterveld, the Bosasa Youth Centres in Gauteng, and those  in  the  Western
Cape and Limpopo which deal with the rehabilitation of children in  conflict
with  the  law.  Such  initiatives,  through  the  utilisation  of  existing
community facilities and capacities, have ensured  that  community  members,
in particular young people, are successfully trained in  life  and  business
skills with a view to impacting  on  employing.  Such  initiatives  dovetail
neatly with the anticipated outcomes  and  overall  goals  of  the  Expanded
Public  Works  Programme,  which  requires  the  active  participation   and
partnership amongst private, public and civil society sectors.

For us to adequately partner with such initiatives that are  driven  by  our
people, we must accelerate and deepen the transformation process within  the
welfare sector so as to meaningfully address  the  huge  socioeconomic  ills
that face our society. What has become obvious to us is that  these  sectors
of our society cannot be isolated from communities  or  families.  Thus  our
emphasis is on the restoration of family and communal values.
In this, the International Year of the Family and 10 years  of  freedom,  we
will accelerate our interventions at the family level, with the emphasis  on
working closer with local government because this sphere  of  governance  is
at the centre of our delivery strategy. In this regard  we  will,  over  the
next  six  months,  engage  various  local  governments,   including   local
government  co-ordinating  structures  such  as  Salga,  so  as  to  clarify
overlapping policy areas, such as  the  indigent  policy,  while  developing
common programmes of action.

We remain focused  on  our  goal  of  ensuring  that  all  services  to  the
vulnerable  are  delivered  in  a  manner  that  is  integrated,  effective,
dignified, and even more importantly in a manner that  empowers  communities
so that they rely less on the state and more on their ingenuity  and  power.
In order to  attain  this,  we  must  double  our  efforts  to  ensure  that
collaboration and  co-operation  within  and  amongst  all  the  spheres  of
government happens more effectively. In order to adequately do so,  we  have
to pay greater attention to the organisations in civil society  sector  that
continue to work very closely with our people.

In addressing this priority  area,  we  will  firstly  finalise  the  sector
financing policy  by  December  2004,  to  address  the  challenges  of  co-
ordination,  governance,  financing  and  accountability  of   organisations
functioning in the sector.

A study on  the  nonprofit  sector,  conducted  by  the  University  of  the
Witwatersrand and the John Hopkins  University,  revealed  that  there  were
just over 100 000 nonprofit organisations functioning  in  South  Africa  in
1998. The operating expenses of these NPOs totalled R9,3 billion.  The  bulk
of  these  operating  expenses  is  covered  by   voluntary   and   variable
contributions,  thus  signalling  that  we  must  address   and   accelerate
financing of this important sector.

In  anticipation  of  the  outcomes  of  the  draft  financing  policy,  our
department has set aside over R18 million this year to finance the  work  of
the national councils. However, we have  to  pay  urgent  attention  to  the
following  issues:  the  manner  in  which  these  councils  deliver   their
services, the beneficiaries  of  the  services  provided  by  councils,  the
manner in which these councils are configured, constituted and  capacitated.
The answers to the above questions will dictate to us the  manner  in  which
we integrate and align the work of the  councils  to  support  our  people's
contract for a better life, which the President elaborated on in  his  state
of the nation address.

Drug and  substance  abuse  are  factors  which  are  at  the  core  of  the
disintegration  of  the  moral  fibre  that  previously  held  together  our
families and communities.  The  abuse  of  drugs  such  as  alcohol,  dagga,
mandrax, cocaine, heroin  and  crystal  methamphetamine,  which  is  locally
known  as  ``tik'',  is  beginning  to  affect  the  hearts  and  minds  and
creativity  of  our  community  members,  particularly  children  and  young
people.

The fact that drugs are being sold to children as  young  as  nine  and  14,
signals to us that we must begin to mount a total co-ordinated onslaught  on
the drug peddlers and pushers who are selling drugs to  our  youngsters.  In
this  regard,  I  commend  the  Western  Cape  provincial   government   for
addressing   the   epidemic   associated   with   the   abuse   of   crystal
methamphetamine  amongst  the  youth  through  a  sustained  and  integrated
campaign involving  the  Departments  of  Education,  Safety  and  Security,
Social Services and Poverty Alleviation, and the Premier.

I further take this opportunity to commend  the  Department  of  Health  for
efforts to address the effects of and  prevention  of  substance  abuse,  in
particular the fight against fetal alcohol syndrome,  recognising  the  link
between women abuse, alcohol abuse and poverty in De  Aar  where  the  fetal
alcohol syndrome is amongst the highest in the world. Prof  Viljoen  of  the
Foundation for Alcohol-Related Research, with the support  of  the  MEC  for
Health in the Northern Cape, Dr Malusi, established a safe house where  care
for  vulnerable  pregnant  women  is  integrated  with  skills   development
projects to assist such women to become more self-sufficient.  This  project
is a good example of partnerships  that  are  possible  between  Government,
donor and private sectors to address social problems in an integrated way.

Our fight against substance abuse will require that we  place  our  children
at the centre of strategies so as to  equip  them  with  the  knowledge  and
courage to say: ``Nee dankie, ek is fine sonder drugs.'' [No  thank  you,  I
am  fine  without  drugs.]  To  successfully  do  so,  we  must  ensure  the
involvement of other stakeholders, including members of this House. To  this
end,  my  department,  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry  of  Safety  and
Security, the Central Drug Authority and the United Nations Office on  Drugs
and Crime, has launched the Ke Moja campaign, which means:  ``No  thanks,  I
am fine without drugs.''

The success of this campaign will lie in  its  ability  to  adapt  to  local
conditions and dialects. If we are to reach those at risk, we must speak  in
the language that is relevant and understandable  to  them.  To  spread  the
message, we will require the involvement of all media.  In  this  regard,  I
thank the SABC  and  print  media,  who  have  highlighted  the  problem  of
substance abuse in the past three months.

I urge the media to assist  Government  in  also  reporting  on  efforts  of
Government to address the problems and to take the Ke Moja campaign  to  all
corners of our nation. Such an effort will complement our efforts to  review
and implement the National Drug Master Plan which we have been  tasked  with
co-ordinating over  the  past  five  years.  This  plan  will  require  that
communities be actively involved in its  implementation  through  innovative
instruments such as the establishment of provincial  and  local-level  anti-
drug forums, which will complement the work of the central  drug  authority.
The challenges  will  be  the  integration  of  such  forums  into  existing
community structures so as to ensure co-ordinated action.

The challenge presented by alcohol, drug and substance  abuse  is  a  global
phenomenon and social ill. In this regard, South Africa has  ratified  three
international conventions, including the 1999 UN Convention Against  Illicit
Trafficking in Narcotics and Psycho-tropic Substances. In order  to  further
facilitate the implementation of these protocols, we will host a  delegation
from the International Narcotics Control Board this  week  with  a  view  to
closing our borders and communities to drugs.

The National Drug Master Plan is up for review and renewal in 2004,  and  in
this process we shall refine the operations of the CDA to  more  effectively
implement the Prevention and Treatment of Drug Dependency  Act  of  1992  as
amended in 1999.

In order to advance an integrated approach to combating substance abuse,  we
will, on the 26th of this month, mark the  International  Day  Against  Drug
Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking. Several activities  will  be  undertaken
which once again will require the participation of  all  within  the  social
development sector, including members of this House.  The  main  event  will
happen in Kimberley, and I trust that similar activities are being  held  in
all the other provinces.

This month began with the focus  on  the  rights  of  children  through  the
International Children's Day. I also  take  this  opportunity  to  echo  the
Minister's appeal to this  House  to  assist  with  the  expedition  of  the
Children's Bill. During this month of June, which is Youth  Month,  we  must
also begin to actively engage young people in  their  development.  To  this
end, my department forms part of the national youth  development  machinery,
which includes the National Youth Commission,  the  SA  Youth  Council,  the
Umsobomvu Youth Fund and all the departments, as well as  other  spheres  of
our government.

Through the national youth development strategy and programmes, such as  the
youth in service  programme,  we  will  seek  to  elaborate  on  the  social
dimensions  for  youth  development  during  this  financial  year.  Through
programmes such as the Voices of the Youth on Social  Security  and  Poverty
hearings we intend to host in the provinces as from 26 July  2004,  we  will
elaborate  on  the  key  and  non-negotiable  development  requirements  and
programmes that should be put in  place,  particularly  for  the  vulnerable
youth. Such requirements will require  the  active  engagement  of  all  our
sectors,  including  the  private  sector,  and  will   also   require   the
cultivation of an active young social development cadre.

The experience of the last decade  has  shown  that  our  development  as  a
nation requires that we  formulate  a  focus  approach  on  early  childhood
development sector. In this regard, throughout this financial year our  goal
is to focus on efforts in this neglected sector within the  context  of  the
Expanded Public Works Programme, as the Minister has already stated.

We will, therefore, endeavour to work more closely with the  Departments  of
Education and Health so as to focus on  the  emotional,  spiritual,  mental,
moral, physical and social  development  needs  of  our  children,  who  are
indeed our  most  precious  resources.  Protecting  children  from  poverty,
abuse, neglect and other forms of  vulnerability  remains  a  key  priority,
whilst at the same time enhancing skills development and creation of work.

Our focus on removing our people from vulnerability has seen  my  department
gradually increasing the number of people with disabilities into the  social
security safety  net.  We  must,  however,  begin  to  develop  a  concerted
programme of integration of people with disabilities into the mainstream  of
our society. To this end, we  have,  this  year,  set  aside  more  than  R5
million so as to develop a specific and integrated service  delivery  policy
and programme for people  with  disabilities.  These  measures  will  target
disabled people who are vulnerable and live in conditions of poverty.

Over the years we have emphasised  the  need  to  integrate  older  persons'
needs into our policies and programmes, including our programmes on HIV  and
Aids. To this end, we will double our efforts in the implementation  of  the
Madrid Plan of Action with a view to integrating  all  the  needs  of  older
persons, including the requirements for HIV and Aids,  awareness  programmes
amongst the elderly as  caregivers,  and  sexually  active  members  of  our
community. In order to adequately do so, I must echo the Ministers plea  for
your assistance in  finalising  the  Older  Persons  Bill  as  a  matter  of
urgency.

In conclusion, in the 10 years of  our  democracy,  we  have  done  well  to
address the terrible social ills that we had inherited  from  apartheid.  We
have laid the foundation of transforming welfare  services,  while  focusing
on casting a social security net to sustain those who  are  most  vulnerable
through making grants more accessible.

Entry into the global economy presents  new  challenges  requiring  coherent
and integrated efforts across different departments and tiers of  government
to make poor South Africans economically productive. Equally serious is  the
challenge to prevent the poor and vulnerable from falling prey to  organised
crime and traffickers of drugs and  human  beings  across  our  borders  and
within our communities.

Our efforts must be complemented by sustainable partnerships, which have  to
be sector-wide and inclusive of ordinary people and their  organisations.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Ms K MQULWANA (Western Cape):  Thanks  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister  Dr  Zola
Skweyiya, hon Minister of Health, Dr Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang,  the  Deputy
Minister of Social Development, MECs for Health from  other  provinces,  hon
members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  are  proud  to  participate  in  this
important budget policy debate.

This happened just as our province, the Western Cape,  joined  the  rest  of
the country politically. For this reason we thank our people  for  mandating
us to continue pursuing the people's  contract  to  create  work  and  fight
poverty. The main challenge facing us  now  is  translating  this  political
mandate into a reality for the millions of ordinary South Africans.

As  a  starting  point,  the  department  of  social  services  and  poverty
alleviation has established a number of programmes aimed  at  improving  the
lives of our people. As we celebrate the international year of  the  family,
we have placed early  childhood  development  at  the  centre  of  community
regeneration. Further, as we continue rebuilding our community  we  have  to
ensure  that  we  nurture   a   new   South   African   citizen   that   is,
psychologically, politically and socially developed at a very early age.

According to information recently released  by  the  World  Bank,  there  is
growing evidence of how critical the early years are to  child  development.
To give  meaning  to  the  early  childhood  development  programme  we  are
consulting with individual experts from  institutions  of  higher  learning,
the  private  sector   and   various   individuals   in   transforming   and
rationalising  the  ECD  sector  in  our  province.  The  lack  of  suitable
facilities, shortages of resources and the absence of trained and  qualified
ECD educators continue to characterise the day to day running  of  childcare
centres around  our  province.  The  absence  of  an  adequate,  formal  ECD
programme has led to many children  being  cared  for  by  informal  daycare
caregivers.

As we speak, the Ministry has  commissioned  a  study  to  look  at  how  to
formalise  this  sector  and  to  address  social,  political  and  economic
imbalances  of  the  past.  This  will  focus  on  the  following  terms  of
reference: Identify all informal  and  semiformal  ECD  centres  in  various
communities, assess them and identify the  type  of  support  they  need  to
develop into a  fully  fledged  ECD  centre;  identify  training  needs  and
guidelines for the development of  skills  in  early  childhood  development
work; set clear targets to ensure family  support  and  the  development  of
good quality  care  in  the  community  and  create  a  network  capable  of
supporting and developing the  more  marginalised  child  facility,  monitor
progress  and  the  correct  use  of  developmental  resources   at   funded
facilities, while ensuring that many preschools are brought up  to  standard
in preparing children for school readiness.

Last month we launched the child protection month in Danoon,  where  parents
appealed to Government to intensify the campaign at aiming  to  ensure  that
the girl-child is safe from abuse. In response to this cry, and in  a  clear
contract with our community, we are developing a programme  to  address  the
continuous protection of children in our province.

We gather in this important forum at a time when our province is  under  the
onslaught of a very dangerous drug called  tik.  According  to  researchers,
German, Japanese and American soldiers used this drug during the  war  as  a
catalyst to avoid exhaustion and depression. Because of this substance,  the
youth in our province are becoming addicted at a very early age. It  is  for
this reason that we are looking at multipronged strategy to  fight  it.  Our
province  is  also  involved  in  rehabilitation  programmes  such  as   the
Masiphumelele rehabilitation programme. We thank members  of  the  religious
and business community and community leaders for their involvement  in  this
programme. We suddenly learnt that our province has the  highest  number  of
children in conflict with the law. It is against  this  background  that  we
are not  remaining  silent,  but  continuing  to  address  general  problems
affecting young people in our province.

We welcome the announcement made by our premier regarding the  establishment
of the youth commission in order to  sensitise  Government  on  the  broader
needs and aspirations of young people. It is important for me  to  emphasise
that it is only taking place after ten years  in  our  province.  It  is  an
unfortunate situation that after  ten  years,  this  province  is  only  now
announcing the establishment of the youth commission.

Young people encounter horrible experiences on a daily basis. These  include
HIV/Aids, STDs, gangsterism, substance abuse, a  high  school  dropout  rate
and unemployment. A number of activities and programmes are in the  pipeline
to respond to these challenges.

In line with our commitment to the moral regeneration  of  our  society,  we
will pay special attention to the living  conditions  of  our  grannies  and
grandfathers in our centres for the aged. The principle of ubuntu and  Batho
Pele will define the behaviour of our caregivers in  these  institutions  to
ensure that our elders receive the respect and dignity they deserve.

It is important for me to outline in this forum that one of  the  challenges
facing us in this institution is still a lack of transformation.  After  ten
years in our province there are institutions  that  are  not  in  line  with
government policies. So, we are faced with  that  particular  challenge.  In
order  to  deal  with  both  the  shortages  of  these  facilities  in   the
historically disadvantaged communities, as well as the  cultural  diversity,
the relevant directorate within our  department  has  been  commissioned  to
investigate the possibility of establishing daycare centres  using  existing
facilities in most needed areas. We should also welcome  the  Older  Persons
Bill that seeks to protect  our  senior  citizens.  Minister  Zola  Skweyiya
recently announced in his budget speech that national  Government  is  faced
with the challenge of registering 900 000 children  for  the  child  support
grant. In our province, the number translates to 93 000.  As  a  result  our
department will be embarking on a door-to-door campaign to the  poorest  and
the most remote communities in our  province.  We  will  be  launching  that
particular programme on the 28th, and I wish to announce that we  are  doing
this jointly with Home Affairs. We are being assisted  by  Home  Affairs  in
terms of the levy that communities are supposed to pay when they  apply  for
birth certificates and IDs. With the joint programme  our  communities  will
be able to do that free of charge.

We are proud to announce that the campaign will cover all  the  municipality
districts of our province. To  ensure  the  success  of  this  campaign  the
ministry of social  service  will  work  very  closely  with  the  community
involved in identifying social  problems  confronting  our  people.  As  the
Western Cape province, we rise to support Vote No 19.

Mr M S GININDA  (Mpumalanga):  Chairperson,  the  Minister  of  Health,  the
Minister of Social Development, Deputy Ministers, members of the Council  of
Provinces and ladies and gentlemen, it is a singular honour for me  to  take
part in this debate on the occasion of the  Department  of  Health's  Budget
Vote on behalf of the MEC for Social Services for Mpumalanga province, Mr  S
W Sibisi.

I concur with the Minister of Health when she so eloquently  addressed  this
august House on the progress that we have made during  the  past  decade  in
our country. The  challenges  have  been  enormous,  but  through  sustained
interventions we have managed to improve the quality of care that  has  been
rendered to the masses of our people. I support  fully  the  hon  Minister's
view on the need for  sustainable  policies  so  as  to  promote  equitable,
accessible and good quality services.

Mpumalanga, being a  rural  province,  subscribes  fully  to  promoting  the
interests of the poor and the destitute. The hon  Minister  focused  on  the
ten-point plan for the public health sector as well on  the  key  priorities
on matters that would impact positively on the health status of our  people,
and I want to re-emphasise that we, as  a  province,  align  ourselves  with
this vision.

In  Mpumalanga  primary  health  care  remains  the  key  strategy  for  the
department   in   rendering   quality   health   services.   The    hospital
revitalisation programme which focuses  on  four  main  components,  namely,
organisational development, infrastructure  development,  health  technology
management and quality assurance will go a long way  in  ensuring  that  our
hospitals, over a period of time,  become  facilities  that  would  make  us
proud as a nation.

Organisational development empowers  hospital  management  with  appropriate
delegation and skills to manage their facilities  and  be  held  accountable
for the resources under their control.  Infrastructure  development  ensures
that the physical structure of the hospital is relevant and  appropriate  to
the 21st  century  norms  and  standards  and  the  maintenance  thereof  is
strictly adhered  to.  Health  technology  management  ensures  that  public
hospitals have the latest and  most  appropriate  equipment  to  render  the
necessary services to our patients. Quality assurance  ensures  that  public
hospitals maintain a  quality  service  that  is  in  line  with  the  level
provided in the private sector within the resources available.

The envisaged pricing regulations will make  medicines  more  affordable  to
communities, and this would be a great relief  to  many  of  our  people  in
Mpumalanga. The  department  is  embarking  aggressively  on  private-public
partnerships, which have been identified as a key priority by the  Minister.
This initiative that is aimed at promoting constant and  respectful  contact
with our communities is enthusiastically welcomed.

The province supports the Minister's  commitment  to  holding  izimbizo,  in
that by doing so we will further entrench  the  principle  of  participatory
democracy and consultation with the masses of our people. On behalf  of  the
hon MEC, I want to thank the hon  Minister  and  her  department  for  their
visionary  leadership   and   commitment   to   continue   making   decisive
interventions in the promotion of quality health care in  the  interests  of
the poor.

The department of social services is faced with critical challenges and  the
transition  to  the  envisaged  agency  must  not  negatively   affect   the
recipients of social grants. It must not cause insecurity  to  those  public
servants employed by the Department of Social Development at this  point  in
time. So far the process is run fairly and we are confident that  that  will
be the case up to the end. The improved and improving services  rendered  by
this department are most welcome. The poorest of  the  poor  and  the  needy
people are being taken care of. Thank you all for that. Thank you,  Dr  Zola
Skweyiya, Minister of Social Development. Thank  you,  Dr  Manto  Shabalala-
Msimang, Minister of Health. Thank  you  all.  We  support  the  two  votes.
[Applause.]

Mr C SEKOATI (Limpopo): Chairperson, Minister of Health, Minister of  Social
Development and Welfare, Deputy Ministers present here, hon members  of  the
NCOP, fellow MECs of Health and Social Development, we  would  firstly  like
to tell you that we appreciate the rare opportunity  given  to  us  by  this
House to participate in this most important debate. We do so mindful of  the
fact  that  our  people  have  renewed   our   mandate   to   continue   the
Reconstruction and Development Programme we adopted 10 years ago.

The primary health care policy adopted by this Government gives us  guidance
on how we should go about increasing access to health care. To this end,  we
managed to upgrade 68 dilapidated clinics and were also able  to  erect  109
new ones. We have ensured that 292  clinics  provide  24-hour  comprehensive
primary health care services, and in the current financial year  we  aim  to
raise this figure to 332. We are particularly happy with the results of  the
increased access to  these  primary  health  care  facilities.  We  saw  the
citizens of Limpopo responding  by  increasing  their  primary  health  care
utilisation rate from 1,9 visits per person per year in 1994 to  2,6  visits
in 2004. One of our major goals remains that of joining hands with the  rest
of the Southern African Development Community in eradicating polio by 2005.

The province managed to maintain the malaria incidence at acceptable  levels
through the spraying of 850  000  units.  However,  the  emergence  of  drug
resistant malaria remains a challenge which we are  tackling  together  with
our sister provinces of Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, and  in  collaboration
of  our  neighbouring  countries  of  Mozambique  and  Zimbabwe.  While  the
provision of electricity and water to  clinics  remains  a  challenge,  some
progress has been made. A recent electricity audit resulted  in  89  clinics
being electrified with funds that have been  set  aside  for  this  purpose.
Water has already been supplied to some 64 clinics with  no  reliable  water
supply during the previous financial year.

Our efforts to extend primary health care to areas where  we  have  not  yet
managed to put up fixed clinics is through  mobile  clinics.  However,  this
effort has been frustrated by criminal elements which  threaten  and  hijack
our vehicles. We are confident that this  endeavour  will  further  increase
access to primary health care services in our rural areas.

Our emergency medical service's response is still a challenge,  particularly
in rural areas. We have increased ambulance stations from 7 to 18,  as  well
as procured 95 new ambulances. Our average response time is still more  than
one hour. These delays are attributed to poor communication  and  poor  road
infrastructure.

We remain committed to the National Five-Year Plan to deal with the  scourge
of HIV/Aids, sexually transmitted infectious diseases and tuberculosis  with
the aim of translating the marginal stabilisation of the HIV/Aids  infection
rate we had in 1999-01 into an actual reduction. We  are  committed  to  the
implementation of the comprehensive HIV/Aids care management  and  treatment
programme. Preparations to start with  the  programme  are  at  an  advanced
stage.

In an effort to  improve  our  human  resource  capacity,  we  have  awarded
bursaries to 1 685 students since 1997 to pursue health  related  courses  -
850 of whom were sent to study  medicine.  However,  because  of  the  rural
nature of our province, the majority of them would like to pay back in  cash
rather than in service. We are, however, trying to put  some  mechanisms  in
place to ensure that they come and serve their province.

The introduction of rural and scarce skills allowances will go  a  long  way
to assist us in recruiting and returning  these  health  professionals.  For
the past three years we have repeated our call for improved funding  of  the
health  services  in  our  province.  The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review
reflected that we have been the least funded in the  country  for  the  past
three financial years, and the MTEF allocation does  not  necessarily  offer
any solution to the situation. Notwithstanding our vacancy rate  of  46,  it
should be stressed that these vacancies are mainly due  to  the  absence  of
highly skilled professionals  like  doctors  and  other  specialists.  Their
absence is coupled with a severe shortage of  accommodation  for  those  who
would like to join us in the province. If the vacancies were  to  be  filled
successfully, that might probably double  the  personnel  expenditure.  Note
must also be taken that health is a labour intensive function, and  we  will
therefore require more funding for personnel.

It is a reality that our welfare services in Limpopo received 25,7%  of  the
total provincial budget,  which  is  7,7%  more  than  the  equitable  share
formula guide, while health services received  16,4%  instead  of  19%.  The
allocation  received  was  40,7%  instead  of  41%,  and  the  rest  of  the
department in the province will have to share  17%  instead  of  22%.  Given
this scenario, it's a clear indication that the equitable share  formula  is
not talking to the  realities  we  are  facing.  We  therefore  welcome  and
support the review of this equitable share formula.

It is a well-known fact that Limpopo is a  province  adversely  affected  by
the influx of immigrants from neighbouring countries  and  inland  migratory
labour practices, like our sister province, the Eastern Cape.  With  regards
to the latter, the scenario is that economically active persons spend  their
career lives in the industrial provinces of Gauteng, and later come back  to
our province after retirement  where  they  add  to  the  numbers  of  those
qualifying for receiving grants.

This kind  of  a  situation  leads  to  inaccurate  budget  projections  and
planning. It is in this connection that we would like  to  share  with  this
House that in our attempt to reach out to the poor and  the  vulnerable,  we
find ourselves experiencing high overexpenditure  on  our  budget.  This  is
precisely due to the fact that year in year out our application intake  rate
exceeds both national and  provincial  targets  by  far.  A  further  budget
pressure emanates from the recent court judgment in favour of noncitizens.

It is interesting to note that while our total budget of  R6,2  billion  for
the current financial year represents 25,7% of the total provincial  budget,
thus exceeding the national equitable share formula of 18%,  in  real  terms
it only reflects 92% for social assistance grants, with  only  8%  remaining
for  administrative  costs  and  other  social  development  services.   The
situation results in high levels of risk and corruption in our  service  due
to staff shortages and inadequate infrastructure. It is our considered  view
that giving the social assistance grants  often  crowd  out  our  provincial
priorities. The shifting of the function  to  the  agency  would  result  in
adequate funding for  other  social  welfare  services  and  poverty  relief
programmes that will subsequently fall under the provincial competence.

We remain confident that we will  do  all  we  can  to  continue  exercising
appropriate fiscal discipline without necessarily infringing on  the  rights
of the poor and the vulnerable. We would like to take  this  opportunity  to
thank the Minister of Social Development for his relentless effort  to  make
sure that no child  goes  to  bed  without  having  had  a  meal.  With  the
conditional grant of R573 million for a child support  grant  extension  for
children aged nine and 10 this current financial year, we will  be  able  to
meet, if not exceed, the target in our province.

In spite of the  budgetary  challenges,  we  have  successfully  managed  to
implement policies and programmes that are focused on  alleviating  poverty.
Amongst others, we have made significant  interventions  in  various  areas,
such as subsidising  961  crèches  with  the  intention  to  increasing  the
numbers during this current financial year. It is worth noting that most  of
these crèches are in rural areas. The department also supports  the  network
for home-based care of persons infected and affected by HIV/Aids.

We have so far initiated community  home-based  care  projects  and  drop-in
centres to provide children with breakfast, lunch and supper, as well as  an
uniform for schooling. We anticipate establishing 18  more  drop-in  centres
in this current financial year. The number of foster care placements  stands
at 11 984 for the past financial year, with  an  increasing  backlog  to  be
addressed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R STADHOUER (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, maybe I should give one  of
my minutes to the MEC  to  conclude.  Hon  Ministers  Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang and Dr Skweyiya, hon Deputy Ministers, hon MECs, hon members,  allow
me to also congratulate the Ministers, the Deputy Ministers and the MECs  on
their appointments to these positions, strategic to  realising  the  concept
of a people's contract.

As we celebrate 10 years of democracy,  it  is  important  to  consider  the
social gains that we have made in order to address the basic  needs  of  our
people. Since 1994 millions and millions of rands have  been  spent  on  the
rendering of quality and excellent health care services to our country,  and
especially to the poorest of  the  poor.  However,  and  I  speak  from  the
perspective of the Northern Cape, the vastness and the rural nature  of  the
Northern Cape, the increasing demand for specialised  services,  the  cross-
border situation and the budgetary  constraints  that  we  experience,  make
service delivery difficult and very costly. Maybe these factors  contributed
to the overexpenditure you have mentioned, hon Minister.  We  take  note  of
that and we are busy addressing these issues.

Nevertheless, the  concept  of  a  people's  contract  to  create  jobs  and
eradicate poverty, but also to build a healthy caring nation, is slowly  but
surely  coming  into  realisation.  Therefore,  the  health  budget  of  the
Northern Cape focuses on employment strategies, cost  containment  measures,
the  quality  of  health  care,  the  improvement  of   communication,   the
maintenance  of  health   care   facilities,   a   rollout   programme   for
antiretrovirals,  and  learnerships  to  expand  the  volume  of  healthcare
practitioners in our province.

We will maximise our labour component. We  will  be  employing  doctors,  as
well as enrolled  and  auxiliary  nurses  during  this  financial  year.  In
addition, we will strengthen our relationship with NGOs and CBOs  to  ensure
and grant them the opportunity to  employ  more  volunteers  in  the  health
arena, like the Dots  workers,  the  VCT  and  home-based  caregivers.  Very
important, we will engage the social cluster to  maximise  service  delivery
in a co-ordinated, effective and efficient manner.
It is important for us to investigate our policies towards service  delivery
areas to eradicate wastage and inefficiencies and, if needed,  new  policies
will be developed. Current cost  containment  measures  implemented  in  the
previous  financial  year  in  key  solving  areas  will  be  maintained  at
reasonable levels. As I mentioned earlier, the  Financial  Management  Units
within the department are being  strengthened  through  the  appointment  of
additional and appropriately qualified personnel at all  levels  of  service
delivery. Once again, taking into account the vastness and the ruralness  of
our province, it is imperative to have sound financial systems in  place  in
order for us to spread our wings and to stretch our rands and  cents  to  do
more and to do better for our people. So,  before  October  this  year,  all
managers will be trained or refreshed on general  financial  management  and
the implementation of the PFMA.

Our Quality Assurance Unit will ensure that we  focus  and  improve  on  the
quality of health care throughout the province. We  hope  that  the  systems
put in place to carry out the constitutional  mandate  of  providing  proper
and safe health care to our people will bear fruit. In  fact,  we  have  now
fully grasped the proverb that says, ``A journey of a thousand miles  begins
with a single step''. In 1994 we took the first  step,  and  now,  a  decade
later, our people have more access to better healthcare services  than  they
have ever enjoyed in this country before.

Together with that, the principles of Batho Pele should be instilled  -  not
only in our provincial hospitals, in our clinics and in our big  cities  and
towns, but should  be  spread  throughout  the  province  as  a  whole.  The
national objectives, as set out by  the  national  Minister  in  her  budget
speech, support our vision as a department in the Northern  Cape,  which  is
to provide excellent, holistic, people-centred and  affordable  health  care
to all our people. We welcome the conditional grant to the Northern Cape  to
fund the HIV and Aids programmes. In July  this  year,  the  people  of  our
province will also benefit from this conditional grant by  also  being  able
to access the antiretroviral treatment, thus joining the other provinces  in
South Africa with regards to this rollout.  All  systems  are  in  place  to
start with this rollout programme.

Despite our commitment to the people of the Northern Cape,  we  support  all
recent legislation and amendments to  earlier  legislation  passed.  As  the
national Minister  has  stated,  we  need  to  strengthen  the  health  care
services in rural and  underserved  areas.  This  has  rightly  resulted  in
interventions like the scarce-skills allowances, as  part  of  the  Expanded
Community Services System.

The implementation of community services for nurses  as  from  January  2005
was well received and is a very positive step. In the Northern Cape  we  are
pleased to announce that we are already seeing a renewed interest  from  our
staff in moving into the smaller towns and villages of our  province.  While
we continue to support and strengthen the treatment  of  other  communicable
diseases, the major part of our work is the thorough implementation  of  the
Comprehensive Plan for the Management, Care and the  Treatment  of  HIV  and
Aids. The allocation for HIV and Aids has been increased from R11,2  million
from the previous financial year, to almost R31,8 million - an  increase  of
almost 180%.

In conclusion, the health department of the Northern Cape will  continue  to
carry out its objectives in line with the national  Department  of  Health's
strategy. We are committed to achieving our vision through a  decentralised,
accountable, accessible and constantly improving health care  system  within
available resources. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N M MADLALA: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon Deputy Ministers,  hon  MECs
from different provinces, hon members and  comrades,  when  looking  at  our
budget for this 10th year of democracy, it is perhaps  appropriate  to  look
back at how far we have come since the ANC first came into power.

One of the most important tasks that the ANC-led Government had with  regard
to  health  in  1994,  was  to  ensure  that  every  single  South  African,
regardless of race, colour or creed, had access to  essential  health  care.
We had to deal with a racially fragmented health service that  did  not  see
fit to care for every sick person, but rather cared for only a few,  to  the
detriment of the majority.

Clearly, a health system that  discriminated  against  people  along  racial
lines had no place in our new democracy. We, therefore, had  to  reconstruct
and transform the health system completely  to  be  in  line  with  our  new
democratic agenda. Provinces, particularly those that  had  large  stretches
of rural areas, found themselves with little or no  health  facilities,  and
even  less  skilled  doctors,   nurses,   pharmacists   and   other   health
professionals.  Even  in  urban  areas,  public   health   facilities   were
overcrowded in black townships,  and  completely  underutilised  where  they
were located in white suburbs.

Hospitals were usually the  first  place  people  went  to  for  even  minor
ailments, while clinics and day hospitals played a minor role to divert  the
pressure away from large hospitals.  This  influx  led  to  long  queues  of
people that could not even be serviced in a complete day, leaving people  to
come back again and again.

The majority of  our  people  used  public  hospitals  facilities,  yet  the
private health care sector consumed 60% of health spending. This meant  that
private health care catered for only 25% of the population. However, it  was
particularly with regard to the price of medicines that this Government  had
to wage its biggest battle. All we wanted was that the  ordinary  person  in
Polokwane could go to  the  clinic  and  pay  a  reasonable  price  for  the
medication that would make her well again.

Instead, large pharmaceutical companies  took  our  Minister  to  court  and
argued that we could not do parallel importation  of  generic  medicines  in
order  to  bring  down  the  prices  of  medicines.  These  companies   were
protective of profits to the detriment of the health  of  our  people.  Even
such basics as the training  of  health  care  practitioners  were  done  in
racially segregated institutions. Largely  white-run  tertiary  institutions
were hostile towards black students entering these  institutions,  and  made
acceptance criteria deliberately out  of  reach  of  black  students.  Black
professionals, therefore, were few and far in between.

So, one could take each aspect of health and  would  find  that,  generally,
the health needs of the majority of our people were not a priority  for  the
previous regime. Those who ran those health care  institutions  had  extreme
difficulty in understanding what we meant when we said we wanted  access  to
health care for all. It, therefore, became a  huge  responsibility  for  the
new leadership to try and turn around such a system, and bring about  change
that guaranteed that all of us would become a healthy nation.

The challenge, as during the first 10 years, remains there  for  us  to  try
and implement some of the changes that we have put  into  our  policies  and
legislation. The budget is the key to  try  and  implement  the  new  policy
direction. For example, in programme three, health service  delivery,  where
provincial and local spheres of government benefit, the funding has  had  to
shift  from  those  provinces  which  were  historically   advantaged   and,
therefore, had superior services to those provinces which were  barely  able
to cope with the allocation given to them. Without  this  drastic  shift  in
allocation, important services such as those for the prevention and  control
of diseases, hospital services, emergency medical services,  human  resource
development and management, would not be  implemented  with  equity  as  its
cornerstone.

The department's commitment to support  the  development  of  a  sustainable
network of hospitals is important for those provinces  that  are  physically
far removed from scarce skills. The network allows for learnt lessons to  be
supported, translated and shared by everyone in the network.

Also commendable is the  hospital  revitalisation  programme,  according  to
which 27 hospitals will  be  either  upgraded  or  completely  replaced.  To
anyone who has been to some of the provincial  hospitals,  this  is  clearly
long overdue. Other provinces have had no hospitals at all, and people  have
had to cope with travelling great distances for services  that  should  have
been on their doorsteps.  In  some  cases,  they  even  had  to  go  without
professional services.

Primary health care is not reaching its full potential in  provinces.  There
has been fluctuating spending patterns in primary health  care  since  1992,
when public health spending on primary health care  was  11%  and  was  then
increased to 21% in 1996. This fluctuation is attributed  to  the  differing
allocations between various municipalities. In the department's  own  health
sector strategic framework, 1999-04, or its 10-point  plan,  they  undertook
to speed up the delivery of an essential comprehensive primary  health  care
package.

This means that there is a commitment to ensure that committees  are  active
participants in their  own  health  care  and  to  increase  access  to  and
availability of primary health care services. Since primary health  care  is
one of the key areas of  focus  for  the  ANC,  we  will  be  watching  very
carefully to see  how  the  department  copes  with  the  variances  between
provinces and between local municipalities, to deliver primary  health  care
during the second decade of democracy.

One of the ANC's key areas of  delivery  in  health  is  to  strengthen  the
distribution of drugs, so that they can reach all  of  our  people,  and  to
ensure access  to  affordable  medicine,  including  the  implementation  of
generic substitutions and parallel importation.

If one has followed the recent outcry in the media regarding the  objections
raised by dispensing  doctors  who  are  opposed  to  having  to  apply  for
dispensing licences, and who  have  taken  the  Minister  to  task  on  this
matter, as well as  the  outcry  from  the  pharmacists  and  manufacturers,
distributors, retailers and so forth, who are objecting to the control of  a
single exit price for medicine, then one can only wonder at  the  priorities
of such people.

Already, we  have  people  whose  grave  illnesses  sometimes  go  untreated
because the medicines are too  expensive.  This,  despite  the  department's
requirement that all clinics and hospitals follow the essential  drug  list,
which was geared to help control the cost of medicines and  to  give  health
professionals clear guidelines as to when  to  use  the  drugs.  [Applause.]
[Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson,  in  principle  there
is very little I want to say, except to agree in general with the  trend  of
the discussion that has been going on here on  the  issues  that  have  been
raised by the hon members. I think it is generally what we all think  should
be happening. It can only happen if we all work  together  and  ensure  that
not only the Government itself, but basically everybody participates in  the
process, not only of policy making and implementation, but also  interacting
and working very closely with our constituency.

However, I wish  to  raise  one  issue  that  concerned  me  a  little,  and
specifically the statement that had been made by the  hon  member  from  the
DA, Ms Lamola. She made some remarks about influx control, which leave  much
to be desired. Influx control is one of the things that  made  us  who  come
from the Western Cape get into the struggle, and  to  struggle  against  the
white apartheid regime. It hurts deep into  our  psyche,  into  our  living,
when someone tells us not to move anywhere from where we are.  The  majority
of the people who joined the ANC from 1912 did that mostly  because  of  the
pass laws. If there is still South Africans who  think  in  terms  of  that,
then there is something radically wrong, first with the party  which  he  or
she comes from, or basically within his or her own thinking. I don't  expect
that any member of this  august  body  can  really  be  thinking  of  influx
control. This is a free  country,  with  free  movement.  You  claim  to  be
liberals, and yet you want to stop the natives from coming from the  Western
Cape. That is not going to work! Thank you. [Applause.]
UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMPILO: Sihlalo, ngisukuma  nokubonga  ingxoxo  yanamhlanje.
Ngijabulile ikakhulukazi ukuthi oNgqongqoshe bezifundazwe  basinike  imibiko
yokuthi sesisebenze kanjani ohlelweni lwezempilo. Kwesinye  isikhathi  ngiye
ngicabange  ukuthi  abanye  abantu  abezwa  kahle  kodwa  ngethemba   ukuthi
namhlanje sizizwele ngokwethu.

NgeSonto, laphaya kwami besivalelisa  uDkt  Nono  Simelela  osishiyayo,  uNk
Joanne Collinge -  okhona  lapha,  noMnu  Kgopolang  Sikobe.  Sidanse  kwaze
kwacishe kwasa sibavalelisa ngendlela ebekekileyo.

Ngaphambi kokuthi ngiphendule angicele ukuthi uma siqeda  lapha  sonke  siye
esitezi  sesibili  siyokwehlisa  ngamanzi,  sidle  nenyamana  encane   ukuze
sijabulele  ukuthi  ingxoxo  yanamhlanje  ibalulekile  futhi  ihambe  kahle.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I stand up to thank  you  for  today's
discussion. I am happy that the provincial ministers of  health  have  given
us feedback as to how we have worked with the health programme. I  sometimes
thought that other people did not understand clearly, but  I  hope  that  we
all understood today?

On Sunday, at my place, we had a farewell party for Dr Nono Simelane who  is
leaving us; Ms Joanne  Collinge  who  is  present  here,  and  Mr  Kgopolang
Sikobe. We danced until the early hours of the  morning;  it  was  a  worthy
farewell.

Before I respond, let me request that when we finish here,  we  all  proceed
to the second floor to have something to drink, and a meal to celebrate  the
importance of today's discussion and its success.]

Thank you very much for  the  contributions.  Ngifisa  ukuhalalisela  iPhini
lami ngesinqumo  esilithathile  sokugijima  nokudla  kahle.  Kodwa  ngimyale
ukuthi kufanele abeke  imali  eceleni  yezingubo  zokugqoka  ngoba  njengoba
ehlisa  umzimba  wakhe  kufanele  athenge  nezingubo   ezimlinganayo   ukuze
zingalengi.

Bengithi angiqale ngokusho njalo  bese  ngibonga  kakhulu  ukuthi  namhlanje
kuthiwe  ingxoxo  yanamhlanje  akube   eyethu   sobabili   nozakwethu   uDkt
Sikweyiya. Sengiyabona futhi nalapha ukuthi  onke  amagama  akhe  niwafakile
nathi Dkt Z S T, kepha kimina nathi Dkt M  kuphela.  Igama  lami  eliphelele
nginguMantombazane   Edmie   Kate   Tshabalala-Msimang   owazalwa   kwaCele.
Bengingathokoza-ke uma nami  ningase  ninginikeze  lawo  magama  ami  wonke.
Sihlalo, ngicela ungivikele, ngiyathethiswa ngalapha.

USIHLALO WOMKHANDLU KAZWELONKE WEZIFUNDAZWE: Uvikelekile.

UNGQONGQOSHE  WEZEMPILO:  Ngiyabonga.  Ngithi  ngiyajabula  ukuthi  sixoxile
namhlanje ... (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[I wish to congratulate my deputy for the decision  he  has  made  to  start
jogging and to follow a good diet. However, I have warned her to  put  money
aside for clothing as she is  losing  weight,  and  she  must  buy  properly
fitting clothes so that her clothes do not hang loosely on her.

I thought it was necessary to start by saying that, and  then  thanking  you
for giving opportunities to both Dr Sikweyiya and  me.  I  have  also  noted
that you put all his initials, Dr Z S T, but I am just Dr M. My  full  names
are Mantombazane Edmie Kate Tshabalala-Msimang, nee Cele. I would  be  happy
if you could identify me with those names. [Interjections.]  Chairperson,  I
plead for your protection. I am being shouted at.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You are protected.

The  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Thank  you.  I  am  happy  that  we  are  having
deliberations today ...]
... because I think it begins to indicate the manner in  which  we  want  to
deliver services in  our  country.  Regarding  the  success  of  the  social
security system ...

... bengingakamtsheli uzakwethu ukuthi bengise-Spain  kula  masonto  amabili
edlulile.  Ngifike  ngaxoxa  noNgqongqoshe  omusha  wezempilo  khona   ngase
ngibona ukuthi mhlawumbe kungaba  kuhle,  zakwethu,  uma  singase  sithumele
ithimba khona liyobhekisisa i-social health insurance yakhona,  ikakhulukazi
ngoba iyona nto okudala isibalekela.  Sihlale  sithi  siyayizama  siyayizama
kodwa kungaphumeleleki kahle.

Kodwa-ke  siyoyixoxa  uma  sesiqedile  lapha  ngoba  vele   futhi   sobabili
sisebenzisana   nohlelo   lokunakekelwa   kwabantu   emakhaya,    ukuvikelwa
kokusetshenziswa  kwezidakamizwa  -  uzakwethu   omunye   ukhulume   kabanzi
ngalokho  -  kanti  futhi  sibambisene  nabantu  abakhubazekileyo   ekutheni
singabasiza  kanjani  ukuze  bakwazi  ukuziphilela  izimpilo  zabo  njengoba
befuna. Kukhona futhi nokunakekelwa kwabantwana nabantu asebekhulile.

Ngizophawula mayelana nezinto  ezimbili  nje  kuphela  manje  ngoba  ngifuna
ukuthi sisheshe siye phezulu siyophuza itiye, sidle nenyama. Ngifuna  ukuthi
kuNkk Vilakazi, cha,  dadewethu,  ngidumazeke  kakhulu  ngoba  uyazi  ukuthi
abahlengikazi banezinhlangano zabo  okuyiNehawu  neDenosa.  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[... I have not informed my colleague that I was in  Spain  for  two  weeks,
where I had discussions with that country's new minister of health.  I  felt
that it would be good if we could send a delegation  to  Spain  to  look  at
their social health insurance programme,  particularly  because  it  is  the
only thing that we have been lacking for a long time. We have  been  trying,
but in vain. However, we  will  discuss  it  once  we  have  finished  here,
because  both  of  us  are  obviously  working  on  the  Social  Development
Programme. One of my colleagues spoke at  length  about  the  prevention  of
drug abuse; and we are working together with  physically  challenged  people
to see how we can assist them in living their lives as they wish.  There  is
another programme on childcare and one on the elderly.

I will comment on two issues only, because I want  us  to  finish  early  so
that we could have a meal. I wish to say to Mrs Vilakazi: My  sister,  I  am
disappointed. As you are aware, nurses have their own  organisations,  which
are Nehawu and Denosa.] So, I really am surprised that we can stand up  here
and be prepared to advocate for the rights of the nurses at the  expense  of
the poor people who live in rural  areas.  I  would  have  thought  that  we
should be encouraging the department to say the nurses must go to the  rural
areas. I stand here very committed, and I said in the NA that  if  it  means
amending the Act, we should amend it, even if there is no new Nurses Act  as
yet.

I also want to say very clearly that we will not make rural  allowances  and
scarce skills for people sitting in Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. That  is
not what we are going to do! This money is meant for us  to  prioritise  and
ensure that we  address  issues  of  iniquity  that  we  inherited  in  this
country. Gone are the days when people in the rural areas  did  not  receive
adequate healthcare. So, I am indeed confirming in  this  House  that  these
rural allowances are for that. [Applause.]

Of course, I understand that there  are  some  provinces  that  are  already
paying senior management from these rural allowances, and I think we  should
debate this. We should debate this in the Minmec, and we should really  find
a solution to it, and we  must  take  it  back  to  the  Bargaining  Council
because this is not what this money was  meant  for.  Those  provinces  that
have started doing that must really understand that  this  money  was  meant
for the rural areas.

I also do thank Dr Buthelezi for commending us for the work that we do,  but
I just want Dr Buthelezi to understand what these  allowances  are  for.  We
will not change course in terms of what these allowances are for.

Let me say that I was really enjoying the debate,  until  the  DA  spoke.  I
will not pronounce her name wrongly, because  I  wouldn't  want  anybody  to
call me Shabalala, when I am Tshabalala. So, I won't pronounce it,  but  she
knows. You know sometimes they blow hot, sometimes they blow  cold,  and  it
is really very difficult to understand the gist of their argument.  However,
let me pose this question to her: Can she tell  me  of  any  developing  and
developed country that has such a comprehensive programme on HIV/Aids as  we
have? The whole world is commending us for this.  Our  own  counterparts  in
South Africa stand up and criticise, but they have  nothing  to  offer,  and
never had anything to offer! You can go to any developed or  any  developing
country and compare the number of people  who  are  now  on  anti-retroviral
treatment with our number in this country. You will be surprised.

To those who have also debated issues surrounding  HIV/Aids,  I  must  again
plead with all of us not to call it a roll-out ARV Programme, because it  is
not. Once you start doing that, we will forget prevention,  we  will  forget
care, we will forget all these other  important  components.  We  will  even
forget that we can go to traditional  healers.  I  think  we  must  be  very
careful how  we  refer  to  this  programme.  If  it  is  difficult  to  say
management support and care and so on, rather  just  call  it  comprehensive
plan on HIV/Aids, and I would accept that. However, to give it a name  which
we did not present to Cabinet, I really do object to that.

I just want to say to those who debated the issue of HIV/Aids very  briefly:
I would like to refer you to the WHO website. I am not  going  to  tell  you
what it says, but please go and look at the website. I would like  to  refer
to the report by Bill Gates. Please, go and read that report. I  would  also
like to refer you to the recent resolutions of the  G8  countries.  I  would
like you to go and get that information  and  read  it  out  for  yourselves
because ... I not going to say what it says. I  am  almost  tempted  to  say
what it says. ... I think all of us must do our own work.

The last thing I want to say is that, as from  2  August  2004,  the  single
exit price of medicines should be printed on the immediate container of  the
medicines. This price should be lower  than  the  current  one,  as  we  are
aiming to make medicines more affordable to our people. Some of us who  have
already been reading newspapers will have noticed that in less than a  month
the prices of medicines have come down by 16%. Shouldn't we  be  celebrating
that? I think we should! [Applause.]

What we are doing in our efforts of making medicines more affordable  is  in
line with what  other  developed  countries  like  Australia,  New  Zealand,
Canada and the UK have done. Why don't they want us to  do  the  same,  even
about the doctors who are dispensing? I was surprised. I was in Zimbabwe  on
Thursday. In Zimbabwe no doctor may dispense until he or she has  passed  an
examination, because they are taking care of their people. Why shouldn't  we
do  that  in  South  Africa?  They  will  never  dispense  without   passing
examination!

What I want to say is that we have ushered in groundbreaking  transformation
legislation in this regard. It will be helpful therefore if  all  the  role-
players - all of us, stakeholders and all - can embark  on  strategies  that
will enable our people, our doctors and our pharmacists  in  particular,  to
comply with the legislation rather than fight it.

I would like to welcome  back  Ms  Johnson.  Angimazi  ukuthi  muphi  manje.
Sengathi usehambile. [I don't know where she is now. It looks  like  she  is
not here.] She was here before, and I would like to welcome her back, and  I
just want to say she must never ever refer to KwaZulu-Natal as a  Cinderella
province. It has never been that! All that we tried to  do  was  to  address
issues of iniquity in this country. KwaZulu-Natal  was  getting  more  money
than Limpopo. The Western Cape was getting more money than  Mpumalanga,  and
Gauteng was getting more money than the Eastern Cape. So, what we sought  to
do was to ensure that we address those iniquities, to ensure  that  all  our
people are treated fairly and receive  fair  and  affordable  medicines  and
healthcare in this country. So, I am also confident that we will be able  to
turn around the tide of HIV/Aids in this country.

Let me just say to Dr Goqwana  and  Mr  Sekoati  that  some  of  the  senior
officials in my department who come from your  provinces,  particularly  the
Eastern Cape, tell me that if they were to go back to the Eastern  Cape  and
Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, and in particular leave the national  Government,
that would mean I must recruit more Cuban doctors. [Laughter.]  So,  we  are
happy to have them at the national office because at least they  demonstrate
that we have got this deal - these people really help  us  to  do  so  well.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF NCOP: Hon Ministers, Deputy Ministers and  MECs,  let  me
thank you very much for being with us in  this  House  for  more  than  four
hours.

What I want to say to the hon Ministers is that the  approach  that  we  are
beginning to focus on as the NCOP, is this  integrated  approach.  We  can't
have social services  without  Social  Welfare,  Health  and  Home  Affairs,
because the three go together and will go  a  long  way  in  addressing  the
problems that we are faced with. I want to thank you  and  the  hon  members
very much for having stayed on since this morning at  10  o'clock  up  until
now. Thank you very much.
The Council adjourned at 18:30.

                ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces

1.    Reintroduction of Bills


     (1)    The Minister of Social Development


         On request of the Minister the following Bill, that lapsed  at  the
         end of the  Second  Parliament,  was  reintroduced  by  the  Select
         Committee on Social Services in the National Council  of  Provinces
         on 18 June 2004:


         (i)     Older Persons Bill [B  68  -  2003]  (National  Council  of
              Provinces - sec 76) [Explanatory summary  of  Bill  and  prior
              notice of its introduction published in Government Gazette  No
              25347 of 13 August 2003.]


         The Bill has been  referred  to  the  Select  Committee  on  Social
         Services of the National Council of Provinces.


              NOTE: This Bill was  introduced  by  the  Minister  of  Social
              Development in the National Assembly on 7 November  2003,  but
              he has now requested that it be reintroduced in  the  National
              Council of Provinces of the Third Parliament.


              The Bill was classified as a section  76  bill  by  the  Joint
              Tagging Mechanism (see Announcements, Tablings  and  Committee
              Reports of 17 November 2003).


              As the Bill reintroduced today has not been printed again, the
              information relating to the House of introduction  and  person
              in charge of the Bill, as reflected on the front page  of  the
              Bill, is incorrect. As mentioned above the Bill has  in  fact,
              on  request  of  the  Minister  of  Social  Development,  been
              reintroduced in the  National  Council  of  Provinces  by  the
              Select Committee on Social Services.
