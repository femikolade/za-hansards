          ELECTION OF CHAIRPERSON OF NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES

The CHIEF JUSTICE: We shall now proceed to the election of  the  Chairperson
of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  The  Returning  Officer  is  the
Secretary to Parliament, Mr S Mfenyana, and  I  have  to  announce  that  in
terms of Rule 2 of the Rules for the election  of  a  Chairperson,  Ms  L  L
Matyolo, Mr B V L Momoti, Mr  B  Nonyane  and  Ms  J  A  Niekerk  have  been
appointed by the Returning Officer  as  Assistant  Returning  Officers.  The
oath  or  prescribed  affirmation  has  already  been  administered  to  the
Returning Officer and the Assistant Returning Officers, as required  by  the
Rules.

Before calling for nominations, I must remind delegates that,  in  terms  of
the Constitution and the Rules, each nomination must  be  submitted  on  the
prescribed form and duly  seconded.  I  must  also  draw  the  attention  of
delegates to the provision of section 64 of the Constitution,  in  terms  of
which no person may be elected as Chairperson of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces unless he or she is a permanent delegate to the  Council.  I  also
wish to inform delegates that, in terms of item 4 of Part A  of  Schedule  3
to the Constitution, there  may  be  no  debate.  We  will  proceed  to  the
election, and when that is concluded, and a Chairperson  has  been  elected,
the Chairperson will assume the Chair of the House  and  I  will  leave  the
Chamber.

There will now be an opportunity for  nominations  for  Chairperson  of  the
Council.

Ms  Elizabeth  Dipuo  Peters,  seconded  by  Mr  Thabang  Sampson  Phathakge
Makwetla nominated Ms Joyce Lesawana Kgoali for election as  Chairperson  of
the National Council of Provinces.

The Returning Officer reported to the  Chief  Justice  that  the  nomination
paper had been properly completed.

There being no further nominations, the  Chief  Justice  declared  Ms  Joyce
Lesawana Kgoali properly elected as Chairperson of the National  Council  of
Provinces.

The CHIEF JUSTICE: May I congratulate you on your election and  request  you
please to assume the Chair over this House. [Applause.]

The Usher conducted the Chairperson to the Chair and placed  the  Black  Rod
in position at the Chair.

                  ELECTION OF PERMANENT DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, hon President of the Republic,  we
will now proceed to the election of the Permanent Deputy Chairperson of  the
National Council of Provinces. Are there any nominations?

Ms Nosimo Balindlela, seconded by Mr Richard Mdakane,  nominated  Mr  Mninwa
Johannes Mahlangu for  election  as  Permanent  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces.
The Returning Officer reported to the Chairperson that the nomination  paper
had been properly completed.

There being no further  nominations,  the  Chairperson  declared  Mr  Mninwa
Johannes Mahlangu properly  elected  Permanent  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon President of the Republic of South  Africa,
President  Thabo  Mbeki,  Chief  Justice  Chaskalson,  premiers,   Speakers,
special and permanent delegates, guests, ladies and gentlemen, I  thank  the
Chief Justice for presiding over the swearing-in of members of the NCOP  and
the election  of  the  Chairperson.  Thank  you,  hon  colleagues,  for  the
confidence that you have shown in electing me as Chairperson of this  august
House.

President Thabo Mbeki, members of the executive, presiding officers  of  the
National Assembly and distinguished guests who are attendant today,  I  wish
to thank you all for joining us this afternoon. The NCOP came of  age  under
the inspiring leadership of my predecessors. It defined  its  constitutional
mandate and interpreted its role in a coherent fashion. It is  fair  to  say
that the NCOP has become the effective  forum  for  raising  provincial  and
local interests at national level.

I propose to deepen and expand this House, and in addition to emphasise  the
following challenges: To increase public participation in Parliament and  to
enhance the understanding of democracy amongst  our  people;  to  strengthen
the institutional mechanism for enhancing the ability of members to  process
legislation from a fully informed and independent  perspective;  to  enhance
the use of technology in Parliament and especially in the  National  Council
of Provinces as an important part of ensuring full provincial  participation
in national matters; to  provide  additional  research  support  that  helps
legislatures  and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  to  identify   the
provincial and local interests more accurately;  to  improve  our  oversight
and  accountability  capacity;  to  improve  substantially   the   financial
management of Parliament; and to ensure our debates are not a repetition  of
the debates of the other House. These are the main tasks to which the  House
will commit itself over the next five years.

The hard work of members for the past few years sends  a  strong  signal  of
our intention to make the NCOP a House of the people,  fully  responsive  to
the mandate and supporting South Africans in  creating  a  better  life  for
all.

I will not keep members and our guests long. I would like to pay tribute  to
the former Chairpersons,  Minister  Mosiuoa  Lekota,  now  the  Minister  of
Defence, and Ms Naledi Pandor, now the Minister of Education. [Applause.]  I
congratulate them on their appointment and on the  work  they  did  for  the
NCOP. In the same breath I wish to extend a word of gratitude  to  Mr  Enver
Surty, our former Chief Whip. I hope he and Ms Naledi Pandor will  make  the
best team in the Department of Education and Minister and  Deputy  Minister.
[Applause.]

I wish to recognise the presence of the president  of  the  Commonwealth  of
Dominica, a member of the Caribbean  islands,  his  Excellency  Dr  Nicholas
Liverpool and his spouse on the gallery. [Applause.]

I also want to thank our NCOP staff and every person who has contributed  to
the successful preparations for this day. I would also  like  to  thank  the
media for the interest they have taken in this House, and I look forward  to
a fruitful working relationship in the future.

I congratulate all hon members  sworn  in  today  and  invite  you  to  come
outside to the steps for a group photo after the election  of  the  Rotating
Deputy Chairperson.

I would like to end by saying that this is a challenge,  and  I  am  looking
forward to it. With the help of everybody, we will make it  happen  for  the
betterment of our people in South Africa. [Applause.]

                   ELECTION OF ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We now proceed with  the  nomination  of
the Rotating Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces.

Mr Thembinkosi Willies Mchunu, seconded by Mr Ebrahim Rasool,  nominated  Ms
Frances Beatrice Marshoff for election as  Rotating  Deputy  Chairperson  of
the National Council of Provinces.

The Returning Officer reported to the Chairperson that the nomination  paper
had been properly completed.

There being no further nominations,  the  Chairperson  declared  Ms  Frances
Beatrice Marshoff  properly  elected  Rotating  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces.

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  I  want  to  take  this   opportunity   of
congratulating the hon Premier of the  Free  State,  Ms  Beatrice  Marshoff.
Premier Rasool, we are in  the  same  position.  I  don't  know  her  street
address, but I know the  house.  We  welcome  you  as  the  Rotating  Deputy
Chairperson of this Council. [Applause.]

I shall now proceed to afford delegation heads  of  the  various  provinces,
party representatives and members of Salga  an  opportunity  to  say  a  few
words.

The PREMIER OF THE EASTERN CAPE (Ms N  Balindlela):  Hon  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa, hon Judge Chaskalson,  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,
NCOP delegates, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I  would  like  to  thank  the
President of the Republic for his affirmation of the role of women in  South
Africa and in Africa. Not only is this evident in Cabinet appointments,  but
it is also evident in the appointment of premiers in the  provinces  and  of
presiding officers in this  House  this  afternoon.   This  is  a  wonderful
accolade for women in our country, an accolade that  has  never  been  given
before.

Re a leboha, mora Mamofokeng, yena ya ileng a  tshwara  thipa  ka  bohaleng.
[We thank you, son of Mamofokeng, the women who supported  you  through  the
hard times.] Siyabulela ke, Zizi. [Thank you, Zizi.]

Secondly, I would like to say now that we as delegates,  particularly  I  as
the  leader  of  delegates  from  the  Eastern  Cape,  would  like  to   say
congratulations to all the members of  the  NCOP  who  have  been  sworn  in
today. You members have  a  trying  task  ahead  of  you,  representing  the
interests of the people of South Africa. I, however, have no doubt that  you
are confident in this challenging time, and that  the  delivery  during  the
next 10 years of democracy will surpass the  delivery  during  the  past  10
years. We would like you to remember the words  of  our  President  when  he
presented the ANC's election manifesto. Those words are  still  ringing  for
all of us, when he said, "We shall not  abandon  the  poor".  Today  we  are
promising, again, that we shall not abandon the poor. Thank you  very  much.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Mrs F B Marshoff):  Hon  Chairperson,  Deputy
Chairperson, hon  President,  hon  members,  permanent  delegates,  rotating
delegates,  and  leaders  of  the  delegations,  I  am  indeed  honoured  to
congratulate the Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson, as well as  myself  on
having been elected as the first rotating Deputy Chairperson of this  House,
that you have been accorded the responsibility to assure  that  one  of  the
pillars of our democracy is consolidated and strengthened in the  next  five
years.

Also, I  am  pleased  to  congratulate  the  permanent  delegates  on  their
election to this House. Hon Chairperson, the  mandate  that  our  Government
has been given by  the  people  of  South  Africa  speaks  for  itself.  The
contract with the people of our country has been sealed. Our  responsibility
for the next five years is to ensure that we  deliver  on  it.  Through  the
NCOP, we will continue to ensure that the interests of  the  people  of  our
provinces come first. We will continue to ensure that we work together in  a
manner that guarantees that all of  us  as  individuals,  and  collectively,
strive for the betterment of our people.

We all know the challenges that are facing the people  in  our  communities,
and we also know what  the  expectations  are  from  all  of  us.  They  are
convinced that during the next five years their lives will  be  changed  for
the better. Today we rededicate ourselves to making certain that we live  up
to  these  expectations.  We  will  fight  hunger,   poverty,   joblessness,
malnutrition, HIV/Aids, as well as  all  the  other  challenges  facing  our
people.

I  am  certain  that  we  will  use  this  instrument,  the  NCOP,  for  the
development and for the betterment of all our people and for our country.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R MDAKANE (Gauteng): Hon Chairperson of the NCOP, hon  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa, leaders  of  delegations,  comrades  and  friends,
Gauteng congratulates all of you on these new responsibilities entrusted  to
you to run this important organ of our people. We will support you and  work
together with you and all our people, in all the ways, in order  for  us  to
be able to represent our people in our  provinces.  We  will  work  together
with them and you, hon members, to fight against poverty and to create  jobs
for our people. We wish that this House could  represent  the  interests  of
our  people,  from  now  and  forever.  We  thank  you,   hon   Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr T W MCHUNU (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon President, hon Chairperson of  the  NCOP,
the deputies of the NCOP, on behalf of our Premier, hon  S'bu  Ndebele,  his
government and the parliament of KwaZulu-Natal, we wish to congratulate  all
the members who have been sworn in today and in particular  to  congratulate
yourself, Chairperson of the NCOP, and your deputies, for being  elected  to
such honourable positions.

KwaZulu-Natal is proud to be part of the National Council of  Provinces.  We
have  in  the  past  played  a  very  active  role  in  strengthening   this
institution as  we  have  always  believed  that  it  is  a  very  important
institution in the process of nation-building. We again  recommit  ourselves
to playing that role and to do  our  best  as  a  province  to  support  the
leadership of this institution, as well as the members of  this  institution
in support of the project of nation-building.

We are going to be contributing to this project of  nation-building  through
a process that would essentially start  at  home  in  our  own  province  in
uniting the people of that province, as well as leading  the  fight  against
poverty, unemployment and the rest of the ills that  beset  the  peoples  of
that province. As of today,  we  say:  Thank  you  for  the  role  you  have
afforded us and good luck  to  this  institution  and  to  your  leadership.
[Applause.]

Kgoshi L M MOKOENA: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Hon  President,  premiers  and
colleagues, I rise on behalf  of  my  peaceful  province,  Limpopo,  to  say
congratulations to you, Chairperson, and your deputies,  for  being  elected
to these positions  that  are  very  important,  but  which  are  also  very
challenging at the same time.

As you know, there  are  some  members  who,  at  times,  get  excited  over
nothing. You are tasked with the responsibility of making  sure  that  there
is discipline in this House. That will be done to ensure  that  the  dignity
of this House is always  maintained.  However,  that  cannot  be  if  we  as
members and provinces do not reciprocate. As you know, this unique House  is
the  mirror  of  our  democratic  Government.  Having   worked   with   you,
Chairperson, in the justice committee and other committees, I know that  you
are going to make it work. With a hardworking person like M J Mahlangu,  you
are  forming  a  wonderful,  powerful,  marvellous,  calculated,   accurate,
perfect and dynamic team. [Laughter.]  Expect  our  undivided  loyality  and
support. Congratulations. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA (Mr T Makwetla): Hon President  of  the  Republic,
Madam Chairperson, delegates to the National Council of Provinces, it  gives
me great pleasure on behalf of the province of Mpumalanga to add  our  voice
in congratulating the newly elected office  bearers  of  the  NCOP  and  its
delegates for the next five years. It is our hope and belief that with  your
leadership, Madam Chair, we shall continue in the next five years to  enrich
the legacy of this unique Chamber of the Parliament of the Republic. We  are
looking forward enthusiastically to  the  privilege  of  bringing  into  the
inputs of this House the sentiments and views of people from our  region  of
this country. In the process  we  will,  as  we  all  believe,  improve  the
quality of the democracy that our people, over many decades, fought  for.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

THE PREMIER OF THE NORTH  WEST  PROVINCE  (Ms  E  Molewa):  Thank  you,  hon
Chairperson,  President  of  South  Africa,  honourable   Judge   President,
colleagues who are leaders of delegations from  various  provinces  and  hon
members. Just over 10 years ago in the North West Province, in the  villages
such as Kgabalatsane, Mathateng, Winterveld,  Taaiboskraal  and  many  other
villages, our people did  not  have  amenities;  our  people  did  not  have
services like water, electricity, schools,  clinics  and  many  other  basic
services. They also had no hope that they would ever have these services.

Just 10 years down the line, many of our children are  now  able  to  attend
schools under better conditions, sleep under good  shelters,  being  certain
that there is a clinic in the neighbourhood to go to  when  they  are  sick.
What is important to note is that there is now hope that  they  will  indeed
one day be like all other South Africans residing in  Houghton,  in  Cashan,
in Menlo  Park,  in  Potchefstroom  and  all  over  where  there  are  these
amenities. Our people say they  have  no  words  with  which  to  thank  our
President, our ruling party and our Government in  general  for  doing  such
wonderful things for them. They have expressed this in  words  and  also  in
numbers as they came to vote.

We cannot really just not notice the work and the contribution done by  this
House previously. We therefore would like to thank the  past  delegates,  as
well as the leadership of our House, the National Council of Provinces,  and
indeed, we congratulate all of the new members of this  House,  as  well  as
the Chairperson and the  Deputy  Chairperson.  We  are  looking  forward  to
working with you in the future. We have had visits  by  this  House  in  the
past and we are looking forward to interacting  with  you.  We  congratulate
you. We are deploying very able men and women in this  House  to  work  with
you. Thank you, once again, and congratulations in  your  daunting  task  as
you face the future. Thank you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE WESTERN  CAPE  (Mr  E  Rasool):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon
President, heads of delegations, on behalf of the Western Cape,  I  want  to
congratulate Chairperson Joyce Kgoali, Deputy Chairperson M J  Mahlangu  and
second Deputy Chairperson Beatrice Marshoff  who  are  all  members  of  the
National Council of Provinces.

I want to congratulate  them  and  express  confidence  that  they  will  be
responsible and preside over further evolution of the work of  the  National
Council of Provinces. They should make the National Council of  Provinces  a
point of contact, debate and  consensus  between  national,  provincial  and
local government, and ultimately the point  of  co-operation  in  delivering
the people's contract to create work and fight poverty.

I also want to express confidence that this  will  be  the  House  in  which
national legislation and policy will be enriched. As the  Western  Cape,  we
will play our role in enriching all of those processes.

Madam Chairperson, we also  know  that  you,  your  presiding  officers  and
members will spend much time in this province of the Western Cape.  We  want
to say to you: "Welcome to the Western Cape.'' We are  determined,  in  this
third Parliament, to make the Western Cape a home for  all  its  people.  In
welcoming you, we want to say  to  you,  "Feel  at  home  during  the  third
Parliament in this province of the Western Cape.'' [Applause.]

Ms H JENKINS (Salga): Chairperson, hon President,  leaders  of  delegations,
special  delegates,  comrades,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  on  behalf  of  the
Chairperson of Salga, Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, members of  the  national
leadership of Salga, member municipalities and the broader local  government
fraternity, I am indeed honoured to deliver a congratulatory message to  the
new Chairperson and newly-appointed members of the  NCOP.  In  doing  so,  I
extend my heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing Chairperson  of  the  Council,
Ms Naledi Pandor, for her astute leadership  and  unwavering  commitment  in
contributing invaluably to our democratic order.

Salga enjoyed a warm and cordial relationship with the  former  Chairperson.
We wish her every success in her  new  portfolio  as  national  Minister  of
Education. We look forward to renewing our acquaintance with Mrs  Pandor  in
her new office.

Our congratulations are extended to the newly-appointed Chairperson  of  the
NCOP, Ms Joyce Kgoali. We are  certain  that  we  will  give  you  and  your
collective leadership our steadfast  support.  Salga,  in  its  many  future
undertakings with you personally and the NCOP as a  whole,  will  strive  to
perfect our unique system of co-operative governance for  the  greater  good
of our country and our people.

It is common knowledge that as a government  collective,  the  period  ahead
will  confront  us  with  formidable,  but  not  insurmountable  challenges.
Together with our partners in Government, the  local  government  sector  is
ready to meet these challenges, especially that of fighting and  eradicating
poverty. This scourge of our  nation  can  only  be  overcome  by  a  united
onslaught. Salga pledges its unflinching commitment to contributing  towards
a poverty-free South Africa.

Congratulations  and  best  wishes  are  also   extended   to   the   Deputy
Chairperson, the hon Mr Mahlangu, on his reappointment; the rotating  Deputy
Chairperson, Ms Marshoff, who has just been sworn in; and all other  members
of the NCOP.

I am confident that within the next few  years  South  Africa  will  witness
unprecedented economic growth, and that President Mbeki's great  vision  for
South Africa and a new Africa will be on  the  path  to  being  realised.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Hon Mr President, Chief Justice Chaskalson,  hon  Madam  Chair,
deputies and colleagues, I have the  pleasure  to  rise  on  behalf  of  the
Official Opposition, the DA, to wish you, Madam Chair, the best in your  new
office to which you have just been elected, together with your  deputies.  I
also wish to congratulate all delegates that have been sworn in today.

Siyakubongela mama ngalokhu kukhethwa kwakho namhlanje. Sithandazela  ukuthi
uNkulunkulu akuphathe ngesandla  sakhe  ukuze  siqhubeke  kahle  nomsebenzi.
[Congratulations on your appointment today. We pray that God  will  be  with
you so that we can continue to do the work very well.]

Mev die Voorsitter, ons is pas deur 'n fel stryd  in  hierdie  pas  afgelope
verkiesing, en die een ding wat vir almal baie duidelik na vore  gekom  het,
was dat die groot uitdagings van ons land,  naamlik  armoede,  werkloosheid,
misdaad, korrupsie, MIV/Vigs en gesondheid in die algemeen nog steeds  groot
probleme vir hierdie land inhou en dat dit nou daadwerklik aangespreek  moet
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Madam Chairperson, we have just been  through  a  tough  struggle  in  this
recent election, and  the  one  thing  that  came  across  very  clearly  to
everyone, was that the big  challenges  for  our  country,  namely  poverty,
unemployment, crime, corruption, HIV/Aids and health in  general  are  still
posing big problems for this country and should now be actively addressed.]

We share the goals that you have as Government, Mr  President.  We,  as  the
Official Opposition, will help and work with you to arrive at solutions  for
those goals. We will obviously differ at times on how you attempt  to  reach
those goals. However, our task will be to guide you as far as  possible.  Do
not see the obstacles of our country as  stumbling  blocks,  but  turn  them
into stepping stones.

Re le lakaletsa pula, nala, le kgotso. Modimo a be le  lona.  Ke  a  leboha.
[Ditlatse.] [We wish you peace and prosperity. God be with you.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

[Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, the  IFP  would  like  to
support you and wish you success on your appointment, as well as  those  who
are with you. The IFP says to you: "A woman works hard to take care  of  her
children". The IFP says to you that it will co-operate with you only if  you
are not biased in your work. If you do that, you will get  full  support  of
the IFP. Other speakers from Gauteng have  said  enough;  I  would  only  be
repeating what has already been said. However, the IFP says  that  there  is
only one message, the message it has been sending out all these years.]

[We are saying the national Government should not have all  the  powers;  it
must be distributed to provinces and even to the districts, because that  is
where  people  are  and  where  they  can  hear  immediately.  The  national
Government will hear from us, the people, who come  from  the  provinces.  I
will be very pleased if that could happen and Mzizi and  his  Cabinet  could
look at it.

A colleague from the North West spoke of housing shortages  and  many  other
things  people  do  not  have.  In  Gauteng  as  well,  there  are  no   job
opportunities. If there are no job opportunities, it  means  there  are  too
many people and therefore people can't even  afford  to  pay  for  municipal
services. They are being evicted and prosecuted  for  trespassing  in  their
own homes. I am appealing to the national Government to prick its  ears  and
listen to the plight of the people. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr K SINCLAIR:  Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  Premiers,  speakers  and
members of this august House, on behalf of the NNP, I want  to  congratulate
all the office bearers that have been elected here today. We  want  to  wish
them the best of luck and the best  of  everything  for  the  next  term  of
office, for the next five years.

We want to thank the previous office bearers, the Chairpersons,  the  Deputy
Chairs and the members, but also the officials who laid the  foundation  for
this House, this second Chamber of Parliament, to fulfil its  constitutional
obligation.

The NNP will position  itself  where  it  will  matter.  We  will  take  our
agreement with the ANC forward, also in this House. The NNP  won't  be  part
of the prophets of doom, and we will be there to address the issues  of  our
time. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Hon President, Chief Justice, Chairperson and all  members
of the NCOP, I congratulate you this day. Though we are aware that  we  come
from different political parties and we recently suffered a huge  amount  of
pressure due to election  campaigns,  we  are  here  and  we  have  to  work
collectively to come up with sound results. To do that effectively  we  have
to support the  newly  elected  members  of  the  Council.  As  the  UDM  we
therefore pledge our support to them.

Ndithi oomama mabaqine. Xa ndijongile apha, izithethi ezininzi  eziphakamayo
ngoomama. Malibongwe! [I want to encourage women to be strong. When  I  look
at the speakers' list, I notice that most of them are women. Praise!]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, his Excellency the President,  his  Worship  the
Chief Justice, hon Minister of Education, hon  premiers  present  here,  hon
special delegates, hon colleagues and comrades, I stand  on  behalf  of  the
UCDP to congratulate our colleague the hon Mrs Kgoali  on  her  election  as
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, together with the  hon  Mr
Mahlangu as Deputy Chairperson and the  hon  Ms  Marshoff  as  the  rotating
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces. I also wish them well  and
hope that the Almighty God will shower them  with  the  necessary  blessings
that will enable them to execute the functions of their offices with  honour
and dignity.

We have all entered a very critical period in  our  political  life,  namely
the period of delivery - delivery of  services  to  our  constituencies  and
support bases, delivery of love to one another, delivery of kindness to  our
neighbours and even to our so-called enemies.

Rona ba UCDP re rata go solofetsa gore re tla go tshegetsa,  le  go  ema  le
wena. Re tla dira gotlhe go go  mo  nonofong  ya  rona  go  tsweledisa  tiro
yotlhe e e amanang le diporofense tsa rona tsotlhe.  [Legofi.]  [We  as  the
UCDP would like to promise you that we will support you and  stand  by  you.
We will do everything in our power to advance all the work that  has  to  do
with all our provinces. [Applause.]]

Rev E ADOLPH: Hon Chair, hon President of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,
Thabo Mbeki, Chief Justice, the premiers of  the  different  provinces,  all
distinguished guests here today and all sworn-in  members  of  the  NCOP,  I
think on behalf of the ID we have to commend the President  for  creating  a
paradigm shift in the emancipation process of women.  You  set  the  perfect
example by  bringing  more  women  into  Parliament.  Today  this  has  been
affirmed by the election of our hon Chair and Deputy Chair.

I want to assure you of our unconditional support of this House, and in  the
same breath I want to state that we will  rigorously  hold  you  responsible
for implementing the people's contract to deliver on behalf  of  the  people
who suffer. All those challenges that you are facing,  we  are  facing  them
with you. I strongly believe that  this  House  has  the  capacity  to  work
together and to build together, so we can shape and reshape our  country  to
make a better life for all. Thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

The PERMANENT DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Ngithanda
ukuthatha   leli   thuba   ngibonge   kuwe   mngcinisihlalo   ukuthi    nami
kengiphefumule kancane.  Bese  ngicabanga  ukuthi  ungikhohliwe.  Ngiyabonga
kakhulu-ke  uma  usungiphile  leli  thuba.  [I  would  like  to  take   this
opportunity to say thank you to you, chairperson, for allowing  me  to  make
my brief comments. I was begining to think that  you  have  forgotten  about
me. Thank you very much.]

Hon President,  Ministers  present  here  in  this  House  today,  permanent
delegates  and  special  delegates,  leaders  of  the   delegation,   Salga,
provincial Speakers, may I take this opportunity to thank  my  organisation,
the ANC,  for  picking  my  name  to  be  one  of  the  presiding  officers,
particularly in the NCOP. I wish  to  thank  you  very  much.  That  is  the
confidence that the organisation has shown in me as  a  person  and  I  will
uphold it. I will not disappoint the organisation. May I also thank all  the
members who elected me unanimously as permanent Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
Council.

Madam Chairperson,  allow  me  also  to  congratulate  you  on  having  been
unanimously elected as Chairperson of this House. I have  great  confidence,
as Kgoshi Mokoena has already indicated, that you are a very  strong  woman.
We know you and we have worked very close with you. We know  that  you  will
steer this ship, and, together  with  you,  we  will  make  sure  that  this
institution survives.
May I also congratulate our former Chairperson - I can see  she  is  in  the
House. Comrade Naledi, you have made an input with regard to  the  direction
of this House. I know how much effort you put  into  the  building  of  this
institution. You did a wonderful job whilst you  were  Chairperson  of  this
institution and we will follow in your footsteps. Don't forget that when  we
meet difficulties, we will always pick up the phone and ask you to  come  to
our rescue and assist us.

I also wish to congratulate you, Comrade  Naledi,  on  your  appointment  as
Minister of Education. Congratulations in your new  portfolio.  I  know  you
will also prosper there and I know you will do a wonderful job.

Chairperson, if you will allow me, my congratulations also go  to  both  the
newly elected presiding officers in the National Assembly -  I  didn't  have
time to congratulate them  -  Comrade  Baleka  and  Comrade  Gwen  Mahlangu-
Nkabinde. I congratulate them as new presiding officers in the other  House.
I hope they will also do a very good job in that House.

Let me just say the following. Perhaps people are not  aware  that  this  is
one of the most important institutions. The NCOP is very important, and  all
those people who have joined this House should know  from  today  that  they
have come to a very, very important House. You have a very big job ahead  of
you. The task is very great, but normally in this House we work as team  and
we are able to achieve whatever work is before us. We  are  a  small  group,
but we work together and  we  don't  forget,  as  one  speaker  has  already
indicated, that we represent our provinces.

This is crucial in  the  sense  that  in  this  House  local  government  is
represented here, as well as the provinces. All the laws that come from  the
National Assembly are scrutinised here. Therefore this is an  enormous  job.
A huge amount of work is carried out in this House. I therefore  invite  you
all today, as you have been sworn in as permanent delegates of  this  House,
to be prepared to take up this very difficult task and move with it.

I also want to indicate that the task facing us as members here is  that  of
the oversight function.  That  is  a  very  crucial  job  that  we  have  to
undertake, to make sure that the laws that we pass in both Houses  are  well
implemented on the ground and  that  they  make  the  lives  of  the  people
better. We pass those laws so  that  they  can  assist  the  people  on  the
ground. I want to remind you also that as  permanent  delegates  during  our
provincial visits and our provincial weeks it is crucial that we invite  our
provinces to plan together with us, so that as we go  to  ground  level,  we
work together with the provinces to achieve  the  goal  which  we  have  set
ourselves to achieve as the NCOP.

With these few words - I don't want to speak too long  -  may  I  take  this
opportunity to say thank you very much. I wish every one of  you  good  luck
in your positions and in your work. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
The ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mrs F B Marshoff):  Thank  you,
Chairperson. It's very difficult for me  to  speak  just  after  the  Deputy
Chairperson has spoken, but I am going to emulate him and  say  that  it  is
indeed an honour for  me  to  have  been  elected  as  the  Rotating  Deputy
Chairperson of this House. This is indeed a very, very steep learning  curve
for me, and, as someone that has to assume duties  in  this  House,  I  know
it's going to be a very big challenge for me.

I'd once again like to say to the members and to  the  delegates,  both  the
permanent delegates and the special  delegates,  that  I  do,  indeed,  feel
honoured for the trust and faith that you have put in me  to  take  up  this
responsibility. I will ensure that I do it to the  best  of  my  ability.  I
will  also  ensure  that  I  always  carry  the  torch  of  our   provinces.
Individually and collectively we will ensure that we do  indeed  deliver  on
the mandate that the people have given us.

Chairperson,  I  want  to  congratulate  you  on  having  been  elected   as
Chairperson and I also want to give you the assurance that you will have  my
support. I will ensure that the work that needs to be done is done.

To the members present here, I also want to say that  it  is  indeed  a  big
challenge for  us.  We  have  our  responsibilities,  but  we  also  have  a
constitutional obligation to ensure that the work of this House  is  carried
out and that it is carried out to the best of our ability.

To the outgoing Chairperson and the newly appointed Minister  of  Education,
Comrade  Naledi  Pandor,  I  want  to  say  thank  you  very  much  for  the
foundations that you have laid in this House. We assure  you  that  we  will
continue to build upon them and that the work here carries the flag  of  our
people. I thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I  once  more  thank  everybody,  and  also
thank the President of the Commonwealth of the Dominica, His  Excellency  Dr
Nicholas Liverpool, and his spouse. Thank you very much for  being  with  us
today, Mr President. I'm sure we are all blessed to be with you as we  start
our work in this third term of Parliament.

We hope and we promise that we will do our best to  ensure  that  we  uphold
what the people of  South  Africa  have  requested  us  to  do.  It  is  our
responsibility. We want to give you our support as this House, as  permanent
delegates, in order to make sure that the lives of  our  people  get  better
day by day. We will do that as a collective in this House.

That concludes the business of the first sitting of the National Council  of
Provinces of the third Parliament of South Africa. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 15:22.

TABLINGS

National Council of Provinces

1.    The Chairperson:


     (a)    The President of the Republic  submitted  the  following  letter
         dated 18 March 2004 to the Chairperson of the National  Council  of
         Provinces informing Members of the National  Council  of  Provinces
         of the employment of the South African National Defence Force:


         EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE   FORCE   IN
         COMPLIANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF
         SOUTH AFRICA TOWARDS THE AFRICAN UNION


         This serves to inform the National  Council  of  Provinces  that  I
         authorised the employment of the  South  African  National  Defence
         Force  (SANDF)  personnel  in  fullfilment  of  the   international
         obligations of the Republic of South  Africa  towards  the  African
         Union Mission in Comoros.


         This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions
         of Section 201(2)(c) of the Constitution of the Republic  of  South
         Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996), read  with  section  93  of  the
         Defence Act, 2002 (Act No 42 of 2002).


         A total of 17 SANDF members will be deployed to Comoros to  act  as
         military observers and in  support  of  the  south  African  Police
         Service (SAPS) training effort. The Comoros Nation will be  holding
         Parliamentary elections over the period March to  April  2004.  The
         AU commission has approached member states to contribute  personnel
         to  the  AU  Observer  Mission  during  the  said  elections.   The
         deployment will be as follows:
         Seven military observers comprised of:
         (a)     One Colonel;
         (b)     Tow Majors and a Lieutenant Commander;
         (c)     Two Navy Lieutenants;
         (d)     One Non-Commissioned Officer for Operations; and


         11 members in support of the SAPS training effort comprised of:
         (a)     Two French-speaking Interpreters;
         (b)     Two Communication Technicians; and
         (c)     Seven Aircrew members.


         The  SANDF  members  will  be  deployed  throughout  the  electoral
         period, which is expected by the African Union (AU)  to  be  for  a
         maximum period of four months. According to the  AU  practice,  the
         AU will provide return air tickets and daily subsistence  allowance
         of US$ 90 to cover meals, acommodation and incidental  expenses  of
         the seven  military  observers.  Members  will  also  be  paid  the
         standard  Republic  of  South   Africa   allowances   for   foreign
         deployment. The estimated cost for the deployment of  the  military
         obervers is as follows:


         (a)     Republic of South Africa allowance  R191 243
         (b)     Reserve Force wages, subsistence and travel allowance R  49
              747
              Total estimated cost R240 990


         The Department of Foreign Affairs will be responsible  for  funding
         the Republic of South  Africa  allowances  and  the  Department  of
         Defence will be responsible for the rest of  the  cost  from  their
         current budget allocation.
         The cost for the  11  members  deployed  in  support  of  the  SAPS
         training   effort   will   depend   on   the   actual   operational
         requirements, but is estimated as follows:


         (a)     Preparation and communication R 61 728
          (b)     Two support flights, C 130 and Casa 212 Aircraft R960 062
         (c)     Allowances and accommodation R570 647
              Total Estimated CostR1 592 437


         The Department of Foreign Affairs will bear this cost.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the  National
         Assembly, as well as to the Joint Standing  Committee  on  Defence,
         and wish to request that you bring the contents of this  report  to
         the notice of the National Council of Provinces.
