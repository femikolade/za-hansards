   RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT OF THE
                          REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)
Mr M J G  MZONDEKI:  Madam  Speaker,  the  hon  President,  the  hon  Deputy
President and the hon members  of  the  House,  in  April  1994  many  South
Africans stood very patiently in very long queues.  They  were  patient  and
very excited because many for the first  time  were  going  to  vote  for  a
government of their choice. Among those were young people  and  grannies  in
their eighties and nineties, some registering  their  very  first  and  last
vote.

There were also those who had been transported in wheelbarrows and  some  in
their collapsing wheelchairs and with their  old  armed  services  crutches.
They also for the first time became part of a society yearning for  freedom.
An overwhelming majority of South Africans had been united  by  the  ANC  in
the struggle to work together to construct a caring society.

Today, Mr President, as we near the 10 year celebration of our democracy  we
can look back with pride and say indeed we  are  winning  in  creating  that
caring society. We will also not hesitate to accept that  we  still  have  a
long way to go to our ideal destination where there will be  a  better  life
for all. We can look back with pride because today we  have  a  constitution
that makes all equal before the law, that gives us all a  right  to  utilise
opportunities that have come with this freedom.

Mr President, in your state-of-the-nation address you alluded  to  the  fact
that there are still challenges in  addressing  the  persisting  racial  and
gender inequalities as well as the disempowerment of our  youth  and  people
with disabilities, and proper care for children and  the  elderly.  I  agree
with you, Mr President, that we also want to demonstrate that  the  ANC  has
worked hard  and  still  continues  to  work  hard  to  ensure  an  enabling
environment for all.

Today in this debate I would like to focus my speech on the  work  that  has
been done by the ANC to address some of the disempowerment you referred  to.
I will focus on the work that has been done to  address  the  disempowerment
of people with disabilities in this country.  It  is  perhaps  important  to
reflect back and illustrate how this  disempowerment  came  about.  Firstly,
the policies that  were  there  were  disability  exclusive.  Secondly,  the
approach  was  a  welfare  approach.  Disabled  people  had  no  access   to
education. A few lucky ones went to special schools  which  channelled  them
to jobs such as typists and switchboard operators.  There  was  no  national
rehabilitation policy. There were no  employment  opportunities  other  than
sheltered  workshops.  Professionals  were  regarded   as   specialists   on
disability.

The 1994 elections bringing a triumph for the ANC led  to  radical  changes.
Today a legislative framework  is  in  place  to  ensure  that  people  with
disabilities benefit from the freedom that came with the 1994  elections.  I
will highlight some of the work that has been done  in  this  area.  In  the
area of health there is a  White  Paper  on  the  Transformation  of  Health
Services as well as a national rehabilitation policy. There is  a  shift  in
the provision of health services towards civilians.

Programmes which have a specific bearing on disabled people include  amongst
others the provision of assisting devices, access to health facilities,  the
reorientation of rehabilitation professionals to primary health  care,  sign
language development for civil  servants,  immunisation  campaigns  and  the
involvement of the sector in HIV/Aids programmes.

The challenge, however, is to ensure that there  is  a  change  of  attitude
among civil servants, that they serve with dignity, respect and  commitment.
We  need  to  ensure  that  at  provincial  level   there   is   a   similar
interpretation of the policy and that more resources are allocated. We  need
to  ensure  that  we  strengthen  the  partnership  between  Government  and
communities and empower those NGOs that continue to play  a  vital  role  in
our communities. An example of such a  partnership  is  the  community-based
rehabilitation  project  in  Mpumalanga  which  is  a  partnership   between
Disabled People South Africa and the Mpumalanga provincial government.

The project started as a pilot project and has since graduated  to  a  fully
fledged project. We believe that some  lessons  can  be  learned  from  this
project and hope that it will be introduced in other provinces.

Through this project  disabled  people  are  involved  in  assisting  device
distribution and the identification of backlogs. They are  also  trained  in
peer counselling. The project  is  also  used  as  an  empowerment  tool  in
informing disabled people about Government services and  assisting  them  in
accessing such services.

In the area of education a national policy on inclusive education  has  been
gazetted. A national co-ordinating committee  for  inclusive  education  was
established as  well  as  district  institutional-level  support  teams  for
disability issues. An audit of  special  schools  to  be  used  as  resource
centres has been  done.  The  challenges  to  speed  up  the  implementation
process, evaluation of the pilot project and the resource  centres  must  be
overcome as soon as possible. We need to do this to ensure that no  disabled
child is left out of the  system  because  the  schools  are  not  ready  to
accommodate them.
In  the  area  of  employment  there  are  the  Labour  Relations  Act,  the
Employment Equity Act as well as  the  Skills  Development  Act.  All  these
pieces of legislation ensure that there is no discrimination  on  the  basis
of disability and that disabled people have  access  to  skills  development
through the Setas.

A code of good practice on the employment of disabled persons  is  in  place
to  assist  employees  to  understand  the  disability  issues  that  affect
employment. We also see a few disabled people make use of  the  Preferential
Procurement Act and start their own companies. We need to  remove  obstacles
such as access to finance so we can see more disabled entrepreneurs.

In the area of social development an assessment tool has been put  in  place
to ensure that more disabled people that qualify for  grants  receive  their
grants speedily. Disabled people have access to housing through the  Housing
Subsidy  Implementation  Manual  and  the  Housing   Code   which   includes
disability variation on subsidy.
There is, however, a need to improve the implementation of  these  policies.
I perhaps need to pause a bit here and  give  an  example  of  the  need  to
change the mindset, for instance, in one region in the  Free  State  in  the
allocation of housing for disabled people. In that area they were  allocated
a disability exclusive area, which seems to contrast with our  principle  of
integration but is in line with our people's contract which  says  that  the
people need to stand up and take on issues  on  their  own.  The  disability
sector in that region has had a meeting with the councillors to  bring  that
to the attention of the MEC and the matter has since been  attended  to.  We
do not believe that there will be a repetition of this.

Mr President, there are still a number  of  challenges  facing  the  sector,
such  as  access  to  courts  because  of  the  shortage  of  sign  language
interpreters, access to public transport and public buildings. We hope  that
the expanded Public Works programme will go a long way  in  addressing  some
of these accessibility problems. We also believe that  we  need  to  empower
disabled people's organisations so that they  can  continue  to  play  their
role in the communities.

 The adoption of the Integrated National Disability Strategy by the  ANC-led
Government was a great step to success. This  strategy  advocates  a  social
model on disability which is a human rights  approach  placing  emphasis  on
the shortcomings of society and its inability to accommodate diversity.

The ANC has also demonstrated  its  commitment  by  ensuring  that  disabled
people are represented in a number of Government institutions  such  as  the
SA Human Rights Commission, the Gender  Commission,  the  Youth  Commission,
the SA Broadcasting Corporation Board and others. The ANC has  also  ensured
that disabled people are directly represented in the  legislatures  as  well
as in local councils. I am sure that many members here can attest  that  the
ANC is the party that has the largest number of disabled  persons  here  and
in the local councils.

We finally want to recognise the role that you, Mr  President,  continue  to
play not only in your capacity as a patron of  the  disability  movement  in
South Africa, but also in your capacity as  a  leader  in  Africa.  This  is
demonstrated by the confidence that the countries of Africa  have  in  South
Africa when  they  asked  it  to  house  the  Africa  Decade  on  Disability
Secretariat. We hope  that  this  will  extend  to  Nepad  and  ensure  that
disabled  people  in  South  Africa  benefit  from  the  poverty-alleviation
programmes of Nepad. This is  very  critical  because  of  the  relationship
between poverty and disability. We also hope that through  your  leadership,
disabled people will be able to participate in the  AU  and  other  relevant
institutions in Africa that support democracy.

In conclusion,  Mr  President,  I  want  to  steal  from  where  you  quoted
President Mandela when he said:


  The Government I have the honour to lead and, I dare say, the masses  who
  elected us to serve in this role are inspired by  the  single  vision  of
  creating a people-centred society. Accordingly,  the  purpose  that  will
  drive this Government shall be the expansion of the  frontiers  of  human
  fulfilment and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.


  The acid test of the legitimacy  of  the  programmes  we  elaborate,  the
  Government institutions we create, the  legislation  we  adopt,  must  be
  whether we serve these objectives.

I would like to urge all disabled people to go  out  in  their  numbers  and
defend democracy by voting very consciously. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy  President,  hon
members of Parliament, yesterday the DA leader said that South will  have  a
two-way party system, with the DA  as  the  official  opposition  after  the
coming elections. [Interjections.]  The  ACDP  wants  to  dispute  that  and
believes that if, indeed, we have a two-way party system  in  this  country,
then the  ACDP  and  not  the  DA  will  be  the  alternative  to  the  ANC.
[Interjections.]

Most South Africans who  know  that  miracles  don't  just  happen,  but  do
believe that there is  a  miracle  worker,  are  grateful  to  God  for  the
peaceful transition to democracy that they experienced in  1994.  It  seemed
inevitable that war would break out and rivers of blood would  flow  in  our
streets before many of us in this august House had had  the  opportunity  to
cast our first democratic vote.

Fear, anxiety and uncertainty forced millions of South Africans to  turn  to
God in prayer. Indeed, churches were filled with people petitioning  God  to
intervene. Indeed, the resultant peace and calm that came  upon  our  nation
was an answer to those prayers.

On 27 April 1994 many of our people rose up early to be  amongst  the  first
to cast their votes. In some areas long queues  meandered  in  former  no-go
areas, with anxious people patiently waiting for  their  turn  to  vote.  As
people left the voting stations to go back to  their  homes,  many  wondered
what they had been afraid of and where  the  rumours  of  war  had  emanated
from. The truth is that the Lord in heaven had intervened.  Peace  prevailed
and we were all relieved and grateful.

Ten years of democracy have brought with  them  both  good  and  bad.  South
Africans  have  received  a  mixed  bag  of  services,   dignity,   respect,
arrogance, rebellion and selfishness. Our people may  be  free  to  exercise
their right to vote, but many do not know how to balance  their  right  with
responsibility. Our Government has make laws that  have  helped  to  promote
equality for all, as well as laws that have undermined the laws of God.

The Government has succeeded in  many  of  their  endeavours  while  failing
dismally in others. On Friday 6 February, our  President  Mbeki  highlighted
some of the successes of Government, for which  we  commend  him.  The  ACDP
believes in giving credit where credit is  due  and  constructive  criticism
where it is necessary.

What I was most concerned about was the fact that  the  President  mentioned
many of the problems that South Africans still face, but did  not  give  any
solutions to overcome the problems. I now want to focus on  four  challenges
the President alluded to and suggest solutions  that  are  proposed  by  the
ACDP.

Firstly, the President referred to the problem of crime. The ACDP  maintains
that the main role of Government is to protect its citizens  and  wield  the
sword of justice. Yet there is hardly a person in South Africa who  has  not
had their life affected by crime. Clearly the Government is failing  in  its
primary function. The only deterrent to crime is  the  sure  knowledge  that
criminals  will  be  swiftly  apprehended,  tried,  convicted  and  punished
severely.

In the case of certain offences such as murder and the rape of  babies,  the
ACDP believes that capital punishment  is  the  most  appropriate  sentence.
Criminals must be held accountable for  their  actions  by  the  payment  of
restitution to their  victims  or  community  service.  This  victim-centred
approach provides for restitution not only to the state,  but  also  to  the
victims of crime. We believe that crime can be eradicated and  South  Africa
can be the safest country, not only on the African continent,  but  also  in
the world. But to bring this about would need  a  government  that  has  the
political will to teach criminals that crime does not pay.

Secondly, the ACDP is extremely concerned about poverty and the  high  level
of unemployment in our country, which is estimated at about 6 million  South
Africans. Despite hearing about consistent economic growth since  1994,  for
which we are grateful, the fact still remains that this growth has not  been
translated into more jobs for our millions of unemployed citizens. The  ACDP
wants to  see  the  introduction  of  incentives  for  companies  to  invest
locally. Why not apply principles of reciprocity to ensure  that  our  local
manufacturers are able to compete fairly against importers, who are  heavily
subsidised?

What I found most disturbing in the speech was that the  President  did  not
find it necessary to elaborate on the Aids pandemic that is sweeping  across
our nation, or to let us know  what  Government  is  doing  to  reverse  its
relentless course. The President mentioned the word ``Aids'' only once,  and
yet made reference to Mr Mandela about 16 times. With as many as 1 600 Aids-
related deaths occurring in South Africa every day, all our people  will  be
affected physically, emotionally  or  financially  as  the  cost  of  living
soars. The ADCP wants to see the introduction of  sensible,  valuable  life-
skills programmes that will promote the  message  of  abstinence  from  pre-
marital sex, while encouraging fidelity in marriage. A similar campaign  has
helped to drastically reduce the rate of HIV infections  in  countries  such
as Uganda.

In addition  to  prevention,  the  ACDP  believes  that  medical  treatment,
including the provision of antiretroviral treatment  and  sound  nutritional
guidelines, is desperately needed in order to help prolong and  improve  the
quality of life of those living with HIV/Aids. Because HIV/Aids is a  health
issue before it is a human rights issue, the ACDP wants Government  to  make
it a notifiable disease.

Fourthly, the President briefly touched on the issue of moral  regeneration.
Our nation is desperately in need of a moral revolution and  the  Government
must seriously look at their contribution to the decline in the moral  fibre
of our society. It is going to take more  than  just  lip  service  if  real
change is going to come to South  Africa.  King  Solomon  once  said  and  I
quote:


  Righteousness exults a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.

Before  there  can  be  righteousness  in  the   nation,   there   must   be
righteousness in the individuals, and this should include even  the  leaders
of the nation. Both the throne of  the  king  and  the  government  must  be
established not only on justice, but also on righteousness.

Article 18 of the African Charter on Human and People's  Rights  adopted  in
1981, states, and I quote:


  The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society.  It  shall  be
  protected by the state which shall take care of its physical  health  and
  morals. The state shall have the duty to assist the family, which is  the
  custodian of morals and traditional values recognised by the community.


  The state shall ensure the elimination of  every  discrimination  against
  women, and also ensure the protection of the rights of the woman and  the
  child as stipulated in the international  declarations  and  conventions.
  The aged and the disabled shall also have the right to  special  measures
  of protection in keeping with their physical and moral needs.

The Constitutive Act of the  African  Union  undertakes  in  its  objectives
clause, to uphold the  provisions  of  the  African  Charter  on  Human  and
People's Rights. It is unfortunate that South Africa,  which  played  a  key
role in the founding of the African Union, has  enacted  laws  and  policies
that directly undermine traditional family values and fly  in  the  face  of
the  Government's  moral  regeneration  movement.  The  unprecedented  moral
degeneration in this country  over  the  past  10  years  of  democracy  has
resulted in dysfunctional families, wanton crime  and  corruption,  and  the
spread of the HIV/Aids pandemic. Sexual  permissiveness  and  disregard  for
the traditional family spell disaster for our  nation.  The  strength  of  a
nation  lies  in  its  families  and  certain  Government   programmes   are
undoubtedly becoming enemies of traditional family values.

The ACDP believes that the moral degeneration is a direct result of  certain
Government laws and policies, such as the legislation allowing  abortion  on
demand, which has resulted in the legal murder of more that 300  000  unborn
babies since 1997; sexual orientation  and  domestic  partnership  proposals
that legally acknowledge same-sex relationships,  paving  the  way  for  the
redefinition of marriage; the legalisation of pornography and gambling;  and
access  to  contraceptives  and  abortion  for  children  without   parental
consent.

The ACDP commits itself to promote and protect family values.  Our  policies
will strengthen the role of and respect  for  marriage  and  parenthood,  to
build stable families as the cornerstone of  society.  South  Africa  cannot
survive without strong families.

We will do everything possible to ensure that children enjoy the benefit  of
growing up in a safe and secure  environment.  The  ACDP  will  ensure  that
there are  family-friendly  legislation  and  policies  that  promote  moral
regeneration by repealing laws and policies that violate traditional  Judeo-
Christian moral ethics and undermine family values.

We strongly believe that one cannot build a  strong  nation  without  strong
families. Nation builders take the family seriously. That is  why  the  ACDP
believes not only in the rights of individuals, but also in  the  rights  of
families. [Time expired.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I  want  to  point
out that the fact that Mr Len Joubert walked to  the  other  side  does  not
mean that he was trying to cross the floor! [Laughter.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Deputy Speaker, Mr President, on  your  way  to  Parliament
from Rondebosch, you pass the memorial erected for  Cecil  John  Rhodes.  It
was Rhodes who said: "To be born an Englishman is  to  win  first  prize  in
God's lottery." He also said: "Only one race approached  God's  ideal  type,
his own Anglo-Saxon race!"

Sir, blacks and Afrikaners were seen by  Rhodes  as  inferior  and  did  not
qualify for his Anglo-Saxon definition. Why is this important?  Because  the
hon Minister Lekota, yesterday in his speech, simplified  our  history  from
1910 to 1994 into a simple black/white struggle. That was a mistake.

The ANC will never understand the Afrikaner and his aspirations if they  try
to explain everything we did in  the  past  as  simple  white/black  racism.
Those theories might be correct  in  Britain  or  the  USA,  where  a  white
majority bullies a black minority. It is not correct in South Africa.
When Minister Lekota gets angry because black people do not get jobs at  the
Mount Nelson hotel, he explains it  as  white/black  racism.  He  must  just
check if any Afrikaner got a job at that hotel! With its  colonial  history,
the chances are one hundred per cent that our English accents are  not  good
enough for us to be appointed.

The hon Minister Lekota yesterday explained how it was  a  mistake  that  in
1910 blacks were excluded from the settlement  that  led  to  the  Union  of
South Africa. I understand his frustrations. But, Sir, is he  aware  of  the
fact that two delegations from South  Africa  went  to  the  European  peace
talks in Versailles in 1919? It was  an  ANC  delegation  and  an  Afrikaner
delegation. Both delegations were not satisfied  with  the  1910  settlement
and went to ask for freedom as they saw it. Both  failed,  as  the  colonial
powers ignored their requests.

Lord Milner, Cecil Rhodes' right-hand man, wished to  ensure  the  dominance
of the British element in South Africa after the Anglo-Boer  War.  Therefore
instruction through the  Dutch  language  was  not  to  be  allowed  in  the
government schools. Milner  said:  "Dutch  should  only  be  used  to  teach
English and English to teach everything else."

Sir, as Afrikaners we fought and won that fight and will  do  it  again.  In
South Africa  in  1994  approximately  2  000  schools  were  classified  as
Afrikaans single-medium schools. After 10 years of ANC government, only  310
can still be identified as such. None of these schools are whites  only,  so
it is not a racial issue. It must be  clear  why  Afrikaners  see  new  Lord
Milners in South Africa  and  a  repetition  of  their  history,  struggling
against a colonial power.

Another example: Mr President, do you agree with the changing of  Pretoria's
name? How can I explain to an Afrikaner audience why ANC  local  governments
target only Afrikaans town names? Pietersburg and Pretoria were named  after
Afrikaner heroes.  These  names  must  now  be  changed,  causing  anger  in
Afrikaner circles. Towns named after British colonial figures  like  Durban,
Kimberley, Queenstown  and  King  Williams  Town  are  not  targeted.  These
British figures came to South Africa  and  left.  Are  we  again  struggling
against a new colonial power?

The FF Plus welcomes the forthcoming election. It gives  us  an  opportunity
to show the growth that we experienced during the last year  fighting  these
issues.  This  morning,  Mr  Sakkie  Louw,  ex-New  NP  and  DA  member   of
Parliament, joined  the  FF  Plus.  [Interjections.]  We  will  be  back  in
Parliament after the election. We will be back in greater numbers.

Die Nasionale Party het dit nodig gevind om ons  gister  hier  aan  te  val.
Hulle beskuldig ons dat ons die kiesers mislei. Waarom is  die  kiesers  vir
die NNP kwaad en gaan hulle hierdie  verkiesing  nie  vir  hulle  stem  nie?
Omdat die kiesers deur die NNP mislei is.

Elke party het 'n strategie en 'n geloofwaardigheid. Die  NNP  se  strategie
is vir kiesers tans totaal verwarrend en sy geloofwaardigheid  het  tot  nul
gedaal. Kiesers het nie probleme gehad toe die NNP net na 1994 met  die  ANC
saamgewerk het nie. Daarna in 2000  is  hulle  deur  die  huidige  leierskap
vertel dat die nuwe NNP-strategie nou is om die ANC uit die Wes-Kaap te  hou
terwyl hulle saam met die DP gaan regeer.

Nou in 2004 moet kiesers vir  die  NNP  stem,  omdat  hulle  strategie  weer
verander het. Jy moet nou vir die NNP stem om seker te  maak  dat  die  Wes-
Kaap en KwaZulu-Natal aan die ANC oorhandig gaan word!

NNP-kiesers vermoed dat NNP-strategie baie  min  te  doen  het  met  wat  in
belang van Suid-Afrika is, maar dat dit alles te doen het met wat in  belang
is van NNP-leiers se posisies. Om hierdie vermoede te bevestig,  kondig  mnr
Van Schalkwyk aan  dat  die  hoofdoel  met  sy  veldtog  gaan  wees  om  die
premierskap in die Wes-Kaap te behou! In my wildste drome het ek nie  gedink
dat ek in my leeftyd die einde van die NNP sal sien nie. Selfs mnr De  Klerk
slaag nie daarin om lewe in  hierdie  lyk  te  blaas  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The National Party saw fit to attack us here yesterday. They accuse  us  of
misleading the voters. Why are the voters angry with  the  New  NP  and  are
they not going to vote for them during this  election?  Because  the  voters
have been misled by the New NP.

Every party has a strategy and a credibility. The New NP's present  strategy
is totally confusing to the voters and  its  credibility  has  decreased  to
nil. Voters did not have problems when the New NP co-operated with  the  ANC
after 1994. Then, in 2000 they were told by the present leadership that  the
new New NP strategy now is to keep the ANC out of the  Western  Cape  whilst
they are going to govern with the DP.

 Now in 2004 voters have to vote for the New NP because their  strategy  has
changed again. One now has to vote  for  the  New  NP  to  ensure  that  the
Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are going to be handed over to the ANC!

New NP voters surmise that New NP strategy has very little to do  with  what
is in the interests of South Africa, but that it has everything to  do  with
what is in the interest of  New  NP  leaders'  positions.  To  confirm  this
supposition, Mr Van Schalkwyk has announced that the main objective  of  his
campaign will be to retain the  premiership  in  the  Western  Cape!  In  my
wildest dreams I never thought that I would see the end of the New NP in  my
lifetime. Even Mr De Klerk cannot succeed in reviving that corpse.]

Corruption is becoming a problem in  South  Africa.  I  get  more  and  more
reports of traffic police harassing people just to take a  bribe.  Sir,  you
are on record as declaring war on  corruption.  But  this  attitude  is  not
shared by everyone  in  the  ANC.  Last  week  a  prominent  ANC  member  in
Potchefstroom,  Mr  Serfontein,  distributed   the   following   letter   to
businesspeople. The heading reads: "ANC election funds."

I quote:


  With  reference  to  the  above,  we  are  appealing   to   the   various
  organisations who have benefited from opportunities created by your local
  municipality in the past, to  make  a  contribution  towards  the  above-
  mentioned fund.

He suggests R5 000.


  Future business opportunities for your organisation may well be  part  of
  the retention of your existing local government.

Shocking blackmail that cannot be tolerated.

Minister Lekota referred to Eugene Terre'blanche and that many  people  were
misled by war rhetoric before 1994. At this moment, in  our  prisons,  there
are several prisoners from the Afrikaner side and from  the  PAC  from  this
period.

I do not agree with what they did, but their only motive was  political,  18
year old boys who were misled by political rhetoric. After ten years, it  is
time to solve this problem. After the elections and as part of the  10  year
celebrations, I believe is the best time to solve  it.  Let  us  address  it
now.
Recently I spoke on these  issues  and  on  my  dreams  for  Afrikaners  and
Africa. A young Afrikaner girl from Pretoria, Barbara Botha,  sent  me  this
poem. She wrote:


  Am I African?
  How do I know that I am African?
  Is it the colour of my skin?
  Is it the language that I speak?
  Is it the beliefs of my ancestors?


  I know this ...
  The first breath I took, was of African air,
  the first word I spoke, Africa heard,
  the first step I took, was on African soil.
  Every time my heart beats, it beats for Africa.
  I am African!

I agree with her sentiments and  I  understand  her  feelings.  We  have  no
alternative - all of us. We owe it to our children  to  make  a  success  of
South Africa. We owe it to our children to create new dreams for  them  all.
That is exactly what  the  FF  Plus,  Mr  Manuel,  intends  to  do  in  this
election! Thank you very much.

[Mr L J MODISENYANE: Firstly, I would like to  acknowledge  the  manager  of
Lesedi Stereo, Mr Hlaodi Motshweneng, for bringing Lesedi Stereo  here  into
Parliament.  He  brought  Lesedi  broadcasting  here   into   the   national
Parliament to broadcast, live, the President's speech to  be  heard  by  the
people. More than two million listeners were very happy to hear  the  speech
and many of them called the station  to  comment.  I  was  surprised  by  Mr
Seremane when he became silent even when he was given  a  chance  to  appear
before the nation; he was afraid to hold meetings with the people.]

Recognising the fact that South Africa comes from a painful  past  in  which
moral decay was a reality, the ANC convened moral  summits  at  which  moral
regeneration was emphasised. Since its establishment,  the  ANC  has  always
been motivated by strong  ethical  convictions,  because  its  struggle  for
freedom was aimed exactly at achieving justice for all.

The contents of the Freedom Charter  reflect  also  on  the  envisaged  just
society. Its preamble was adopted by the new  dispensation,  and  all  South
Africans speak the same language today  in  the  new  Constitution  in  that
South Africa belongs to all its people, both black and white.

Our leadership, both past and present, have a common mission,  which  is  to
see a moral society transform from  an  unjust  and  immoral  one  that  was
brought about by the apartheid system.  Our  leaders,  together  with  their
followers, have to be commended for fighting for freedom  in  our  lifetime.
Their resounding slogan: "We shall win" became a reality  in  1994  when  we
won the first democratic election. It is important to remember  one  of  our
founding fathers, namely Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme who made a  famous  oration
at Columbia University in 1905 when he chose the topic: The Regeneration  of
Africa.

His oration made such an impact that it was quoted in  its  entirety  by  Dr
Kwame Nkrumah at the first International Congress of  Africanists  in  1962.
That famous oration is still relevant today. Every race, in  fact,  has  its
uniqueness and genius, and that does not prevent us from being  one  nation.
That is the significance of the unbroken resemblance between the ANC's  past
and present leadership. So, the hon Seremane needs to learn  that  President
Nelson Mandela is a disciplined member of  the  ANC  and  that  he  has  not
deviated from the course of ANC leadership.

In his oration, Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme said: "I am an  African."  President
Mbeki also said: "Let us start from the beginning, I  am  an  African",  and
there was a chorus from all political parties in this House, saying:  "I  am
an African". Without a shadow of a doubt, we can proudly say  that  the  ANC
lives,  the  ANC  leads.  [Applause.]  Forward  with   partnership   between
religious communities and the Government. Together we must build a  people's
contract to create jobs and fight poverty.

Die apartheidsjare herinner ons aan die gedig, "O, die pyngedagte".  Dit  is
pynlik om daaroor te dink en te praat. Dit is belangrik om  onsself  daaraan
te herinner, sodat ons nie weer na sulke tye terugkeer  nie.  Apartheid  was
onmenslik, korrup, vol bedrog en rassisties. Ons moet  nie  terugslaan  nie.
Daar is  nie  tyd  vir  Boggom  en  Voertsek-alliansies  nie.  Apartheid  is
verklaar  as  'n  sonde  teen  die  menswaardigheid  van  die  mensdom.  Die
president het dit duidelik gestel dat daar geen basis  bestaan  om  agterdog
te koester oor die toekoms van die land nie.

Wyle dr Malan, 'n vorige Eerste Minister van hierdie  land,  het  Afrikaners
eendag gevra: Waar gaan julle heen? Die antwoord is nou van mnr  Rian  Malan
gekry. Afrikaners gaan na hulle nuwe tuiste, naamlik die  ANC-regering.  Dit
is ons voorland vir nasiebou en versoening. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die apartheidstaat was 'n moordenaar. Die ANC-regering  moes  die  doodstraf
afskaf om die staat van moord af te weer. Daar is 'n groot  geraas  dat  die
galg moet teruggebring word. Ons kan ons nie aan dié geraas steur nie,  want
dit is teen die beginsel van die reg om te  mag  lewe.  Korrektiewe  dienste
word gelewer om misdadigers menswaardig te maak, sodat  hulle  weer  in  die
gemeenskap opgeneem kan word. Dit is moreel. Dit is net die ANC wat dit  kan
handhaaf. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The apartheid years remind us of the  poem,  "O,  die  pyngedagte".  It  is
painful to think  and  to  talk  about  them.  It  is  important  to  remind
ourselves of them,  so  that  we  will  not  return  to  such  times  again.
Apartheid was inhuman, corrupt, full of fraud and racist. We  must  not  hit
back. There isn't time for  Boggom  and  Voertsek-alliances.  Apartheid  has
been declared a sin against the human  dignity  of  mankind.  The  President
clearly stated that no  basis  exists  for  harbouring  mistrust  about  the
future of the country.

 The late Dr Malan, a former Prime Minister  of  this  country,  once  asked
Afrikaners: Where are you going? The answer has now been  received  from  Mr
Rian Malan.  Afrikaners  are  going  to  their  new  home,  namely  the  ANC
Government. That is our  destiny  for  nation-building  and  reconciliation.
[Interjections.]

The apartheid state was a murderer. The ANC Government had  to  abolish  the
death penalty to  put  an  end  to  the  state  of  murder.  There  is  much
clamouring that we should reinstate the death penalty. We cannot  take  note
of that clamour, because it is contrary to the principle  of  the  right  to
life. Correctional services are rendered to give  criminals  human  dignity,
so that they can again be taken up in the community. This is  moral.  It  is
only the ANC that can maintain this.]

This Government is committed to fighting corruption.  Corruption  has  never
been tolerated in ANC ranks. I expected  the  people  on  my  left  to  howl
because I know that the perception about corruption, according to  them,  is
corruption itself. Call them  to  come  forward  with  evidence;  they  have
nothing to prove. We can therefore classify them as loud-sounding  nothings.
Their reaction is to bark and bark,  forgetting  that  barking  dogs  seldom
bite.

This Government has brought about the Public  Service  Commission  to  fight
corruption in the Public Service. It is a known fact  that  public  life  is
corrupted by private interest. It is really commendable to note  that  about
80% of reported corruption cases were discovered by the  Government  itself.
We call upon the public to play their role of assisting their Government  to
combat corruption.
What  was  the  DA  before?  Was  it  not  the  Progressive  Party,  or  the
Progressive Federal Party? The Democratic Party? Their achievement  is  only
to change names rather than delivering  to  the  people,  as  they  are  now
promising. [Interjections.] [Applause.] What will their next name  be?  Wait
for the outcome of the election, which  I  am  quite  sure  will  see  their
numbers extremely reduced because they banked on the support of the  New  NP
which discovered their lies before it was too late.

Now the poor IFP has also fallen into that trap just for  its  survival,  as
was said by the Minister yesterday. [Interjections.] [Applause.]  Alas!  How
can you survive with the assistance of a party that is on  its  way  out  of
the political scene?

[In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that  good  behaviour  is  a  very
important thing. That is why the ANC encourages the youth  to  go  back  and
change their behaviour. The famous Reggae singer called Burning Spear  says:
"Humble yourselves my children, humble yourselves my little ones."

Respect for adults  is  African.  We  should  always  remember  our  elders'
teachings and advice. Don't allow yourself to be tricked.  Your  forefathers
fought for your rights even before you were born, so  that  you  could  reap
the fruits of freedom. Learn everything about the history of  your  country,
so that you may know that many people died so that you could have the  right
to choose your own leaders.

 If you don't take my advice seriously, you will cry over spilt  milk.  Stop
playing and go to the elections; your future is in your  hands.  The  future
leaders will come from you, young  people,  the  real  leadership,  not  the
leadership of people who are not well informed. If we do not know  where  we
come from, we won't  know  where  we  are  going.  So,  let  us  all  commit
ourselves to work together with our Government  to  create  jobs  and  fight
poverty, for time waits for no man. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Deputy Speaker, Comrade President, I want to start  by
doing something very uncharacteristic in this House today. I want  to  thank
President Thabo Mbeki for reminding us about the vision that  they  set  for
this country in 1994. I also want to acknowledge the role played by all  the
liberation movements in delivering democracy to this House and country.  But
this welcome reminder,  Mr  President,  has  only  reinforced  how  we  have
strayed from the vision that we set for ourselves in 1994.

As we approach the third national elections as a free country,  we  need  to
stop and ask ourselves whether we are happy  with  the  way  we  have  moved
forward as a nation. No doubt, the ANC will tend to highlight the  successes
- and to be fair, there have been many - while the opposition  parties  will
be quick to point out the failures. The ID believes, however, that the  past
10 years of our democracy should not only be  judged  on  the  successes  or
failures of Government, but on how we as a nation  have  collectively  taken
forward the vision that we all had for our country back in 1994.

The country we live in today is undoubtedly better than the one  we  emerged
from in the dark and tragic days of apartheid. It would be an insult to  all
those who fought against such a regime though, to now use it as a  benchmark
for our success. We thankfully set higher  standards  for  ourselves,  which
are represented in the  most  democratic  document,  our  Constitution.  The
mistake we all fell into, however,  was  to  think  that  producing  such  a
document was the end point  of  the  struggle.  The  ID  believes  that  the
document must serve as our solid launch pad for our future.

We have witnessed too many cases over the past  10  years  where  Government
has  sometimes  not  remained  true  to  the  letter  and  spirit   of   the
Constitution. In the much quoted cases of Grootboom,  the  Treatment  Action
Campaign, the Richersveld case,  we  have  seen  the  good  rulings  by  the
Constitutional Court. While I am extremely grateful for  the  power  of  the
Constitution and the Constitutional Court to hold Government to  account,  I
am also  dismayed  at  Government's  constant  disregard  for  the  founding
document of our new nation. It is a bitter irony that the  very  people  who
helped draft the Constitution are now violating it.

Comrade President, also in your response to the Hefer Commission report  you
stated that I should be called before Parliament and  disciplined.  Well,  I
challenge you today in this House to  do  exactly  that,  because  I  really
question the understanding of the parliamentary processes. I also hope  that
your legal advisers will advise you better.

Let us also consider the sorry state of our  politics  in  South  Africa.  I
believe that, far  from  building  bridges  in  our  nation,  our  political
parties have continues to be divided. Opposition parties, in the  quest  for
votes, will stop at nothing to achieve  their  ends.  People  are  dying  in
KwaZulu-Natal as a result  of  political  parties  jostling  for  their  own
selfish needs. I call upon President Thabo Mbeki and Minister  Buthelezi  to
lower the political temperature in KwaZulu-Natal, so that  the  bloodletting
can be prevented.

Our  people  deserve  more  maturity  from  their  political  parties.   The
challenge for opposition parties is to tangibly show Government how  it  can
improve  its  performance,  as  opposed  to  simply  just   rejoicing   when
Government is messing up. It is also unfair of some  opposition  parties  to
now attack Government on nondelivery, when they have also had  a  chance  to
show the electorate what they could do. In this province, the Western  Cape,
there is debt, sex scandals and division. I hope  the  courts  send  all  of
them to jail.

We have, in the Western  Cape,  a  Premier  who  continues  to  lie  to  the
province that he is putting education first. The ID  is  aware  of  the  107
mobile  classrooms  that  were  ordered  by  the  provincial  department  of
education in 2003, at an astronomical cost of R135  000  per  classroom.  So
far, only 12 have been delivered. If we bought the classrooms  directly,  it
would have cost us only R85 000. The classrooms have not been delivered.  We
also have a contractor from Gauteng and, even though he  has  not  delivered
on the 107 classrooms, he was, again, issued  another  contract  to  provide
more classrooms.

The problem with this, Comrade President, is that  it's  our  children  that
are affected by this. We have schools where there are more than 65  children
in one classroom. The schools affected by this are  Masipumele,  Nomzana  in
Strand, Sedgefield in George and Heins Park in Mitchells Plain. This is  the
product of the unholy alliance between the  New  NP  and  the  ANC  in  this
province. We demand the resignation of  both  Ministers  Tasneem  Essop  and
Andre Gaum for not only lying to us, but for failing to  deliver  classrooms
in time to our children. [Interjections.]

The ID is happy that the Government will be spending R100  million  more  on
infrastructure development. The economic policy of the ID is that this  R100
million  should  be  spent  on  eradicating  the  backlog  of  repairs   and
maintenance of our deteriorating hospitals, schools and roads, by  investing
this money into SMMEs, so that they can also grow.

HIV/Aids is continuing to divide us, through our destructive  stigmatisation
of HIV-positive people in South Africa. We  do  not  have  strong  political
leadership  to  personify  the  struggle  against  HIV/Aids.  Our  political
leaders need to follow the footsteps of our new breed of heroes  like  Nkosi
Johnson and Khabzela, who were not afraid to speak out and act on HIV/Aids.

In contrast we have a Government that is relegating HIV/Aids to a  vegetable
patch, from garlic to a touch of olive oil and beetroot. The African  potato
is now being swallowed and ditched. When are we going to  get  out  of  this
madness and face the issues? We urgently need to train  people  and  provide
the medicines. When will the Minister  take  the  epidemic  seriously?  Stop
scratching around in  the  vegetable  patch  and  go  visit  the  people  in
hospitals and the bereaved. [Interjections.]

Crime in South Africa is also dividing  our  people,  and  communities  live
through the fear it generates. We need to speed  up  the  transformation  of
our justice system. We need far more courts  to  be  built  and  prosecutors
need to be paid a decent wage. The same applies to the police.

When we launched our access to education initiative  a  few  weeks  ago,  we
received a number of calls from concerned applicants who want to  help.  But
I want to quickly turn to opposition parties.

Opposition parties have an important role to play in our democracy and  they
must stop fragmenting our society. The ID is growing the opposition and  not
fragmenting it. [Interjections.] I want  to  say  to  Kortbroek  -  he  must
listen, even though he is  not  here  -  that  it  does  not  mean  allowing
ourselves to be co-opted by the ruling party  for  the  sake  of  short-term
political gain.

Die NNP is nou die snol van die ANC, die hoer, die houvrou van die  ANC,  en
dit is nie opposisie nie! [Tussenwerpsels.] [The New NP  is  now  the  ANC's
harlot, the whore, the concubine of the ANC, and this is not opposition!]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Agb Boy Geldenhuys, jy kan solank begin sing, "Gaan  my  nie
verby, O Heiland", want jy gaan nie weer terugkom in die volgende  Parlement
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Hon Boy Geldenhuys, you can start singing  "Pass  me
not, Oh Gentle Saviour", because you will not be  returning  to  Parliament.
[Interjections.]]

The ID offers ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has expired!

Mrs P DE LILLE: It's not yet...

The DEPUTY  SPEAKER:  No,  it's  already  55  seconds  more  than  you  were
allocated! [Interjections.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Oh, thank you.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Comrade President and Madam Speaker, it  is  that  time
of the year when leaders and members of political parties  are  required  to
respond to and interact  with  the  speech  of  the  hon  President  of  the
Republic of South Africa.

Allow me to start with something that relates to some of us and  others  who
are out there amongst our people in the streets and in the villages. In  the
past, because of a society that was built on the supremacy of white  people,
because of a society that was governed by racial segregation, because  of  a
society that enriched only white people at the expense of  the  majority  of
the people, because of a society that made us grow  up  having  no  trousers
and no shirts to wear, and having no homes, many of us had to grow up  in  a
struggle. We walked barefoot and did not even have jackets to wear.

In years gone by we wore a loincloth and when  winter  came,  we  made  fire
from wood we collected from the bush to keep all family members  warm.  From
such an early age we cannot remember, we only  ate  once  a  day  and,  even
then, food was not enough and often we would not  know  in  advance  whether
there would be food tomorrow.

We grew up thinking that  poverty  was  normal  in  our  villages.  This  is
because the existential situation was such that we could not move  from  our
villages to the towns. All the boys and girls in the villages  wore  similar
clothes, played together and sang songs of  sorrow  together.  This  is  the
society we come from.

At that time our knowledge of society was  limited  to  village  activities,
their ethos and their hopelessness,  but  today,  after  so  many  years  of
struggle, we know that the villages we grew up in were  not  very  different
from many informal settlements in our country. We now know, also, that  many
black people who do not live in villages live in  informal  settlements.  We
have also come to know that there are many street children in  our  country.
This state of affairs must change after the elections.

Those who grew up the way  I  have  described,  those  of  you  who  had  to
struggle against the apartheid regime in  order  to  speak  freely  here  in
Parliament, Azapo says to you:  We  should  actually  redouble  our  efforts
together to free our people even more. [Applause.] For those of you who  did
not have to struggle in order to gain a vote, you should not dare  to  think
that we have forgotten the past. You should not dare to  think  that  we  do
not know what poverty is.

Azapo would like you to understand that, had it not been for the  fact  that
the society we fought against favoured you, you would have gone through  the
same pain that  black  people  went  through.  Azapo  believes  that  it  is
paternalism, particularly for the DA  which  benefited  from  apartheid,  to
love black people only during election time, in order to  get  their  votes,
to keep their privileges. [Applause.] The challenge is: If  you  love  black
people,  why  do   you   oppose   restitution   and   land   redistribution?
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

What Azapo places in front of you is  that  to  show  your  love  for  black
people, you should be prepared to share  the  wealth  you  acquired  through
apartheid with black people. You should be prepared to support black  people
in their struggle to get their land back. [Interjections.]

As we debate the President's speech,  Azapo  also  knows  that  hawkers  are
constantly being harassed in the streets of Johannesburg. Azapo  also  knows
that these are the people we want to incorporate into  our  economy  system.
Azapo's assessment is that hawkers, spaza shops, shebeens  and  taverns  are
major employment facilities for ordinary people and, as a result,  we  would
like to see a programme designed specifically for these groups, in order  to
enhance their economic status in society.

Saki Macozoma, writing about black  economic  empowerment,  in  an  abridged
version of his speech which appeared in the City Press on 8  February  2004,
had this to say:


  What is clear is that the political transformation that South Africa  has
  undergone since the early 1990s has not  been  matched  in  the  economic
  sector. Research shows that, despite  the  progress  towards  equity  and
  equality that has been made in the past 10 years,  whites  still  benefit
  economically, disproportionate to their numbers, their efforts and  their
  natural abilities.


  This continuing disparity has produced a new political problem that could
  develop into a political risk factor in the  future.  Black  people  have
  political power and whites have economic power.

To this end, Azapo supports the President when he  asserts  that  there  are
many black people who are still suffering out there. Indeed, the dignity  of
poor people is at stake. The 10 years of democracy has to be judged  against
the quality of life of poor people. [Applause.]

Ms N B GXOWA: Deputy Speaker, President, Deputy  President,  hon  Ministers,
hon members, it is unfortunate that the opposition parties do  not  want  to
hear about our people's past. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I'm  going
to do here. You will have to bear with me because we have to  say  where  we
come from, in order to be able to reach our destination.

It is an honour and a privilege, Mr President, to congratulate you  on  your
comprehensive account and reflection  of  the  10  years  of  democracy  and
freedom in our country. In support of the President's state  of  the  nation
address on 6 February, I would like to share my  experience  as  an  African
woman and  the  successes  that  the  ANC-led  Government  has  achieved  in
systematically ensuring the expansion of the frontiers of  human  fulfilment
and the continuous extension of the  frontiers  of  freedom  to  many  South
Africans, especially women.

As we celebrate  the  tenth  year  of  our  freedom  and  democracy  in  our
beautiful country, there are things that we must honestly remember.  One  of
those things is where we come from. We need to  remember  that  the  African
woman in South Africa experienced triple oppression,  namely  gender,  class
and racial discrimination. As a result, African women are the most  poverty-
stricken, downtrodden section of our South African population.

I was born and grew up in KwaDukathole in Germiston, now  called  Katlehong.
This was a location, like many others during the apartheid  days,  which  an
African needed a permit  to  enter.  A  brutal  incident  happened  in  this
location during my time there. This incident will linger in my memories  for
a long time to come. This is how, through this horrendous incident,  I  have
to remember KwaDukathole. A pregnant woman was  walking  in  the  street  of
KwaDukathole when a patrolling police van stopped next to her  and  demanded
a permit, which she didn't have. Although she offered  to  show  the  police
where she stayed, the police put her in the  van  and  continued  patrolling
and arresting more victims whilst the woman was in labour  in  the  back  of
the van. Sadly and humiliatingly, the poor woman gave birth in the  back  of
the van in front of all the other victims. That is where we come  from,  hon
Patricia de Lille.

African  women  constitute  the  poorest  of  the  poor  and  are  the  most
downtrodden and humiliated in our society. Between  80%  and  90%  of  these
women worked as domestic workers. During the apartheid days, those who  were
not fortunate to find work depended on making African brew and  selling  it.
Unfortunately, this was not allowed. Those found practising  this  trade  to
earn a living were arrested and sentenced to a period of not  less  than  30
days.

The second experience I want to share with this House involves  the  origins
of some of the names that were given to us by the oppressors. I  wonder  how
many of us know  where  the  names  like  "Annie"  and  "Nanny"  come  from.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Tell us!
Ms N B GXOWA: Yes, I'm going  to  tell  you  just  now,  Khosi.  During  the
apartheid years, African people were not allowed to knock at the door  of  a
white woman or white man's house to ask for a job. One had to  walk  up  and
down the streets shouting: "Any job missies, any  job  missies?"  She  would
then open the door and wouldn't ask your name - who you are  and  where  you
come from. She would ask you whether you could iron a shirt for her  husband
and would tell you to iron a shirt. She wouldn't ask your  name,  she  would
just call you Annie or Nanny. If you were lucky, at the  end  of  the  month
you would be paid, and if you were unlucky, at the  end  of  the  month  she
would say she was not paying you because you were a  thief,  you  stole  her
husband's shirt. That's where we come from.

Thirdly, it is a well-known fact  that  African  women  were  humiliated  in
apartheid prisons. When arrested, African women were  taken  to  the  prison
parade in the courtyards, where the poor women were  made  to  undress.  You
would never be admitted to a cell before you were  undressed,  because  they
said you were carrying dagga and weapons. So you had  to  be  undressed  and
searched before you went into the cell. They were instructed  to  perform  a
high jump, irrespective of size or age. They had to  stand  in  that  parade
and jump, so that whatever they carried on them or in their breasts fell  on
the floor. Whilst the warders were doing that to the women  -  and  in  some
cases they were men - they would then call upon a security man who would  be
standing on the balcony and say, "Phoyisa, kom sien die  vrou."  [Policeman,
come and see the woman.] That's where we come from. This was the worst  kind
of humiliation that any human being could endure.

Women have always been the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We,  the
women of South Africa, have every reason to look back to where we come  from
with pride and dignity. The ground that we have covered, travelled  and  won
many  victories  on  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  ANC-led
Government. We need to thank ourselves and the ANC-led  Government  for  our
successes. The ANC-led Government was able to restore the dignity  of  South
African women by bringing back the remains of Sarah Baartman to  be  finally
laid to rest in a dignified and  respectable  manner  in  the  land  of  her
birth. [Applause.]

Allow me to add to the real story of the successes that the  ANC  Government
has achieved  in  the  decade  since  1994.  Although  job  reservation  was
abolished prior to 1994, its real meaning and application was given  content
and practice by the ANC-led Government. The Group Areas Act  was  abolished,
ending a long history of segregated settlement. Women have been given  their
right to sign contracts on  their  own  behalf  -  African  women  were  not
allowed to sign hire purchase contracts, buy cars and houses. As  a  result,
Rev Meshoe - family values - some women got into  marriages  of  convenience
to get a man for security, to come and sign a contract if she wanted to  get
a house. That is the reality we all know and that's where we come from.

Influx control was abolished and adult education introduced, of course,  all
thanks to the ANC because, as I said earlier, 80% to 90% of women  were  not
educated and worked as domestic workers.  Today  we  have  introduced  adult
education and many of our women are educated  as  a  result  of  that.  Free
health care for pregnant women and children is  being  provided  now.  Also,
broad-based Black Economic Empowerment has been introduced  and  that  will,
amongst others, enable women to use their talents to advance  their  careers
both in business and in government. One person  said  to  us:  "Really,  you
know  the  ANC  did  good  by  bringing  women  into  these  decision-making
positions. How many of us  here  in  South  Africa  would  have  known  that
Nkosazana  Zuma  can  be  such  a  capable  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs?"
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

Ms N B GXOWA: I want to say, let's go and vote for  the  ANC  and  implement
the people's contract. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, it was interesting  to  listen  to  the
speech by the hon Minister of Defence yesterday. He enlightened  us  on  the
remains of racism and discrimination in the labour field, quoting  an  hotel
manager who says he cannot appoint black workers because  their  English  is
too poor. That of course is balderdash and a very poor  excuse  for  blatant
racial discrimination against blacks, because we all  know  that  there  are
thousands and  thousands  of  black  people  seeking  employment  who  speak
excellent English.

Racism and discrimination in the labour field have  thus  not  finally  been
eradicated, especially racism and discrimination against white  workers,  as
I will shortly demonstrate. During  the  past  10  years  it  has  been  our
prerogative to support the transformation process. We did so  on  the  basis
of bringing justice to  all,  especially  those  who  have  previously  been
disadvantaged. In the labour field, injustices and imbalances  of  the  past
were addressed by creating a system of affirmative action, which we  in  the
IFP support.

Today, after 10 years, the previously disadvantaged not  only  govern  South
Africa, its nine provinces and practically all local governments,  but  also
serve in most senior positions in  the  civil  service  and  are  also  well
placed  in  business.  Black  economic  empowerment  is  being  successfully
applied and the previously disadvantaged are finally getting their share  of
South Africa's prosperity. We have of course not arrived  yet,  but  we  are
well on track.

There, however, unfortunately appears to be one  hurdle  which  together  we
have to address, namely that the system of affirmative action is not  always
fairly  implemented.  The   interpretation   of   labour   legislation   and
regulations sometimes leads to  what  is  generally  known  as  ``unintended
consequences''  for  which  the  Government   cannot   always   be   blamed.
Misinterpretation of labour laws  and  regulations  lead  to  the  unfounded
belief that  Government  and  private  companies  are  obliged  to  unfairly
discriminate against whites. It appears  that  because  of  uncertainty  and
unintended consequences, employers tend to go too far in  their  application
of affirmative action,  with  the  result  that  they  discriminate  against
whites.

I  am  concerned  that  these  unintended  consequences  will  lead  to  the
resuscitation of old wrongs and  are  counterproductive  to  reconciliation.
Please allow me to quote just a few practical  examples  of  alleged  unfair
discrimination against whites. These are serious allegations and  the  truth
thereof needs to be urgently verified.

Firstly, Telkom allegedly issued a directive  that  white  males  at  senior
level are not to be appointed  or  promoted.  Although  this  directive  was
subsequently withdrawn, very little  at  Telkom  has  changed  in  practice.
Secondly, the unemployment equity plan of the Blue  Train  prescribes  that,
as far as possible, no whites are to be appointed. Thirdly, white  policemen
were not promoted because they were white; the Labour Appeal  Court  ordered
their  promotion.  Fourthly,  Denel  allegedly  produced  a  document  which
stipulates that no whites  may  be  appointed  or  promoted  unless  special
application is made to Denel's board.

Sanlam has refused to award a bursary to  the  Western  Cape's  top  student
because he is white. An Eskom manager allegedly said that the sooner  whites
realise that there is no room for  them  at  Eskom,  the  better  everything
would be for Eskom and its employees. Gold Fields and Telkom use race  as  a
criterion when determining who are to be  retrenched.  A  white  matriculant
with an average of 98,9% is denied a bursary because he  is  white.  A  very
shocking further example  is  one  Peter  John  Shapiro,  a  cum  laude  law
graduate from Potchefstroom, who could not find work because of  the  unfair
application of affirmative action. Mr Shapiro said: ``I would  rather  be  a
first-class citizen in somebody else's country than a  second-class  citizen
in my own country.''

Mr President, I am sure that you, like all of us, would want to  have  these
and many other similar damning allegations verified. If found  to  be  true,
they no doubt constitute racial  discrimination  against  whites  in  direct
contravention of the spirit of our Constitution.  You,  sir,  are  also  the
President of the white community. White citizens of  this  country  look  to
you today, respectfully requesting your protection in  accordance  with  the
Constitution against unfair discrimination in the labour field. Whites  find
it progressively more difficult to find employment, not  because  there  are
no  jobs  available  for  them,  not  because  they  are  not  appropriately
qualified, no, simply because they are white.

I appeal to you today to look seriously into this matter. Something  has  to
be done to prevent the creation of new forms of  injustices  and  imbalances
and thereby repeat the evil and harmful cycle. We  propose  a  solution.  We
propose that the code of good practice  of  the  Employment  Equity  Act  be
revisited and amended or even that a complementary code be devised to  serve
as a  set  of  just  guidelines  on  exactly  how  employers  are  to  apply
affirmative action, but stripped naked of the  unintended  consequences  and
in the true spirit of the Constitution.

We propose that the Ministry of Labour, trade unions, research  institutions
and other interested parties plan and devise such an amended  code  of  good
practice, which is to include an equality accord amongst  all  stakeholders.
White workers call for your protection based on the very principles  of  our
Constitution, namely that there should be a place in our land for  everyone;
there should be equality for all, and there should be no  racial  or  unfair
labour  discrimination  against  whites,  which  condemns  young  whites  to
permanent unemployment.

What we need in the labour field is real and fair empowerment for all,  also
for  whites,  real  jobs  for  all  our  people  and  no  racism  or  unfair
discrimination against some. Our people therefore call on the  President  to
prevent old wrongs and injustices being resuscitated in  the  labour  field,
to ensure equality for all through a proper code of good practice.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker, hon  President,
the late Albert Luthuli said: Man is my brother, not my blood.  But  because
we cherish the same values and stand  for  the  same  standards,  I  believe
personally that notwithstanding the fact that our cultures are  diverse,  we
come to live together. To my mind that is  the  real  meaning  of  unity  in
diversity.

Die enigste pad vorentoe vir Suid-Afrika is dat al sy mense saamwerk  om  'n
beter land vir almal te bou. Die NNP  is  reeds  trots  om  te  sê  dat  die
samewerkingopsie die beste is om die behoeftes van minderhede - Bruin,  Wit,
Indiër en Swart - wat nie vir die ANC stem nie,  op  die  regeringstafel  te
kry. Die anti-alles DA en De Lille-opsie is natuuurlik aantrekliker vir  die
elite en die rykes wat meen hulle het niks van die regering nodig het en  'n
tweede apartheidsrede soek sodat hulle nie 'n bydrae hoef te  lewer  om  die
lot van arm mense te verbeter nie. Deur samewerking is  daar  reeds  heelwat
welslae behaal, soos onderhandelinge met die Minister  van  Verdediging  vir
die herontplooiing van  die  SANW  op  die  grens  tussen  die  Vrystaat  en
Lesotho, om veediefstal hok te slaan.

Die uitbreiding van die antiretroviraleprogram teen MIV-Vigs  wat  op  hande
is, en 'n toename van 50% in Suid-Afrikaanse polisiegetalle in die  Wes-Kaap
teen die einde  van  volgende  jaar;  beleidsgesprekke  oor  verskille  soos
godsdiensbeoefening in skole en die regering se erkenning aan  die  NNP  vir
sy positiewe rol wat hy gespeel het met  die  grondhervormingswetgewing  wat
gelei het tot konsensus en 'n beter uitkomste - is  maar  enkele  voorbeelde
van hierdie samewerking tussen die NNP en die ANC.

Die agb Kraai van Niekerk het baie te sê gehad hier,  maar  hy  het  destyds
soos 'n klein kindjie vasgesteek en  geskop  en  sy  speelgoed  uit  sy  kot
gegooi toe ons uit die Regering van Nasionale Eenheid gestap het. Nou is  hy
weer dikbek omdat ons terug is in 'n veelpartyregering. Aan watter kant  van
watter draad sit die Kraai nou? Hy is 'n tipiese politieke trekvoël.

Op die gebied van versoening en nasiebou is baie bereik.  Alle  gemeenskappe
regdeur Suid-Afrika toon dat hulle mekaar meer verdra  en  tans  behaal  ons
die beste sukses in  vennootskap.  Hierdeur  het  die  NNP  geslaag  om  die
minderheidsregte in Suid-Afrika te help vestig deur inspraak  waar  besluite
geneem word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The only way forward for South Africa is for all its people  to  co-operate
in building a better country for all. The New NP is  already  proud  to  say
that the co-operation option is the best to get the needs  of  minorities  -
coloureds, whites, Indians and blacks - who do not vote for the ANC, on  the
government's table. The anti-everything DA and the De Lille option  are,  of
course, more attractive to the rich and the elite who  think  that  they  do
not need anything from the government and  who  are  looking  for  a  second
apartheid reason not to contribute  to  improve  the  plight  of  the  poor.
Through co-operation a lot  of  success  has  already  been  achieved,  like
negotiations with the Minister of Defence for the redeployment of the  SANDF
on the border between the Free State and Lesotho to combat stock-theft.

The expansion of the antiretroviral  programme  against  HIV-Aids  which  is
about to be launched, and an  increase  of  50%  in  the  numbers  of  South
African police officers in the Western Cape by the end of next year;  policy
discussions about differences such as the practising of religion in  schools
and the government's acknowledgement of the positive role the New NP  played
with regard to the land transformation legislation which  led  to  consensus
and better outcomes - are but a few examples of  this  co-operation  between
the New NP and the ANC.

The hon Kraai van Niekerk had a lot to say here, but back  then  he  behaved
just like a little child when he stopped dead in his tracks  and  threw  his
toys out of the cot when we walked out of the Government of National  Unity.
Now he is sulking again because we are back in a multiparty  government.  On
which side of the fence is the Kraai [Crow] sitting now?  He  is  a  typical
political migratory bird.

A great deal has been achieved  in  respect  of  reconciliation  and  nation
building. All communities throughout South Africa are showing that they  are
more tolerant of one another and currently  we  are  experiencing  the  best
success in partnership. Through this, the New NP has  succeeded  in  helping
to establish  minority  rights  in  South  Africa  by  having  a  say  where
decisions are made.]

My party and I positioned ourselves to be part of  the  contributors,  Madam
Speaker and hon President, for the next 10 years of democracy.  The  New  NP
wants to contribute to the success lying ahead, to contribute  to  the  next
decade of struggle to make South Africa  work,  to  push  back  poverty  and
unemployment, to create one South Africa for all and  to  put  South  Africa
first.

In reality, however, the official opposition seems to be born  breakers  and
not builders, critics rather than  participants;  spectators  who  stir  the
emotions of the people on the stand but completely isolate  them  from  what
really counts, moaners and blamers who stir the emotions of the  people  who
are disadvantaged, but  leave  them  on  the  road  of  destruction  through
excuses.  For  in  reality  they  can  do  nothing  for  the   disadvantaged
coloureds, Indians  and  blacks  after  wasting  their  votes  in  the  next
election, repeating  their  own  history  of  contributing  nothing  to  the
building of our country. My party and I choose to be contributors.

The DA is marginalising its voters, preventing them from trying  to  have  a
positive outlook on South Africa. They use fear  tactics  to  canvass  white
and  coloured  voters.  They  are  shouting  "swart  gevaar"   again.   They
absolutely love it when something goes wrong in South Africa,  because  they
have then no other issue that they can mislead these vulnerable  voters  on.
It is not in the DA's best interest that South Africa works.  We  all  agree
that South Africa deserves better than  the  DA.  What  is  easier  than  to
criticise, to be negative and to spread the  message  of  fear?  They  don't
have  to  do  anything  constructive  nor  do  they   have   to   take   any
responsibility.

The fact of the matter is that  the  DA  is  a  totally  negative  force  in
politics today,  trying  to  tell  the  world:  Only  white  men  understand
democracy. Blacks, Indians and coloureds cannot govern. [Applause.] That  is
the message you want to tell us, trying to convince people to withdraw  into
laagers on the fringes  of  South  African  society.  [Interjections.]  They
convince people that that is the safest place. We all see those  unfortunate
posters that start with ``fight this'' and ``fight that'' and all it  really
means is ``fight blacks'', the back-to-apartheid brigade of the DA.

A famous motivator said: The purpose of life is to help others  but  if  you
can't help them - and we know that these  breakers  cannot  help  anybody  -
please do not hurt them. Listen and learn. The New  NP  believes  that  more
must be done to combat crime. Zero tolerance to criminals.

Geen genade vir misdadigers, swaarder strawwe vir geweldsmisdaad, meer  howe
om kriminele te straf, 'n konstabelmag om plaasaanvalle en misdaad teen  die
landelike bevolking te stop, noem en verdoem  korrupte  amptenare,  versterk
die polisie en korrektiewe beamptes met groter getalle en  beter  toegeruste
manne en vroue. Die tyd het  gekom  om  drastiese  stappe  te  neem  om  die
misdaadsituasie in die land aan  te  spreek.  Mense  mag  nie  eie  reg  uit
frustrasie gebruik  nie,  veral  omdat  hulle  voel  die  situasie  kan  nie
verbeter nie. Wanneer 'n baba of weerlose verkrag of wreed vermoor word,  is
dit tyd om die doodstraf weer in te stel. Die NNP glo die herinstelling  van
die doodstraf as afskrikmiddel en 'n vonnis vir gewelddadige misdaad  is  'n
oplossing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[No mercy for criminals, heavier sentences for violent crimes,  more  courts
to punish criminals, a  police  force  to  combat  farm  attacks  and  crime
against the rural population, name and shame corrupt  officials,  strengthen
the police and correctional officers by adding greatly to their numbers  and
giving them better equipped men  and  women.  The  time  has  come  to  take
drastic measures to address the  crime  situation  in  the  country.  People
should not take the law into their own hands  out  of  frustration,  because
they feel that the situation  cannot  be  improved  upon.  When  a  baby  or
defenceless person is raped or  viciously  murdered,  then  it  is  time  to
reinstate the death penalty. The New NP believes  in  the  reinstatement  of
the death penalty as a deterrent as well as a solution  to  and  a  sentence
for violent crime.]
Overcrowded correctional facilities are a testimony that we are turning  the
tide on crime,  presenting  us  with  a  new  challenge  to  prevent  crime,
shifting from communities to correctional facilities. It is a  privilege  to
be part of the Government. Therefore, the New NP will  use  the  opportunity
as part of  correctional  services  and  the  criminal  justice  cluster  to
contribute  to  the  solutions  to  address  crime,   relieve   overcrowding
responsibly and correct the criminal behaviour in our facilities.

Ek werk elke dag met misdaad en misdadigers, maar die grootste misdaad  teen
Suid-Afrika en sy mense is om ons te polariseer, agterdog  en  haat  aan  te
wakker, soos die DA dit doen.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  [I  work  with  crime  and
criminals on a daily basis, but the biggest crime against South  Africa  and
its people is to polarise us, incite suspicion and  hatred,  as  the  DA  is
doing. [Time expired.]]

Mr B A RADEBE: Madam Speaker, his Excellency the President of  the  Republic
of South Africa, hon members, comrades and compatriots, today I  would  like
to  start,  first,  by  saluting  the  farmworkers  of  South  Africa,   who
contributed so much to the economy of this country and, yet, got  so  little
in return.

In particular, I would like to salute Mr Nelson  Shisane  from  the  Limpopo
Province, who was recently thrown into the  lion's  den  by  the  farmer  he
worked for because he was a troublesome worker. I would also like to  salute
Mr Lenepa Petrus Mxira, who resided somewhere near Vrede in the Free  State,
and who had worked on the same farm for 45 years, but because this year,  on
15 March, he was going to turn 60 years old, and the Extension  of  Security
of Tenure Act was going to improve his tenure on the farm, the farmer  tried
to push him off the farm, first of all by forcing him to reduce  the  number
of cattle he owned from 29 to 10, in the space of  one  week.  When  he  saw
that this racist farmer was at his back, he knew  that  the  only  place  of
safety in such a situation was the ANC. He ran to  the  constituency  office
at Vrede, where, after reporting the matter, he passed away immediately.

The farmer was not even satisfied with that. What he  did  was  to  try  and
stop this worker, who had worked on that  farm  for  45  years,  from  being
buried on that farm. However, because the ANC  is  there,  we  went  to  the
police services and the Department of Land  Affairs,  and  ensured  that  Mr
Petrus Lenepa Mxira was buried with  dignity  last  year,  on  17  November.
[Applause.]

This debate occurs on the eve of the return to District Six of  one  of  the
families which were forcibly removed from  the  District  Six  area  in  the
sixties. This event reminds me of the brutish  governments  which  have  led
this country for many years. In 1913, the Union of  South  Africa  passed  a
retrogressive Act known as the Natives Land Act of 1913. The thrust  of  the
Act was to ban land sale transactions between  blacks  and  whites  of  this
country. The violation of this Act by any individual led to a fine of up  to
£100, which is about R500 000 in  terms  of  today's  monetary  values.  Any
deviation from this Act was supposed to be approved by  the  then  governor-
general. This Act confined the blacks in the native  scheduled  areas.  This
laid  the  basis  for  separate  development  and  the   disintegration   of
communities and families, because 85% of blacks were  condemned  to  13%  of
the land and whites occupied 87%.

The apartheid government passed the Group  Areas  Acts  of  1950  and  1966,
which exacerbated the  land  hunger  of  the  indigenous  people.  This  Act
identified the black spots which were converted into white  residential  and
business areas. This Act led to  the  massive  forced  removal  of  cohesive
communities. The forced  removals  led  to  the  undermining  of  the  human
dignity and economic rights of these communities. District Six  was  one  of
the areas which suffered under the Group Areas Act.

In 1968, there was an uprooting of thousands of people in the  District  Six
area. This led to the undermining of their dignity, because  they  were  not
consulted during the  execution  of  this  move,  and  they  suddenly  found
themselves with insecure land tenure. This meant that they could  not  build
new houses and businesses in the place of their birth.
With the creation of the democratic state in 1994,  the  ANC-led  Government
passed the Land Restitution Act  of  1994,  which  enabled  the  victims  of
forced removals to  have  their  land  rights  restored.  The  District  Six
Beneficiary and Redevelopment Trust was formed to oversee the  redevelopment
of District Six. This body was appointed by  the  ex-residents  of  District
Six to co-ordinate the claims, resettlements and redevelopment  of  District
Six. The mission of the trust is  to  drive,  co-ordinate  and  monitor  the
process of land restitution in District Six.

Working jointly with local, provincial and national authorities,  the  trust
functions  with  the  explicit  purpose  of  facilitating  the   return   of
previously disadvantaged individuals to their ancestral land. The  trust  is
committed to the principles of faith and fairness, and seeks to restore  not
only the land  of  District  Six,  but  also  to  reclaim  a  heritage,  co-
operation, respect and dignity.

This mission was realised by the President of South  Africa,  Comrade  Thabo
Mbeki, the Minister of Land Affairs, the Mayor of Cape Town, the Chief  Land
Claims Commissioner and the trust, when the  handing  over  of  certificates
was done in 2002. This event was a confirmation of the creation of a people-
centred society by this ANC-led Government.

The success story of District Six is one of  the  36  489  land  restitution
claims  which  were  settled  since  1994,  benefiting  more  than   5   000
households, involving 457 000 beneficiaries. The outstanding 43  205  claims
will be settled  by  2005,  since  an  efficient  administrative  settlement
process was adopted by this Government.

Since this ANC-led Government  is  committed  to  the  millennium  goals  of
halving  poverty  by  2012,  this  Government  will  ensure  that   30%   of
agricultural land will have been distributed by the year 2014,  which  means
that 24,6 million  hectares  will  have  been  transferred  to  historically
disadvantaged people. This will ensure that the rural masses  will  be  able
to have their  own  land  for  food  security  and  will  be  able  to  farm
commercially.

This target can be met because 466 000 hectares  of  state  farm  land  have
already been disposed of to emerging farmers. This represents 69,78% of  the
land disposed of. These emerging farmers have already been helped through  1
988 projects, which involved sub-programmes like  the  settlement  and  land
acquisition grant, the equity schemes, labour tenants and the commonages.

These projects involved the transfer  of  more  than  1  700  000  hectares,
through both land redistribution and tenure reform.  This  amounted  to  the
delivery of 2,2% of total farm land of South  Africa,  which  translates  to
8,6% of the  national  targets  of  redistribution,  which  is  30%  of  the
agricultural land, in 15 years.

The Elra sub-programme will ensure that emerging farmers will graduate  into
commercial farmers with enabling grants from the  Government.  These  grants
will enable farmers to buy  agricultural  inputs,  cover  land  acquisition,
land improvements, infrastructure investment  and  capital  assets.  Through
the Land Bank, the projects are approved  and  financed  after  the  project
proposals are submitted.

The aspiring farmers are trained and allocated to the mentorship  programmes
to ensure the success of these projects. These  projects  also  ensure  that
the historically marginalised groups like women and young people  are  taken
on board. The racist and brutish acts of  the  apartheid  regime  must  have
inspired former President Mandela to make a call  that  the  ANC  Government
should create a people-centred society, where the dignity of all the  people
would be guaranteed.

Over the past ten years, his  vision  has  been  realised  as  this  ANC-led
Government has put programmes, systems  and  institutions  in  place,  which
restored the social and economic rights of all the people.  The  restoration
of  economic  rights  posed  many  challenges.  For  example,  we  have  the
existence of two economies in one country. The first economy is  integrated,
technologically advanced and its  participants  score  high  on  the  living
standard measure of the SA Advertising Research Foundation.

The participants of the first economy scored an  LSM  of  ten,  which  means
that they are educated, affluent, high-tech  consumers  in  the  suburbs  of
South Africa's metropolitan centres. This economy  came  about  because  the
former regime ensured that the participants of this economy got  first-class
education, which was relevant to the skilled needs  of  the  economy.  Their
businesses were heavily subsidised, their businesses paid  starvation  wages
to the workers and their businesses were over-regulated and  protected  from
external competition.

The second economy is characterised  by  low  levels  of  technical  skills,
marginalisation, underdevelopment and high  levels  of  poverty.  This  came
about because of the many years of bantu education, which was  unleashed  on
the participants of this second economy. The  participants  of  this  second
economy usually  score  low  on  the  living  standard  measure  of  the  SA
Advertising Research Foundation. The consequences of participating  in  this
economy are that a large  number  of  people  are  structurally  unemployed,
compared to the other economy in which people are in  cyclical  unemployment
or are experiencing frictional  unemployment.  This  means  that  Government
must make deliberate interventions, like the re-skilling of the  people  and
come up with social programmes which will stem the marginalisation of  these
people.

This ANC-led Government initiated one of  the  most  successful  programmes,
which  is  the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme.  This   programme
received the International Labour Organisation award  for  promoting  social
cohesion and alleviating poverty, because it  was  labour-intensive  and  it
involved the participation of communities.

Over the past nine years, the programme was able to  create  more  than  150
000 short-term jobs and created productive assets like clinics,  classrooms,
créches, access roads, water canals and multipurpose community  centres.  In
the process, the participants in the programme acquired useful  skills  like
project management and social skills  such  as  community  consultation  and
participation.

Based on this successful experience, the  people's  movement,  the  ANC,  is
going to forge forward with the people's contract and create work and  fight
poverty through  the  use  of  the  Extended  Public  Works  Programme.  The
Extended Public Works Programme will be more  massive  than  the  Community-
Based Public  Works  Programme  because  more  than  R100  billion  will  be
invested in creating infrastructure which will integrate both the first  and
the second economies.

The infrastructure envisaged is the  improvement  of  roads,  rail  and  air
transport, as well as improvements  in  the  telecommunications  and  energy
sectors. This will encourage more investment in key economic  sectors,  such
as manufacturing,  information  and  communication  technology,  mining  and
business   services,   which   will   further    enhance    our    economy's
competitiveness. This will enable our economy to create more than a  million
jobs in the next five years, because labour-intensive methods will be  used,
which will benefit the participants  of  the  second  economy,  through  the
acquiring of skills and job opportunities.

Since the private sector  investments  tend  to  follow  the  public  sector
investments, more jobs will be created in the procurement  of  services  and
tools needed to sustain the Extended Public Works Programme. The  consistent
GDP growth of more than 10% per  annum  in  the  developing  countries  like
China, in the past ten years, came about  because  of  programmes  like  the
Extended Public Works Programme.

To ensure the success  of  the  infrastructural  development,  this  ANC-led
Government  has  already  established  a  structure  like  the  Construction
Industry  Development  Court,  which  will  ensure  that  the   construction
industry delivers  quality  infrastructure,  promotes  economic  growth  and
provides sustainable opportunity for all participants.

The CIDP Act  empowers  the  board  to  establish  a  national  register  of
constructors,  which  will  categorise  contractors   in   a   manner   that
facilitates public sector procurement and promotes  contractor  development.
The national register of projects will provide information  on  the  nature,
value and distribution of the projects, and will provide the basis for  best
practice projects assessment skills.

These registers will be transparent to ensure  black  economic  empowerment.
That's why, in response to your question, President,  that  this  Government
must be judged whether it has created a people-centred society, we say  that
14 April is the day when that question will be  answered,  because  we  know
that the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa will  vote  ANC
and look forward to the second decade  of  freedom.  [Interjections.]  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

 Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, the  Secretaries,  the  President  and  hon
members,  the  state  of  the  nation  address  offers  the  Government   an
opportunity to live up to its legitimate objective, which is to  inform  the
nation about what they have done, need to do and have not done. Last  week's
address did just that.

For us in the UCDP one area that has to be  examined  closely,  is  the  one
around local municipalities. A good number  of  these  structures  has  been
called into question. We have lost  count  of  the  number  of  councillors,
mainly from the ANC, who  have  been  shown  the  red  card  on  grounds  of
ineptitude,  which  includes  theft,  fraud  and  corruption,  yet  the  rot
persists.

As it is, tomorrow, 11 February, the NCOP will be receiving and  considering
reports on the Qaukeni and Lekwa Teemane Municipalities resulting  from  the
interventions of the provincial governments of  the  Eastern  Cape  and  the
North West that resulted in the dismissal  of  ANC  councillors.  Some  town
managers are on suspension  because  of  their  indiscretion  in  allocating
themselves obscenely high remuneration packages.

The Government has to concede that the wall-to-wall government  system  that
was introduced with fanfare does not work. In  metros such  as  Johannesburg
and  Tshwane  there   are   problems   with   billing   systems,   and   the
unconstitutional disconnecting of water  and  electricity,  while  in  other
areas towns have become centres of unhygienic living because  of  the  filth
and stench from uncollected refuse.

The UCDP believes in taking action, even with the  millions  of  rands  that
were earmarked for urban  renewal  at  Bekkersdal,  Gauteng  and  cannot  be
accounted for. This is even more necessary as the amount  was  announced  on
the occasion of the President's imbizo in the area. There should be no  room
for stalk borers who siphon funds away and leave  the  needy  desperate  for
help.

The provision for education in  junior  phases  seems  to  be  difficult  to
access. According to the 2001 census there has been a drop in the number  of
citizens who have completed primary and secondary school, compared with  the
1996 census. This is  cause  for  concern.  There  should  be  no  drops  in
enrolment in these phases of schooling. There is of  course  an  upsurge  in
the  higher  education  phase,  mainly  because  of  the  National  Students
Financial Aid Scheme.

We would argue that primary education should be resourced better.  The  drop
in enrolments at lower levels can be attributed  to  parents'  inability  to
pay for their children's education because of poverty and mainly because  of
unemployment.

We have noted, Mr President, the quick  response  of  the  cellular  company
that erected a mast about seven  days  after  it  was  requested.  We  plead
therefore that the staff in the Presidency do likewise or better.

On 15 January 2004 we enquired by letters sent to both the  Union  Buildings
and  Tuynhuys  about  the  fate  of  the   people   in   the   crossboundary
municipalities in relation to which provinces their votes would  go  to  but
to date we have had no response. One wonders whether it is a matter  of  the
dark spot being underneath the candle.
We call for the roll-out of Public Works projects so that people may earn  a
living while learning skills they can use once the  projects  are  complete.
This will bring an end to doling out social grants, as  they  tend  to  make
people dependent on hand-outs and thus lose their dignity  and  self-esteem.
The biblical injunction is that we should all  live  by  the  sweat  of  our
brows. More work opportunities will be created with this, and I thank you.

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Speaker, in his excursion down memory  lane,  the  hon
President  referred  to  President  Mandela  on  a  number  of  occasions  -
correctly so. President Mandela was the very epitome of  confidence  in  the
future of our country simply because all South Africans trusted him.

What is the situation today? I need only point to two  indicators.  Firstly,
thousands of talented young South Africans are  leaving  to  seek  a  better
future elsewhere. Secondly, capital investment, both foreign and  local,  is
not such that new employment opportunities are keeping up with the need.  In
fact, jobs are on the decline.
The hon President must take a very hard look at the  reasons  for  this  and
the extent to which his presidency has failed  to  inspire  confidence.  You
cannot simply send out mixed messages all the time and expect to  inspire  a
belief that the future will be  stable.  On  the  contrary,  mixed  messages
breed uncertainty and a lack of confidence. I  wish  to  point  to  some  of
these negative signals.

I am glad to say that the President has now said that he wants our  national
teams to win. In the past he said transformation  was  more  important  than
winning. That brings me to transformation, the very  subject  that  the  hon
Koos van der Merwe has dealt with exhaustively -  I  can  only  confirm  and
endorse everything he said. The point is that, for our people, some  are  in
a  shorter  queue  than  others  when  it  comes  to  the   ever-diminishing
employment and other opportunities. South Africa deserves a  better  way  of
eradicating past injustices.

But there is also the  signal  about  safety.  How  long  still  will  white
farmers be systematically robbed and murdered? It reminds us  of  Nero,  hon
President, except that Nero did not have a jet to play with.  Regarding  the
Mugabe victims, what are we doing to assist those  people,  South  Africans,
that are being robbed by Robert Mugabe?  Zimbabwe  is  a  signatory  to  the
International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Why  does
the President not let South Africa sign and use that  avenue  to  refer  the
confiscations for arbitration by international tribunals?

The hon President, I am sorry to say, has failed to  protect  the  interests
of his people. They put their trust in their President.  He  had  to  choose
between Mugabe and his own citizens. He chose Mugabe. They deserve better.

Then, we live with the constant tampering with the Constitution.

Ons het reeds die sluimerende, maar dreigende onteiening  van  mineraleregte
en  waterregte.  Nou  het  die  President  'n  wet  gemaak  en  geteken  dat
onteiening  gebruik  kan  word  vir  restitusie  onder   die   vaandel   van
grondhervorming. Is dit die pad wat grondhervorming gaan  loop?  Hoe  skakel
dit in by die feit dat daar  nou  'n  voorstel  is  dat  die  ras  van  elke
grondeienaar aangeteken moet word in 'n register? Waarheen is ons op pad?

Dan het ons verder ten opsigte van die Grondwet die Asmal-aanslag  op  taal-
en kultuurregte via ons skole. Die ergste is nog die belaglike  "certificate
of need'' wat die agb Minister van Gesondheid nou wil vereis.  Ek  bring  'n
saluut aan die 2 000 mense wat 'n  petisie  gebring  het.  Ek  sien  in  die
koerant hulle praat nou van haar as Dokter Knoffel. Sy  moet  oppas  dat  sy
nie eerder die naam van Dokter Patat verdien nie: "Doctor African Potato".

Konstitusionele vandalisme, wat besig is om plaas te vind, wek nie  vertroue
nie. Die Grondwet is veel, veel meer as net die woorde wat daar staan.  Daar
is ook in die Grondwet 'n gees wat ingebou is  en  wat  geleef  het  in  die
harte van die  mense  wat  dit  tot  stand  gebring  het.  (Translations  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We already have the slumbering, but threatening  dispossession  of  mineral
and water rights. Now the President has  drafted  and  signed  an  Act  that
expropriation can be used for restitution under the banner of  land  reform.
Is this the road that land reform is going to take? How does  this  link  up
with the fact that there is now a proposal  that  the  race  of  every  land
owner must be entered in a register. Where are we going?

Then we furthermore have, regarding the Constitution, the  Asmal  attack  on
language and cultural rights via our schools.  The  worst  of  all  is:  the
ridiculous "certificate of need" that the hon Minister of Health  now  wants
to demand. I salute the 2 000 people who brought a petition. I  see  in  the
newspaper they now refer to her as Doctor Garlic. She must  take  care  that
she does not instead earn the name  Doctor  Sweet  Potato:  "Doctor  African
Potato".

Constitutional  vandalism,  which  is  taking   place,   does   not   instil
confidence. The Constitution is much, much more than  just  the  words  that
are written there. The Constitution also has built into  it  a  spirit  that
lived in the hearts of the people who drafted it.]

But I want to refer to a last mixed signal: the way the hon President  deals
with our political system. Our  Constitution  aims  at  securing  multiparty
democracy for South Africa. That is what the Constitution  regards  as  best
for South Africa. This presupposes opposition, but the  President  obviously
prefers a system of co-option which effectively silences the opposition.  We
see that he obviously prefers opposition parties to become his lapdogs.

Mag ek die agb President waarsku: 'n skoothondjie kan hom nie verdedig  nie.
'n Skoothondjie kan net 'n groot gemors op sy skoot veroorsaak. [I  want  to
warn the hon President: a lapdog cannot defend him. A lapdog can  only  make
a big mess in his lap.]

The DA will never be that. I shall state my case and the DA will  state  its
case without being intimidated. It is for the electorate, even if  it  is  a
minority of the electorate, to say that they like or that they dislike  what
we are saying. We say  to  them:  South  Africa  deserves  better.  To  that
message they must respond. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms L M  T  XINGWANA:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  President  and  hon  members  of
Parliament, I  do  believe  that  the  DA  is  indeed  a  one-eyed  monster.
[Interjections.] The hon  Delport  just  talks  about  the  whites  who  are
leaving South Africa. He does not talk about the many whites who are  coming
back, having discovered that the grass is not greener away from  home,  that
home is best and that South Africa is the best home for all South  Africans.
[Interjections.] He does not even talk about the black youth who  are  going
overseas to learn more skills, and who will  then  get  all  those  advanced
skills and come back, contribute and plough back into the economy  of  South
Africa.

Mr President, you have, on TV,  addressed  the  question  of  Zimbabwe  very
adequately.

Abangena zindlebe zokuva  abasoze  beve.  [Those  without  ears  will  never
hear.]
I had the honour to address the women of the Labour Party in Westminster  in
October last year. Some of the issues raised there were about  Zimbabwe  and
what the President is doing. I told them  that  Zimbabwe  is  not  the  10th
province  of  South  Africa,  and  therefore  does  not   fall   under   the
jurisdiction of the South African  President.  However,  the  President  has
addressed the issues of human rights, violence  and  all  issues  concerning
the people of Zimbabwe on television and in many other speeches.

I just wanted to address Mr Joe Seremane.

Ke maswabi he, ha ntate Seremane a balehile kajeno. Ke a bona ba mo  shapile
haholo maobane, ha a kgone ho emela dithupa tsa kajeno. [I am sorry that  Mr
Seremane has run away today. I realise that they gave  him  a  real  hiding,
yesterday, and he cannot face today's punishment.]

I just want to remind Mr Seremane that at one stage  we  were  directors  of
the SACC. I was the director for women's ministries;  he  was  the  director
for justice and reconciliation. I want to go back to what  we,  through  our
liberation theologians in the SACC, defined as reconciliation. According  to
our  liberation  theology,  reconciliation  must  be   based   on   justice,
repentance and practice, that is, you must practise what you preach. I  must
not look to my left and see white  balding  males,  males  with  grey  hair,
representing the DA. I must see change in that party, if the DA is indeed  a
party for change. [Interjections.]

First of all, we must accept and correct the injustices of  the  past,  that
is reconciliation, before we can talk. There  can  never  be  reconciliation
without justice. In other words, we cannot reconcile God and the  devil.  We
cannot  reconcile  a  party  that  has  become  more  right  wing  and  more
reactionary than any other party in this House  with  the  people  of  South
Africa.

This is the reconciliation that the great theologians  and  leaders  of  our
time, including Rev Beyers Naudé, Rev Frank Chikane  and  Dr  Albert  Nolan,
praised and practised; this is the  reconciliation  that  the  ANC  and  its
leadership, including President Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela,  who  formed
part of the collective leadership of the  ANC,  fought  for  and  strove  to
achieve throughout their lives. It is a  reconciliation  that  is  based  on
justice, equality, respect for human  and  women's  rights,  love,  sharing,
caring and unity. These are the values that the ANC has  espoused  from  its
foundation in 1912 to date.

 Our people will  continue  to  vote  for  the  ANC  in  their  overwhelming
numbers, because this is the only party that espouses  these  values  today,
tomorrow and forever, and for a  thousand  and  a  million  years  to  come.
[Interjections.] Women in particular will  continue  to  vote  for  the  ANC
because of the strides we have made under the ANC leadership.

Malibongwe! [Let women be praised!]  In  the  gallery  we  have  women  from
Ilitha Labantu, from NGOs in  South  Africa  such  as  the  Victoria  Mxenge
project, who  have  been  working  and  supporting  the  Government  in  its
endeavour to fight violence against and abuse of women,  and  to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

Mr Tony Leon said that South Africa would like to vote for change.

Abukho ubuvuvu nobuxoki obufana nobo. [Nothing could  be  further  from  the
truth.]

South Africans will not vote for a party that  will  take  them  back  to  a
racist, apartheid South Africa ... [Interjections.] ... which  is  what  the
DA has been fighting for in this House  since  1994.  [Interjections.]  They
have fought against every piece of legislation that has opened the doors  of
our schools to all the children of South  Africa  ...  [Applause.]  ...  and
that has opened the mining industry to  all  the  people  of  South  Africa,
including women.

Babaleka, boomama,  bahamba  baya  phesheya  kweelwandle,  baya  kusilandela
abelungu  ababecinga  ukuba  babhetele,  bazi  kakhulu.  Bafika   singajiki,
singabuyi ngamva sibheka phambili. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  Ngoko  ke,  yintshutshiso
ye-DA, ethethe ngayo apha, boomama, eza kusibuyisela eYiphutha;  kulapho  ke
abantu bakuthi bangasayi kuya khona. [Uwele-wele.]

Mna ke, maqabane, ekhaya kuseMqanduli. Inkokeli ye-UDM  -  ndilusizi  ayikho
apha - ngumkhaya. Sobabini siyazi ukuba  umbane  phaya  eMqanduli  siwubone,
okokuqala, phantsi koRhulumente  we-ANC,  hayi  kowakhe.  Bendiphaya  ekhaya

ngonyaka  ka-2000.  Ndothuke  kakhulu  ngumbono  endiwubone   ekhaya   ngalo
Disemba.  Idolophu  ibimdaka,   inkunkunkuma   yeevenkile   ibilahlwa   apha
esitalatweni.  Amangcwaba  oomama  nootata   ebegqunywe   yingca,   ingangam
ndimile, kugcwele ubobo namatyholo,  ungakwazi  nokulibona  ingcwaba  lomntu

Ndiyabazi ke mna  oomama,  abawafuni  amaxelegu.  Ndiyabazi  ke  mna  oomama
abasokuze bavotele  amaxelegu  nabantu  abangena  mbeko,  abangazihloniphiyo
izinyanya  zezwe   lakowethu.   Sekela-Mongameli,   mandingene   emxholweni.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The women ran overseas to  fetch  white  people,  whom  they  thought  were
better informed, but when they came back they found us progressing  and  not
retrogressing. [Applause.] Therefore it is the oppression that  the  DA  was
talking about here, which is going to take us back to Egypt, and we are  not
going there. [Interjections.]

Comrades, my home is in Mqanduli. Unfortunately the UDM leader is not  here,
but he is my homeboy. We both know that there was no  electricity  there  up
until the ANC Government and not in his regime. I was home during  Christmas
time. We unfortunately went through a sad period in that area of losing  our
municipality to the UDM in local elections  in  the  year  2000.  I  was  so
shocked by what I saw there in December. The  town  was  untidy  and  dirty;
streets were full of litter from the shops. The graveyard was  buried  under
tall grass and shrubs, it was so neglected  that  you  would  never  find  a
relative's grave in it.
I know that women do not like untidy people. They  would  never  give  their
vote to people without courtesy, who do not respect their ancestors.  Deputy
President, let me get to the point.]

Madam Speaker, President and hon members, since 1994,  after  the  birth  of
the first democratic, nonracial, nonsexist  Government  in  our  motherland,
which is led by the ANC, the quality  of  life  and  status  of  women  have
improved  substantially  in  South  Africa.  The   adoption   of   the   new
Constitution of South Africa, which  has  been  declared  one  of  the  most
progressive constitutions worldwide, was a major victory for  the  women  of
South Africa.

For South African women the Constitution is  their  charter  of  rights.  It
embraces  the  hopes  and  aspirations  of  women  and  men,  many  of  whom
sacrificed their lives, fighting for justice and equality  in  our  country.
The  Constitution  is  a  product  of  the  liberation  struggle  that   was
spearheaded by the ANC in South Africa, that spurred  the  urban  and  rural
communities, the old and the young, women and men to fight against the  pass
laws, dispossession and forced removals, exploitation  and  abuse,  poverty,
inferior education and laws that discriminated against women.

One of the most significant features of the Constitution  is  the  right  to
equality. It is hailed as the  cornerstone  of  the  Constitution,  and  all
other rights must be interpreted to give effect to equality.

The main thrust  of  the  South  African  constitutional  democracy  is  the
promotion and protection of human dignity for all. It provides  a  framework
for human freedom, which connects civil rights and socioeconomic  rights  in
a holistic manner, affirming and protecting the  integrity  and  dignity  of
all our people. Therefore, to us, the Constitution is not only  the  supreme
law of the land, it is the single most significant document  that  seeks  to
address the injustices of the past and provides a vision for the future.

Today, at the beginning of  the  21st  century,  the  African  century,  the
legal, political, socioeconomic and cultural status  of  women  has  changed
fundamentally in South Africa. This is the result of 10  years  of  struggle
by the ANC in this House against the forces of darkness. The  ANC,  together
with the people and the women of South Africa, will  fight  to  protect  and
defend their Constitution.

With regard to the achievements of women in public  and  political  life,  I
would like to quote from Cedaw:


  State  parties  shall  take  all  appropriate   measures   to   eliminate
  discrimination against women in political and public life of the  country
  and, in particular, shall ensure that women are on equal terms with men.

This is from the Cedaw Convention.

I now come to the achievements of South African women in  the  first  decade
of freedom and democracy. Currently in South Africa, the high proportion  of
women MPs and women in Cabinet is, largely, as a result of the ANC  adopting
a one-third quota for women representatives. Other parties  were  forced  to
include women ...

... kuba ayesazi ukuba anizi kuwavotela, boomama.  [...  because  they  knew
that you women would not vote for them.]

There has been a steady increase  in  the  number  of  women  Ministers  and
Deputy Ministers in the South African Cabinet  since  the  first  democratic
elections.

Post-1999, under  the  presidency  of  hon  Thabo  Mbeki,  the  Cabinet  now
consists of nine women Ministers, which is 30% of  the  Cabinet,  and  women
make up 50% of Deputy Ministers. [Applause.] At provincial level, we have  a
24% representation for women. Only three  provinces  have  reached  the  30%
representation. These are Gauteng,  Limpopo  and  the  North  West,  and  of
course those are ANC-led provinces.

In our big metro cities we have only one  mayor  who  is  a  woman,  and  we
indeed need to improve in this regard. We still have just one woman  premier
and we hope that in the coming  year  we  will  have  at  least  four  women
premiers. [Interjections.]

This is important because it highlights the level of women's  representation
in our Government and Parliament in South Africa, and is the result  of  the
political will demonstrated by the leadership  of  the  ANC,  starting  with
former President Nelson Mandela and now the current President  Thabo  Mbeki,
who has actually improved on the  initiative  started  by  former  President
Mandela.

We have women in the judiciary and we need to increase the number  of  women
so that our efforts to transform the judiciary will be a  success.  We  want
to applaud Judge Serete for having sentenced a  father  who  had  raped  his
five-year-old daughter. It was the first time that a judge  said  that  this
was a serious crime and that we therefore needed to  come  up  with  a  very
heavy  sentence,  and  imposed  the  maximum  sentence   on   this   father.
[Applause.] We hope that other judges will follow suit.

We have a number of laws that have been mentioned  by  other  members,  that
have affirmed the position of the women of South Africa. The challenge  that
remains is the implementation of these laws. This  Government  has  set  the
foundation for the  liberation  and  emancipation  of  the  women  of  South
Africa. We therefore ask all our women to  join  the  people's  contract  to
create work and fight poverty.

We have already mentioned the  projects  women  have  initiated.  Women  are
ready. We also want to say, let us transform our tendering system  and  make
it more accessible and user-friendly, particularly in so far  as  women  are
concerned. [Applause.]

We also want to say that we  need  a  special  development  fund,  like  the
Umsobomvu Fund. We have had a  number  of  meetings  called  by  Mrs  Zanele
Mbeki, at which we were talking as South African women in dialogue.  One  of
the main concerns amongst women is poverty. Women out there are ready to  go
and initiate projects to create jobs and to fight poverty. However, we  need
that special fund. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, the hon President trumpeted the successes  of
the past 10 years during his state of the nation address on Friday.  But  he
was silent on the challenges and failures which have  hampered  progress  in
the social services cluster. He failed to mention that by the end  of  2001,
five million people were infected by HIV; that 660 000  children  have  been
orphaned by HIV/Aids; that there are 16 000 disgruntled doctors; that 4  413
health care professionals resigned in 2003 and that there are 23 442  vacant
posts in the health care sector at the present moment; and that,  in  short,
the health of South Africa is  seriously  ailing,  and  has  been  since  Dr
Garlic took charge of this vital portfolio.

When the President said in his  address  that  the  masses  will  not  allow
desperate politicians to do desperate things to  win  or  retain  power  for
themselves, I take it that he was referring  to  the  Minister  of  Health's
pathetic attempt to hold on to her job by introducing draconian  legislation
which disables doctors and  compromises  patient  care.  Clause  36  of  the
National Health Bill stipulates that  all  health  care  professionals  must
apply for a certificate of need in order  to  practise.  This  clause  is  a
violation of the constitutional rights of  doctors  in  that  it  encroaches
upon the right to freedom of trade, occupation and profession, as  protected
by section 22 of the Constitution.

The certificate of need also  intrudes  on  the  doctors'  rights  to  human
dignity and freedom of movement and residence. In short, it can  be  likened
to a reintroduction of the Group Areas Act.  So,  while  the  hon  President
does not foresee that there will be  any  need  for  new  and  major  policy
initiatives, the DA asks the President to consider  its  petition  to  refer
the National Health Bill back to the NA  for  reconsideration  in  terms  of
section 71 of the Constitution of South Africa.

The hon President remarked at the weekend that he does not  know  why  there
is so much emphasis on HIV/Aids. Perhaps  I  could  enlighten  him  on  that
score. Mr President, secret research done by the Department  of  Health  has
found that nearly half of the patients in state  hospitals  had  Aids.  This
report is under wraps, so it may account for your failure to  see  why  more
aggressive measures  are  needed  to  contain  the  pandemic.  A  report  by
Parliament puts present  Aids  infection  rates  at  five  million,  with  a
reported 1 500 new infections per day, of which 200 are babies, and we  have
about 600 deaths per day. The life expectancy in South  Africa  has  dropped
from the mid-lower seventies to the  fifties  as  a  direct  result  of  the
pandemic, yet another reason to place more emphasis on Aids.

The reality is  that  health  in  South  Africa  is  currently  in  a  life-
threatening crisis. The President's day has for the past two years been  the
focus of protest action. In 2003, the TAC marched  on  Parliament  to  voice
their concern at Government's refusal to roll out antiretroviral  drugs.  In
2004, doctors marched to protest against the declining  public  health  care
facilities and restrictive legislation. On both occasions, the  Minister  of
Health has been  breathtakingly  arrogant,  chastising  the  protestors  for
spoiling an important occasion. She must shoulder the  blame.  Her  attitude
has  set  her  on  a  collision  course  with  doctors  and  activists.  Her
incompetence in dealing with her portfolio has resulted  in  health  matters
being decided by litigation, and her refusal to  comply  with  court  orders
reflects her contempt for the  rule  of  law.  It  is  indeed  a  cause  for
concern.

The DA believes that South Africa deserves better than the present  Minister
of Health and  her  delusional  gardening  theories.  Hon  President,  South
Africa deserves a better  health  care  system.  The  DA  calls  on  you  to
prescribe a serious remedy to cure the Minister of her  feverish  ramblings,
to put her out  to  pasture  and  inject  a  greater  sense  of  urgency  in
addressing the challenges which are  crippling  the  health  sector  in  our
country. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  ARTS,  CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Madam
Speaker, hon President, hon members, kumnandi  ukuma  kweli  qonga,  utekete
njengoko i-DA isenza, udlala ngobomi babantu [it must be pleasing  to  stand
here and babble, as the DA does, putting people's  lives  at  stake  in  the
process], all for political expediency. We know for a fact that  the  DA  is
not committed to the welfare of our  poor  people.  [Interjections.]  It  is
harping on the HIV/Aids issue purely for one reason: political expediency.

I think the issue of statistics that only  the  DA  is  privy  to,  is  very
questionable. We know for a fact that the President did address  this  issue
of the absence of the real reason behind our people dying so much.

First of all, I would  like  to  pay  tribute  to  Dr  Ngubane,  the  former
Minister of Arts,  Culture,  Science  and  Technology,  for  his  invaluable
contribution to the development and  implementation  of  the  policies  that
sought to transform our society, especially in the area  of  arts,  culture,
science and  technology.  We  wish  him  well  in  his  latest  appointment.
[Applause.] We know that he will distinguish himself  in  his  new  mandate.
Secondly, I would also like to welcome my new Minister, Mlambo Ngcuka.

My input focuses on nation-building. I want to emphasise  that  this  is  an
ongoing project  of  reconstructing  our  society,  which  needs  all  South
Africans to enter into a contract with the  Government  if  we  want  it  to
succeed.

I'm  particularly  focusing  on  culture,  which  was  used  as  a  tool  to
perpetuate racial discrimination during the colonial period and  later  used
as a foundation for  establishing  the  apartheid  system.  Conversely,  the
democratic Government ushered in in 1994 chose to utilise culture as a  tool
for nation-building.

It is a fact that the colonial and apartheid regimes  manipulated  the  fact
that  the  people  of  South  Africa  are  different:  We  speak   different
languages; we dress differently; we have different  traditions  and  values;
we eat different food. At the heart of this differentness was the fact  that
the cultures and traditions of the indigenous people  and  the  majority  of
South Africans were perceived to be  inferior  to  those  of  the  minority.
Consequently, all policies of  apartheid  governments  were  designed  along
these lines, so that we saw things in black and white, as  in  inferior  and
superior.

For us, Dr  Mulder,  whether  white  meant  being  English  or  British,  or
Afrikaans meant being an Afrikaner, blacks at the  time  were  still  third-
class citizens under both colonisation and apartheid, in the land  of  their
birth.

I want to give a few examples of the policies that I spoke about earlier  on
where race was used to disenfranchise the majority of the people:  The  Land
Act of 1913, which  was  basically  about  taking  away  an  asset  from  an
inferior person who did not deserve to lead a noble life and to make  it  an
exclusive white privilege.

When the Afrikaners took power in 1948 they never attempted to reverse  this
situation; instead they intensified it. And surely, Dr Delport,  the  people
haven't forgotten that. That is the reason why, in showing their  confidence
in the ANC that liberated them and in the Government that has been ably  led
by our President, they will vote overwhelmingly on 14 April, refreshing  the
mandate of the ANC because it is their only hope. [Applause.]

The legacy which manifests itself in the two economies  that  the  President
spoke about was the result of such policies as the Land Act of  1913,  which
enforced poverty on  the  majority  while  the  minority  group  enjoyed  an
opportunity to accumulate riches.

The education system is another example. We had about 17  education  systems
in this country, all of them along  racial  lines.  We  remember  Verwoerd's
philosophy that blacks deserved an inferior education  so  that  they  could
remain subservient to the whites.

On the occasion of enacting the system of Bantu Education in 1953,  this  is
what Verwoerd said, and I quote:
  The black man has been subject to a school system  which  drew  him  away
  from his own country and misled him by showing him the green pastures  of
  European society on which he is not allowed to graze.


  Under the new Act, natives were to be taught from  childhood  to  realise
  that equality with European is not for them.  Different  races  in  South
  Africa were to be educated separately, not with equal  funding  or  equal
  opportunities  for  entrance  at  university,  but  rather  in  a  system
  separated along racial lines where the black will be  suppressed  forever
  more.

That was a very strong statement from Verwoerd. "There was no place for  him
in the European community"  ...  [Interjections.]  Because  he  never  spoke
against that, and he knew that all the years  he  was  there.  It  was  only
after 1994 that he became so vocal in speaking on behalf of the poor.


  There was no place for him in the European community above the  level  of
  certain forms of labour, and for that reason it is of no value to receive
  a training which has as its aim absorption in the European community.

This was institutionalised as a system of  governance  and  the  consequence
thereof was a society polarised along racial lines. It is this  legacy  that
the ANC had to deal with when it took over the reins of power  in  1994.  We
had to deal with such attitudes of hatred that disregarded that we  are  all
human and that we all have the right to be and to exist as we are.

The ANC brought hope to millions of South Africans who  were  struggling  to
deal with their prejudices. We knew that the challenge we had to  deal  with
was not easy, from the very  outset,  when  we  proclaimed  in  the  Freedom
Charter the vision that "South Africa belongs to all who live in  it,  black
and white" - a call for unity among all South Africans.

In 1994 the biggest question that we were faced with was: How were we  going
to create an environment which would lead to people accepting  one  another,
given that - one, we were a bleeding society; two, we were  divided;  three,
we were in a situation where the majority was deprived and destitute;  four,
we still had pockets of arrogance; and five, we still had  people  who  were
resistant to change, a situation which still prevails to date.

Even though we knew that this was a mammoth  task,  it  was  clear  that  we
needed to succeed in our  commitment  to  unite  the  country  in  order  to
achieve the stability necessary for  social  and  economic  development.  We
also knew that only the ANC  could  provide  leadership  to  this  challenge
because from its inception in 1912, the primary objective of the ANC was  to
create a nonracial and nonsexist society.

How then did the ANC-led Government respond to this challenge of  rebuilding
the  nation,  ridding  it  of  racial  stereotypes  that  characterised  our
society? We've laid a strong foundation for the preservation, promotion  and
development of our cultural life in all its spheres, among other things.
We have policies and a constitution that guarantees the equal protection  of
all and allows all human beings  to  exist  and  coexist,  without  fear  of
prejudice. We  have  a  constitution  underpinned  by  human  rights,  which
creates an environment where any violation of human rights is outlawed.

Realising that the laws under apartheid had impoverished about  85%  of  the
population of South Africa - the blacks; the indigenous people - we  ensured
that our policies sought to redress  this  situation  in  a  fair  and  just
manner. We had to address the material  imbalances,  if  the  reconciliation
project was to be meaningful, otherwise the vision  of  creating  a  people-
centred society would not be realisable. The ANC, again, was wise enough  to
realise the need for an open process of reconciliation and made it the  main
focus of its transformation agenda.

The Constitution  clearly  gives  all  of  us  the  right  to  reassert  our
individual  identities,  creating  the  atmosphere  for  different  cultural
expressions while learning to tolerate and appreciate other cultures.
South Africa, like all other countries that were  colonised,  is  recovering
from the effects of a cultural bomb that was unleashed by  colonisation.  In
his book Decolonising the Mind, Ngugi wa Thiongo describes  this  experience
as having an effect of  annihilating  a  people's  belief  in  their  names,
languages, environment, heritage, unity and, ultimately, in themselves.

 In our Constitution and through the policies of our Government,  as  people
of South Africa, we committed ourselves to redressing the issues  that  were
outlined by Prof Ngugi. Our approach  in  redressing  this  situation  is  a
comprehensive one. It is multipronged in nature because it addresses  issues
from all walks of life. These issues  include  culture,  language,  economy,
education, poverty, and so on. Of course, we are always guided by  the  need
to be inclusive, carrying along the whole nation in all these processes.

Madam Speaker, today I  would  like  to  highlight  and  emphasise  language
rights as language  is  central  to  culture  and,  as  Prof  Ngugi  rightly
submits,  language  is  central  to  a   process   of   decolonisation   and
deracialisation.  We  also  need  to  appreciate  that   South   Africa   is
characterised by diverse cultures and by  implication  this  means  that  we
have many languages.

We are certain as the ANC that  our  policies  are  adequate  and  that  the
responsibility for all of us is to ensure that laws respond  to  the  plight
of the poor, whom they were meant to benefit.

As a country, we are faced with the huge task of implementing  the  National
Language Policy. There are enormous  challenges  in  the  implementation  of
this policy. We know that there are still some violation of language  rights
that exist. We know that farm workers  are  still  subjected  to  having  to
speak the languages of their masters.

We also know that domestic workers are  still  forced  to  use  English  and
Afrikaans without any efforts from their employers to  speak  the  languages
of their workers. Children at school are still not aware of their rights  to
a wide choice of 11 official languages. There are people who are  still  not
able to access basic services  like  social  grants  because  they  are  not
proficient in English and Afrikaans.

Madam Speaker, this is a clear indication that racism is still alive and  in
some areas it is very  subtle,  whereas  in  some  cases  there  is  blatant
racism. The example that the  Minister  of  Defence  cited  here  about  the
manager at the Mount Nelson Hotel is a typical example of this.

Siyayigxininisa kubantu bakuthi into  yokuba  lilungelo  lakhe  wonke  umntu
ukuba athethe ngokukhululekileyo ngolwimi afuna ukulusebenzisa, kude  kuthi,
olu lwimi aluncance kuma. [We emphasise it  to  our  people  that  it  is  a
right, to everyone, to speak freely in a language  they  prefer,  especially
their mother tongue.]

Madam Speaker, we need to take cognisance of the fact that critical  to  our
freedom is our cultural heritage,  the  soul  of  our  nation.  Our  freedom
should also reflect on the work we have undertaken in restoring the  dignity
of our people and this can best be measured by the extent to which  we  have
revived and promoted our indigenous cultures.

This process needs us to delve into our historical  memory  to  bring  forth
our cultural identity. As  Prof  Ngugi,  during  his  recent  visit  to  our
country, said:


  Memory is also the site of dreams, desire and when we say that  a  person
  has lost his or her memory, we are talking of a real loss of those traces
  that make an individual make sense of what is happening to them.

This preservation of memory, our  heritage,  is  the  basis  of  the  legacy
projects. The Freedom Park is but one significant legacy project  as  it  is
all-encompassing and reflects a comprehensive life history of the  struggles
of the people of South Africa. We need to give Freedom Park  the  status  of
being a foundation for moral regeneration and consciousness that  is  needed
in our society.

Freedom Park should be a place that all South  Africans  should  honour  and
visit once in their lifetime. We need to explore the possibility of  Freedom
Park  and  other  legacy  projects  being  integrated  into  the   education
programmes to educate and inform not only the young but all  the  people  of
South Africa about the historical memory of South Africa.

Mhlawumbi bangade baguquke naba,  xa  bezibona  zibhaliwe  izinto  ababekade
bezenza  kuthi.  Abaziqondi  kakuhle  ngoku,  ngoba  ingathi  zisafihlakele.
[Maybe these people might change, when they see that the things  which  they
have been doing to us have been  recorded.  Because  they  don't  understand
them clearly now, it is as though they are still hidden.]

It is no coincidence that we celebrate South  Africa  Day  in  the  form  of
National Heritage Day on 24 September,  where  all  South  Africans  display
their diverse cultures in all forms, dress, food and dance.

Madam Speaker, we have had very disturbing experiences  about  some  pockets
of our society not giving recognition to this important  day  whose  purpose
is to create space for all of us  to  express  our  different  cultures,  to
learn each other's cultures, stimulating  a  high  level  of  tolerance  and
promoting unity in South Africa.

It is, especially, sad and painful when these attitudes are  transmitted  at
the level of education in school. Two situations of private schools in  Cape
Town and East London have been brought to my attention, where  children  are
being told about all other special days - Mother's Day,  Father's  Day,  and
Valentine's Day - but they are never told and  provided  explanations  about
Heritage Day. One school did not explain the purpose of the holiday and  the
other decided to call it a "games" day.

This is one piece of evidence of a continued distortion of our  history  and
we are not going to allow this. We are not going to allow a situation  where
the struggles of the  majority  of  the  people  are  watered  down  through
deliberate disregard. It is even more disheartening to  learn  that  parents
pay school fees only for the policies of Government to be undermined.

Since 1994, South Africans have worked together practically to  construct  a
society that cares.  The  preservation  of  national  heritage  is  but  one
important aspect of a  caring  society  because  it  ensures  the  country's
future. It takes care of its future generations, the youth.

The statement made by  the  hon  De  Lille  about  African  potatoes,  Madam
Speaker, is also  a  clear  display  of  an  attitude  that  undermines  our
indigenous knowledge and the values of our people, which  is  the  basis  of
our heritage.

After all, Madam Speaker, Mrs De Lille knows  as  well  as  I  do  that  her
conventional medicine has no cure for HIV/Aids. Who knows  where  that  cure
will come from? It may come from the very  iingcambu  (medical  roots)  that
she is despising here. We want to remind the hon De Lille  that  traditional
healing and medicines are not foreign. It is not  something  that  would  be
unique to South Africa. Countries like India, Mexico  and  China  are  using
their indigenous and traditional medicines and are proud to do so.

As a nation we need to respond to former President Mandela,  as  was  quoted
by the President in his state of the nation  address,  when  he  said:  "...
regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, we  need  to
seize the time to define ourselves for ourselves what we  want  to  make  of
our shared destiny."

We need to face the reality that we are one nation and we are faced  with  a
responsibility to define  our  shared  destiny.  We  want  to  make  a  call
especially to our youth and our intellectuals to enter into a contract  with
Government and the  whole  nation  and  to  lead  the  public  discourse  of
defining the shared destiny that we can never avoid.

Our aspiration towards a united  South  Africa  is  also  reflected  in  our
national symbols: The National Anthem, the National Flag, and  the  National
Coat of Arms.

Our national anthem is unique in that it represents all the language  groups
of South Africa and we believe it is the only one in the world with  such  a
characteristic. We invite all South Africans to make an effort to  learn  to
sing the national anthem. You see some of them waffling  when  it  comes  to
singing the national anthem. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Business suspended at 12:21 and resumed at 14:00.

                              Afternoon Sitting

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Hon  Chairperson,  Mr  President,  Mr
Deputy President, hon members and ladies and gentlemen, the  period  we  are
in today asks of us to actually reflect on who we are and where we  actually
come from.

From 1652 to 1906 South African history is characterised by the  destruction
of the subsistence economy  of  the  Africans,  the  dispossession  and  the
proliterianisation of the Africans by European imperialism and the  numerous
wars of resistance waged  by  South  Africans  in  defence  of  their  land,
liberties and freedom. The Boer War  of  October  1899  and  the  subsequent
Peace Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May  1902  set  the  stage  for  political
evolution that would lead to the enactment of the so-called Act of Union  of
1910. This Act which  established  the  South  African  Union,  led  to  the
creation of a parliament which served exclusively as a forum  for  political
representation  of  the  white  minority.  These  developments  led  to  the
realisation among the dispossessed of the need  for  an  effective  national
organisation which, regardless of tribal origin  or  language,  could  unite
the people as they struggled against white minority domination.

This awareness found expression on 8 January 1912 when  the  representatives
of the oppressed and dispossessed met to form the  ANC.  When  South  Africa
became a republic in 1961, it enacted a new constitution  which  perpetuated
the exclusion of Africans from government and parliament.  This  took  place
at the same time in the late fifties and sixties as  people's  organisations
were banned, activists and leaders imprisoned or banished in an  attempt  to
silence all opposition to white minority domination.

The  resurgence  of  internal  political  resistance  in  the  1970s,  which
significantly  undermined  the  apartheid  state's  ideological   positions,
forced the racist regime to try and rebuild its  ideological  and  political
foundation around  the  package  of  major  policy  reforms.  The  inclusive
negotiation  process,  the  Convention  for  a   Democratic   South   Africa
culminating in  the  adoption  of  the  1993  transitional  Constitution,  a
process which would lead to the holding of the  first  democratic  elections
in 1994 and the ushering in of the new Government based on the will  of  the
people, marked an end of a historical era and the beginning of a new one.

Out of these historical processes the new democratic state was born  with  a
Constitution, Government and Parliament that represents  a  true  expression
of the will of all our people. This  is  our  proud  history  of  sacrifice,
heroism, reconciliation and forgiveness. Ten years  into  our  democracy  we
look back filled with pride at  our  extraordinary  achievements.  Even  the
obvious fact that we are gathered  here  today  as  representatives  of  our
people to debate openly and freely  should,  if  well  considered,  convince
even the worst of cynics that indeed we must celebrate the first  decade  of
our freedom with pride, resolved to  push  back  further  the  frontiers  of
hopelessness, united in  a  people's  contract  to  create  work  and  fight
poverty.

The untarred road of debate we  chart  today  is  a  necessary  occasion  we
cherish  and  respect  as  a  platform  out  of  which  arises  the   shared
understanding about our shared future and destiny.

The reaction by most parties to the state  of  the  nation  address  by  the
President is amazing. It actually reminds me of a story when as boys we  had
a debate about the origins of the term ``scapegoat''. One  of  our  friends,
Gwinya, told us that the term ``scapegoat'' derives from  an  ancient  Greek
born in a traditional community.

Each year villagers would gather in one place in the village  to  perform  a
ritual. A goat would be brought before the villagers and each  villager  who
had a problem of any sort would come forward and put blame on the  goat  for
his or her misfortunes. For instance, a villager would walk up  and  say:  I
do not have a wife today or I lost  my  girlfriend  because  of  this  goat.
Another would walk up and say: I think I feel bewitched, so this goat is  to
blame. This would continue until finally the goat was released to escape  to
the mountains in the hope that  it  was  leaving  with  all  the  ills  that
villagers had blamed on it and would never return.

I am citing this particular example because when all of  us  are  confronted
by social challenges which are man-made some people  turn  around  and  say:
This situation is not a product of social engineering  of  a  specific  era.
They look for a convenient scapegoat. In  this  instance,  the  ANC  is  the
scapegoat for all racist and colonial era collaborators.  All  of  them  are
innocent. They have no room in the creation  and  sustenance  of  oppressive
regimes.

Persistently, questions on the situation in  Zimbabwe  have  been  asked  in
this House. Of course, we should understand that this is part  of  a  normal
exercise. However, the motive is not innocent. As  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Home Affairs put it yesterday. Natives across the Limpopo are grabbing  land
and violently harassing fellow citizens, so this will also happen here.

The DA has always been quick to deny such an assertion. Mr Ian Davidson,  an
hon member of this House, has been the Gauteng DA leader  since  5  February
2004. He has been in the frontline of what  they  call  Democratic  Alliance
Telemarketing. He informs would-be voters in his  letter  in  the  following
manner:


  The DA is currently doing work to prevent a one-party state situation  in
  our country.

He urges involvement and ``to help prevent such a horrendous  debacle  which
would undoubtedly lead to catastrophic instability in our  land,  the  likes
of which we are witnessing in Zimbabwe''.

Through this very same letter  they  urge  would-be  voters  to  join  their
confidential  supporters'  list  and  for  them  to  contribute  financially
towards their growth fund. So, the Zimbabwe issue is used  to  scare  fellow
South Africans, so that they should  bankrol  the  DA.  [Interjections.]  To
them this particular issue is never driven by principle at all.

The other new fashionable machination that is gaining  currency  within  the
ranks of some in our country is the equation that is being  made  between  a
strong ANC and a one-party state.  Yisimanga  sikaJehova-ke  lesi  [Uhleko.]
[This one is really Jehovah's miracle.] [Laughter.] And,  of  course,  these
are the wonders of our times.

To  actually  suppose  that  in  a  constitutionally  entrenched  multiparty
democracy you could have a one-party state, this being brought about by  the
democratic process itself, is absurd in the extreme. It is  an  undemocratic
supposition which seeks to deny South Africans  their  constitutional  right
to elect freely, without fearing the democratic  outcome,  a  government  of
their own choice. It is a feeble attempt at twisting the primary  object  of
democracy by exploiting genuine fears that are a residue of  our  past.  Old
habits do indeed die hard. The apartheid racist state  thrived  on  whipping
up these very same fears among one part of our community so  that  it  would
be prepared to take up arms against its fellow citizens.

The beneficiaries of  apartheid  were  persuaded  into  believing  that  the
victims of that system were savages, barbarians and  terrorists  waiting  to
take their wives and their children and destroy everything the country  had.
Of course, they were wrong. They should have read our  policies  where  they
would have discovered our love for  our  people,  our  country  and  all  of
humanity. They would have  discovered  that  the  very  first  line  of  the
Freedom Charter declares for all to know that South Africa  belongs  to  all
who live in it. In contrast to what they foretold, what has emerged  instead
is one of the most, if one may borrow the phrase,  civilised  constitutional
democracies in the world - a country envisaged in the Freedom Charter.

Today, hon members, comes the modern scaremonger. He tells our  people  that
if they, in their maximum numbers, unite behind  the  common  conviction  to
eradicate the legacy of apartheid,  their  democratic  expression  would  be
harmful to the process of eradicating that legacy. Their unity, it is  said,
is dangerous to democracy. Now, we may as well ask whether  people  actually
do remember our past. Do they remember the days of divide and rule? He  says
our unity is dangerous to his type of democracy.  These  scaremongers,  like
their forerunners, are wrong. No catastrophe is about to befall our  country
on account of the huge support our people are  rendering  to  speed  up  the
process of democratic transformation.

On the contrary, something bad would happen if our people were to listen  to
these prophets of doom. In addition  to  wasting  their  votes,  the  scared
victims of these schemes would have their money looted  too.  There  we  see
the  negative  characteristics  born  out  of  years  of  racial   supremist
upbringing where one person has the audacity to stand up and tell the  whole
nation  that  his  view  and  only  his  is  democracy,  not  the   nation's
overwhelming choice as this nation's choice,  according  to  him,  represent
the destruction of democracy. What stupidity, in a country with perhaps  the
largest number of opposition parties in the  world.  Here  we  have  a  real
multiparty democracy.

What a logical turn of events that the DA, which as the PFP used to  be  the
nocturnal friends of the apartheid regime, is now the daylight  opponent  of
constitutional multiparty democracy, scaring people  about  the  dangers  of
expressing freely their democratic views. As we  heard  the  hon  Tony  Leon
state boldly here yesterday, there  is  now  a  new  version  of  multiparty
democracy being offered to our people. Let me quote him directly:  ``We  are
going to create a genuine two-party system.''

Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to  quote  from  the  Constitution  of  South
Africa: Chapter 1, section 1, subsections (a) and (d):


  The Republic of South Africa is one sovereign democratic state founded on
  the following values:


  (a) Human dignity, the achievement of equality  and  the  advancement  of
       human rights and freedoms ...


  (d) Universal adult suffrage, a national  common  voters'  roll,  regular
       elections and a multiparty system of democratic government, to ensure
       accountability, responsiveness and openness.

They should  also  familiarise  themselves  with  our  policies.  Addressing
itself to issues relevant to this point, the ANC has expressed its  position
as follows:


  The ANC commits itself to the fundamental provisions of the basic law  of
  the land, which accords with its own vision  of  a  democratic  and  just
  society. We set out to implement both the letter and the  spirit  of  the
  Constitution, including such  principles  as  multiparty  democracy,  the
  adoption and practice of separation of powers in a constitutional  state,
  fundamental human rights to all its citizens, respect for the  rights  of
  linguistic, religious and cultural communities and social  equity  within
  the context of correcting the historical injustices of apartheid.

We adopted this position so that all the people of  our  country  are  clear
about our commitment, to ensure that even the smallest voice of  our  people
is heard. The overwhelming support for the  ANC  is  in  fact  a  very  good
signal for our democracy. It proves that  more  and  more  people  of  South
Africa are progressively uniting in a people's contract  to  accelerate  the
process of eradicating the apartheid legacy and that  they  have  identified
this legacy as their common enemy. South Africa without  that  legacy  would
be better in every respect.

It is therefore correct that the people of our country should  unite  behind
the ANC to defeat  the  legacy  of  apartheid  in  all  its  manifestations,
whether it appears in the form of unemployment or schemes designed to  scare
people into parting with their hard-earned cash. We as a people must  remain
very vigilant. These scary ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Now  the  new
one being nurtured is the so-called third term for the President.  To  these
people the foremost issues are not  unemployment,  poverty  and  a  lack  of
skills from  which  our  people  suffer  daily  humiliation.  They  are  too
preoccupied with the powers of the Presidency - which they  have  no  chance
in hell of ever occupying.

Truly, life has become interesting in the South Africa of today.  Yesterday,
no sooner had the President announced  the  date  of  the  national  general
elections, than there came the mouse, strutting  before  the  lion,  saying:
Come here, you  weak  lion,  I  am  going  to  show  you  a  thing  or  two.
[Laughter.] This House watched in disbelief - and on some faces I  saw  some
slight smiles. So much for the excitement of the  elections.  And  when  the
people raised their voices, hon Tony Leon  said  yesterday,  the  Government
reacted in ways that  raised  serious  questions  about  its  commitment  to
openness and democracy. I may not agree with the views  raised  by  the  hon
Leon in this instance, but I think part of the answer that  should  help  to
explain our  reaction  to  his  interventions  may  be  found  in  the  very
statement he read to this House yesterday. In that statement  the  hon  Leon
continues to say:


  I say this with confidence, because I have listened to the people and the
  people want real change.

He then he goes on to give us a list of wants, namely that the  people  want
an economy that grows, and he goes through the  list  to  the  last  bullet,
dealing with a road map to democracy in Zimbabwe. These  are,  according  to
him, the policies that would bring South Africa real  freedom.  How  can  he
list six wants that he  believes  to  be  policies  that  would  bring  real
freedom to South Africa?

This is the problem of South Africa's political opposition. They develop  no
real policies to address the problems of  our  people.  They  only  remember
that the people are confronted with problems when they  find  themselves  in
front of a microphone, where they will then list a  set  of  bulleted  wants
and call these policies, as the hon Leon did yesterday.

I suppose one should also take  this  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  hon
Leon's concerns on issues of our foreign policy in  general,  and  Haiti  in
particular. He, together with other elements in our country, have made  much
noise about our participation in the celebrations of the bicentenary of  the
independence of Haiti. Perhaps the best place to start our response in  this
regard is to state that as a country we are committed  to  good  governance,
peace and stability, human rights and the creation of a better life for  all
by creating a better world.

As has been stated before, we do not believe that South Africa  can  survive
as an island of prosperity in a sea  of  poverty  and  instability.  On  the
other hand, we should also state categorically that it is  correct  that  we
celebrate the Haitian revolution, and we make no apologies  for  that.  That
revolution, led by a slave by the name of Toussaint  l'Ouverture  from  1791
to 1803, dealt a heavy blow to slave traders. The cargo, as  it  was  called
by them in that business, was nothing other than human  beings,  whose  only
crime was that their skin pigmentation could not be defined as  white.  This
particular revolution struck a heavy blow at the slave trade, a  trade  that
was no trade at all. It was a business that ruined families and trampled  on
human dignity and human rights.

Colonists among themselves during that time used to  enjoy  a  game  derived
from the blowing-up of slaves. It was called ``burning a  little  powder  in
the arse of a nigger". Because of this trade in human beings,  many  of  our
people were murdered and lost their identity, their  culture,  their  future
and their humanness. That we should celebrate and  rejoice  at  the  Haitian
revolution is correct. We should, as President Mbeki  once  said,  celebrate
the heroic deeds of these Africans who single-mindedly struggled  for  their
freedom and inspired many of us to understand that none  but  ourselves  can
defeat those who subject us to tyranny, oppression and exploitation.

Those in our country who are still intent on continuing their  cultural  and
psychological dominance over those who were the victims  of  these  satanic,
dastardly practices, now want to tell us what is of historical  significance
and what is not. In  so  doing  they  are  telling  us  that  they  must  be
understood to be yearning for nothing else, except  for  a  continuation  on
their part to rewrite the story as to who we are in history, deprive  us  of
our  language,  of  poetry,  architecture,  of   civil   laws,   of   social
organisations, of art and science, mathematics  and  abstract  concepts  and
philosophy. Actually, a yearning to efface us from creation, thus  depriving
us of history and humanity.

Secondly, they want to tell us that in the fight against poverty, we  should
not work in solidarity with those  who  are  poor.  They  maintain  that  we
should not contribute to the renaissance of Africans anywhere in the  world.
They are wrong in this particular instance. For us  to  defeat  poverty  and
underdevelopment requires that we  work  to  advance,  here  and  everywhere
else, the  objectives  of  peace  and  stability,  good  governance  and  an
entrenched culture of human rights.

Ben Okri says in his book, Infinite riches:


  It is only when diverse people of the earth meet and learn from and  love
  one another, that we can begin to get an inkling of this awesome picture.
  Call it the picture of divinity or humanity if you  want,  but  like  the
  magic powers that Africans sometimes allude to,  this  great  jigsaw  has
  been distributed amongst all of us. One aspect of  our  destiny  on  this
  earth may be to discover something of that grand image or  music  of  our
  collective souls, of our immense possibility our infinite riches. No  one
  person or people has  the  final  load  or  the  great  keyboard  or  the
  exclusive possession of this jigsaw of humanity.  Only  together  as  one
  people of this earth, facing our common predicament and  redeeming  love,
  can we make use of this gift, the map of our earthly journey and glory.

In conclusion, forces of backwardness are saying  that  the  hills,  valleys
and mountain ranges of our country were for nearly  350  years  scorched  by
the evil fires of  colonialism,  imperialism  and  racism,  the  fires  that
deformed the human spirit  within  the  coloniser  beyond  recognition;  the
fires that dispossessed and dehumanised; the fires that for  all  this  time
set our people on a collision course, deliberately setting  them  apart  and
teaching each to  hate  the  other.  They  say  the  beautiful  rains  of  a
democratically constituted state must,  in  one  decade,  turn  the  barren,
scorched soil of our country into the beautiful garden of Eden, fill up  the
Sahara desert with the abundant waters of the Nile and  fill  every  stomach
with the milk and honey of Canaan. [Time expired.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, the hon Chief Whip seems to understand  little
about the Constitution and even less about  democracy.  [Interjections.]  He
thinks we are a democracy because we have a lot of little  parties  in  this
House. By his argument, if we had 20 extra parties in  the  House  we  would
probably be 20 times more democratic. [Interjections.]  He  must  understand
democracy does not consist of the outward trappings. What it consists of  is
an opposition which is able to hold the government to account and do  so  on
behalf of the people of South Africa.

Everybody knows that the ANC has failed on crime. Next  to  jobs,  crime  is
the ANC's biggest failure. They are tired, they have no more policies,  they
have run out of steam. And  in  any  real  democracy  the  voters  would  be
throwing them out and giving the official opposition a turn  to  take  over.
Hopefully at least in this election what the voters will do is  to  cut  the
Government down to size and then Government and  opposition  will  be  in  a
better balance, so that they have to look over their shoulders.

This Government has failed  on  crime  and  three  successive  Ministers  of
Safety and Security have left no impression  on  the  fight  against  crime.
They have all been nice guys, but all of them  have  failed.  Even  the  hon
Charles Nqakula, with his silver tongue and his charm, has  not  managed  to
make much difference to the horrendous  daily  reality  of  crime  in  South
Africa, and that is the truth.

I suspect that if the hon President wins the election,  the  President  will
appoint a new Minister, and that will be  my  fourth  sparring  partner.  My
advice to that Minister is that he  or  she  should  pay  attention  to  the
following matters: Firstly, do not try  to  hide  the  statistics  from  the
people of South Africa. It is easy for Ministers to get out  of  touch  with
the people, because they move on an elevated plain unlike the  rest  of  us,
but they must not be under the impression  that  ordinary  people  in  South
Africa are fools. They are not fools. The  people  know  that  12,5  million
crimes have been reported under ANC rule, with only  10%  of  the  criminals
having been convicted.

They also know that almost a quarter of a million people have been  murdered
in the last 10 years and that only a fraction of those murderers  have  paid
for their crimes. The rest are still roaming the  streets  of  South  Africa
sowing fear and destruction. There  have  been  263 000  attempted  murders,
849 000 robberies with aggravating  circumstances,  460 000  reported  rapes
and attempted rapes and 2,1 million burglaries. The shocking  fact  is  that
nine out of 10 criminals get away with it.  They  never  get  caught.  Every
murder, every rape and every violent robbery leaves a scar  on  the  victim,
on those who loved him or her and  on  our  collective  consciousness  as  a
nation.

Each Minister who comes into office believes in  major  national  strategies
and initiatives, but the people have already learned that they do not  work.
There is only one  thing  that  is  effective  against  crime  ie  good  old
fashioned policing in neighbourhood  police  stations  and  in  the  streets
where we live. That is where  the  public,  the  police  and  the  criminals
interface; that is where the criminals commit  their  crimes,  and  that  is
where the criminals are caught.

The DA's approach to crime is focused on a practical  five  step  plan  that
will make an immediate difference  to  the  fight  against  crime.  Firstly,
there must be 150 000 police officers on the street. There  must  be  enough
policemen where it counts. I am sometimes accused  of  not  giving  the  ANC
enough credit for what they do, and I want to congratulate  them  today  for
adopting the DA  proposal  to  have  150 000  police  officers.  Thank  you,
President and thank you, Minister. Now we must take it further.  We  do  not
want police officers that  are  bogged  down  in  administrative  tasks  and
duties. They must be on the streets on active duty fighting crime.

We are very concerned by the ANC's lack of urgency  about  the  matter.  The
target that they want to reach? They will reach it in five years' time.  The
DA proposal will start immediately and see 150 000 officers on  the  streets
by 2007. [Interjections.] We  will  recruit  and  train  12 000  entry-level
constables each year for the next three years. The total cost of  this  will
be R4,5 billion over three years. This  requires  a  real  increase  in  the
police budget of only 4%, and that is surely  something  that  South  Africa
can afford.

It is extremely important that when we  have  these  police  officers,  they
should be properly skilled and properly trained. None  of  this  matters  if
they are not up to the task, because they have an  extremely  difficult  and
dangerous job to do. We have to equip them with the skills and the  training
to see that they carry out that job.

Thirdly, they have to be properly equipped.  They  must  have  radios,  they
must have bullet proof vests, they must have motor cars, they must have  the
tools to enable them to do the job.

Fourthly, there must be a service contract. We have to negotiate a  contract
with them, so that they know and we know exactly what we can expect  of  our
police.  Turnaround  times,  time  to  answer  telephones,  statistics   ...
[Laughter.] ... what we are going to do in terms of how  many  criminals  we
are going to arrest, how many successful prosecutions we are expecting,  all
of the things which go to making this a successful policing effort.

All that must be in the contract and that contract must be  right  from  the
top. The Minister of Safety and Security must enter into  such  a  contract,
and so must the National  Commissioner  and  everybody  right  down  to  the
station commissioner. And then after that we can hold them accountable.

If the crime rate comes down dramatically and  substantially,  the  Minister
can claim the credit together with the police.  But  if  it  does  not  come
down, if it does  not  stabilise  satisfactorily,  then  the  Minister  must
either resign or be fired and the same must happen at  every  level  in  the
Police Service. It really is quite simple: there is  accountability  if  you
know what is expected of you and if the state  has  provided  you  with  the
tools to do the job and enough people to do it.

I am absolutely convinced that if people were to follow the DA's  advice  on
the matter, we would start bringing crime under  control  in  South  Africa,
because South Africa cannot go on  as  it  is  now.  South  Africa  deserves
better. [Applause.]

UMPHATHISWA   WEZABASEBENZI:   Mhlalingaphambili,    Mongameli,    mandiqale
ngeendaba ezibuhlungu, zokufa kukaLungile Mathebula, ofele kwisibhedlele  i-
Addington emva kokuba ilifti ebekhwele  kuyo  yena  nabanye  abathathu,  iye
yehla nabo yaya kunkaleka ezantsi, waze yena wasweleka kwangoko.

Kwakhona,  Mongameli,  ndivakalisa  ngokusweleka   kuNelson   Shisane,   oye
wathatyathwa, waxangxathwa, wanyashwa ngumfama, othe  akugqiba  ukwenza  oko
waya kumgibisela ezingonyameni; babukela, bahleka begigitheka ngexa  uNelson
Shisane edliwa, eqwengwa ziingonyama.

Babekade besifunza ngezinja, ngoku siphoswa  ezingonyameni.  Siyakrwentshwa,
siyaxhokonxwa. Ndilugcalagcala ngumsindo kule ndawo ndimi  kuyo,  kuba  noko
le  nto  ngoku  ithande  ukuthi  kratya,  into   yokungahoywa   kwamalungelo
abasebenzi. Sinabantu abafana nohloniphekileyo uTony Leon,  abathi  umthetho
wezabasebenzi mawuthathwe ulahlwe kwesinomhlwa, sibe  ngoku  sixakene  nento
yokuphathwa kakubi  nokunyashwa  kwamalungelo  abasebenzi.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, hon President, let me start  with  the
bad news that Mr Lungile Mathebula passed away in Addington Hospital,  after
an accident in which he and three other people were involved,  when  a  lift
failed to stop. He died instantly.

Again, Mr President, let me tell  you  about  the  brutal  death  of  Nelson
Shisane, who died after his farmer  employer  violently  assaulted  him  and
then threw him into a lion's den  to  be  devoured.  They  were  entertained
whilst the lions were feasting on this man.

They used to release dogs to bite us, but now they feed us to the lions.  We
are being provoked. I am very angry right now because  this  is  really  too
much. This is a violation of workers' rights. We have people  like  the  hon
Tony Leon, who say that the labour legislation should be scrapped whilst  we
have on our hands a travesty of these workers' rights.]

We for our part have a single  indispensable  need,  that  of  our  dignity.
There can be no dignity without freedom. Sekou Toure of  Guinea  said  these
words at the height of the struggle to free  Africa  from  the  shackles  of
colonialism.

We of the ANC who have gone through the  dolorosa  of  agony  in  search  of
freedom have learned and we know that people  are  the  makers  of  history.
They are the determiners of their own destiny. Side by side with the  people
of South Africa, the ANC fought for the freedom that we all cherish now.  It
is in the cauldron of the struggle  for  freedom  that  the  first  people's
contact was sealed. Ours is not the weathercock contract often  found  among
the instant parties in the ranks of present day political  desperadoes,  ...
ooJoj' iinkumpa abafana naba bakwesi sandla sam sasekhohlo [... such as  the
ones to my left]. Our people's  contract  is  based  on  trust  and  lasting
optimism that is only known to those who know how this freedom was won.
Madam Speaker, we look at the past 10 years with pride. Who will  deny  that
in the past 10 years  the  Government  of  the  ANC  has  managed  to  build
monuments of history no force can demolish. South  Africans  will  celebrate
10 years of freedom this year, a freedom that was  won  through  the  vision
and sacrifice of millions of South Africans. Today, we are a nation of  free
people, with a Government that has  a  mandate  from  the  majority  of  the
people of this country to deliver a better life for  all,  and  not  just  a
racially defined minority.

We are celebrating a new dawn after the long dark  night  of  apartheid  and
the ravages it cost at every level of South African life. There is  much  to
celebrate, but in order to truly appreciate our 10 years  of  democracy,  it
is vital that we never forget where we came from.

Less than 20 years ago, the then government  promulgated  amendments  to  an
earlier Labour Relations Act  which,  like  almost  every  aspect  of  South
African legislation, was characterised by exclusion. The list  of  employees
who were excluded included farmworkers and  domestic  workers,  while  those
who enjoyed the benefits of the Act  were  never  explicitly  mentioned  and
were almost always white.

The then Minister of Labour, Schoeman - incidentally, Laboria  House  is  in
Schoeman Street [Laughter.] - declared his intention to ``bleed  the  native
unions to death''. The 1988 amending Act identified the need to include  the
sectors excluded from the Act, and as late as 1993  separate  statutes  were
introduced, which paid lip service to the needs of this workers.

An examination of the changing nature of the labour market in  South  Africa
will acknowledge that the changes and progress that have been achieved  over
the past 10 years were achieved as a result of long and bitter struggles  on
the shop floor. Because, as laughable as  some  of  the  amendments  to  the
1988, 1991 and 1993 statutes were, they were replacing even  more  draconian
legislation that was firmly rooted in  notions  of  kragdadigheid  and  were
deeply anti-worker in complexion.
The pre-democracy Labour Relations  Act  emerged  from  various  master  and
servants laws, which among other things made desertion a  criminal  offence.
It must never be forgotten  that  the  central  truth  about  the  apartheid
labour market was that it was meant to ensure that it served  the  needs  of
the  white  minority  regime.  As  such,  the   labour   market   was   also
characterised by a racial twin track, a dualism where the Verwoerdian  maxim
of blacks being  hewers  of  wood  and  drawers  of  water  was  fanatically
enforced.

Acts such  as  the  Job  Reservation  Act  prevented  blacks  from  entering
specific professions, while various education departments ensured  that  you
could never get the skills that  would  be  required  to  participate  above
certain levels in the labour market. The aim of  those  education  Acts  and
the denial of opportunities for our people to develop their  skills  were  a
deliberate attempt to keep black workers unskilled and illiterate.  We  were
shown  the  green  pastures  of  economic  opportunity  and  then   brutally
prevented from entering them.

It is for this reason that human resource development forms the core of  ANC
policy in undoing the ravages of the past. It is for this reason  that  this
Government of the ANC has invested so much in  skills  development.  Because
of the past exclusion of black people from the  economy,  it  was  necessary
for the ANC Government to pass the 1998 Employment  Equity  Act,  to  ensure
that all South Africans enjoy access to the labour market.

Likewise, the ANC Government has committed itself to spend over R15  billion
on broad-based Black Economic Empowerment to ensure  greater  inclusion.  It
smacks of hypocrisy, Comrade President, that certain people complain of  the
creation of a black elite, implying that only whites have the right to  have
their Oppenheimers.

Our skills development programme has  enjoyed  enormous  successes,  with  a
significant  buy-in  from  business,  labour  and  the  community.  Teething
problems have been identified and addressed. The skills revolution,  Comrade
President, is indeed on track.
It is  successful  interventions  such  as  these  that  give  us  cause  to
celebrate our 10 years of democracy. Today South  Africa  has  a  democratic
Government because of the ANC. Today South  Africa  has  a  growing  economy
because of the ANC. Today South Africa has a well  managed  economy  because
of the ANC. We must never forget that it is under the  ANC  Government  that
over 2 million jobs have been created since 1995.  [Applause.]  Before  1994
economic growth had ground to a halt. We are now enjoying growth  levels  of
2,8% and are in a position to grow even further, precisely because  the  ANC
is confident of the future. It is all thanks to the ANC Government.

 Comrade President, we know that the number of people looking for  work  has
increased, because many more people are being  casualised:  many  have  been
subcontracted and outsourced. You have asked us to investigate this  matter,
Comrade President, precisely because you are confident of the  future.  Many
more have entered the job  market,  because  more  people  are  getting  the
opportunity to enter the job market when they complete  their  schooling  or
finish their degrees. And this is the problem  that  is  facing  our  labour
market.

We as the ANC believe in a people's contract to create  work  and  eradicate
poverty; a people's contract, Comrade President,  to  monitor  those  Sector
Education and Training Authorities; a people's  contract  to  ensure  proper
functioning of those Setas; a people's contract to  develop  the  skills  of
this nation; a people's contract to receive 72 000 learners by May  2004;  a
people's contract to receive interns and provide skills to  young  graduates
... [Applause.] ... and a people's contract to protect the  most  vulnerable
workers, domestic workers and farmworkers.

McIntosh, hon sir, when I know where your farm is, wait for me,  I  will  be
coming wearing my cap inscribed "Inspector, Department of  Labour".  I  will
soon get your address and I will be there. [Interjections.]  Don't  call  it
electioneering: you know that I am the  chief  inspector  of  this  country.
[Interjections.]

The people's contract finds expression in many  aspects,  not  only  in  the
skills development strategy, but also in our  contract  with  employers  and
workers in order to ensure safety in the workplace; to ensure  stability  in
the labour markets; and to ensure that even the most vulnerable  of  workers
enjoy protection. I might add that this contract, especially with regard  to
those rural workers, can only have been made by the ANC-led Government.

Earlier in my speech I referred to the exclusion  of  domestic  workers  and
farmworkers from the apartheid versions  of  labour  legislation.  Today  we
have reason to  celebrate,  because  those  domestic  workers  now  enjoy  a
minimum wage and basic conditions of employment. Even the hon  member,  Tony
Leon, now knows that there is the Labour Relations  Act,  failing  which  we
sit on you and we make sure that you  pay  your  domestic  worker  properly.
[Laughter.] He now knows how to treat a domestic worker. This is because  of
the ANC. [Interjections.]

If you think that I am intimidating you, wait  until  I  meet  you  outside,
then you will see that indeed this man can intimidate you.  No  other  party
in this House would have done this. The ANC is the only  party  that  has  a
track  record  of  delivery,  particularly  to  the  poor  and  the   needy.
[Applause.]

A further example  of  our  people's  contract  came  from  the  Growth  and
Development Summit, where Government, labour,  business  and  the  community
organisations committed themselves to the achievement  of  measurable  goals
to boost economic growth and job creation. Some of the  initial  goals  have
been met and others are well on track. It is through the  people's  contract
with business that we can proudly say that even our targeted  72  000  young
unemployed people will be in learnerships by May 2004.  We  as  the  ANC-led
Government will ensure that  all  South  Africans  enjoy  the  dignity  that
freedom brings. Hence we are proud to celebrate 10 years of our democracy.

Oko yasekwayo i-ANC, umbutho wesizwe, yasoloko  ibeke  phambili  umdla  wabo
bonke abantu beli lizwe  loMzantsi  Afrika.  Yabamanya  kwidabi  lenkululeko
elakhokelela  kumnyaka  wenkululeko,  u-1994.  Kuloko   ngomhla   wama-   27
KuTshazimpuzi siza kube sibhiyozela iminyaka elishumi yenkululeko,  sivuyele
intatho-nxaxheba kawonkewonke, iminyaka elishumi yoxolo,  iminyaka  elishumi
yozinzo, iminyaka elishumi yenkqubela. Sibhiyozela uMzantsi Afrika wethu  xa
sisonke sidume ngazwinye sisithi: Halala Mzantsi Afrika! Halala!

Le nkululeko asiyikhongozwanga. Le nkululeko ize ngegazi; le  nkululeko  ize
ngokufa;  le  nkululeko  ize  ngokuzincama  kwabantu  abaninzi,   bekhokelwe
ngumbutho  wesizwe  i-ANC.  Yinkululeko  evule  amathuba  okukhomba  indlela
ebheka phambili. Liphumile ngoku ilanga eMzantsi Afrika.

Azange sibe kuRhulumente siyi-ANC ngaphambili. Kule minyakana nje  ilishumi,
sizuze amava.  Uninzi  lwabantu  luyimbumba  ejonge  ukukhawulezisa  inguqu.
Iziseko ezibekwe yi-ANC  azihexi,  ziqinile.  Sifundile  ngoku.  Siza  kuthi
chatha  ukuzisa  inguqu  kubomi  babantu.  Siza  kuba  manya  abantu,  sakhe
amathuba okusebenza, silwe indlala.
Ngumbutho  wesizwe  i-ANC  yodwa  enembali   engathandabuzekiyo,   ezingcayo
ngembali yayo. Yiyo yodwa ezise inguqu; yiyo yodwa enamava  okuzisa  inguqu.
Akukhange unyanzeleke, Dlamini, ukuba ufake iCV yakho  kwimanifesto  ye-ANC.
NguHolomisa, uBantu, yedwa ofaka iCV kwimanifesto, kuba akaziwa. Uthe  ukuze
aziwe, waziwa ngexesha ebekulo mbutho wesizwe, iANC. Siza  kuwubukela  ngoku
umgcwabo wakhe.

Yonke eminye imibuthwana le ngoofunz' eweni, ovuk' ayibambe,  abangoozungul'

[Uwelewele.] [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Since the ANC was formed, the national  organisation  has  always  put  the
interests of all the citizens of this country,  South  Africa,  forward.  It
united them in the struggle for freedom, which led to the year  of  freedom,
1994. That is why on 27 April, we will be celebrating ten years  of  freedom
and the enjoyment of  democracy,  ten  years  of  peace  and  ten  years  of
progress. We are celebrating our own South Africa;  all  of  us  are  saying
with one voice: Congratulations, South Africa! Congratulations!

We did not get this freedom as a gift, but blood was  shed  for  it.  People
died for it. It came as a result of sacrifices made by many people,  led  by
the ANC. It is freedom that has led to opportunities,  progress  and  a  way
forward. The sun has risen now in South Africa.

We, as the ANC, have never been in government before but  in  the  last  ten
years we have gained experience. The majority of the people  are  united  in
speeding up change. The foundations that the ANC has laid  are  unshakeable,
they are very strong. We have learnt now. We are going to bring  about  more
changes in people's lives. We are going to unite people,  create  employment
opportunities and alleviate poverty.

It is the only national organisation, the ANC, that has  the  unquestionable
history, which they are very proud of. It  has  brought  about  this  change
alone, no one else has the experience of bringing about change. You  we  not
obliged, Dlamini, to bring your CV to the ANC manifesto. It  is  only  Bantu
Holomisa who puts his CV on the manifesto because he is not well  known.  He
was only known whilst he was with the national  organisation,  the  ANC.  We
are now going to watch his funeral.

All these other parties are less experienced  fortune  seekers,  whose  main
objective is to divide and  destroy  the  unity  that  the  people  of  this
country  have  achieved,  especially  the  blacks.  Allow  me,  Dlamini,  to
conclude by saying: Be strong, my brother. Do not be  a  weakling  and  fear
nothing. Cynics are born every day.

They are speechless as we speak now. They have criticised and insulted  you,
saying you alone can change the Constitution because you want  to  cling  to
power. We, on the other hand, are saying: Long live  the  son  of  the  Zizi
clan, the grandson of Ngubonde, of Ndosi; of Lunika;  Mkhuli;  Mavumengwana.
[Interjections.] Gumbi lamagwala [the room of cowards] Libokoboko  [is  full
of scars] Ngxibinoboya, you  know  yourself  very  well,  for  you  are  not
feathered. The one whoe mouth is foaming, who  has  a  running  nose,  whose
chest is always with flu. The bird that flies first before others,  a  beast
with very strong teeth. A piece  of  wood  that  wood  fetchers  carry  with
caution, the one who saddens his neighbours, the one with  a  bad  voice  to
those who speak the white man's language.

Dance, you young man, and shake your cheeks. The old  men  are  dancing  and
their beard is shaking. When you appear, everyone  ululates  with  pride.  I
saw this with my own eyes. The poets are praising,  the  enemies  look  with
savage eyes. They stare with eyes of envy, Dlamini. They  undermine  us,  we
are the ANC. They do not know us well; they hear people  talking  about  us.
There is mumbling even now; they are inaudible, talking nonsense,  they  are
confused. Come quickly, 14 April; the ANC are going to outclass  them,  they
are going to sweep them out because they are fully prepared.  The  weaklings
are going to get nothing.  Forward  with  the  National  Congress,  forward!
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon member  threatened
persons in the opposition during his speech. He said: "Wait until I get  you
outside." I submit that that's unparliamentary. [Interjections.] Can  I  get
a chance to finish? I know that the hon member admitted that he only  had  a
little thing, but nonetheless. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Delport, in what  the  hon  member
said, I did not hear him specifically mentioning a name. In that  particular
case, I do not think it ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Whose fault is that?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Therefore, I don't think it's a threat  aimed
at a particular member of the House, and I would rule accordingly.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, in another  time,  John  F
Kennedy declared: "We observe today,  not  a  victory  of  a  party,  but  a
celebration of freedom."

How true. The lofty achievements and endeavours that the President spoke  of
in the state of the nation address on Friday  actually  belong  to  all  the
people of South Africa. Our nation's progress over the past 10 years is  the
stuff that dreams are made of, a uniquely South Africa dream.

It is amazing to consider that South Africa's transition to  democracy  took
place under the threat of terrible conflict, a  conflict  portentous  enough
for the country to be  included  in  a  scholarly  collection  on  collapsed
states under the heading States in danger of collapse.
Of course, this did not happen. In the pursuit of freedom and democracy,  we
rejected division and chose unity.  We  rejected  discrimination  and  chose
tolerance. We rejected despair and chose hope. Together as a nation we  want
peace, a precious peace that, up to the present time, has eluded so many  in
the Middle East, in Northern Ireland,  in  Kashmir  and  in  other  troubled
spots across the globe.

The IFP is immensely  proud  to  have  played  a  significant  role  in  the
reconciliation process and the nation-building project since 1994 under  the
leadership of its president, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. We did  not  stand
on the sidelines. We were not afraid to become  involved  and  we  were  not
afraid to soil our hands.

Whilst the IFP participated in the national Government  to  advance  nation-
building and reconciliation, the majority party's  magnanimity  in  allowing
the  IFP  to  contribute  to  the  nation's  governance  was,   I   believe,
unprecedented.  Also,  our  differences  with  the  ruling  party  have  not
prevented  us  from  giving  credit  where  it  is  due.  Great  strides  by
Government, better than some dared to hope,  have  been  made  in  providing
essential  services,  water,  electricity,  housing,  sanitation  and  other
services to the poor majority.

The IFP also commends the President  for  departing  in  his  state  of  the
nation address from the usual ANC tradition, established over  the  past  10
years, of not recognising where  Government  has  not  done  enough  or  has
simply failed, by admitting  that  there  are  important  challenges  to  be
addressed and resolved. In doing this, the President has  shown  himself  to
be a statesman able to rise above the narrow sectional politics of parties.

As the political parties are preparing to go out and contest South  Africa's
third democratic elections, we must not be lured  into  believing  that  the
remarkable achievements  of  the  past  decade  mean  that  the  painstaking
process of reconciliation and  nation-building  is  complete.  South  Africa
remains a job in progress. The road to national unity is a long journey.  We
may not even complete it in our lifetime, but  we  have  made  a  beginning,
however humble it is.

The  task  of  national  unity  is  one  that  transcends  this  House   and
Government, for  it  can  only  be  achieved  by  the  contribution  of  all
political parties and by the active participation of  the  constellation  of
groups that we call civil society - student bodies,  women's  organisations,
NGOs, religious organisations, etc.

Most importantly, national unity requires  the  contribution  of  individual
men and women in their daily lives,  individuals  for  whom  ubuntu  is  the
touchstone of human character and disposition. Democracy and a human  rights
culture that flows from living in a free society will  only  take  root  and
flourish if the full citizenry participates.

So today we celebrate our freedom and not a victory of a party. And yet,  we
are mindful that, even after a decade of freedom, the black  majority  still
lives in abject poverty which we have not succeeded in overcoming,  and  the
IFP  believes  that  a  lasting  reconciliation  and  the  building   of   a
successful, united nation can only take place  when  each  and  every  South
African enjoys equality of opportunity and is free  from  destitution,  from
disease and from despair.

The IFP was particularly concerned that  the  President  did  not  take  the
opportunity of using the pulpit of  the  state  of  the  nation  address  to
emphasise the fight against HIV/Aids as a national priority. This we  deeply
regret - that the issue of HIV/Aids, which is  a  tragedy  really,  has  too
often over the past five  years  been  cast  in  party-political  terms  and
debated in a polemic tone. We are saddened that this  issue  has  threatened
to undermine the moral authority of your office, Mr President.

Perhaps, Mr President, your country and people look to you to be a  unifying
father figure, to show the warm touch and to reach out to your fellow  South
Africans with compassion in a way that only a head of state can do. When  we
say this, we do  so  not  to  injure  or  cause  offence,  because  the  IFP
recognises  and  sympathises  with  the  difficulties  Government  faces  in
confronting this pandemic at this critical moment in history, for there  are
other overwhelming demands and expectations to correct  the  injustices  and
the legacy of the past, but the President and the Government must  take  the
lead on this issue.

More than  any  other  ill,  HIV/Aids  has  the  potential  to  destroy  our
families, our communities,  and  our  sense  of  national  unity.  This  war
requires a proportional response. Like the task of national unity,  the  war
against HIV/Aids will require  all  the  people  of  South  Africa  to  work
together in unison in order to overcome it.

On the economic front, the IFP welcomed the  President's  laudatory  remarks
in the address about the need to develop the first  economy.  This  must  be
followed up by action. Government must urgently work out proposals to  slash
bureaucratic red tape,  and  review  labour  legislation,  especially  those
aspects that inhibit job creation, in order to increase our  competitiveness
as a country to make South  Africa  a  magnet  for  foreign  investment  and
accelerated growth.

The  IFP  endorses  the  President's  commitment   to   making   significant
infrastructure investments. The IFP believes that,  in  this  regard,  South
Africa must emulate the Asian tiger economies, which  achieved  double-digit
growth in the post-war years, and invest in growth industries and services.

On foreign affairs, the President was right to state that South  Africa  has
a role  to  play  in  the  construction  of  a  new  world  order  within  a
multilateral framework of international relations. Let  us  not  forget  the
one billion people who live outside the formal global economy, most of  whom
are on the continent of Africa. Today we are keenly aware what  the  serious
challenges facing  South  Africa  are:  HIV/Aids,  economy  growth  and  job
creation, crime, corruption and poverty.

The IFP will contest these elections on  the  merits  of  its  proposals  to
address these seminal issues, not with  rancour  and  negative  campaigning.
And so we appeal to all political parties, in the spirit  of  reconciliation
and nation-building, to do the same, for history will judge  us  harshly  if
we fail to do so.

We endorse the President's appraisal of the progress that South  Africa  has
made in the past decade, but we dare not linger here too long and  dwell  on
these achievements, for much still needs to be done. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, Mr President,  hon  members,  the  10th
anniversary of freedom invites us to reflect on the dreams and plans we  had
for our country as we entered the unfamiliar  territory  of  government.  It
also compels us to consider how far we  have  moved  towards  achieving  the
goals we held most precious.

In his state of the nation address, the President  reminded  us  that  South
Africa has enjoyed a decade of peace and progress. The  notion  of  progress
resonates  in  the  field  of  health  care  where  we  have  faced  massive
challenges,  challenges  that  are  linked  to  the  apartheid  legacy   and
challenges that arise from global health trends.

Our direction was determined from the outset by the  simple  principle  that
South Africa belongs to all who live in it and that every  citizen  deserves
access to essential health care at a time of need. In time,  this  principle
became our constitutional duty, a duty that we have taken seriously  at  all
times. It is a responsibility that has demanded  quite  fundamental  changes
in the health system and the introduction of laws that have not always  been
popular. We are quite clear that we need to take positive action  to  affirm
the rights of the poor and the vulnerable.

One of the first requirements of our "health care for  all"  agenda  was  to
establish the infrastructure for the effective delivery  of  primary  health
care services. We have substantially achieved this.

In 10 years we have introduced free health care for  children  and  pregnant
women. In 1996 free health care was extended to everybody  at  primary  care
level. Last year we included  people  with  disabilities  in  this  package,
including  hospital  care.  This   is   a   contribution   towards   poverty
alleviation.

Fees for services have been a barrier to basic health  care  for  those  who
need it most. We have proved our critics wrong who  said  that  free  health
care was a pipe dream. Sure, it  costs  money,  but  we  managed  this  leap
because of the political commitment of the ANC.

It must be said, however, that we claim  progress  -  not  perfection  -  in
primary health care,  precisely  because  there  is  still  an  unacceptable
variation in the standard of primary care that is being offered  across  the
country, and this is linked largely to resources. The tragedy  is  that  the
poorest amongst us, who are most in need of  public  health  care,  all  too
often have the weakest services. To illustrate this  point,  expenditure  on
primary health care per person per year among provinces ranges from  R50  to
R300.

Equity in service provision is the  critical  measure  that  determines  who
lives and who dies, who suffers permanent harm and who is restored  to  good
health. Let us never forget this  reality  as  we  rededicate  ourselves  to
service in the second decade of freedom.

The second major area of transformation in  health  care  was  the  hospital
sector, in which  physical  revitalisation,  rational  planning  and  better
management were the key objectives. The investment in capital  projects  has
steadily gained ground. In the year ahead about R2 billion will be spent  on
infrastructure and the building of new hospitals. An amount of  R911 million
will be spent on 27 major hospital projects, including the  building  of  18
new hospitals. In building new hospitals, we  have  tried  to  overturn  the
apartheid legacy and create an effective referral network.

The hospital revitalisation programme deals with organisational  development
- proper human resource  planning  and  management  systems,  ensuring  that
hospitals have  adequate  medical  equipment  and  simultaneously  improving
quality of care. Far from neglecting tertiary  level  care,  we  have  built
three new academic hospitals in the last decade - the Chief  Albert  Luthuli
Hospital in Durban, the Nelson Mandela Hospital in Umtata and  the  Pretoria
Academic Hospital Complex.

An increasing number of public hospitals offer the quality of  service  that
attracts full-fee and medical aid patients, but  never  at  the  expense  of
patients who are 100% dependent on public-sector  care.  These  include  the
Mankweng, Kimberley, Witbank, Folateng and Pelonomi  Hospitals  and  others.
The social contract therefore demands that we participate in the  governance
of these facilities through hospital and  clinic  boards,  and  protect  and
safeguard our facilities from crime and vandalism.

The third major area of  innovation  was  the  expansion  of  programmes  of
disease control and prevention and the establishment of new  programmes.  We
have expanded the child immunisation programme in line with WHO  guidelines,
have introduced additional vaccines  against  hepatitis  B  and  haemophilus
influenza and have made immunisation part of our  everyday  operations.  The
results have been the eradication of polio and  a  sharp  drop  in  measles.
Therefore, as part of our social contract, I am  appealing  to  fathers  and
mothers to bring their children to  our  clinics  to  be  immunised  against
preventable diseases.

We have seen a drop in the number of deaths owing to diarrhoeal  disease  as
a result of a number of factors, including improved access  to  clean  water
and sanitation, the promotion of breast-feeding,  the  prompt  treatment  of
diarrhoea and education of the public.

We tackled the long-standing problem  of  tuberculosis  by  introducing  the
community-based treatment programme. This improved our ability  to  identify
TB patients, test them and supply them with the correct drugs - all free  of
charge. TB remains a major challenge and it is further  complicated  by  the
development of a multidrug-resistant strain. We therefore need  to  redouble
our efforts against TB. There is no room for complacency.

In the face of a huge escalation in  malaria,  we  took  the  bold  step  of
reintroducing residual indoor spraying with DDT. By taking this step  -  and
working  closely  with  Swaziland,  Mozambique,  soon  to  be  followed   by
Zimbabwe, the DRC and Angola - we effectively turned  the  tide  of  malaria
infection in the year 2000.

HIV/Aids had begun to emerge as a serious public health threat by 1994,  but
there was no national programme to speak of as freedom dawned. In  the  past
decade, enormous resources have been committed to HIV/Aids and South  Africa
has indeed followed international best practice in  its  national  strategy.
Few countries would be able to claim an increase of 2 000% in Aids  spending
in less than 10 years.

Few would be able to point to greater investment  in  prevention  strategies
and few could claim such widespread mobilisation across sectors.  The  South
African National Aids Campaign is an achievement. We should  not  allow  our
progress to be overshadowed by the sheer scale of HIV infection.  We  should
see the magnitude of the problem as a challenge, not a defeat.

I would be  the  first  to  concede  that  it  is  not  sufficient  to  have
stabilised our HIV infection rates - we need to put them into reverse  gear.
Therefore, we are committed to strengthening the national  response  to  HIV
and Aids through the comprehensive plan adopted by Cabinet in November  last
year, as this brings to completion our five-year strategic plan on  HIV  and
Aids, which is itself due for review during the next 10-year period.

In the 12  weeks  since  the  plan  was  adopted,  there  has  been  intense
preparatory work and our implementation plan is at an  advanced  stage.  The
plan requires simultaneous action on many fronts across the  health  sector.
I can assure Parliament that we are committed to making this plan a  reality
- to achieving the target of  a  service  point  in  all  53  districts  and
metropolitan councils within one  year.  Let  me  assure  you  that  we  are
determined to offer every citizen quality  treatment,  management  and  care
for HIV and Aids, and not a shoddy programme that some in  this  House  want
to hurry us into delivering.

Let me clarify that, as the Minister of Health, the President has  delegated
to me the responsibility of accounting in  detail  what  the  Government  is
doing regarding HIV and Aids. South Africa is a member of the board  of  the
Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, where it represents the  Southern
and Eastern Africa Region. We also chair the Afro Regional Committee of  the
World Health Organisation.

Through  far-sighted  tobacco  control   legislation   and   tax   policies,
Government has reduced the size of the smoking population  in  our  country.
Given the relationship between tobacco use and various cancers  and  cardio-
vascular disorders, the population is likely to reap  the  benefit  of  this
decisive move by the Government in years to come.
Chairperson, a critical factor in our ability to ensure universal access  to
health care is equity in the distribution of resources.  More  bluntly  put,
it is our ability to overturn the huge imbalance in  resources  between  the
private and the public sectors on the one hand, and between urban and  rural
areas  on  the  other.  We  have  tackled  this  in  two  ways,  firstly  by
redistributing financial and human resources in the  public  health  sector,
and secondly, by legislation that encourages more efficient  use  of  health
resources in the private sector.

The impact of  initiatives  for  redistribution  in  the  public  sector  is
visible. Most of the 900 new clinics we have built are in the  rural  areas.
There is a narrowing as the gap between the health  spending  of  the  best-
resourced two provinces, namely Gauteng and the Western Cape,  and  that  of
the  least  developed  rural  provinces.  Through  community   service   and
government-to-government  agreements,  we  have  improved  the  professional
staffing of rural facilities quite dramatically. This year alone, more  than
3 000 young graduates are doing community service,  and  the  proportion  in
rural areas is the highest ever. Just a week  ago,  we  announced  a  unique
system of allowances for 33 000 health professionals  in  the  rural  areas,
and 66 000 professionals with skills that are in scarce supply.

Despite all these measures, Chairperson, the health gap  between  the  major
cities and the rural areas remains unacceptably high. We need to  boost  the
rural areas further, and we cannot do this simply by  siphoning  funds  from
the urban areas. We seriously  need  to  consider  whether  we  can  achieve
peace, progress, social justice and better quality of  health  care  on  the
current spending levels.

Various laws have been passed to safeguard private sector  health  consumers
and promote better value  for  money  in  that  sector.  These  include  the
Medical Schemes  Act  and  the  Medicines  and  Related  Substances  Control
Amendment Act, which advance  the  cause  of  more  affordable  and  quality
medicines.

The National Health Bill replaces the old Health Act of  1977,  and  ensures
that the health sector is in line with the Constitution. This Bill lays  the
foundation for rational health planning and the proper co-ordination of  all
the elements of the  public  and  private  health  sectors,  and  from  this
perspective of national  interest,  it  requires  that  all  health  service
equipment  and  establishments  are  certified  to  provide  affordable  and
quality health services.

Let me read, very quickly, from the submission  of  the  Health  Professions
Council of South Africa, a body that registers  all  doctors,  in  both  the
private and public health sectors. This is what  they  had  to  say  on  the
certificate of need:


  Council supports the issue of the certificate of  need  for  health  care
  establishments in relation to the yet-to-be-established institutions  but
  more so supports the  idea  of  revalidating  through  the  certification
  process of the existing   institutions. This is particularly against  the
  backdrop  of  perverse  incentives  and  schemes   that   a   number   of
  establishments   have   perpetrated,   thereby   inducing   practitioners
  registered with Council  to  act  unethically,  without  a  mechanism  of
  ensuring control of the activities in these institutions.  Secondly,  and
  more importantly, the issue of  adequacy  of  human  resources  in  these
  establishments is critical  as  Council  has  had  instances  where  some
  institutions  actually  operate  emergency  and  trauma  units  with  one
  practitioner who is not even properly trained in handling  trauma  cases.
  Council therefore fully endorses and supports the certificate of need.

Health care cannot be left to  the  whims  of  the  market.  Government  has
stewardship to ensure  that  every  citizen  has  equal  access  to  quality
services.

Chairperson, during the next decade we will focus on the following  priority
areas. We will improve our understanding of the causes  of  death  in  South
Africa in order to ensure proper  planning  and  appropriate  allocation  of
resources. We will accelerate the revitalisation  of  health  facilities  to
reverse apartheid planning.
We will consolidate the improvement of human resource planning and  training
to deal aggressively with the shortages and unfair  distribution  of  health
workers  throughout  the  national  health  system.  We  will  implement   a
comprehensive school health programme, as this will lay the  foundation  for
health promotion among the  youth.  We  will  accelerate  the  programme  of
making sure that medicines  are  available  to  all  South  Africans  at  an
affordable  price,  as  envisaged  in  the   regulations   currently   under
discussion by the public.

The goal of achieving equity between the rich and the  poor,  between  urban
and rural, between provinces and within provinces, will  continue  to  drive
our health sector reform programme. We will increase the pool of  those  who
have medical aid and protect them  against  unscrupulous  schemes.  We  will
promote solidarity in health by ensuring  that  those  who  can  afford  to,
contribute to the health of the poor.

This year we will  eliminate  the  backlog  in  assistive  devices  such  as
wheelchairs and hearing and walking aids, and intensify  our  programmes  on
noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and  heart  diseases
including obesity, by amongst  others,  stepping  up  our  health  promotion
programme.

Chairperson, I have observed that the promise of free treatment for HIV  and
Aids is fast becoming the popular slogan of the opposition parties  in  this
House. I think they need to wake up and stop daydreaming,  because  we  have
already adopted a programme to treat comprehensively those who are  infected
with and affected by Aids, to manage them with compassion,  and  to  provide
them with quality care. In the public sector these services will  always  be
provided free of charge.

As we approach the tenth anniversary of freedom and democracy, I would  urge
sober reflection across society on the meaning  and  value  of  a  just  and
equitable health care system to a nation  that  is  still  divided  in  many
ways. When we act to uphold the right to  health  and  life  of  each  South
African, we truly begin to bridge these divisions. The new decade is  a  new
opportunity. I thank you. [Applause.]

Die ADJUNKMINISTER VAN GESONDHEID: Agb Voorsitter, agb President, agb  lede,
hierdie is 'n politieke debat en ek wil begin deur die diepe kommer van  die
NNP oor gesondheidskwessies in ons land op rekord te plaas.

Die siening van die NNP oor die protesoptog van dokters  verlede  week,  wat
ons gesteun  het,  asook  ons  sterk  opponering  van  die  sertifikaat  van
behoefte is volledig uiteengesit verlede Vrydag in 'n  mediaverklaring,  wat
ons vandag weer eens uitreik  in  die  lig  van  wydverspreide  spanning  en
onrustigheid oor gesondheidskwessies.

Die verkiesingsmanifes van die NNP,  wat  op  20  Februarie  2004  vrygestel
word,  sal  ook  ons  sterk  standpunte   oor   die   volle   spektrum   van
gesondheidsorg bevat en  tydens  die  verkiesingsveldtog  sal  ons  dit  met
mening bevorder. Ek wil dus nou terugkeer tot die debat oor sake geopper  in
die  President  se  staatsrede  en  spesifiek  die  kwessie   van   armoede.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon
members, this is a political debate and  I  want  to  start  by  placing  on
record the deep concern of the New NP about health matters in our country.

The New NP's stance on the protest march by  doctors  last  week,  which  we
supported, as well as our strong opposition to the certificate of need,  was
fully set out in a media statement last Friday, which we  are  issuing  once
again today in the light of  widespread  tension  and  unease  about  health
matters.

The New NP's election manifesto, which  will  be  released  on  20  February
2004, will also contain our strong views on the entire  spectrum  of  health
care and we will be strongly promoting it during the  election  campaign.  I
therefore want to return to the debate now and  address  matters  raised  in
the President's state of the nation address and  specifically  the  question
of poverty.]

It is a fact,  Mr  President,  that  anyone  who  reads  your  speeches  and
statements will observe two words featuring very  prominently  in  all  your
pronouncements. One of the words is "poverty" and the need to deal with  it,
and the second is "unity" and the need to achieve it.

Increasingly, poverty, like crime, dominates much of our national  discourse
when dealing with socioeconomic issues, and  rightly  so.  It  was  Franklin
Roosevelt who described those in  poverty,  the  poorest  of  the  poor,  as
"forgotten men and women at the bottom of the economic pyramid". Poverty  is
without a doubt a central issue of our  time,  globally,  continentally  and
nationally, and that is why the priority that the Government  gives  to  it,
and which you restated on Friday, cannot be faulted.

Much of what the Government is doing to  fight  poverty  today  is  probably
informed by the excellent report entitled ``Poverty and Inequality in  South
Africa'', prepared and published in  May  1998.  And  although  that  report
contains much data, it makes a very telling observation when it  reminds  us
that statistics say little about people's actual experience of poverty on  a
human level, where poverty  typically  comprises  ill  health,  arduous  and
often hazardous work for low  income,  high  levels  of  anxiety,  emotional
stress and exposure to violence which has a profound impact on the lives  of
the poor.

The second word which you  used  frequently,  Mr  President,  was  the  word
"united" - the need for unity of purpose and a national united effort,  also
in respect of poverty and the other challenges that face us.  Correctly  you
work on the premise  that  in  unity  lies  strength  -  ex  unitate  vires,
"eendrag maak mag" - and that the extent  of  the  challenges  require  such
unity and strength for a collective effort to overcome them.

Earlier this year, Mr President, you made an appeal  which  bears  repeating
in this debate. You said:
  We will also have to intensify our  work  among  those  sections  of  our
  population, both black and white, who occupy more privileged positions in
  our society. We must encourage these also to lend a hand  in  the  common
  national effort to defeat poverty and underdevelopment.

We in the New NP are working hard to persuade as many fellow South  Africans
as we can that that call is worthy of support. But, regrettably,  there  are
forces in our country which prefer a state of disunity, a lack of  unity  of
purpose, even on the biggest  problems  facing  us,  who  prefer  to  divide
rather than unite and criticise in the  most  exaggerated  terms.  I  am  of
course referring to the DA and its leader, the hon  Leon,  famous  Afrikaner
icon of note according to his resident  imbongi,  the  hon  Douglas  Gibson.
[Laughter.]

As the election approaches, we see the shrillness and aggression of  the  DA
increasing exponentially, and the targets  of  their  bile  range  from  the
President himself to the national leader of the New NP, the media and,  more
recently, former President F W de Klerk  -  to  whom  I  will  return  in  a
moment. But the common factor in the DA's pronouncements  is  the  promotion
of disunity and division, no matter what the cost  to  the  country  or  the
nation as a whole. We in the New NP see this  as  a  dangerous  and  gravely
flawed approach which threatens to marginalise many good South Africans  who
can play a positive role.

But I want to return to the hon Leader of the Opposition.  A  few  days  ago
the hon Leon chose to launch a tirade against  Mr  F  W  de  Klerk  for  his
intention to restate his support for the ANC/New NP co-operative  governance
agreement. And of course the attack  contained  the  usual  Leon-speak,  the
prizefighter  mentality  with   words   like   "double-cross",   "betrayal",
"zigzagging", etc. It reminds one of the wrestling federation.

Interestingly, in August 2000, when the hon Leon spoke as leader of  the  DA
at the naming of the F W de Klerk Boardroom in the Marks  Building,  he  had
the following to say. Mr Tony Leon said that the naming of the boardroom  in
honour of F W de  Klerk  was  an  important  milestone  in  the  DA's  short
history, because it was De Klerk's famous speech of  2  February  1990  that
made the new politics of today possible. It helped steer  our  country  away
from a bloody civil war. Leon  said  that  one  of  the  achievements  which
flowed  from  De  Klerk's  speech  was  the  establishment  of   a   liberal
constitutional state. Now let's talk  about  zigzagging  and  inconsistency.
The hon Leon reminds me of a quote by an American  president  who  said:  "I
have opinions of my own, strong opinions, but  I  don't  always  agree  with
them."  [Laughter.] [Applause.]

With all due respect, our submission is that the country deserves  a  better
performance from the hon Leon - if he ever wants to be  taken  seriously  by
anyone at all. And in fact, South Africa deserves a  better  Leader  of  the
Opposition. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson,  comrades,  President  and
Deputy President, there are many South Africans, including  members  of  the
ANC and the tripartite alliance, who fully  understood,  Comrade  President,
the reason you quoted so extensively from former President Nelson  Mandela's
speech in this House almost 10 years ago. You were talking to  the  unbroken
thread that has characterised the struggle of  the  masses  of  our  country
under the leadership of the ANC for our liberation.

This unbroken thread predates the establishment of the ANC 92 years ago.  It
was characterised by the wars of resistance, led by amakhosi in  many  parts
of our motherland to protect our land and our nationhood. Starting with  the
battle in 1659 when Chief Autshumao,  to  whom  white  historians  over  the
years have attached the pejoritive name Harry the Hottentot, led  his  Khoi-
Khoi army against Jan van Riebeeck, who had forcefully  seized  the  tribe's
best grazing lands.

The hope that the resilience of our people  had  been  completely  destroyed
with the defeat of Nkosi Bhambatha was shattered when the ANC was formed  to
take forward the struggle of our people, finally  to  arrive  at  the  point
where Madiba addressed this Assembly, as the first South  African  President
to be elected through a truly democratic process.

We understood you, Comrade President, to be asking  us  to  strengthen  that
thread when you recalled Madiba's observation that -


  ... the purpose that will drive this Government shall be the expansion of
  the frontiers of  human  fulfilment,  the  continuous  extension  of  the
  frontiers of freedom.

What Madiba said then, and your reiteration of the fact, Comrade  President,
reminded the great majority of  our  people  that  the  struggle  continues:
Aluta Continua.

No one  can  gainsay  that  the  movement  forward  is  littered  with  many
challenges. You indicated some of these in  your  speech  last  Friday.  You
made it clear at the imbizos in KwaZulu-Natal recently that the  outstanding
challenges will require more time and more  resources  to  overcome.  Anyone
saying  anything  to  the  contrary  would  be  stretching  the  truth.  The
timelines for this will not be short.

I was part of the President's delegation to the Democratic Republic  of  the
Congo last month. I could not but marvel at the sight that greeted us  every
time our convoy travelled from one point to  the  next.  Thousands  of  that
country's people lined the streets in appreciation of our presence in  their
country. They waved and ululated as the  convoy  drove  past,  many  raising
their clenched fists to recognise the significance of the  visit.  They  saw
it as a clear sign of solidarity with them in their effort to  build  a  new
nation, a new country and  new  opportunities.  They  carried  placards  and
banners that proclaimed their hopes and their dreams of a better future  for
themselves and the generations to come. One of the banners screamed:


  President Thabo Mbeki is bringing us peace and development.

These words carried both hope and a strong sense of  confidence  that  South
Africa would be able to help create the conditions that must lead  to  peace
and stability. That an ANC Government would indeed be ready  to  help  is  a
mandate that springs directly from the Freedom Charter. There  are  millions
of people at home and abroad, Comrade President, who have  internalised  our
political programme. They have unshaken faith in its great sense of  purpose
and ideological morality. The Congolese in the DRC and other nations on  the
African continent expect the ANC and its Government to follow to the  letter
the stipulations in the Freedom Charter  that  "there  shall  be  peace  and
friendship".

They have fully appreciated our exposition of the clause that:


  South Africa shall strive to maintain world peace and the  settlement  of
  all international disputes by negotiation, not war. The right of all  the
  peoples of Africa to independence and self-government shall be recognised
  and shall be the basis of close co-operation.
We are bound by those injunctions of our political programme.  That  is  why
we respond positively when the governments of the  continent  and  elsewhere
in the world call upon us to assist to consolidate  their  effort  to  build
peace and development in their countries. That is why  we  are  helping  the
Burundians  and  the  Congolese;  and  that  is  why  we  are  helping   the
Mozambicans to find and destroy the weapons that killed  so  many  of  their
own in the civil war in their country;  and  that  is  why  we  are  helping
Zimbabwe. All these nations, and the great majority of our people know  that
our vision of peace and stability is the only vehicle that  will  give  them
thoroughgoing freedom and democracy, equal opportunity and prosperity.

Allow me at this point to pay homage to  our  people  who  listened  to  the
President's appeal to our nation to celebrate  last  year's  festive  season
peacefully. The people's co-operation resulted in the  lowest  incidence  of
crime in a very, very long while; and there were fewer deaths on our  roads.
The South Africans who listened to your call,  Comrade  President,  are  the
millions of people who want to be part of the people's  contract  to  create
work and fight poverty. They live in Hillbrow in  Gauteng,  in  KwaMashu  in
KwaZulu-Natal, in Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain in the  Western  Cape  and
in other areas of our country where crime levels in the past were  extremely
high.

There are many South Africans who come from the various people's  structures
that make up  our  country's  springboard  of  human  advancement,  who  are
participating in the  programme  to  create  an  atmosphere  of  safety  and
security for all our people and the  visitors  who  come  as  investors  and
tourists.

On New Year's Eve last year my colleague, MEC  for  safety  and  liaison  in
Gauteng, Mrs Nomvula Mokonyane and I joined the police on  their  rounds  in
some parts of Johannesburg. We were  joined  by  a  high-powered  delegation
from  the  SA  Council  of  Churches  led  by  that  organisation's  General
Secretary, Dr Molefe Tsele. We went  to  the  crime  hotspots  of  Hillbrow,
Berea and Alexandra, helping to spread your message, Comrade  President,  of
a peaceful festive season.

Prior to this, we had a number of meetings with the SACC where we  discussed
and agreed on a programme of co-operation in the fight  against  crime.  The
agreement  of  a  partnership  against  crime  was  meant  to  formalise   a
relationship that has existed for a long time between  the  law  enforcement
agencies of the democratic government and the clergy and the members of  the
various parishes  across  the  country.  This  relationship  was  a  logical
development; given the role of religious leaders and their followers in  the
struggle for a free, democratic, nonracist and nonsexist South Africa.

The march on 24 February 1988 by South Africa's religious leaders  to  South
Africa's whites-only  parliament,  was  groundbreaking.  The  marchers  were
responding to the dictates of  their  lodestar,  the  Kairos  Document.  The
document itself was historic. It was presented by Dr Beyers  Naude,  General
Secretary at the time of the SA Council of Churches, to  the  World  Council
of Churches' Ecumenical Centre leaders in Geneva on 25 September  1985.  The
Kairos Document firmly placed religious  leaders  in  the  trenches  of  the
liberation movement.

In February last  year  the  clergy  initiated  a  march  against  crime  in
Khayelitsha that attracted more than 25 000 participants. All  of  this  was
part of the unbroken thread of our struggle you enunciated in your state  of
the nation address, Comrade  President.  The  religious  leaders,  who  were
founder members of the ANC, some of whom went on to lead the  movement,  set
the standard for those who directly challenged  apartheid;  as  did  Bishops
Trevor  Huddleston,  Manas  Buthelizi,   David   Russell,   Buti   Thlagale,
Archbishops Desmond Tutu, Dennis Hurley, Njongonkulu Ndungane,  Revs  Beyers
Naude, Frank Chikane, Allan Boesak, and Fr  Smangaliso  Mkhatshwa,  just  to
mention a few.

The role of progressive religious leaders in  the  fight  against  crime  is
further clarified in the SACC statement released on 15  December  last  year
which said, among other things:


  We must all see the fight against crime as an extension  of  our  ongoing
  struggle  for  national  liberation,  social  transformation  and   moral
  regeneration.

There are many other South Africans like the religious leaders who  want  to
work with the democratic Government as part  of  the  people's  contract  to
create work and fight poverty. They include leaders in the  business  sector
and  in  various  organs  of  civil  society,  from  trade  unions  to   the
associations of commercial farmers and cultural workers.

The South Africans who continue to speak ill of  our  country  and  policies
abroad have been reduced to a small  coterie  of  whingers  who  are  mainly
whistling as they pass the graveyard,  as  the  saying  goes.  Some  of  the
sympathisers they still have are barely  listening  to  them.  The  tourists
continue to pour into our country and our economy continues  to  strengthen.
Larger numbers of people here and abroad are supporting us and I believe  we
are going to enjoy overwhelming support from our people for a long  time  to
come on the basis of the progressive policies that  underpin  our  programme
of service delivery, to ensure a better life for all our  people.  To  quote
our fallen hero, a beloved son of our people and a leader of this  movement,
Steve Tshwete: ``Siza kuphatha  isithukuthezi  sento!''  [We  are  going  to
govern forever!]

Last Saturday when others elsewhere had the luxury to grandstand  and  shout
many meaningless slogans, the Ministry of Community Safety  in  the  Western
Cape, under my colleague, Leonard Ramatlakane organised a  function  at  the
Castle in Cape Town to express appreciation to 3  500  volunteers  who  last
year participated in the Safer Festive Season programme as  crime  fighters.
Working side by side with the law enforcement  agencies,  they  catered  for
our people's safety on the trains, on the roads, on the beaches, and  safety
for our children wherever they were. [Applause.]

The volunteers will continue to work with the police. The SACC committed  to
convene in the early part of  this  year  a  summit  of  church  leaders  to
identify ways in which churches can expand their pastoral role in the  fight
against crime and promote efforts to build peace and security at  grassroots
level. There is a lot of goodwill all around and readiness to work with  the
ANC and Government to eliminate the many stumbling blocks that still  remain
in our march to freedom.

Your call to South Africans across the  board,  Comrade  President,  at  the
90th anniversary celebrations of the oldest political party on  the  African
continent, the ANC, to commit time and energy in a collective way to  create
conditions for  a  better  life  for  all  our  people  remains  valid.  The
volunteers in Cape Town and elsewhere are responding  to  you.  There  is  a
strong indication that the ANC's call to all South Africans  to  participate
in the people's contract to  create  work  and  fight  poverty  will  get  a
positive response.

The ANC articulated, before the 1994 democratic elections, a vision for  the
new  police  service  for  South  Africa.  That  has  informed  the  current
programme  for  safety  and  security.  For  a  new  police  service  to  be
effective, it needed to be rooted firmly among the people  working  together
as units and sections of the same army to prevent and combat crime. The  ANC
recognised that a police service of that kind would enjoy the confidence  of
the law-abiding citizens of  the  country,  with  the  people  as  the  best
repository of information, placing essential intelligence  at  the  disposal
of the members of the service. As it  were,  there  is  better  co-operation
between the police and the people, resulting in better crime  detection  and
prosecution these days.

During the presidential imbizos in KwaZulu-Natal and again last Friday,  the
President spoke about "those among us who are fond of  threatening  violence
to promote their causes". The people of  KwaZulu-Natal  who  attended  these
imbizos gave the President strong support  when  he  raised  the  matter  of
peaceful campaigning as a prerequisite for a free and  fair  election.  They
are tired of bloodletting and want permanent peace in KZN.

The entire law-enforcement sector and armed forces  of  South  Africa  fully
identify with the call for  nonviolent  political  activity,  be  it  around
election campaigns  or  ordinary  political  programmes.  Members  of  these
institutional structures understand the mandate they  have  to  protect  our
democracy. That means, among other things, the right  of  all  parties,  big
and small, from the ANC to the ID party, freely to  promote  their  policies
among all sections of the  people  anywhere  in  South  Africa.  This  means
nobody will declare any part of our country a no-go area. Consequently,  the
right of every citizen to campaign freely would be protected  with  all  the
resources at the disposal of the state. That this was not so going into  the
1994 elections should not be  construed  as  available  space  for  visiting
political violence on our people once again. That space is simply no  longer
available.

 That is an injunction from our Constitution. This is the Constitution  that
the Leader of the Opposition would like to  change  to  create  a  situation
where only two parties would be participants  in  this  Assembly.  When  the
question was asked today, the hon Gibson came  here  and  further  explained
what they meant by that. He said in depicting  the  political  parties  that
are here in opposition, from the IFP right down  to  Azapo,  they  are  mere
outward trappings of democracy, following a tune from his leader.

I watched as the hon Delport was speaking here today.  Looking  at  the  hon
Dan Maluleke, I was trying to read what was perhaps going through  his  mind
as a member of his own party was saying  here,  in  raising  the  issues  of
security, that security only relates to white farmers in  South  Africa  and
in Zimbabwe. And when we were talking about mineral rights again it  related
to those who have been owners of the mines for a  long  time  and  obviously
those are white people. You heard when he was talking about the white  brain
drain. I was looking at the hon Maluleke because he is mobilising people  in
Soweto to support his DA. I wonder what they think when they hear this  kind
of talk.

Shenge, I really felt for you yesterday when  you  were,  in  a  constrained
manner, talking about the relationship between your party  and  the  DA.  It
was clarified later when the DA said that the only parties in  the  type  of
democracy that they understand to be acceptable in these  hallowed  Chambers
would be a two-party democracy. It means that as far as they are  concerned,
looking at the current situation, those parties should be  the  ANC  as  the
ruling party and the DA as the opposition. No IFP, no New  NP  and  none  of
these other parties.

You said that you were  forced  to  go  into  that  untenable  situation  by
circumstances, maybe beyond your  control,  Shenge,  but  the  fact  of  the
matter is that in the final analysis this type of relationship is not  going
to be longstanding. It is not based on  principle.  It  was  described  here
today as it was described yesterday,  namely  that  the  only  parties  that
matter in this House are the ANC and the DA and the rest  are  only  outward
trappings of democracy. As the ANC we want  to  recommit  ourselves  to  the
democracy that we understand, where all our people must be participants  and
where the representatives of all our people must  have  the  possibility  to
come here and be represented. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, my colleague  was  very  fast  in
going back to his seat. I wanted to ask a question concerning what  he  said
about me.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: You had a minute  left,  Minister.  If
you want to take the question, I will still afford  you  the  time.  Do  you
want to take the question? [Interjections.] No. The Minister declines.

The MINISTER OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  So  this  great  democrat  is  refusing  my
question. [Interjections.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chairperson, hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President
and Ministers, our democratic Government and all  South  Africans,  I  bring
greetings to all of you from the hon leader of the  MF,  Mr  A  Rajbansi.  I
take this opportunity to welcome all of you back in a new year  and  express
the hope  that  2004  will  be  approached  with  determination,  unity  and
strength in undertaking the challenges, aims and dreams of our nation.

The MF welcomes the President's state of the nation address.  Mr  President,
in your address last Friday, you correctly followed the  course  mapped  out
by our great former President, Nelson Mandela. The emphasis on peace,  unity
and reconciliation that forms the landmark of this map is  the  strength  of
our nation. The country should recognise the call that there is no need  for
negative opposition. Let us all join hands and, together, we  will  build  a
great nation.

India has an  excellent  growth  rate  and  is  fast  becoming  an  economic
powerhouse. This is a result of the great  Prime  Minister,  Pundit  Nehru's
efforts, since it was he who unfolded five-year plans and toured the  world.
Hon President, you have unfolded a second 10-year plan  and,  like  the  hon
Nehru, are building good relations globally. Through your actions, you  have
secured great investment for our beloved country. Generations to  come  will
look back at this period with pride.

To date, we have had a number of comments and criticism on  the  President's
state of the nation address. The loved and  legendary  Mahatma  Ghandi  once
said: "Do not judge India by  bright  lights.  Look  at  the  villages  that
suffer."

Hon President, it is pleasing to note that, in your  address,  many  of  our
achievements were highlighted, and that our shortfalls and the realities  of
the less fortunate in our country were acknowledged too. Those  on  my  left
only worry about the haves, but the stock-taking shows that homes have  been
built;  education  has  been  uplifted;  and  there  is  water,  sanitation,
electricity, clinics and hospitals  in  place  that  had  never  been  there
before. These are but a few achievements that the MF is proud that  we  have
achieved in this decade of democracy.

At this juncture, I take the opportunity to pass on  a  message.  I  have  a
message for the hon Tony Leon. In the 2000 local election  your  party,  the
DA, adopted a dirty tactic against the MF. You came  to  Chatsworth  like  a
fox terrier. Mr Rajbansi has called you ``the balloon boy'' as you  seem  to
come once every five years with your balloons. Unfortunately, the  hon  Tony
Leon is not here, but I'm sure he will get the message.

Mr Rajbansi, the Bengal tiger, once again challenges you to  a  debate.  The
MF will worry the SABC to allow the debate. Our  hon  leader  proposes  that
you make use of your notes and advisors, as he will  challenge  you  without
the above and swallow you for  breakfast.  [Laughter.]  Mr  Rajbansi  senses
your fear, hon Tony Leon. You may retort with Visvin  Reddy.  For  the  past
two years, the DA has attacked the MF for the doings of  Mr  Reddy.  The  DA
wanted him removed from the council for alleged corruption.

When our leader wanted to remove Mr Reddy from the council's executive,  the
DA offered him carrots. The DA has taken Reddy, the same person they  wanted
removed for corruption. While  the  MF  is  lean  and  clean,  a  journalist
recently reported that the DA is lean and white.

The MF shares the concerns of many regarding poverty, crime and  the  social
wellbeing of the nation. The extreme effects of HIV/Aids on all  sectors  of
our community and its continuous threat  need  serious  attention  and,  hon
President, I think a number of persons, including the MF,  were  hoping  for
your greater emphasis and attention on that matter.

Job creation is another matter that we are hoping, hon President,  you  will
emphasise more. It is through job  creation  that  we  can  tackle  our  sad
reality of poverty. The DA says more cops, less crime. The MF, on the  other
hand, says more jobs, less crime. If  we  can  relieve  our  nation  of  the
burden of poverty through job creation, we would certainly  be  taking  many
criminals off the streets, replacing their  desperation  with  hopes  for  a
brighter tomorrow.

Regarding the rights of association, we have here  our  double-standards  DA
that shares an alliance with the right-wing parties as well as the IFP,  and
they call it nation-building. When others have a working  relationship,  the
DA stoops to its lowest level and criticises these parties. The  DA  attacks
working with the ANC, yet they have an alliance with the IFP that  is  in  a
coalition with the ANC.

The MF is proud of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights that has  awarded
every South African equality and democracy. Our belief is  that  the  rights
to equality, freedom and democracy and the assurance to uphold these  rights
is a duty of all. Moreover, we see human rights as not  only  South  African
rights, but as global rights of all people.

In view of this and our foreign policy, the MF feels that all  human  rights
violations - and that includes  in  neigbouring  countries  -  need  serious
attention. On matters of this nature,  we  need  to  take  a  serious  moral
stand.

Hon President, in your speech, you took us back  to  our  horrific  past,  a
past that we never want to return to, a past that we swear  we  shall  never
allow to repeat itself. Hon President, in your  address,  you  wisely  noted
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  before  I  call
upon the hon I  Vadi,  the  Chair  proposes  that  we  have  a  seven-minute
adjournment  at  the  end  of  Mr  Vadi's  speech.  Five  minutes  into  the
adjournment, the bells will be  rung  for  two  minutes  to  afford  members
sufficient time to be back in their seats again, refreshed,  to  resume  the
business of the House.

 Mr I VADI: Deputy Chairperson,  whenever  the  hon  Tony  Leon  speaks,  it
appears as if he despises South Africa,  he  dislikes  its  people;  and  he
undermines public  confidence  in  our  country.  At  home  and  abroad,  he
consistently projects negative images of our country, its  leaders  and  its
people. Its about crime and alleged corruption, the danger  of  a  one-party
dictatorship and a power-hungry President. Its a picture of doom and  gloom.


The hon Leon's politics is potently destructive, it  is  patently  divisive,
and it is designed to leave South Africans demobilised and  disunited.  That
is why he will go down in history, not as a nation-builder, but as  one  who
has polarised our society.

In Shakespearean theatre, the royal comedian often proclaimed the  truth  to
his Majesty through humour. Perhaps in our democracy, Karen Bliksem  of  The
Sunday Independent can  be  likened  to  a  modern  day  court  jester.  She
captured a truth this  weekend,  when  she  called  the  hon  Leon  "the  DA
Fuhrer". She said:  "C'mon  Tony,  things  aren't  that  serious.  It  seems
unlikely that you will ever take responsibility  for  anything  large,  like
say, the government, in my lifetime or yours." The hon Leon will not  become
the President of South Africa after the 2004 elections.  Maybe  destiny  has
it in store for him in 4002.

In contrast to the Leon's political  cacophony,  listen  to  the  voices  of
ordinary South Africans who go about  in  their  daily  lives  building  our
nation. Some of these  voices  are  poignantly  captured  in  Antjie  Krog's
latest book, A Change of Tongue. In her opening chapter, she  describes  the
victory of a black athlete in a predominantly  white  school  at  an  inter-
schools athletics meeting in the following way:


  The pavilion crowd is on its feet. The black parents are  yelling  wildly
  and pressing against the railing...The white parents  are  cheering,  one
  tossing a hat into the air. "Why is everybody happy?" she asks  some  men
  next to her, and listens to his reply. "The blacks are happy  because  it
  is a black kid beating the whites.  The  whites  are  happy  because  the
  winning kid is from a white school and was trained by them."

That  is  precisely  the  point.  All  South  Africans,  that  is  Africans,
coloureds, Indians and whites can play a meaningful  role  in  building  our
nonracial  democracy.  We  may  do  so  from  different  perspectives,  with
different purposes in mind. We can contribute to nation-building by  forging
partnerships with the democratic Government.

A good example of this is the work of the Lenasia-based  Crescent  of  Hope,
which has teamed up with  the  Mpumalanga  government  to  provide  borehole
water to villages in remote areas  in  the  province.  We  can  build  South
Africa by working within organs of civil society, such as  the  Gandhi  Walk
Committee, which raises funds annually and then distributes  these  to  over
10 development organisations in and around Lenasia. And  we  can  do  so  by
individual acts of kindness.

Mr President, I wish to cite the example of Mrs Zohra  Gaibee  from  Mayfair
in Johannesburg, who makes and sells Indian  pickles  and  uses  every  cent
that she makes in profit to educate two boys  from  the  Transkei  and  four
orphans in Bosnia. [Applause.] These are golden examples of  ordinary  South
Africans doing something to help build this nation.

However, a conflict-ridden society such as ours can only be  healed  through
forgiveness, humility and sensitivity. It cannot be built on  the  political
arrogance as exemplified by the DA. Many South Africans  across  the  racial
spectrum have drunk the milk of human kindness.  They  have  forgiven  their
former tormentors and oppressors. Whatever the imperfections of the TRC,  it
became the historical instrument that allowed thousands  of  South  Africans
to render forgiveness, to bury the past, and move forward. That  process  is
beautifully captured in a poem by an 18 year old girl, Emma Hendrie:


  Memories bubble to the surface
  And erupt with pain
  Generating heated words
  Which burn to be said and burn to be heard.
  Microphones turn shameful whispers into booming confessions
  And private sobs of grief into the mourning of a nation
  Shame and sorrow, but ultimately
  Tears are the common product.
  The forgiver and the forgiven are welded together
  By the cathartic reaction of conflicting memories
  And finally, through the searing handshake,
  Two opposing truths are forged into a single understanding.

This is how a nation is born, moulded and built!

Deputy Speaker, the hon Leon has another bad  habit  which  he  displays  in
public every now and then. He  has  tried  to  drive  a  wedge  between  the
politics of former President Mandela and President Mbeki,  casting  the  one
as a good guy and the other as a bad one. He has  attacked  President  Mbeki
for allegedly turning his back on the path of  national  reconciliation  and
for re-opening racial wounds.  He  accuses  the  President  of  espousing  a
narrow-minded Africanism, as  opposed  to  the  broad  South  Africanism  of
Mandela. Nothing is further from the truth. [Interjections.]

President Mbeki has consistently sought to interact and  converse  with  all
communities in South Africa. Last year he addressed  a  major  gathering  of
the South African Jewish community.  President  Mbeki  has  visited  my  own
hometown on three separate occasions, the most memorable  being  the  annual
Diwali celebrations organised by the Hindu  Co-ordinating  Council.  He  has
held  ongoing  dialogues  with  religious  leaders  through   the   National
Religious Forum.

He has walked the  dusty  roads  of  dorpies  in  the  Cape  platteland  and
listened to Coloured women speaking their minds.  He  has  spoken  to  young
Afrikaners. He has interacted  with  the  representatives  of  the  business
community - black and white - and with  militant  trade  unionists.  So  the
reality is that he has reached out to leaders  and  representatives  of  all
racial, class, religious and cultural communities in South Africa. His  door
is open to all, except that there may be some who don't  want  to  knock  on
his door.

But his door remains decidedly shut to those  who  have  used  terrorism  to
advance their cause. Terrorists have threatened our  national  security  and
undermined our nation and our democratic order. The wave of urban terror  in
the Western Cape in the mid 1990s, and  the  more  recent  bombings  by  the
white right wing represent the systematic use of  coercive  intimidation  to
secure narrow political ends and to destabilise democratic rule.

It is the work of desperate groups who are afraid of democracy and  freedom.
In the case of the Western Cape, terror attacks against gangsters  and  drug
dealers soon degenerated into violent attacks on  Muslim  religious  leaders
and academics, Government officials  and  symbols  of  state.  In  the  most
recent terror attacks they have targeted a  mosque,  a  Buddist  temple  and
civilian transport  infrastructure.  The  aim  was  to  instil  a  panic  in
society, spark off religious and  racial  conflict  and  extract  ill-gained
concessions from our Government.

It is to the credit of our democracy that  all  political  parties  in  this
House  have  unreservedly  condemned  these  acts  of  terror.   Democracies
throughout the world are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, but  a  young  and
fragile democracy such as  ours  is  even  more  vulnerable.  It  is  highly
commendable that our democratic state has  acted  swiftly  to  smash  terror
groups in South Africa, and it is more  commendable  that  it  has  done  so
without unduly restricting or  curtailing  civil  liberties  and  individual
freedoms. This inspires confidence in  our  nation  and  in  our  democratic
institutions.

We live in an era where race, ethnicity, religion, culture  and  imperialism
have torn asunder many nations in  the  world,  particularly  in  the  Third
World. Ethno-nationalists and ethno-religious  conflicts  have  resulted  in
brutal  massacres,  genocide  and  failed  states.  One  can  cite  numerous
examples; Yugoslavia, Burundi and  Somalia  are  but  a  few.  South  Africa
pulled itself from the edge of  the  precipice  on  the  eve  of  the  first
democratic elections in 1994.

While many political leaders can claim some responsibility for the  peaceful
transition to democracy,  the  lion's  share  undoubtedly  must  go  to  the
leadership of the ANC. [Applause.] The origins of this success  lie  in  the
Freedom Charter - adopted in June 1955 - which declared  that  South  Africa
belongs to all who live in it, black and white. We are one  nation.  We  are
politically united in spite of our diverse cultures,  languages,  religions,
and racial and ethnic identities. We are proudly South African!

 After  10  years  we  have  a  functioning  and  cohesive  nation-state,  a
Government that enjoys popular legitimacy  and  an  administration  that  is
displaying greater capacity to distribute public  services  efficiently  and
equitably. This is the miracle of our country - the centre is  holding.  The
greater miracle is that the prophets of doom or the  traditional  doomsayers
have been proved wrong. Some, like Rian Malan, are bold and  big  enough  to
acknowledge it - albeit belatedly. I suppose,  others  on  that  side  never
will.

The hour has come for the hon Leon to stop punting doomsday messages.  Don't
put your country down! Leon must listen carefully to the humble advice of  a
quiet and unassuming South African poet, Shabir Banoobhai, when he says:


  Our understanding of truth is coloured by who we are. This very statement
  reveals  the  particular  understanding  of  a  particular  person   with
  particular limitations ... This does not mean that nothing  is  true.  It
  simply means that we may understand something as true, when  it  is  not.
  This is our right. But your right to be wrong does not give you the right
  to mislead others.

Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Business suspended at 16:07 and resumed at 16:24.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon President, the Chairperson in his wisdom  decided  to  give
you a break before facing me - you need it. [Laughter.]

Agb  Speaker,  agb  President  Mbeki,  wyle  prof  Gawie  Cilliers  het  per
geleentheid tydens 'n geselligheid waar hy matrieks in  Tzaneen  toegespreek
het, hulle dié lewenswysheid geleer  van  "eet  jou  rape  eerste".  Hy  het
vertel hoe hulle tydens die arm kinderjare in die depressie  rape  moes  eet
wat in die tuin gekweek is, en hulle het rape gehaat.  Dan  eet  hulle  maar
eers al die ander kos op die bord, maar die rape lê daar vir  jou  en  loer.
En hy word al hoe groter en groter, en uiteindelik moet jy hom maar  inwurg,
en dit bederf die hele maaltyd. Toe het hy geleer: eet jou  rape  eerste  en
geniet dan die res van jou maaltyd.

Agb President, u kan gerus hierdie les leer as dit kom by Suid-Afrika en  sy
vraagstukke. U het in u toespraak Vrydag dié kos geëet  waarmee  u  gemaklik
is - die makro-ekonomie, die mikro-ekonomie en swart bemagtiging  -  maar  u
het die rape gelos - Zimbabwe, Vigs en misdaad. En daardie rape lê en  loer,
meneer, en hulle is besig om die maaltyd  van  u  presidentskap  te  bederf.
Hulle gaan nie verdwyn nie. Hulle word net groter en groter, en  u  sal  dit
moét  aanspreek.  Julle  sal  dit  na   die   verkiesing   moét   aanspreek.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Speaker,  hon  President  Mbeki,  the  late  Prof  Gawie  Cilliers  had
occasion at a function where he addressed matrics in Tzaneen, to teach  them
the worldly wisdom ``eat your turnips first''. He told how, during his  poor
childhood years in the depression, they had to  eat  turnips  grown  in  the
garden, and they hated turnips. Then they would  first  eat  all  the  other
food on the plate, but the turnips would be lying  there  looking  at  them.
And that pile of turnips would grow bigger and bigger,  and  eventually  you
would have to force it down, and it would spoil  the  whole  meal.  Then  he
learnt: eat your turnips first and then enjoy the rest of your meal.

Hon President, you would do well to learn  this  lesson  when  it  comes  to
South Africa and its issues. In your speech on Friday you ate the food  with
which you are comfortable - the macro-economy, the micro-economy  and  black
empowerment - but you left the turnips  -  Zimbabwe,  Aids  and  crime.  And
those turnips are lying there looking at you, sir,  and  they  are  spoiling
the meal of your presidency. They are not going to disappear. They are  just
getting bigger and bigger, and you will have to address this. You will  have
to address this after the election.]

It is with delight, Mr President,  that  we  have  to  recognise  that  your
theory  of  two  nations  has  made  way  for   the   more   realistic   and
reconciliatory theory of two economies. I must  agree  with  the  hon  Carol
Johnson that your speech echoes the sentiments of  one  nation.  Of  course,
the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the same, but I feel it is  much  safer
today to quote Carol Johnson. But  still,  there  is  a  problem  with  your
concept of one nation. Let me explain. [Interjections.] Jong, jy lawaai  nou
net. [All you are doing is making a noise now!]

 When my wife and I got married, the dominee said: You  will  become  one.''
After 33 years I realised which one. And this is the  question  behind  your
concept of one nation. Which one? You focused on the  absence  of  vengeance
and retaliation amongst black people. You mentioned that they were  standing
in the election queues and never uttered a word of  anger  nor  jostled  the
white person next to them. Yes, sir, that is true. But it is only  one  side
of the coin and not the only truth. It takes two to tango.
In the same queues there were white people  who  willingly  let  go  of  the
power they had for many years without the war being  lost.  People  who  did
not choose the Savimbi option, but still  give  their  everything  for  this
country. People who are not  throwing  their  toys  out  of  the  cot,  just
because the ANC is ruling the  country;  in  the  agricultural  sector,  the
financial sector, big business, small business, political parties, you  name
it, accepting this beloved  country  as  their  own,  even  under  different
circumstances. Loyal, positive citizens, taking up the situation of being  a
minority without power as a challenge to still be themselves. And  that,  Mr
President, is exactly the approach of the NA. And now you can  relax,  I  am
now actually addressing the electorate. [Laughter.]

Our slogan is: Your future is here!  A  new  party  with  hope  and  with  a
message that we believe will eventually be the  trademark  of  a  successful
South Africa; a party which indeed left behind the values  of  the  past;  a
party which did not only make cosmetic changes by  putting  an  extra  ``n''
before its name or a plus behind an old name; a  new  fresh  start,  exactly
what South Africa needs.

Meneer, die Nasionale Aksie het 'n visie vir  Suid-Afrika  -  'n  visie  wat
werklik  reg  wil  laat  geskied   aan   die   beginsel   van   eenheid   in
verskeidenheid, "unity in diversity". Eenheid.  Die  NA  sê  duidelik  Suid-
Afrika eerste. Ons erken Suid-Afrika as ons enigste vaderland en is  daartoe
verbind om saam met ander Suid-Afrikaners 'n beslissende rol te speel om  'n
beter Suid-Afrika vir almal daar te stel. Maar meneer, ons gee  gelyke  klem
aan die erkenning van die verskeidenheid van  Suid-Afrika.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Sir, the National Action has a vision for South  Africa  -  a  vision  that
will really do justice to the principle of unity in  diversity.  Unity.  The
NA clearly says South Africa first. We recognise South Africa  as  our  only
fatherland and are committed, together with other South Africans, to play  a
decisive role to establish a better South  Africa  for  all.  But,  Sir,  we
place equal emphasis on the recognition of the diversity of South Africa.]
The ANC is also preaching diversity. But the ANC's model  for  diversity  is
that  every  institution  and  every   organisation   should   reflect   the
demographics of the country. The result is that every institution looks  the
same, and that's not diversity.  Every  school  becomes  a  parallel  medium
school and that's not diversity.

Meneer, die NA erken en  respekteer  die  identiteit  en  kultuur  van  elke
gemeenskap as voorwaarde vir goeie verhoudings in  Suid-Afrika.  Die  NA  ag
kulturele sekuriteit as 'n absolute voorwaarde vir volhoubare  ontwikkeling,
vrede, harmonie en vooruitgang. 'n Geborge mens is  'n  positiewe  mens,  en
Suid-Afrika het positiewe mense  nodig.  En  hierdie  geborgenheid,  hierdie
kulturele sekuriteit, word vandag op vele  terreine  aangetas.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

Sir, the NA recognises and  respects  the  identity  and  culture  of  every
community as a condition for good relations in South Africa. The NA  regards
cultural security as an  absolute  condition  for  sustainable  development,
peace, harmony and progress. A secure  person  is  a  positive  person,  and
South Africa  needs  positive  people.  And  this  security,  this  cultural
security, is today being assailed in many spheres.]

Top-down  mergers  of  tertiary  institutions;  irresponsible   changes   of
geographical  names;  governmental  pressure  for  parallel  medium  schools
resulting in a decline of Afrikaans medium schools from  over  2  000  to  a
mere 300; everlasting affirmative action - even if it is  young  people  who
started  school  after  apartheid  had  been   abolished;   and   compulsory
multifaith religious education enforced upon children as young as  five  and
six years old - a matter taken to the Section  185  Commission  by  the  NA.
[Interjections.] We will meet you there, Minister; don't smile too soon.

 On the other hand we know that if we want others to be  serious  about  our
priorities with regard to these matters so dear to us, addressing  the  most
basic  need  of  poverty  and  the  daily  need  of  existence  is  just  as
indispensable. As long as millions of people suffer through a lack of  basic
needs, the issues so dear to us will not be high on the agenda.

We believe, Mr President,  that  the  necessity  for  development  in  South
Africa  and  the  nourishing  of  the  communities,  does  not   demand   an
everlasting clash of interests. With the right approach and mutual  respect,
and with loyalty towards this dear fatherland, the one would rather  be  the
key to the other.

The NA is devoting itself to set our country along these lines. We base  our
approach on the words of the prophet Jeremiah to the Israelites in exile  in
Babylon: "Pray for the city, seek the  peace  of  the  city  for  the  peace
thereof shall ye have peace ... '' The NA is a party devoted to  change  the
fate of South Africa according to  these  principles,  and  is  not  a  mere
calculated political business for Afrikaners.

Ons opposisierol word nie bepaal deur ons nabyheid of ons  afstand  van  die
regerende party nie,  maar  selfstandig  deur  ons  visie  vir  Suid-Afrika.
Meneer, ons word deur die ... [Our role in opposition is not  determined  by
our proximity to or our distance from the ruling  party,  but  independently
by our vision for South Africa. Sir, we are being ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr C AUCAMP:  ...  apaties  by  die  huis  bly  en  onttrek  ...  [...  stay
apathetically at home and withdraw ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member! Although  we  share
the same bench, I am afraid that's as much as I can  allow  you  to  address
the House.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Ons wil op die hoofveld speel ... [We  want  to  play  on  the
main field ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Order,  hon  member!  Order!
Thank you. Hon Minister of Sport.

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, Mr President,  Mr  Deputy
President, hon members of the House, I made a vow to  myself  that  I  would
not listen to the howling from this side. I will just keep on going on  with
what I have to do.

I wish I had more time at my disposal for reflecting  on  the  contributions
of sport to the development of our democracy during the 10 years of  freedom
that we have traversed in our country. I think it may even be  necessary  to
recall developments from 1994, from that  critical  Canon  Collins  Memorial
Lecture delivered in May 1987 by the then ANC President,  Oliver  Tambo,  in
which he announced the new strategy for the movement,  deviating  from  that
of  boycotting  and  isolating  the   apartheid   regime,   towards   giving
recognition to and transforming  those  vital  institutions  of  the  future
democratic South Africa.

Sport was one of the identified  institutions.  It  set  the  tone  for  the
various engagements between the sports movements  of  the  country  and  the
future government still in exile at that time. The role that  our  President
played was seminal in that regard. The initial meetings, some of which  were
held with you in Lusaka, Mr President, set us on an irreversible  path  that
would lead to unity and, eventually, a  dispensation  that  would  guarantee
access to and support for sport for all the country's citizens.

As a movement, the ANC knew that it held the key to  South  Africa's  future
in sport.  Leaders  of  the  apartheid  sports  structures  in  the  country
realised that too, for apart from a  few  rebel  tours  to  and  from  South
Africa, their sportspeople were  thoroughly  isolated.  They  realised  that
only the ANC had the key that could  open  doors  nationally,  continentally
and internationally. Meetings followed in Dakar and Harare, amongst  others.
The hon President was even instrumental in bringing rugby to  the  table  in
meetings in Frankfurt, Dakar and London.

The  establishment  of  the  National  Sports  Congress  in  1988  laid  the
foundation for the mass-based, democratic sports movement in  South  Africa.
For sixteen years prior to that, SANROC and  later  SACOS,  represented  the
voice of disadvantaged  sportspeople  in  our  country.  The  ANC  played  a
crucial role in securing  South  Africa's  participation  in  the  Barcelona
Olympic Games  even  before  the  first  democratic  elections.  It  was  an
indication of the magnanimity of our people, whose only wish was to see  our
nation united  through  sport.  We  continued  to  see  sport,  as  the  hon
President did during those days in Lusaka,  as  an  agent  or  catalyst  for
change in the country.

I thought it was necessary to remind the House of the cardinal and  critical
role played by the ANC, for it laid the foundation  for  a  dispensation  in
sport in our country that contributed to the  remarkable  developments  that
we have witnessed over the past ten years. In this respect, I would like  to
pay homage to my predecessor, the late Comrade Steve Tshwete, whose role  in
securing unity will be engraved in the annals  of  sports  history  of  this
country. [Applause.] He was instrumental in so many  things.  But  who  will
forget his role in organising that inaugural cricket tour to  India  and  in
sorting out disputes during the unity process. He deserved his nickname,  Mr
Fixit. I dedicate this speech to him and others like him, foot soldiers  who
gave unselfishly, to ensure that ordinary  South  Africans  should  enjoy  a
fair dispensation in sport and, indeed, in everyday life.

People like Kedi Tshoma, Khaya Majola, Jomo  King,  Ben  Tengimfene,  Rosina
Mogola, Jimmy Summers, Bill Jardine and others spring to  mind  immediately.
Through their intervention, and that of the ANC, we were able to secure  and
successfully host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in  South  Africa.  We  could  so
easily have ignored  that  event  in  the  light  of  terrible  and  serious
incidents perpetrated against our people, but remained true to our word  and
sacrificed the losses that we suffered and forgave in favour of  the  longer
term benefits that we knew the pursuit of our mission held in store for  our
country and all its people.

We  recognised  that  sport  was  a  platform  for  nation   building,   for
inculcating pride and nationalism, and for promoting social cohesion.
Ons toewyding was 'n teken  van  ons  grootmoedigheid,  onselfsugtigheid  en
bereidwilligheid om die toekoms van al ons land se burgers eerste  te  stel.
Sport sou bydra tot 'n rooskleurige toekoms, het ons geglo en  ons  glo  nog
steeds so. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Our  dedication  was  a  sign  of  our   magnanimity,   unselfishness   and
willingness to put the future of all the citizens of our country  first.  We
believed and still  believe  that  sport  would  contribute  to  a  brighter
future.]

Apart from winning the Rugby World Cup,  we  successfully  hosted  the  1996
African Cup of Nations tournament  and  in  the  process  were  crowned  the
champions of Africa. We hosted the 1997  world  championships  in  athletics
and the 1999 All Africa  Games,  from  which  we  also  emerged  as  overall
winners. More recently we hosted the Cricket World Cup and  the  President's
Cup in golf and firmly proved to the world, our capabilities  as  presenters
of major, international sports events.
We have participated in three major, international sports  events.  We  have
participated in three consecutive Olympic Games, Paralympic  Games  and  the
Commonwealth Games. Our flag has flown proudly in many stadiums  across  the
globe and in other sport events worldwide. The fact that we made it  to  the
finals of  two  consecutive  Soccer  World  Cups,  speaks  volumes  for  the
character of our players. Our individual athletes have  been  proud  bearers
of our  magnificent  standard,  making  it  one  of  the  most  recognisable
national flags in the world. I  would  like  to  reiterate  that  all  these
opportunities were made possible through the  intervention  of  the  ANC-led
Government.

We achieved a lot over the past decade. We have spent much of the first  ten
years of  our  democracy  in  sport,  laying  the  basis  for  an  equitable
dispensation  in  which  the  major  focus  was  ensuring  access   to   the
institution of sport by all South African citizens.  We  started  by  giving
some order to it by drafting a White Paper on Sports and  Recreation  -  the
roadmap that we believed would put us on course  for  a  flourishing  sports
dispensation. We inherited a situation in which sport was run on an  ad  hoc
basis.

In the state of the nation address, the  President  indicated  that  we  now
have policies in place  that  will  allow  us  to  deliver  on  our  various
mandates. I believe that the same is true for sport and recreation in  which
the White Paper, our policy document, is as relevant today as  it  was  when
it was first launched six years ago. It is  a  good  document.  We  followed
that up with legislation that  started  to  give  substance  to  our  policy
directions. I must still steer one piece of legislation  through  Parliament
that will give the Minister of Sport and Recreation the right  to  intervene
in disputes and problems in sport, without crossing the  line  in  terms  of
the protocols of international federations.

We also tried to create the physical environment in which sportspeople  from
all walks of life participate. We determined  in  1995,  for  example,  that
just to eradicate the backlog of facilities  in  disadvantaged  areas  would
require an investment of some R5 billion by 2005.

Dit gee 'n eenvoudige aanduiding van hoe apartheid ons land  skade  berokken
het. Ek wonder soms hoe ver gevorderd ons sou  wees,  ook  op  sportterrein,
sonder daardie afskuwelike  stelsel.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

This gives us a simple indication of the damage caused  to  the  country  by
apartheid. I sometimes wonder how far we would have progressed, also in  the
field of sport, without that horrible system.]

Amongst numerous and disparate needs in our  country,  we  have  still  been
able to invest some R500 million by the end of the  2003-04  financial  year
and a further R140 million in 2004-05 to counteract the problem.

I would be the first to admit that we still have a considerable way  to  go.
We cannot expect our children to develop golf skills  on  the  pavements  of
our townships or learn to swim in dams and forests. We have to provide  them
with the requisite facilities, equipment, teachers and coaches. In the  past
three years alone, we have built and upgraded more than  250  basic,  multi-
purpose sports facilities. We have  established  community  councils  around
each of them, that have been empowered to manage and  sustain  them  and  we
have trained our people to establish and  run  sports  clubs.  I  personally
handed over many of these facilities to community leaders and have  observed
the pride on the faces  of  the  residents  -  the  rural  people,  in  many
instances, who at last, have been afforded the dignity of playing sport  and
exhibiting their talents on decent surfaces with appropriate equipment.

Xa sisakha la mabala, senza igalelo kwiphulo lokulwa nendlala. Sisusa  ikati
eziko ngokuthi sidale amathuba emisebenzi exesha  elide  nelifutshane.  Kule
minyaka  mithathu  idlulileyo  sidale  imisebenzi  engama-10  000,  kuba  xa
kusakhiwa  naxa  kudlalwa,  bayakwazi   oomama   basezilalini   ukuba   baze
kuthengisa  oko  banakho,  ukuzama  ukususa  ikati  eziko.  (Translation  of

[By  building  these  sport  facilities,  we  are  contributing  to  poverty
alleviation.  We  are  fighting  hunger  by  creating  short  and  long-term
employment. In the last three years, we have  created  about  10  000  jobs.
When builders are working, and when there are sporting events,  local  women
get the chance to sell their goods, so as to earn money to buy food.]

By the  same  token,  we  supported  and  assisted  the  Cricket  World  Cup
organising committee to  run  a  successful  tournament.  We  trained  sport
administrators, managers, coaches and officials with  our  partners  in  the
sports commission.  I  believe  that  we  have  performed  well  within  the
confines of the competing priorities. Lots of things still need to be  done.
We have a national academy that Cabinet has  given  us  the  right  to  run.
Within the next  financial  year,  the  national  academy  will  be  up  and
running.

We have also  created  opportunities  through  which  to  identify  talented
athletes. We will be launching a mass  participation  programme.  Again,  in
all of these, I must thank the hon President for his continued  interest  in
the development of sport and recreation, for batting for us in our quest  to
secure more resources to  promote  our  activities.  I  recall  vividly,  Mr
President, at the Presidential Sports Awards function  at  Tuynhuys,  where,
upon  returning  from  a  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government   meeting   in
Australia, you insisted that we should invest more  substantially  in  sport
in our country. I am convinced that those comments  prompted  MINCOMBUD  and
the National Treasury, who I  thank,  to  consider  our  requests  for  more
resources  favourably,  to  ensure  that  our  mass  participation  and  our
national sports academy, amongst others, can be realised.

There are many challenges that we must tackle and overcome.  We  must  build
more facilities. I want us to address one thing  quickly.  You  spoke  about
the weaknesses in the management and the efficient  running  of  sports.  Mr
President, I can assure you that we will make sure that there  are  adequate
programmes to look at those issues - to consolidate the  unity  process,  to
transform sports structures and to eliminate those weaknesses that you  have
identified. You have given  an  order,  and  it  will  be  carried  through.
[Interjections.]

We are working very hard for the World Cup Bid for 2010. We can't be  judged
only by the participation of the team in the Cup  of  Nations.  We  will  be
judged by what we put in front of the technical committee of  FIFA.  We  are
working very hard as Government to make sure that we do that.  We  will  not
fail FIFA when they announce on  15  May  that  the  host  country  will  be
Afrique de Sud. [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Chairperson, Mr President, Deputy President, hon  Ministers
and hon members, the struggle for the ideal of the liberation of  women  was
born in the lap of the liberation movement.

This was endorsed  by  the  1954  women's  charter,  which  called  for  the
enfranchisement of men and women of all races. It was about the equality  of
employment  opportunities;  equal  pay  for  equal  work;  equal  rights  in
relation to property, marriage and children; and the  removal  of  all  laws
and customs that denied women such equality.

Whether one likes it or not, change has occurred in  the  past  five  to  10
years. As women, more especially women from the rural areas, our lives  have
now been changed for the better by what  our  ANC-led  Government  has  done
during the 10 years of democracy.

Water is now within walking distance from our homes. We have electricity  in
our homes  and  telephones  in  the  rural  areas.  Beyond  any  doubt,  the
apartheid government was not committed to making the lives of women  better.
But now, as women, we know that  our  lives  have  improved.  Even  domestic
workers can now be registered  as  workers  and  a  minimum  wage  has  been
legislated for them. [Applause.]

It is African women, more especially rural women,  who  suffered  more  than
any other group of people and have borne the brunt  of  oppression  in  this
country. We have all met this with patience and courage. Above all, we  have
remained human. It is because of our patience  and  courage  that  the  late
Comrade Oliver Tambo had this to say  at  a  rally  where  the  ANC  Women's
League was relaunched in Durban, in August 1990, and I quote:


  I am asking you to take action to help ensure  that  the  future  of  our
  country matches the aspirations for which our  people,  and  particularly
  our women, have struggled for so long.

When I speak about the women's struggle, it brings me back to 1957 when  the
women of Zeerust in the North West province, struggled  against  pass  laws.
They struggled and fought because they did not want  to  carry  pass  books.
The women in Sekhukhune also fought for  their  husbands'  cattle  when  the
commissioner ruled that  African  people  could  not  have  more  than  five
cattle.  It  was  the  women  who  fought  that  battle,  and  they  did  so
successfully.

This was the reason why Comrade Oliver Tambo  said  that.  The  commissioner
who came to tell the people about  the  cattle  culling  had  to  run  away,
leaving his assistant, who was a black man, behind.

Basadi ba ne ba ntshetsa botlhoko jwa pelo mo go bona, gonne  ba  ne  ba  sa
batle gore dikgomo tsa bona di kgaolwe. Ba ne ba itse gore bana ba  bona  ba
tlaa tlhoka ma[s]i. [The women took out their anger on  them,  because  they
did not want their cattle to be culled. They knew that their children  would
need milk.]

In my life I have seen a lot of hardship. I remember that on 12 May  1969  I
was detained. A lot of other people  -  members  of  the  ANC  -  were  also
detained. The ANC was still banned and it was said that we  were  furthering
the aims of a banned organisation. We were taken to Pretoria.

Many people died at that time. A man called Caleb Mayekiso,  who  came  from
New Brighton, was one of the people who died there. Again, in 1976  we  were
detained during the school uprisings.  Each  time  my  husband  and  I  were
detained, we were forced to leave our children behind, who were  then  still
very young. The first born was nine years old, and she is the  one  who  had
to cook for her brothers.

When we were detained in November during the uprisings, my husband  died  in
detention. To rub salt into the wound, I was not even  allowed  to  go  home
for his burial. They  refused  me  permission,  and  he  was  buried  by  my
children and relatives. I was only released after the funeral. That  is  why
Comrade Tambo said what he said at the rally I spoke about.

It is because of  that  repression  that  we  as  women  steadfastly  worked
towards the realisation of  a  nonracial,  democratic  South  Africa,  which
celebrates 10 years of freedom  this  year.  Women  with  potential  are  no
longer just housewives, but have opportunities opened for their  advancement
in all sectors of life, eg in Government and the industries.

These changes to democratise our country were achieved because we  as  women
acted and organised ourselves to bring about  a  change  in  attitude  among
those men and women who perpetuated that situation.

This reminds me of the time when I was a little  girl.  My  granny  used  to
tell us stories. She once told us that when the  moon  is  full,  dogs  bark
until it goes down. They bark because they think they can get to  the  moon,
to tear it up and eat it. But when the moon goes down, they stop barking.

I want to address myself to the President of our  country:  never  mind  how
much the dogs bark, just  be  like  the  moon!  [Applause.]  Do  not  worry,
because they will never get to you even if they try. [Applause.]

It is, therefore, not surprising that, despite  all  the  hardships  he  was
subjected to, Chief Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I  think  one
day our President will also get that prize.  [Applause.]  In  accepting  his
prize, he said:


  I am recognised, however, that in my country, South Africa, the spirit of
  peace is subject to some of the severest tensions known to man. For  that
  reason South Africa has been and continues to be in the  focus  of  world
  attention.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member,  your  speaking
time has expired. [Applause.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: A pula e ne. Pula! [Thank you. Thank you!]

HON MEMBERS: A e ne! [Thank you!]

Mr W P DOMAN: Deputy Chairperson, hon President and members, I want  to  say
to the member who spoke before me that a dog can also warn you  of  trouble.
We  have  a  delivery  problem,  a  delivery   crisis,   in   our   country.
[Interjections.] One example: Last month,  after  the  schools  opened,  the
Limpopo education department instructed schools to  retrieve  all  Grade  10
reports and adjust the marks upwards according to a sliding  scale.  Thirty-
six percent must now  become  50%  and  so  on.  [Interjections.]  Why  this
exercise? Because the education department was not ready with the  Grade  10
to 12 curriculum and learners were forced to adapt to  the  old  curriculum,
and failed in droves.

It put the schools two weeks back to rectify the situation and thousands  of
learners will in the next and very important final  phase  of  their  school
career suffer because of this lack of delivery. [Interjections.]

Prof Lawrence Schlemmer writes:


  It has become conventional wisdom that although Government  policies  are
  frequently very sound and sophisticated, their implementation is  equally
  frequently disappointing or deficient.

Prof Louwrens Pretorius says that it is  accepted  by  experienced  analysts
that the gap between policy and delivery is not  only  a  delivery  problem,
but also that any policy is defective if it fails to assume and  predict  in
advance that there will be serious problems of implementation capacity.

Pretorius further emphasises that in South Africa today we are  particularly
prone to evaluate the policy products  of  Government  in  terms  of  rather
virtuous checklists of criteria such as equity, empowerment,  participation,
etc.

No wonder Prof Jonathan Jansen has observed that  our  policy-makers  regard
their  public  policies  as  products  to  be  admired  on  their  intrinsic
ideological  merits,  with  cavalier   disregard   for   what   the   actual
consequences may be. [Interjections.] As an educationalist he must have  had
education policies in mind. [Interjections.]

Minister Kader Asmal is one of the best exponents of virtuous goals who  has
wrapped his policies in self-congratulation and hence in  political  armour.
[Interjections.] Their design flaws, however, impede policy  implementation,
and  the  nemesis  of  unintended   consequences   often   overshadows   the
consequences planned in these policies. [Interjections.]

Looking back, the education reforms  of  this  Government  have  led  to  an
exodus from the profession of South  Africa's  best  teachers  and  a  rapid
growth  in  private  education,  which  has  robbed  the  state  system   of
significant income flows. [Interjections.] All the Government  has  to  show
is greater access, which would have been achieved in  any  event,  but  poor
quality. [Interjections.]

Ná sy aanstelling het minister Asmal op 27 Julie 1999 nege beloftes  gemaak.
Nou, vyf jaar later, het hy nog nie  een  daarvan  ten  volle  nagekom  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [After his appointment Minister Asmal made  nine  promises
on 27 July 1999. Now, five years later, he has not kept one  of  them  fully
yet. [Interjections.]]

Firstly, the back of  illiteracy  among  adults  and  youths  has  not  been
broken. Secondly, many  schools  have  become,  not  centres  of  peace  and
stability, but of ill discipline by learners,  violence,  sexual  abuse  and
continued  poor  performance  by  too  many  educators.  Thirdly,   physical
degradation in  schools  has  not  ended.  Vandalism  of  schools  continues
unabated.

Vierdens, uitkomsgebaseerde onderwys is deur  die  Minister  aangekondig  as
die groot redder om aktiewe leer te bevorder. Nie alleen  moes  dit  haastig
geskrap word nie, maar derduisende leerders  het  deur  hierdie  eksperiment
skade opgedoen vir die res van hulle loopbaan.  Vyf,  die  gehalte  van  die
onderwyserpoel het eerder afgeneem. So kan ek voortgaan.

Watter invloed het die NNP nou hierop? Nêrens blyk die NNP se versaking  van
sy opposisierol duideliker as in die onderwys nie. In 2002 het die  NNP  nog
teen die  onderwysbegroting  gestem  en  die  agb  Geldenhuys  het  as  rede
aangevoer    dat     die     Minister     nie     veeltalige,     Afrikaanse
hoëronderwysinstellings finansieel vergoed nie. Niks  het  hieraan  verander
nie, maar verlede jaar stem hulle vir die begroting. [Tussenwerpsels.]

In 2002 beveg die NNP nog wetgewing wat die magte van beheerliggame  wegneem
om nuwe onderwysers te kan  aanstel.  Verlede  jaar  word  beheerliggame  se
magte  ten  opsigte  van  die  ekstra  vergoeding  van  onderwysers   verder
afgewater, en die NNP stem jou waarlik ten  gunste  van  hierdie  ingryping!
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Uit die onderwys blyk dit die NNP is op 'n glybaan en teen die tyd  dat  die
verkiesing  kom,  sal  hulle   netjies   in   die   ANC   se   poel   plons.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Daar is darem  ook  goeie  nuus!  In  die  bespreking  van  die  Aanvullende
Begroting in die Portefeuljekomitee oor Finansies einde verlede jaar  kondig
Minister Asmal aan dat onderwysers wat pakkette  geneem  het,  tog  weer  in
diens  geneem  sal  word.  Toe  los  die  Minister  egter  'n  bom.  Hierdie
onderwysers sal egter in die swart  townships  en  afgeleë  platteland  moet
gaan werk. Hy sê uitdruklik  die  Kaapse  Vlakte  word  hiervan  uitgesluit!
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Fourthly, outcomes-based education was proclaimed by  the  Minister  to  be
the great saviour to promote active learning. Not only did  it  have  to  be
scrapped hastily, but thousands of learners have suffered harm for the  rest
of their careers because of this experiment. Fifthly,  the  quality  of  the
pool of teachers declined instead. I can continue in this vein.

What influence does  the  NNP  now  have  on  this?  Nowhere  is  the  NNP's
forsaking of its opposition role clearer than in education. In 2002 the  NNP
still voted against the education budget and the hon Geldenhuys gave as  the
reason  for  this  that  the  Minister  was  not  financially   compensating
multilingual,  Afrikaans  institutions  of  higher  education.  Nothing  has
changed in this regard but last year they voted in  favour  of  the  budget.
[Interjections.]

In 2002 the NNP still opposed legislation which  deprived  governing  bodies
of the power to appoint new educators. Last  year  the  power  of  governing
bodies in respect of the extra remuneration of educators  was  watered  down
even further, and the NNP actually voted in  favour  of  this  intervention!
[Interjections.]
From education it would appear that the NNP is on a slide and  by  the  time
the elections come around, they will splash  neatly  into  the  ANC's  pool.
[Interjections.]

However,  there  is  also  some  good  news!  In  the  discussion   of   the
Supplementary Appropriation in the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  at  the
end of last year, Minister Asmal announced that  educators  that  had  taken
voluntary severance packages,  would  in  fact  be  reappointed.   Then  the
Minister dropped a bomb, however. These educators would,  however,  have  to
go and work in the black  townships  and  remote  rural  areas.  He  clearly
stated that the Cape Flats was excluded from this!]

Mr President, in the light of your repeated commitment to  South  Africa  as
one nation we call on you  to  intervene.  This  is  blatant  discrimination
against  the  coloured  schools  and   population!   [Interjections.]   That
Minister's  ideological  smugness  is  going  to  rob  South  Africans   ...
[Interjections.] You said it! You said it in the  Chamber  above  this  one!
[Interjections.] The Minister's ideological smugness is going to  rob  South
Africans, and in this instance from  the  coloured  community,  of  quality,
mostly Afrikaans-speaking teachers. And the people on  the  Cape  Flats  are
Afrikaans-speaking. South Africa  deserves  better.  [Interjections.]  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D J SITHOLE: Chairperson, his Excellency the President of  South  Africa,
the hon Deputy  President,  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers  present,  hon
members, it is significant that today we are discussing  the  state  of  the
nation address that signifies the end of the term of  this  Parliament,  but
which sets a process in motion for the victory of  the  ANC  in  the  coming
election.

This debate comes at a time when the country  is  celebrating  a  decade  of
freedom - 10 years of freedom from  apartheid,  racial  discrimination,  and
the denial of human rights to the African majority and  blacks  in  general.
It is difficult  for  those  who  enjoyed  the  benefits  of  apartheid  and
participated in prolonging its life to continue  preserving  the  privileges
it gave them over time  and  to  understand  why  the  ANC  holds  dear  the
creation of a stable, democratic and prosperous continent.

They have refused to understand - and they will probably not  even  make  an
effort to accept - that white domination is a thing of the past.  They  will
oppose us when we seek  to  articulate  the  plight  of  the  poor  of  this
continent. They will complain when we contribute to the African  continental
struggle for peace, democracy and prosperity.

They will complain about the time and money we spend on  supporting  efforts
to build a continent that is  peaceful,  democratic  and  respects  people's
rights. They will go around preaching hopelessness  and  despair  among  our
people in an effort to divorce South Africans from other Africans.

They will  manipulate  genuine  fears  and  the  desperation  of  the  white
community in pursuance of their ill-conceived ambition of the 20th  century,
which was that of making Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, a fifth  province  of  the
Union. This assimilation failed then, but  the  white  apartheid  regime  in
South Africa and their counterpart in Rhodesia went  ahead  nevertheless  to
shape the economic structure of Zimbabwe in such a way  that  it  became  an
undeclared fifth province of the Union.

In pursuit of this policy  of  annexation,  the  apartheid  regime  deployed
troops in support of the minority regime in Rhodesia.  They  lost  the  war,
and now they want to use this democratic Government to advance the cause  of
their apartheid forefathers.   We will not do it. We  will  not  do  it.  We
will continue to send our boys in uniform to preserve and defend  the  peace
on the continent.

It is true that we will continue to equip our army to be able  to  meet  the
challenges of their new responsibilities  on  the  continent.  It  would  be
wrong for anyone, sitting in the  comfort  of  the  opposition  benches,  to
refuse those who  ask  for  help  to  disarm  armed  rebels  using  inferior
weapons.

As we modernise this House to make our lives and functions easy, we must  do
the same for the boys we send into the bush to defend democracy. The  amount
of damage they caused this country ...

Mrs S M CAMERER: [Inaudible.]

Mr D J SITHOLE: Of course, Sheila, this is not part of your  concern,  hence
you moved from the NP. [Interjections.]

They have, on a number of occasions, been  proved  wrong.  This  Government,
with its own overwhelming majority, has not deviated from its  programme  to
fight poverty and create peace amongst the people.

The vision of this Government is the rebirth  of  Africa.  Working  together
with  others,  we  will  continue  to  promote  peace,   regional   economic
integration, growth and development and strengthen the pillars of  democracy
on  the  continent.  We  will  put  resources  into  developing  progressive
leadership and the principles of good  governance  in  our  region  and  the
continent as a whole.
We have committed ourselves since 1994 to working for a better Africa and  a
better world in order to promote  collective  and  multilateral  actions  to
meet global challenges. This commitment was elaborated on by  the  President
on 4 February 2000 when he addressed this House. He said:


  As much as the rest of the world stood with us as we fought  to  end  the
  system of apartheid, which struggle brought about the announcements  that
  were made from this rostrum as the apartheid parliament opened  10  years
  ago, so  do  we  have  an  obligation  ourselves  to  contribute  to  the
  construction of a better world for all humanity.


  We should aim to make a meaningful contribution in  this  regard  because
  with regard to all the important objectives we  have  to  pursue,  at  no
  point during our entire history have we ever been as well  placed  as  we
  are to meet the challenges that confront us. From this,  we  cannot  walk
  away.

Yes, from this we cannot walk away. We cannot  walk  away  because  our  own
destiny as a nation, as opposed to those who want  us  to  believe  that  we
South Africans are not part of the African continent, is  tied  to  that  of
our region and Africa as a  whole.  Hence,  the  declaration.  President,  I
agree, we cannot walk away from that task.

We  will  dedicate  more  resources  to  ensure  that  we  contribute   more
effectively  to  the  efforts  on  our  continent  to  prevent  and  resolve
conflict. We will seek not to dictate to people what  to  do,  but  to  work
with them. When we contributed to resolving the Lockerbie  standoff  between
the West and Libya, everybody rejoiced in  the  success,  but  no  one  said
anything about the nature of diplomacy used.

As we continue to score successes in building peace in the DRC, Burundi  and
other areas, no one stops to ask the  question:  "What  diplomacy  is  being
applied?" If I am correct - which I  think  I  am  -  it  is  not  megaphone
diplomacy they are advocating in the Zimbabwean situation.

Comrade O R Tambo articulated this 36 years ago when he addressed the  South
African situation. He said:


  We in the ANC have always believed that the honourable  task  of  freeing
  South Africa rested firmly with the people of  South  Africa  themselves.
  The task of international organisations  was  to  assist  the  liberation
  movement. This still remains the fundamental position of  principle  from
  which all international actions should be appraised.

That indicates the commitment to working with people, and not coming with  a
road map that you designed in your boardroom to dictate to people what  they
must do. [Applause.] Therefore, they must allow Zimbabweans to  be  assisted
to find solutions to their political situation and accept  that  it  is  not
possible to implement failed attempts to annex it.

It is, however, understandable why they are aggrieved. It is because we  are
not listening to or taking instructions from those who in  their  upbringing
were taught  to  look  down  on  Africans'  ability  to  find  solutions  to
problems. It is they who have a superior colour who must  provide  solutions
to these people in executing their God-given  right  to  lead  Africans  and
blacks in general. As the ANC continues to involve ordinary  people  in  the
governance of their lives, this sends shock waves down the  spine  of  those
who are used to Bantustan power.

Before I take my seat, I want to conclude with a  critical  quote  from  the
hero of our struggle, Comrade O R Tambo,  when  addressing  the  UN  Special
Committee Against Apartheid in 1968 - that is exactly 36 years  ago  -  with
the hope that this will provide clarification to those who seek  to  portray
the ANC as nothing but an organisation  that  does  not  care.  This  quote,
President, is from 36 years ago, exactly to the year in which I was born:


  By the year 1961, it had reached a  level  which  led  the  ANC  and  the
  oppressed population of South Africa to decide on armed struggle  as  the
  next phase of the fight for freedom. That decision which, it can  now  be
  said, will always constitute an important chapter in any analysis of  the
  current political situation in the whole  of  Southern  Africa,  was  not
  taken lightly. The massive loss of life it entailed, the  destruction  of
  property, its implication for individual African independent  states  and
  for peace and security of the whole of Africa and the world were not lost
  to the ANC and its leaders.

That is what we are saying today, and that  is  what  we  continue  to  say.
Together we can do and we will do more, better. A better life for all  South
Africans and a better life for our people. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, hon President, hon members,  after  nearly  17
years as a member of Parliament, during the last 10 years of  which  I  have
been privileged to serve as a member of a fully democratic  institution,  it
is an honour to participate in this debate, marking the  last  parliamentary
session of our first 10 years of democracy.

It is a historic moment to savour among many historic moments  in  the  past
14 years that I have  been  fortunate  enough  to  be  part  of  since  that
February day  when  my  political  leader  and  hero  at  the  time,  former
President F W de Klerk, spoke in this House at the opening of Parliament  to
herald the dawn of democracy.

The President in his speech on  Friday,  referred  to  27  April  1994,  the
fulfilment of De Klerk's announcement, when he said ``black and white  stood
together, acting voluntarily for the first time in our history, together  to
give birth to a new social order''.

At that time there was no doubt that De Klerk was  the  acknowledged  leader
of the whites who stood in those queues  to  vote,  as  well  as  the  black
minority communities. He had a clear mandate from those communities to  take
his party into a Government of National Unity with the ANC  majority  for  a
constitutionally mandated period of at least five years, with  the  goal  of
national reconciliation and nation-building.

Sadly, soon after that, things went  wrong.  De  Klerk  lost  his  political
magic touch. He betrayed his supporters and the South African electorate  by
leaving the Government of National Unity  in  1996.  [Interjections.]  Eight
years later, in an interview in Rapport - you will be sure to be  interested
in the jobs, hon member - last Sunday, De Klerk claimed that  that  decision
was not only his and that the NP did back him up.  This  is  a  very  skewed
version of events. I know because I was there. Every senior  member  of  the
NP executive, every Cabinet member, myself  included,  made  an  impassioned
plea for him to stay in President Mandela's Government. [Interjections.]  We
argued that this was what people  wanted,  what  we  were  mandated  by  the
voters to do.

I remember two exceptions, ie Marthinus van  Schalkwyk,  recently  described
by my hon leader as the ANC's weakest link and David Malatsi,  now  awaiting
trial on corruption charges. De Klerk  then  held  us  to  ransom  with  his
threat to resign as the NP leader if we didn't go along  with  him,  leaving
us little option. The bottom dropped out of my  political  world  that  day;
there was total disillusionment. The electorate too showed  its  displeasure
by drastically reducing its support for the NNP in the 1999 election.

However, times change and the requirements  of  the  Mbeki  Presidency  were
different. Now the ANC was a huge party with a rampant majority, where  many
of its functionaries and acolytes were abusing the levers of power and  were
involved in self-enrichment and corrupt practices on a huge  scale,  as  has
been seen in the aftermath  of  the  arms  deal  with  the  Shaik,  Yengeni,
Madikizela-Mandela  and   many   other   court   cases,   not   to   mention
maladministration and failure to deliver on a huge scale. [Interjections.]

What our constituency wanted in 2000, was a strong  vocal  opposition  which
could hold the Government to account. Due to the initiative of the  then  DP
leader, the hon Tony Leon, they got what they wanted with  the  amalgamation
of the DP and the NNP ahead of the local government elections  in  2000.  On
the ticket of strengthening multiparty democracy, the  electorate  gave  the
new DA a ringing endorsement with 23% of the total votes. [Interjections.]

However, once again the South African electorate was betrayed  by  the  NNP,
backed behind the scenes by De Klerk, who had  sadly  lost  touch  with  his
constituency. Once again the mandate given by the  voters  was  conveniently
ignored by the NNP when it tucked itself  under  the  wing  of  the  ANC  to
ensure that party's hegemony in the Western Cape and for the sake of  a  few
posts. [Interjections.]

South Africa deserves better than this and  on  14  April  our  constituency
will give the DA a renewed mandate. [Applause.]  In  his  speech  on  Friday
President Mbeki rightly looked  back  over  the  past  10  years  ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr R D PIETERSE:
  Wit vrese vir 'n swart regering; hoe hoër 'n boom, hoe meer kritiek.
  Maar daar is u nog steeds die hoogste met 'n hoë profiel.
  Met u as die hoogste van alle bome, met jou lang wortels wat  uitreik  na
  ander bome, maar nog steeds na u opkyk.
  Geen vrees of apart-rassisme, want die ander wat u gehelp het, groei.
  Met minder bome wat apart is, het die reënboog meer kleurvol geraak.
  Met die genade van die Here hoop ons dat u nog jare by ons sal bly.
  Dankie, Thabo Mbeki.

Agb President, hierdie gedig is  geskryf  en  opgedra  aan  u  deur  Britney
Garies, 'n graad 12-student aan die Gerhard du  Plessis  Hoër  Skool,  ná  u
staatsrede, Vrydag, 6 Februarie. Die mense van Langeberg sê vir u dankie.

Agb Speaker, agb lede van die Parlement, waar kry ons 'n land waar  eertydse
aartsvyande nou om dieselfde tafel sit en die toekoms van ons pragtige  land
en sy mense bespreek, beplan en selfs help uitvoer?  Watter  land  se  mense
vergewe so maklik wanneer sy nasionale spanne soos sokker, krieket en  rugby
swak vaar in internasionale kompetisies?

Maar laat ons dadelik begin werk om te verbeter en te wen by  die  volgende.
As 'n land is ons vasberade om bo uit te kom en ek glo ook dat ons die 2010-
Wêreldbekerbod sal kry. Ons het die kapasiteit, ons het die  infrastruktuur,
die tegnologie, ensovoorts, om hierdie toernooi suksesvol aan te bied.

Agb lede, in 1994 het ons 'n regering geërf wat swartmense verhinder het  om
wetenskap en tegnologie te studeer.  Wanneer  ons  as  kinders  standerd  10
voltooi het, kon jy seker wees daardie kind word  óf  'n  onderwyser  óf  'n
predikant. As 'n seun standerd agt voltooi het, het jy weer geweet  hy  word
'n ambagsman - dis nou 'n messelaar, 'n skrynwerker of 'n verwer.

Die land se regering wat ons geërf het, was gestruktureer  om  die  land  se
militêre masjinerie tegnologies aan die gang te hou. En nie lank  terug  nie
het die land juis van sy militêre masjinerie ingespan om aangrensende  lande
aan  te  val.  Baie  van  daardie  mense  kom  oor  die  grens  omdat  hulle
geleenthede soek  en  dan  behandel  ons  hulle  soos  vyande;  ons  ly  aan
xenofobie.

Tog doen ons nie dieselfde nie, selfs nadat blankes Chris Hani vermoor  het.
As ons dan nou oor xenofobie beskik, waarom pas ons dan  nie  dieselfde  toe
nie? Net wanneer dit swart Suider-Afrikaners is, dan raak ons  histeries  en
sê hulle moet terug na hul lande toe. Ons  moet  somtyds  net  stilstaan  en
dink en vra waarvandaan ons kom dat ons nou dié vryheid geniet.

In 1994 begin die ANC-regering om hierdie prentjie te verander deur van  die
militêre fasiliteite te omskep tot voordeel van  almal;  nie  net  in  Suid-
Afrika nie, maar in Afrika. President Mbeki, in die jaar  2000  sê  u  in  u
staatsrede dat spesiale aandag geskenk moet word  aan  die  kritiese  tekort
aan wiskunde-, wetenskap- en taalonderwysers, sowel as  die  nuwe  eise  van
inligtingstegnologie.

Minister Asmal en sy departement het dadelik aan die werk gespring en  vroeg
in 2001 die nasionale strategie  vir  wiskunde,  wetenskap  en  tegnologiese
opleiding geloods. 'n Deel van hierdie  strategie  fokus  op  vroue  en  die
platteland. Ons kan terugkyk en  met  trots  sê  'n  merkbare  en  positiewe
verandering het plaasgevind.

Laat my toe om al die betrokkenes te bedank: die Departement  van  Onderwys,
die onderwysers, die dosente, en veral die studente en hul ouers. Hulle  het
skouer aan die wiel gesit; hulle het harder gewerk en daarom  kan  ons  sien
dat verlede jaar se matriekuitslae nie slegs 'n  verbetering  was  nie  maar
ook wat daardie vakke betref, naamlik wiskunde en wetenskap.  Dus  sien  ons
dat die ANC-regering sy vinger  op  die  pols  het  en  die  hersiening  sal
toepas, indien nodig.

Ons het navorsing en ontwikkeling rakende  elektronika  begin  doen  om  die
elektroniese media te bevry en vandag sien ons dat meer van  ons  mense  nou
toegang het om na programme van hul keuse en taal te kyk,  as  ooit  tevore.
Destyds is een klopjag na die ander op gemeenskapsradiostasies uitgevoer  in
'n poging om ons mense stil te maak en te verhoed om na  hul  eie  programme
te luister. Vra maar vir Bush Radio hier in die Kaap.

Vandag is daar meer as 40 gemeenskapsradiostasies en die  einde  hiervan  is
nog nie in sig nie. Ons het ook onlangs die  MDDA  gestig  om  te  sorg  vir
ondersteuning, onder andere vir die  gemeenskapsradiostasies.  Natuurlik  is
dit nie genoeg nie en meer moet nog gedoen word  en  ek  glo  dat  die  ANC-
regering verbind is om meer te doen en sommer vinniger ook.

Maar dit kan nie alleen gedoen word nie en slegs wanneer  die  publiek,  die
privaatsektor en die regering saamwerk in daardie  vennootskap,  in  daardie
kontrak, kan dit gebeur. Ons moet 'n vennootskap  vorm  met  die  mense  van
Suid-Afrika, insluitende die privaatsektor, om werk  te  skep  en  saam  die
grense van armoede terug te stoot.

So, in daardie vennootskap is dit belangrik dat  ons  moet  betaal  vir  ons
dienste gelewer, ons sal beskerm wat ons  s'n  is  -  die  telefone  en  die
radiostasies -  ons moet dit beskerm teen misdadigers, teen vandaliste.

President Mbeki, in 1996 in u beroemde "I am  an  African"-toespraak  het  u
baie mense gedwing tot 'n diepgaande selfondersoek. Baie agb  lede  het  oor
hul voete geval om dit te kom beaam, selfs dié wat nie  geweet  het  waaroor
dit gaan nie. 'n Vriend van my antwoord só daarop:


  Ek is gebore in 'n karoodorpie genaamd Zoar, skoolgegaan  en  grootgeword
  daar, myself in die Kaapse Vlakte begewe, terwyl ek gehoop  het  vir  "'n
  job", Manenberg om presies te wees. Ja, ek praat Afrikaans, my moedertaal
  met 'n "slang", maar ek is 'n "African", want ek vra nie wat my land  vir
  my doen nie, maar wat ek vir  my  land  kan  doen.  Natuurlik  is  ek  'n
  "African".

Agb lede, Mark Shuttleworth het sy  plafon  in  sy  lewe  geïdentifiseer  en
suksesvol aangepak met  die  hulp  van  tegnologie.  Trots  het  elke  Suid-
Afrikaner hul vlaggies geswaai, na die televisieskerm gewys en  gesê:  "Daar
is ons vlag.  Daar  is  Suid-Afrika  se  vlag  wat  hoog  in  die  hemelruim
rondvlieg."

Wie kan vergeet  van  mnr  Velani,  eens  'n  gewone  veewagter  en  dan  'n
amptenaar van die Nasionale Parkeraad wat ook sy plafon aangedurf  het:  die
berg Everest? Die traan van trots wat menige van ons weggevee  het  toe  mnr
Velani die Suid-Afrikaanse vlag om sy skouers laat wapper het, terwyl hy  op
die hoogste piek gestaan het. Hy het wetenskap en tegnologie gebruik om  hom
voor te berei vir die uitvoering van sy taak.

Volgende week vertrek die absolute trots van Suid-Afrika,  van  Afrika,  die
vyftienjarige Nomathemba Kontyo van Khayelitsha na Kalifornië in Amerika  om
deel te vorm van 'n studenteruimtevaarderprogram. Sy verteenwoordig  Afrika,
nadat sy aan die internasionale kompetisie deelgeneem het. Sy is  die  beste
- nie net in Suid-Afrika nie.

Maar belangrik ook, toe die ANC-regering oorneem, toe is sy  in  graad  een.
Sy is nou in graad 10 en sy verteenwoordig die toekoms van wat die  ANC  vir
ons  kinders  beplan.  Natuurlik  is  haar   gunstelingvakke   wiskunde   en
wetenskap.

Ons het natuurlik ook 'n bod ingesit om die bou van 'n reuse  internasionale
teleskoop wat in die Noord-Kaap geleë sal wees. Indien  suksesvol,  sal  dit
broodnodige werkskepping meebring en 'n finansiële  inspuiting  vir  hierdie
gebied wees.

Kan u sien dat 'n beter lewe op 'n daaglikse basis  op  verskillende  fronte
plaasvind? Nou het ons  daardie  kontrak,  daardie  ooreenkoms  tussen  alle
rolspelers nodig om te verseker dat ons dinge beter, vinniger  en  nog  meer
doen.

President Mbeki, Mariëtta Struis, 'n graad 11-leerling, sê die volgende  van
u:


  Thabo Mbeki is die president van ons land,
  want deur hom vorm ons almal in Afrika 'n sterk band.
  Hy sê nooit nee nie en help waar hy kan,
  want ons in Suid-Afrika is 'n uitgebreide span.
  Hy is altyd betrokke as rampe ons tref;
  hy is onse pappa, het julle dit besef?
  Hy is soos 'n plant wat aanhou groei
  en maak die lewe vir ons beter as die son so gloei.

Nou wil ek graag 'n beroep doen op die mense van Langeberg  -  dis  waar  my
kiesafdeling is - die mense van die Kaapse Vlakte, maar veral die  Wes-Kaap,
KwaZulu-Natal. Maak die regte besluite, stem reg, stem vir  'n  beter  lewe.
Word deel en bly deel van die volkskontrak om werk te  skep  en  armoede  te
beveg. Vergeet van die uitgediende IVP.

Ek kon gister regtig nie my ore glo toe minister Buthelezi sê waarom  hy  'n
ooreenkoms, 'n koalisie het met  ...  ek  wil  amper  sê  ...  ek  moet  net
ordentlik wees en nie die mense se regte name noem nie,  die  mense  aan  my
linkerkant ... Nou vergeet van die Herstigte DP, stem vir  een  party.  Stem
vir die ANC.

Nou, mnr Leon, me De Lille, mnr Holomisa praat altyd van die  President  wat
nooit hier is nie. Maar baie van hulle kom net om hul  "paycheques"  te  kom
haal. Dan is hulle weg. [Tussenwerpsels.] Agb Leon is voor aan die punt.  Ek
hoop hy het die moed om die bus waarmee hulle rondry na Zimbabwe  te  ry  en
mnr Mugabe daar te gaan uitskel. Ek wil hom graag uitdaag  om  oor  te  gaan
Zimbabwe toe en nie hiervandaan te skel nie. Ek hoop  hy  het  die  moed  om
daar te gaan skel, dat hy kan sien wat maak "Uncle Bob" met hom.

Mnr Leon, male sonder tal, praat  van  die  plaasboere.  Ek  het  nog  nooit
gehoor hy praat van die plaaswerkers nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hoekom praat  hy
nie van die plaaswerkers in Suid-Afrika  en  in  Zimbabwe  nie?  Hoekom  het
hulle gestem vir die "minimum wage" van plaaswerkers en die "domestics"?  En
dan het hulle die "audacity" om te sê daardie mense moet vir hulle stem!

Kyk, mnr Leon, hy "aspire" mos om die President te wees. Nou, hy het ook  'n
nar wat in my kiesafdeling is,  aangestel  om  die  premier  te  wees.  Nou,
daardie nar gaan ons 'n ding wys. Ons  gaan  doodseker  maak  mnr  Leon  sal
nooit weer sy kop hier kan oplig nie. Dat hy nie net weer in  die  opposisie
sal sit nie, maar hy sal deel wees van daardie opposisie, want  hy  sê  daar
is net twee partye. Die tweede party weet jy nie waarvan hy  praat  nie.  Hy
sal daar agter sit daar by ons waar daar net een persoon is.  Hy  sal  nooit
weer kans kry om te praat as leier van die opposisie nie.

Agb lede, ek wil graag afsluit en vra elke regdenkende  mens  stem  vir  die
party wat vir jou vryheid gebring het, stem vir die party wat  seker  gemaak
het dat kinders soos Nomathemba uitstyg in  hul  skoolwerk.  Dís  die  soort
mense wat ons nodig het. Maak seker julle stem vir die ANC. Vergeet van  die
IFP. Vergeet van die ID. Vergeet van die Herstigte Demokratiese Party.  Daar
is een party;  stem  ANC.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr R D PIETERSE:


  Wit vrese vir 'n swart regering; hoe hoër 'n boom, hoe meer kritiek.
  Maar daar is u nog steeds die hoogste met 'n hoë profiel.
  Maar u as die hoogste van alle bome, met jou lang wortels wat uitreik  na

  Dankie, Thabo Mbeki.

Hon President, this poem  was  written  and  dedicated  to  you  by  Britney
Garies, a grade 12 student at the Gerhard  du  Plessis  High  School,  after
your opening address on Friday, 6 February.  The  people  of  Langeberg  say
thank you to you.

Hon Speaker, hon members of Parliament, where would we find a country  where
former sworn enemies are now  sitting  around  the  same  table  discussing,
planning and even helping to implement the future of our  beautiful  country
and its people? What country's people forgive so easily  when  its  national
teams such as soccer, cricket and  rugby  perform  poorly  in  international
competitions?
But let us set to work immediately  to  improve  and  to  win  at  the  next
competition. As a country we are determined to reach  the  top  and  I  also
believe that we will get the 2010 World Cup Bid. We have  the  capacity,  we
have the infrastructure, the technology, etc,  to  present  this  tournament
successfully.

Hon members, in 1994 we took over from a government  that  prevented  blacks
from studying science and technology. When  we  as  children  had  completed
standard 10, one could be  sure  that  that  child  would  become  either  a
teacher or a clergyman. If a boy had completed standard eight, you  knew  he
would become an artisan - that is a bricklayer, a carpenter or a painter.

The country's government which we  inherited  was  structured  to  keep  the
country's military machinery going technologically. And  not  long  ago  the
country  actually  harnessed  some  of  its  military  machinery  to  attack
neighbouring countries. Many of those people come over the  borders  because
they are looking for opportunities and then we treat  them  as  enemies;  we
are suffering from xenophobia.

Yet we do not do the same, even after whites murdered Chris Hani. If we  now
have xenophobia, why do we not apply it the same? Only when  black  Southern
Africans are involved, then we become hysterical  and  say  that  they  must
return to their countries. We must sometimes pause and think and  ask  where
we come from that we now enjoy this freedom.

 In 1994 the ANC Government started  changing  this  picture  by  converting
some of the military facilities to the advantage of all; not only  in  South
Africa, but in Africa. President Mbeki, in the year 2000 you  said  in  your
opening address that  special  attention  must  be  given  to  the  critical
shortage of mathematics, science and language teachers, as well as  the  new
demands of information technology.

Minister Asmal and his department set to work immediately and early in  2001
they  launched  the  national  strategy   for   mathematics,   science   and
technological training. Part of this strategy focuses  on  women  and  rural
areas. We can look back and say proudly that a marked  and  positive  change
has taken place.

Allow me to thank all those concerned:  the  Department  of  Education,  the
teachers, the lecturers, and especially  the  students  and  their  parents.
They made a concerted effort; they worked harder and therefore  we  can  see
that last year's matriculation results were  not  only  an  improvement  but
also as  far  as  those  subjects  are  concerned,  namely  mathematics  and
science. Therefore we see that the ANC Government  has  its  finger  on  the
pulse and will apply the revision, if necessary.

We started doing research and development regarding electronics to  liberate
the electronic media and today we see that  more  of  our  people  now  have
access to watch programmes of their choice in the language of  their  choice
than ever before. In the past many  raids  were  carried  out  on  community
radio stations in an endeavour to silence our people  and  to  prevent  them
from listening to their own programmes. Ask Bush Radio here in the Cape.

Today there are more than 40 community radio stations and  the  end  is  not
yet in sight. We also recently  established  the  MDDA  to  ensure  support,
inter alia for the community radio stations. Of course this  is  not  enough
and more will have to be done and I  believe  that  the  ANC  Government  is
committed to doing more and faster too.

But this cannot be done alone and only when the public, the  private  sector
and the Government co-operate in that partnership, in  that  contract,  will
it be possible. We must form a partnership with the people of South  Africa,
including the private sector, to create employment  and  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty together.

So, in that partnership it  is  important  that  we  pay  for  services,  we
protect what is ours - the telephones and  the  radio  stations  -  we  must
protect them from criminals, from vandals.

President Mbeki, in 1996 in your famous  ``I  am  an  African''  speech  you
forced many people to a deep  introspection.  Many  hon  members  fell  over
their feet to come and confirm it, even those who had no idea  what  it  was
all about. A friend of mine responds to it as follows:


  Ek is gebore in 'n karoodorpie genaamd Zoar, skoolgegaan  en  grootgeword
  daar, myself in die Kaapse Vlakte begewe, terwyl ek gehoop het  vir  ``'n
  job'',  Manenberg  om  presies  te  wees.  Ja,  ek  praat  Afrikaans,  my
  moedertaal met 'n "slang", maar ek is 'n ``African'', want ek vra nie wat
  my land vir my doen nie, maar wat ek vir my land kan doen.  Natuurlik  is
  ek 'n ``African''.

Hon members, Mark Shuttleworth identified  and  successfully  addressed  his
ceiling in his life with the aid of technology. Proudly every South  African
waved their little flag, pointed at the television screen and said:  ``There
is our flag. There is South Africa's flag flying high in space.''

Who can forget Mr Velani, once an ordinary shepherd and then an official  of
the National Parks Board, who also tackled his ceiling: Mount  Everest?  The
tears of pride that many of us wiped away when Mr Velani  draped  the  South
African flag around his shoulders, while he stood on the  highest  peak.  He
used science and technology to prepare himself for the  performance  of  his
task.

Next week the  absolute  pride  of  South  Africa,  of  Africa,  15-year-old
Nomathemba Kontyo, of Khayelitsha will be going to California in America  to
form part of a student astronaut  programme.  She  is  representing  Africa,
after having taken part in the international competition. She is the best  -
not only in South Africa.

 But what is also important is that when the ANC Government took  over,  she
was in grade one. She is now in grade 10 and she is representing the  future
of what the ANC is planning  for  our  children.  Of  course  her  favourite
subjects are mathematics and science.

Of course  we  also  put  in  a  bid  for  the  construction  of  a  massive
international telescope which will be situated  in  the  Northern  Cape.  If
successful, it will result in  much  needed  job  creation  and  will  be  a
financial injection for this area.

Can you see that a better life on a daily basis is taking place  on  various
fronts? Now we need that contract, that agreement between  all  role-players
to ensure that we do things better, faster and far more.

President Mbeki, Mariëtta Struis, a  grade  11  pupil,  says  the  following
about you:


  Thabo Mbeki is die president van ons land,
  Want deur hom vorm ons in Afrika 'n sterk band.
  Hy sê nooit nee nie en help waar hy kan,
  Want ons in Suid-Afrika is 'n uitgebreide span.
  Hy is altyd betrokke as rampe ons tref;
  Hy is onse pappa, het julle dit besef?
  Hy is soos 'n plant wat aanhou groei
  En maak die lewe vir ons beter as die son so gloei.
Now I would like to make an appeal to the people  of  Langeberg  -  that  is
where my constituency is - the people of the Cape Flats, but especially  the
Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal. Make the right decisions, vote correctly,  vote
for a better life. Become a part and remain a part of the people's  contract
to create employment and fight poverty. Forget about the outdated IFP.

I could really not believe my ears yesterday when  Minister  Buthelezi  told
us why he had an agreement, a coalition with ... I almost want to say ...  I
must just be decent and not mention the people's real names, the  people  to
my left. Forget about the Herstigte DP, vote for one  party.  Vote  for  the
ANC.

Now, Mr Leon, Ms De Lille, Mr Holomisa always talk about the  President  who
is never here. But many of them come only  to  collect  their  pay  cheques.
Then they are gone. [Interjections.] Hon Leon is first in line.  I  hope  he
has the courage to take the bus they ride around in to Zimbabwe to  harangue
Mr Mugabe there. I would like to challenge him to go to Zimbabwe and not  to
harangue him from here. I hope he has the courage to  go  and  harangue  him
over there, then he can see what ``Uncle Bob'' will do to him.

Mr Leon talks about the farmers time and time again. I have never heard  him
talk about the farmworkers. [Interjections.] Why does he not talk about  the
farmworkers in South Africa and in Zimbabwe?  Why  did  they  vote  for  the
minimum wage of farmworkers and domestics? And then they have  the  audacity
to say that those people must vote for them!

Look, Mr Leon is aspiring to be the President. Now, he has also appointed  a
clown who is in my constituency to be the premier. Now, that clown is  going
to show us a thing or two. We will make quite sure that Mr Leon  will  never
be able to lift his head here again. That  he  will  not  only  sit  in  the
opposition again, but that he will be part of that  opposition,  because  he
says that there are only two parties. One does not know  what  he  means  by
the second party. He will sit at the back there with us where there is  only
one person. He will never again get the opportunity to speak  as  leader  of
the opposition.

Hon members, I would like to conclude and ask every right-minded  person  to
vote for the party that  brought  you  freedom,  vote  for  the  party  that
ensures that children such as Nomathemba  do  well  in  their  school  work.
These are the types of people we need. Make sure that you vote for the  ANC.
Forget about the IFP. Forget  about  the  ID.  Forget  about  the  Herstigte
Democratic Party. There is only one party; vote ANC. I thank you.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Hon President, Deputy President,  serious  seekers  of  the
truth are always confronted with the question: Is there  an  ultimate  truth
or is truth relative? The answer to this  very  important  question  is  not
always as easy and straightforward. In many instances there is  a  thin  but
decisive line between truth and deception. We, as politicians,  need  to  be
very cautious  in  our  approach,  evaluation  and  conclusion  because  our
diagnosis will determine the prescription that will ultimately bring  either
hope or despair to the people.

Meneer die President, soekers na waarheid vra  vrae.  [Mr  President,  those
who seek the truth ask questions.]

And I'm not referring to sweetheart questions.

En as hierdie vrae eerlik hanteer word en  ware  patriotte  sal  dit  eerlik
hanteer, behoort ons antwoorde te kan kry vir die vrae waarmee ons  worstel.
Ons kan die vrae vra of ons kan ons  besig  hou  met  politieke  clichés  en
politieke "grandstanding". [Tussenwerpsels.]

Wat is die waarheid omtrent die  misdaadvlakke  in  ons  land?  Wat  is  die
waarheid omtrent Vigs? Wat is die waarheid  omtrent  werkloosheid,  armoede,
korrupsie, "shady deals"? Wat is die waarheid in verband  met  probleme  met
ons dienslewering? Wat is die waarheid omtrent die beweerde nuwe  vorms  van
diskriminasie?

Op die oomblik is die verhoor van 'n monster van  Mitchell's  Plain  in  die
Kaapse Hooggeregshof aan die gang. 'n  Familie  is  wreedaardig  vermoor  en
vroue op 'n bisarre wyse verkrag. [Tussenwerpsels.] In  my  gesprek  verlede
week  met  die  familie  van  die  slagoffers  het  hulle  beweer  dat   die
beskuldigde een van hulle is aan wie u  presidensiële  kwytskelding  verleen
het.

Meneer die President, is dit 'n persepsie of is dit  die  waarheid?  Ek  het
vanoggend gehoor van iemand wat gruwelik aangerand is en  vir  leeus  gevoer
is.  Misdadigers  is  besig  om  in  ons  land  op  te  tree  met  roekelose
arrrogansie. Ook verlede week het 'n man in desperaatheid met sy  bakkie  en
die kapers oor 'n krans gejaag. Orals begin  mense  die  wet  in  hulle  eie
hande neem. Verslaggewers van City Press kan  uit  polisiekantore  stap  met
belangrike dokumente sonder dat iemand 'n vinger veroer. Verwag u  dat  ons,
die wetsgehoorsame burgers, moet omrol en  dood  speel  as  ons  dogters  en
vroue  verkrag   en   vermoor   word?   Die   belangrikste   konstitusionele
verantwoordelikheid om die burgers te beskerm,  word  gruwelik  verwaarloos,
word gesê. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[And when these questions are dealt with in  an  honourable  way,  and  true
patriots will deal with them in an honourable way, we ought to find  answers
to the questions that we are grappling with. We could ask the  questions  or
we  could  occupy   ourselves   with   political   clichés   and   political
grandstanding. [Interjections.]

What is the truth about the crime levels in our country? What is  the  truth
about Aids? What is the truth about unemployment,  poverty,  corruption  and
shaky deals? What is the truth  regarding  the  problems  with  our  service
delivery? What is the truth about the alleged new forms of discrimination?

At the moment the trial of a monster from Mitchell's Plain is continuing  in
the Cape High Court. A family was brutally murdered and women were raped  in
a bizarre way. [Interjections.] In my discussions with the  victims'  family
last week they alleged that the accused  was  one  of  those  who  had  been
granted a presidential pardon by you.

Mr President, is this a perception or is it the truth? This morning I  heard
about someone who had been viciously assaulted and fed to  lions.  Criminals
are  behaving  with  reckless  arrogance  in  our  country.  Last  week,  in
desperation, a man drove his van and the hijackers over a cliff. People  all
over are starting to take the law into their own hands. Reporters from  City
Press can walk out  of  police  offices  with  important  documents  without
anyone lifting a finger. Do you expect  us,  the  law-abiding  citizens,  to
roll over and pretend to be dead when our  daughters  and  women  are  being
raped and murdered? It  is  said  that  the  most  important  constitutional
responsibility of protecting our citizens is being grossly neglected.]

Is it fact or fiction? Is the feeling that the Government is more  concerned
about the basic human rights of hooligans, murderers and  rapists  than  the
rights of law-abiding citizens a perception or is it a truth?  The  question
of discrimination has been  raised  by  the  former  members  of  the  SACC,
"voormalige Kaapse Korps" [former Cape Corps]. They say  that  their  former
Commander in Chief, Mr F W de Klerk,  has  been  given  the  Gold  Order  of
Mapungubwe by you, Mr President, while they, in contrast to  how  you  treat
their former superiors, and what has been given to  the  former  members  of
Umkhonto weSizwe,  feel  that  they  are  being  discriminated  against  and
treated  like  dirt.  Is  this  the   truth   or   is   it   a   perception?
[Interjections.]

 The question of discrimination has also been raised by traditional  leaders
of the Kung, Xhwe! and Quena people. Promises were made  a  long  time  ago,
but also during the discussions of the Bill on traditional leadership,  that
urgent attention would be given to reach a solution to their  problems.  The
fact that indigenous names  of  ancient  historical  standing  -  Quena  and
otentottu  -  were  replaced  by  politically   motivated   academics   with
artificial and never previously recorded colonial  names  such  as  the  so-
called Khoi-Khoi, as invented by the German Theoplus Hahn in  1881  and  the
name Khoisan, as invented by another German, Leonard Shultze,  in  1928,  is
not helping to get an historically sound and acceptable  solution.  Existing
results are available from research  that  was  historically  demanding  ...
[Laughter.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Mr Chair, Mr President, Mr Deputy  President,  today  the  vast
majority of our population is rejoicing. They  are  rejoicing  because  they
know there is no turning back. They are rejoicing because  they  accept  the
inevitability of the irreversible process of  liberation  from  poverty  and
racial discrimination.

Only a small minority of our population, led by  the  DA  and  a  number  of
extraparliamentary splinter groups such as the Boeremag have a negative  and
hostile disposition towards the removal of  racial  discrimination  and  the
vision of a new, just South Africa. They are trying to make this  moment  of
truth in our  history  the  basis  for  resistance  and  even  revolt.  With
contemptuous disregard for reason and rational thinking, for  reality,  they
are exploiting the uncertainty of change and the anxiety which causes this.

Today I want  to  say  the  following  to  all  those  out  there  who  feel
uncertain, who continue to try to find their  security  in  the  restrictive
racial isolation of the DA: Do not allow yourselves to become  the  prey  of
rabble-rousing  right-wing  politicians   and   troublemakers.   Think   for
yourselves. Look around you and know that you cannot build a safe future  on
disregard for the rights of the permanent and irremovable majority  of  this
population. What is dear to you and what is also dear  to  me  can  only  be
protected if there is full  recognition  of  the  human  dignity  and  basic
rights of all South Africans, irrespective of colour.

This vision of a new South Africa brought most South  Africans  increasingly
closer together. In most hearts there is a yearning for  peaceful  solutions
and  co-operation.  The  majority  are  tired  of  the  negative   and   the
destructive, and wish to join hands, but do not always know how to do  this.
These facts place the responsible  and  positive  leadership  corps  in  our
country before a challenge. The time  has  arrived  for  nation-building.  I
wish to accept this challenge today and invite every leader to  join  me  in
doing so.

Mr President, on Saturday we saw the Leader of the  Opposition  representing
himself to the country. In a darkened room, in dark clothes like a  Satanist
evangelist, he ranted and raved. He levelled curses at  the  leader  of  the
majority of this country. [Interjections.] Yesterday we saw him  again.  Let
us analyse him. Let us consider what a South Africa under  Tony  Leon  would
be like.

I will not use propaganda; I will use the words of a member of the  DA,  who
said that the DA was  built  on  a  platform  of  treachery.  Leon  and  his
personal Rasputin, Ryan Coetzee, told the DP federal council  in  June  2000
that the move was essential to remove the New NP from the  political  arena.
You cannot take his word. We were assured that Marthinus van  Schalkwyk  and
other New NP leaders would be removed from office  at  the  first  congress.
The entire plan was based  on  Leon's  ambition  to  be  the  leader  of  an
alternative government. Yesterday he acknowledged that.

In 1999 and 2000 the ``Fight  Back''  campaign  did  in  fact  mean  ``fight
blacks'' to the newfound  DP  supporters  who  came  from  the  Conservative
Party, the  Herstigte  Nasionale  Party,  the  FF  and  even  the  Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging, who sit with the Afrikaner Boeremag now. When the DA  is
accused of racism, it is true of a large percentage of  its  supporters  and
is reflected in the management structures in  some  provinces  and  regions.
These are not my words. The DA can  no  longer  claim  to  be  the  home  of
liberal democrats.

Prof Themba Sono and Richard Ntuli recently said that the DA's black  public
representatives were nothing more than window-dressing, black ornaments.  By
and large they are people who could not get elected via the ANC.

Richard Ntuli came to this Parliament as a  retired  inspector  of  schools,
educated and with experience. When Dominee Doman left the  pulpit  and  went
to the DA, he was considered a better DA spokesperson for education  than  a
qualified former teacher. That is the DA's racism. This is what  Carl  Werth
says.

The DA prescribes ethics and morals for the Government ad nauseum, but  does
not apply the same standards to its activities. Two MPs were caught  fudging
canvassing results but have never been disciplined. The same Leon who  bayed
for the head of the Mpumalanga premier when he said it  was  acceptable  for
politicians to lie under  certain  circumstances,  supported  Gerald  Morkel
when he openly lied and ``bent the truth'' - in his words -  after  the  New
NP walked out of the DA.

But the most damning of all were the allegations that the DA accepted  money
from Jürgen Harksen, a known fugitive  from  justice.  The  fact  that  Leon
wrote a personal letter of thanks to all donors of more than R20  000  makes
it  inconceivable  that  he  would  not  have  known  about  the   donation.
[Interjections.]

The spending, exemplified by the R8,8 million debt run up  in  the  December
2000 local  government  elections,  is  most  disturbing  in  a  party  that
professes to be a ``mean and  lean''  alternative  government  to  the  ANC,
whose financial and economic record is the best  in  the  history  of  South
Africa. [Applause.]

While Leon criticises the President when he  travels  around  the  world  to
open markets for us, and to assist this continent in  becoming  a  continent
of peace and prosperity, he himself is off on an overseas junket every  time
Parliament goes into recess - this is what his own people  are  saying.  The
details of his visits and who pays for them would make interesting  reading.
We should find that out. [Interjections.]

The political promiscuity of courting first the New  NP,  now  Inkatha,  the
Minority Front, the United  Democratic  Front  and  Lucas  Mangope's  United
Christian Democratic Party - and they talk about multiparty democracy  -  is
just another cynical attempt.
But let us see  what  the  independent  press  says.  Carol  Paton,  liberal
journalist, says:


  ... the DA saw taking control of Cape Town as  an  opportunity  to  build
  what they called a ``shining city on the hill''.


  At the outset, in December 2000,  the  DA  declared  that  -  with  their
  businesslike efficiency and corruption-free record - they were  going  to
  ``work smarter'' than anyone had before. They would deliver more  at  the
  same or even less expense.

[Interjections.]


  Not only has the process of governing turned out  to  be  more  difficult
  than they imagined, but the DA has shown themselves to be clowns.


  On the level of  political  leadership,  the  DA  has  been  an  outright
  failure.


  The blunders and embarrassments are incredible: top officials  fired  for
  political reasons; the mayor involved in fraud ...


  With Gerald Morkel at the helm as mayor, things got no better. Stories of
  his relationship with a fraudster soon hit headlines and Morkel, refusing
  to stand down, dragged the DA down further.

She goes on to say:


  Although the DA concede that they have failed  politically,  they  insist
  that Cape Town administration is doing very  well  in  terms  of  service
  delivery.


  But is it?


  The city's finances are in a mess. City manager Robert Maydon battled  to
  balance the budget, presented in June, and all departments  were  ordered
  to shave their budgets by R140 million.


  Over the past few weeks it emerged that it was not enough of a  cut.  The
  council had to reduce the  electricity  tariff  for  bulk  users,  losing
  revenue of R50 million, underestimated wage  costs  by  R73  million  and
  miscalculated the rates on former agricultural land.


  Despite the business acumen of the top officials that the DA installed in
  the city, Cape Town has still not balanced its budget. Furthermore ...

[Interjections.] I am reading the article.


  Services have already been cut back. The metro police force, which  aimed
  to take in another batch of recruits this year, has cancelled its plans.

At the end she says, and these are very important words:


  ... the DA could ironically be worse off. It  will  lose  the  chance  to
  offload the burden of governing - a  burden  it  has  found  surprisingly
  heavy.

The DA was happy when the ANC and the New NP  stabilised  the  Western  Cape
and the metrocity.

Yesterday the Institute of Security Studies said:


  Since the ANC and the New NP has governed the Western Cape, the  emphasis
  turned to service delivery.

The people of the Western Cape, like the people of  KwaZulu-Natal,  and  the
people of South Africa, will next term experience the stability and  service
delivery from the  ANC-New  NP  coalition.  I  thank  you.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Mnu F BHENGU: Mhlalingaphambili, amathunz' anabile, kurhatyele,  masigoduke;
umsebenzi usilindile phandl' apha.

Mhlalingaphambili,  Mongameli,  Sekela-Mongameli,  balweli   nani   bathandi
benkululeko, malungu abekekileyo, naku ukwenzeka:  Unyaka  ngu-1993,  ilanga
libumnyamarha, inyanga  ihamba  ngamathunzi  obumnyama,  umoya  unengcwangu;
imigqumo yeengxangxasi yimindumzelo. Amasimi  abharhile  yimbalela;  amabuzi
ngoocwethe  eziseleni;  abantwana   imikhunyu   yomele   emathatheni;   umsi
wesirhalarhala  ubika  indlal'  entungo;   intsengwakazi   ibukul'   ithole;
isikhova ngongcwalazi sibik' umonakalo.

UNgxabani  ubal'  iinkozo  ngomsimelelo  kuba   amacebo   aphelile;   amehlo
antywizis' iinyembezi lurhatyazo; ngesingqala, "inzima le  ndlela,  inameva;
uyasinda lo mthwalo, uyandongamela; inkululeko suka yaziinkwenkwezi."

Naku ukwenzeka: uMamQocwa, usan' ebeleni; umbhekaphesheya yincindi  yekhala;
ubuthongo  libali;   uqamele   ngoMqulu   weNkululeko;   kungqungq'   ingoma
echukumis' izazela; abantu baza kulawula; abantu baza  kwabelana  ngentlutha
yelizwe labo; siza kuyisebenzela  le  nkululeko.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr F BHENGU: Chairperson, it is late, the time is against  us.  Let  us  go
back home. Our work is waiting for us out there.

Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  Deputy  President,  freedom  lovers  and
fighters, hon members, listen to this: It is 1993, the weather is not  clear
and bright; the sun is behind the clouds; it is very windy  and  drought  is
reigning. The children look very  hungry  and  poor,  even  nature  and  the
environment all around look pale; the calves do not get any  milk  from  the
cows; the owl is crying foul.

Ngxabani is counting mealy beans with his stick because he  has  lost  hope.
His eyes shed tears because of blindness. He  sobs:  "It  is  becoming  very
difficult; I am losing hope, freedom has become impossible."

Listen: MamQocwa, breastfeeding her child; her smoking pipe is full of  tar;
she is having sleepless nights. Under her pillow there is  freedom  chatter;
she is quietly singing an inspirational song; the people shall  govern;  the
people shall share their country's wealth. We are going  to  work  hard  for
our freedom.]

The people shall govern; the people shall share in the country's wealth.  We
pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing neither strength  nor  courage,
until the democratic changes have been won.

Kumaxesh'  obunzima  iAfrika   iyahlabela;   kumaxesh'   obumnyama   iAfrika
iyahlabela; kumaxesh'  enkxwaleko  iAfrika  iyahlabela;  kumaxesh'  eentsizi
iAfrika iyahlabela; kumaxesh' ovuyo iAfrika iyahlabela.

Nyamezel' inkululek' ifikile; nyamezel' inkululek' isemagxen'  ethu;  thath'
umthwalo ungabi namkhinkqi; thath' umthwalo ukhokel' iAfrika; thath'  abantu
ubabeke phambili, kub' inkululeko  lilima,  kub'  inkululeko  kukubambisana,
kub' inkululeko kukuvuka uzenzele,  kub'  inkululeko  iyasetyenzelwa.  I-ANC
iyasetyenzelwa. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Ingoma kaMamQocwa yeza nenkululeko ngo-1994. Ngaloo nyaka  mnye  waba  nakho
ukuya kuvotela umbutho awuthandayo norhulumente amthandayo. Ngubani  na  oze
nale nkululeko? Ngaba ngumhlekazi uTony Leon? [Uwele-wele.] Hayi, akunjalo.

Namhlanje iinkonde zakuthi zamkela inkamnkam nyanga zonke,  ide  yanokratya.
Ngubani oze neli cebo? NguTony Leon, umhlekazi? Hayi!

Namhlanje  amanzi  aqukuqela  ngemibhobho  angcanyulwa  kwiinkalo  ngeenkalo
zeelali zethu. Ngubani umenzi, ngaba yi-DA na?

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILEYO: Hayi!

Mnu F BHENGU: Hayi!

Umbane ezilalini utsho kwasemini. Ngubani unobangela, nguLeon, umhlekazi?

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILEYO: Hayi!

Mnu F BHENGU: Hayi!

Iintsana  ukuya  kwiminyaka  eli-11  zifumana   isibonelelo   senkxaso-mali.
Yingcamango kabani na leyo, yekaTony? Hayi! [Uwele-wele.]

Iindlela  ezilalini  zigudisiwe,  into  engazange  yenzeka.  Ngubani  kanene
unobangela woku, nguTony?

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILEYO: Hayi!

Mnu F BHENGU: Hayi!

Izikolo zakhiwe, akukho mntwan'  uvalelwe  ngaphandle.  Uthini  uTony,  uthi
nguye? Hayi!

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILEYO: Hayi!

Mnu F BHENGU: Imihlaba ibuyele kubaniniyo. Nguban' umenzi?  Yi-ANC.  Izindlu
zakhiwe.  Zakhiwe  ngubani?  Ikwa  yile  ANC.  Kumabala  emidlalo  yintsholo
kuqhwatyw' izandla, ngamayeye. Ngubani owenze kwaba njalo? Yi-ANC.

ILUNGU ELIHLONIPHEKILEYO: DA! [Kwahlekwa.]

Mnu F BHENGU:  Iimfonomfono  zikhala  mihla  nezolo,  ziyasiphazamisa.  Kazi
ukuba ngubani na owenze kwaba njalo? Ikwa yile ANC. [Uwele-wele.]

Yakhan' umkhanya, nikhalime, nibuze umbuzo kwi-DA wokuba kule  minyaka  eli-
10  yenze  ntoni?  [Uwele-wele.]  Ikhona?  Hayi,  ayikho.  Into   abayenzayo
kukuhlala  ezithebeni   zabagxeki,   behlala   nabantu   abangabahanahanisi,
bebaxelela okungekukho,  baqwele  bangazazi  neenkokeli  ezikhokela  ilizwe,
bathethe unobenani. Babulibele ubuAfrika kuba ababazi.

Ndiphaya kuTsolo, kuwelela kuthi, Tat' uMbadi, amalungu athile athi:  "Kwezi
wadana zethu besisoloko sisithi sithi abalawulayo kuba  sasiyifumene  ivoti,
kodwa into esoyisileyo kukuba  singakwazi  ukuya  kuthi  ebantwini  kukwenza
kwethu. Imihla nezolo sithi: "Hayi,  niyayifumana  inkamnkam.  Hayi,  amanzi
akho, kuba sibakho kwiingxoxo zekansile, kodwa asikwazi ukulikhupha  litsole
sithi, `Hayi, sithi abenze oku singulo mbutho'.  Kodwa  into  esimisa  ngayo
ngulo  Khongolose.  Yiyo  loo   nto   sibuyele   kuKhongolose;   soyisakele.
Sizibuzile  ukuba  kode  kube  nini  na  sisoloko  sixokisa   abantu,   kuba
uKhongolose akanamkhethe. UKhongolose ukwenzela  indlela  nawe  mntu  we-DA,
ukuze uhambe kuyo." [Uwele-wele.]

Wena we-UDM, uKhongolose  ukuseza  amanzi,  ude  uxhaphe  ngamanzi.  Akathi:
"Hayi, ndenzela abantu be-ANC."

Makhe ndijike ndithi: (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[In times of struggle Africa sings; in times of darkness  Africa  sings;  in
times of despair Africa sings; in times of sorrow Africa sings; in times  of
happiness Africa sings.

Hold on, freedom has arrived; endure, freedom depends on  us;  take  up  the
baton, do not tire, take it and lead Africa, make the  people  lead  because
freedom is co-operation, it is helping each other. Freedom is  doing  things
for yourself. And it is worked for. You must work for the ANC. [Applause.]

MamQocwa's song brought us freedom in 1994. In the same year  she  was  able
to vote for the party of her choice and for her own Government. Who  brought
us freedom then, is it the hon Tony Leon?  [Interjections.]  No!  I  do  not
think so.

Today, our elderly people  get  pension  grants  every  month,  it  is  even
incremental. Who came up with that plan? Is it the hon Tony Leon? No!

Today, the water goes through pipes to the  different  destinations  of  our
villages. Who is responsible for that, is it DA?

HON MEMBERS: No!

Mr F BHENGU: No!

Electricity in our villages is available throughout the day. Who  made  that
possible, is it the hon Tony Leon?

HON MEMBERS: No!

Mr F BHENGU: No!

Infants up to children of 11 years old receive social  grants.  Who  thought
of that, is it the hon Tony? No! [Interjections.]

The village roads have  been  smoothly  paved,  something  which  had  never
happened before. Who did that, is it the hon Tony?

HON MEMBERS: No!

Mr F BHENGU: No!

Schools have been built for every  child  to  be  able  to  have  access  to
education. What does the hon Tony have to say about that? Is he  responsible
for that? No!

HON MEMBERS: No!

Mr F BHENGU: Land has been redistributed to its  rightful  owners.  Who  did
that? The ANC. Houses have been built. Who built them?  The  ANC.  In  sport
facilities the people are happy and applauding their heroes loudly.  Who  is
responsible for that? It is the ANC.

An HON MEMBER: DA! [Laughter.]

Mr F BHENGU: The telephones, though they  disturb  us,  ring  every  day.  I
wonder who is responsible for that? Again it is the ANC. [Interjections.]

Look, stop and ask the DA some questions  like  whether  there  is  anything
that they have done  in  the  last  ten  years.  [Interjections.]  Is  there
anything? No, there is not. What they do  best  is  being  cynical,  sitting
with misleading people, who tell them lies; they end up not knowing who  the
country's leaders are. All they  speak  is  nonsense.  They  have  forgotten
about Africanism, because they do no know it.

I live in Tsolo village, Mr Mbadi, where some people are saying:  "In  these
little wards of ours we are taught that we are  governing  because  we  were
voted into power, but the problem is that we cannot go and tell people  that
we are responsible for their plight."  Every day we say: "But,  you  do  get
social grants. And you have access to water, because we are always there  in
local council  meetings."  But  we  cannot  say  confidently:  "We  as  this
organisation are responsible for this." But  we  always  put  the  ANC  name
forward. And that is why we have come back to the ANC, to look for help.  We
have asked  ourselves  why  we  are  lying  to  people.  The  ANC  does  not
discriminate. The ANC paves the way, even for the DA  people  to  walk  on."
[Interjections.]

The ANC supplies water to even you people of the UDM, and it gives you  more
of it than you actually need. It does not  say:   "We  only  serve  the  ANC
constituencies."

Let me say for a change that:]

Our Government has, over the  past  10  years,  put  in  place  a  conducive
environment in the form of the Constitution; a legislative framework  and  a
concrete programme that seeks  to  address  especially  the  plight  of  the
vulnerable groups, such as our children, women,  persons  with  disabilities
and the elderly.

Most  of  my  colleagues  have  already  referred  to  and  specified   such
programmes and legislation, which facilitated the social  transformation  of
South Africa. We need not go  through  the  long  list  ...  kuhlwile  bantu
bakuthi; ngaba sidlala ngexesha [... it's late in the evening; we  would  be
wasting time].

However, what is important to mention is that as we enter our second  decade
as a democracy, we need to agree, as South Africans, on  what  needs  to  be
done to realise the people-centred society  that  our  leaders  have  spoken
about repeatedly.

Loo nto ijika ibuze ukuba ngaba siya kusoloko sigxeka de kube nini na,  mnta
kaMike Ellis? Loo nto ithi siya kusoloko sikhala kude kube  nini  na,  ngaba
asiyiboni na indlela? UMongameli utshilo ukuba umgaqo,  umkhombandlela  weli
lizwe, usanele. Nina makholwa nazi ngcono.  Ithi  iBhayibhile:  (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[That leaves the question: For how long are  you  going  to  continue  being
cynical, Mr Mike Ellis? When are you going to stop complaining,  do  we  not
see the way? The President said that  the  law,  the  Constitution  of  this
country is enough as the ultimate authority. You  Christians,  know  better.
The Bible says:]

My grace is sufficient for you. [Interjections.] Mntan'  eNkosi!  [Child  of
the Lord!]

I would like to take this opportunity to state some of the  goals  and  aims
that this Government has come up with  in  effecting  social  transformation
underpinning all programmes of  the  national  and  provincial  departments.
These goals are: One, building a nation united in action for change.

Zibuze  mntan'  enkosi  ukuba  ngaba  uyinxalenye  yokwenza  oko  na.   [Ask
yourself, child of the Lord, if you are part of that process.]
Secondly, moving to a faster job-creation  economic  growth  path;  thirdly,
investing in  human  resources;  fourthly,  more  effective  integrated  and
interactive  government;  fifthly,  rural  development  and  urban  renewal;
sixthly, eradicating  poverty  and  expanding  access  to  social  services;
seventhly, fighting crime and corruption; eighthly, African recovery.

Masibuye,  masenze  umbulelo  ongazenzisiyo  kuMongameli.  Ndileqa  nexesha.
Phaya kwela phondo lethu leMpuma Koloni, kwathi  kwakubakho  umonakalo  ombi
kumasebe ethu, kukhala oomakhulu noobawomkhulu,  besithi:  "Asiyazi  le  nto
yenzekayo. Kazi ukuba uphi na lo Khongolose?"  UMongameli  wathumela  igqiza
ukuze  liye  kujonga  ukuba  umonakalo  uphi  na.  Ibuyile  ingxelo  isithi:
"Umhlola usembizeni." [Uwele-wele.]

UKhongolose  ukwazile,  ngalo  Rhulumente,  ukuba  alungise  iziphene   kuba
umhlola obusembizeni  ngabantu  esifumanise  ukuba  abakhathalelanga  abantu
bethu,  kodwa  besitya  kwale  mali  iphuma  kwiipokotho   zabantu   bakuthi
abahluphekileyo ukuze bona baphile. Ndithetha nawe  nje  namhlanje,  lukhona
ucwangco nozinzo, kuba  lo  Rhulumente  utshilo,  mntakaNqakula,  ukuba  uya
kubulwa bonke ubugwenxa, kwaye uza kulwa nabantu abangazimiselanga  ukunceda
abantu bakuthi nabarhwaphilizayo.

Into  eyenzekileyo,  bantu  bakuthi  abamameleyo  phandl'  apho,  kukuba  lo
Rhulumente  ukwazile  ukufumanisa  ukuba  kukho   abantu   ababe   neenjongo
ezingezizo zokondla nokwakha abantu bakuthi, kodwa  babe  besamkela.  Andizi
kuphinda amazwi kaMongameli, obesele ethethile ebonakalisa  ukuba  umonakalo
uleli phi na.

Ndingathathanga thuba lide, ndingangenanga nakweminye  imiba,  mandilithathe
eli  thuba  ndibulele  kumaQocwa,  ndiwubulela   umzi   waseMzantsi   Afrika
ngokunika i-ANC  inkxaso  engagungqinyo  kuyo  yonke  le  minyaka,  ude  ube
nethemba lokuba i-ANC iya kusithatha isise enkululekweni.

Masiyibulele inkxaso esiyifumana ebantwini  bakuthi,  amaxhegwazana  akuthi,
ngokusinyamezela kuloo miqodi xa esiya kwamkela inkamnkam yawo,  de  kubekho
aswelekayo kuwo, kubekho ukuphatheka kakubi ezintliziyweni. I-ANC  iyabulela
ngokusinyamezela. I-ANC ihlaba ikhwelo kubo bonke oosomashishini ukuba  nabo
bancedise kwiphulo  likaRhulumente;  kulutsha  lwakuthi,  amadoda  neentombi
zakuthi, kaloku eli lizwe  lelenu.  Xa  ningakwazi  ukumamela  ezi  nkokeli,
nakulilawula njani  na  eli  lizwe?  Siyanqanda  sithi  kuni,  musan'  ukuba
nentandabuzo, wuthembeni lo mbutho;  mthembeni  lo  Rhulumente.  Nize  nithi
ngalaa mhla we-14 nihambe niye kuvotela i-ANC.

Ayizi nazithembiso, koko  into  eyenzayo  i-ANC  kukusebenza  nani.  Sihlab'
ikhwelo.  Yile  nto  sithi  sisibhambathiso  noluntu,  i-people's  contract.
Aniyiva  na,   i-ANC   ithi:   "Yizani   sisebenze   sonke."   [Uwele-wele.]
Mhlalingaphambili, ndingakutyelanga ixesha, amathunz' anabile,  ndiyabulela.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Let us now sincerely thank our President. I am running out of time. In  our
province, the Eastern Cape, when there was a crisis in our departments,  the
elderly cried out and said: "We do not know  what  is  happening.  I  wonder
where the ANC is?" The  President  sent  a  delegation  to  investigate  the
problem. The  report  came  back  saying:  "There  are  internal  problems."
[Interjections.]

The ANC, through the Government, was able to solve those  problems,  and  it
was discovered that the problem  was  internal  negligence,  by  people  who
misuse the funds of our poor people for their own selfish  needs.  As  I  am
talking to you now there is stability and order,  because  this  Government,
Mr Nqakula, is going to fight all the corruption and deal  with  people  who
do not want to assist the community members, and with fraudsters also.

To all the community members who are  listening  out  there,  this  is  what
happened, this Government discovered that there were  people  with  sinister
motives, people whose intentions were neither  to  feed  nor  to  build  the
nation, whilst on the other hand they benefited by drawing  salaries.  I  am
not going to repeat what the President said as he has  spoken  already,  and
identified the problem.

Without taking too much time and dwelling on other issues, let me take  this
opportunity to thank MamQocwa, together with  the  whole  country  of  South
Africa, for giving the ANC consistent support throughout the years. We  have
always hoped that the ANC will lead us to freedom.

We have to thank the  people  for  their  support,  especially  our  elderly
women, who endure a lot of pain when standing  in  those  queues  for  their
social grants; some of whom die in those queues; which does not  augur  well
at all. The ANC thanks you for you patience.  The ANC would  like  to  plead
to the private sector also to give their assistance to  all  the  government
initiatives; to all the youth; to all our men and women; do not forget  that
this is your country. If you cannot listen to these  leaders,  how  are  you
going to govern this country? We are pleading with you and  saying,  do  not
have reservations, but trust this organisation, trust  this  Government.  On
14 April go and vote for the ANC.

It does not come with any promises, but what the ANC does is  to  work  with
you. We are issuing a challenge. This is what we call a  people's  contract.
Are  you  listening?  The  ANC  says:  "Come,   let   us   work   together".
[Interjections.] Chairperson, without wasting  your  time,  it  is  late.  I
thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate the hon Durand on his swan song. The voters  will  finish  what
they started in 1999, I have no doubt. [Interjections.]

As the Hefer saga recedes  and  the  first  Hawk  trainer  jets  into  South
African skies, last week, South Africa's arms deal and the  real  issues  in
the arms deal are back on the  public  agenda.  These  include  the  mammoth
costs involved and the hidden costs involved in the  deal,  the  suitability
of the equipment that we are purchasing for a changed role of  peace-keeping
and peace-building under the auspices of the African Union  and  the  United
Nations, the lack of delivery of suppliers on the  industrial  participation
obligations,  as  evidenced  in  today's  Business  Day   again,   and   the
outstanding corruption allegations against the Deputy President  and  others
who are still under investigation, both locally and abroad.

While the Mac and Mo show may have hogged the  headlines  at  home,  abroad,
developments in Sweden, the United Kingdom  and,  indeed,  in  France,  have
highlighted the corruption  allegations  in  this  deal,  once  again.  This
procurement cannot, and will never have a clean bill of health.

The issue of the Deputy President has to be  dealt  with.  As  long  as  the
Deputy President continues  to  serve  in  this  Cabinet,  claims  of  moral
renewal will ring hollow. The people of South  Africa  deserve  better  than
this, Mr President.

Another year has passed, and the matter remains  unattended  to.  When  will
you display leadership in this regard, Mr  President?  When  will  you  stop
hiding and deflecting the way you did on a recent  state  visit  to  France,
when you said on Radio France International:
  We are proceeding from the position that everybody is innocent until they
  are found guilty. We have not found Thomson guilty, we have not found the
  Deputy President guilty on this thing.

These  comments  are  as  inappropriate  as  they  are  premature.  As   the
Scorpion's case against Schabir Sheikh gathers  momentum,  one  would  trust
that the Deputy President would do the honourable thing and step  down.  The
collateral damage of the Zuma affair is considerable  in  the  international
domain and must not be underestimated.

You must act, Mr President,  and  protect  the  international  standing  and
reputation of your Cabinet. Do not wait for the elections  to  resolve  this
matter by default and by  appointing  a  new  Deputy  President.  The  South
African people and this House deserve to also know whether this  matter  was
discussed with the French foreign Minister and/or Mr Chirac on  your  recent
visit.

In  Sweden,  parliamentarians  and  church  groups  are   calling   for   an
investigation of the allegation that Gripen contributed over $35 million  to
the ANC; in the United Kingdom, a quadripartite committee of  the  House  of
Commons will probe allegations that have engulfed BAE systems in respect  of
the Hawk deals in the Czech Republic, in India, in Qatar,  in  Saudi  Arabia
and in  South  Africa.  These  allegations,  repeated  by  Andrew  Feinstein
recently, include  that  BAE  systems  contributed  directly  to  the  ANC's
election fund in 1999.

While South Africa's constitutional oversight structures may have failed  in
probing  this  procurement,  the  oversight  structures  in  the   supplying
countries appear to be functioning. Today, as we gather in this  House,  new
oil  slick  allegations  have  emerged  less  than  a  year  after   similar
allegations about Nigeria.

This time, however, it is far more potentially damaging, as  it  relates  to
corrupt oil voucher schemes operated by Saddam Hussein's  former  regime  in
Iraq, a scheme which may even have  included  a  defrauding  of  the  United
Nation's Oil for Food programme or  manifested  itself  in  sanction-busting
operations.

However, what does Almader and the documents in the possession of the  Iraqi
governing  council  say  about  our  foreign  policy?  Were   these   random
individuals or companies carrying on their own purely commercial  activities
and carrying their own commercial briefs?

If so, why did it coincide with visits by the ANC heavyweights,  Mr  Kgalema
Motlanthe and Mandy Msimang, to Iraq? What prompted the high-profile  visits
of Tariq Aziz and other Baathists to South Africa in 2002, and the  immortal
picture of Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, Aziz Pahad,  with  former  Iraqi
President, Saddam Hussein?

Or are there more sinister diplomatic  reasons  for  the  concerns  that  we
raised about the ongoing issues involved in Iraq? The  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs must tell us categorically  whether  our  foreign  policy  concerns,
expressed on the eve of the war, were focused, fundamentally  and  foremost,
on concerns about the impact of unilateral military pre-emption in Iraq,  or
were there more sinister motivations at work. [Interjections.]

These allegations paint a worrying picture, Minister. It is  up  to  you  to
tell us whether our foreign policy is for  sale,  is  it  for  rent  to  the
highest bidder or is it, indeed, on auction  for  ...  [Interjections.]  ...
barrels of crude oil? We cannot be seen as a country  whose  foreign  policy
is hallmarked by a dinar dictator or a dinar  principle,  instead  of  being
guided by solid commitments to human rights.

Our country cannot founder its  diplomatic  standing  at  a  time  when  the
multilateral international system requires us to speak in a  chorus  of  the
developing countries on Doha, the United  Nations,  Kyoto  and  others.  The
challenges to you and your Presidency and this Cabinet are  clear.  Act,  Mr
President. [Interjections.] [Time expired] [Applause.]

Mr N L DIALE: I thank you, Chairperson. I will not waste time responding  to
the  hon  member  Kalyan.  We  have  principles,  rooted  in  the  objective
conditions of our struggle. We are clear enough.

Hon President of the Republic of South  Africa,  Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,  hon
Deputy President Jacob Zuma, hon  members,  Deputy  Ministers,  members  and
comrades, ...

... ke a le dumedisa ka moka. Ke thaba go tsea karolo mo ngangisanong ye  ya
MoPresidente wa naga ya puso ya Batho Pele. [I greet you all. I am happy  to
take part in this debate of the President of  a  country  that  puts  people
first.]

Chairperson, as South Africans, we can look back  over  the  last  10  years
with an enormous sense of pride.  We  have  triumphed  against  overwhelming
odds,  weathered  much  criticism,  entered  into  dynamic  discussions  and
experienced dramatic changes to the world order. In the SA National  Defence
Force we can take pride in knowing that the  debates  around  our  country's
defence requirements have been acknowledged as among  the  most  transparent
and consultative in the world.

The Defence Force exists through its primary objective, which is  to  defend
and protect South Africa,  its  territorial  integrity  and  its  people  in
accordance with the Constitution. We can look back on the last few years  of
restructuring and know that we are on  the  right  course  by  acknowledging
that we have shown that we are  a  learning  organisation,  capable  of  new
thinking.  We  are  a  living  organisation  one  capable  of  adapting  and
changing. We have shown that we are a leading part in  Africa  and  SADC  in
important areas, and we have shown that our armed  forces  can  deliver  the
support that is needed.

What are our achievements? Since the advent of democracy, South  Africa  has
undertaken one of the most systematic defence and security  reviews  in  the
developing world. This has led to the abandoning of  nuclear  deterrence,  a
commitment to collective and common security  and  the  adoption  of  a  new
framework for the management of security. One of the major  tasks  over  the
last few years has been to build an  integrated  Defence  Force  and  ensure
that integration of the various armed formations went off smoothly.

Given the historical animosities amongst the various armed formations,  this
was an admirable achievement. Transforming the  SA  National  Defence  Force
has been a long and  difficult  process,  as  witnessed  in  the  Tempe  and
Phalaborwa shootings. It  remains  a  challenge  of  restructuring  and  re-
engineering of the management of the information  control  system  necessary
to  support  the  Defence  Secretariat  with   regard   to   its   statutory
obligations. In many SA National Defence  Force  divisions,  top  leadership
remains white and male. Gender transformation also remains a  daunting  task
in the Department of Defence.  The  policy  framework  of  the  SA  National
Defence Force evolved through the comprehensive Defence Review which  formed
the basis of the White Paper on Defence and the subsequent legislation  that
governs this important area of our national security.

 The White Paper set out important principles for civil  military  relations
and for the organisational structure of defence management. It also  brought
to prominence the fact that Parliament ``has a range of  significant  powers
regarding military affairs in order to assert democratic  control  over  the
armed forces and defence policy''.

Some of the other successes today within defence  include  the  adoption  of
various  bilateral  and   multilateral   agreements;   the   launching   and
implementation of  the  Civic  Education  Programme;  the  drafting  of  and
wideranging consultation on the defence Bill; steady  progress  towards  the
balancing  of  the  personnel  budget;  the  successful  launching  of   the
Foundation training; the implementation of equitable merit bonuses; and  the
recognition of former  nonstatutory  force  service  for  the  provision  of
pension benefits.

This resolution seeks to address the pension  benefits  of  members  of  the
Public Service who were previously disadvantaged by the past  discriminatory
pension policies. The Defence Force also played  an  important  role  during
the floods in Mozambique a few years ago. All SADC member states  also  have
the opportunity to annually train members  of  their  armed  forces  at  our
establishments.

The department's programme to replace obsolete equipment is  on  track  with
the acquisition of air force and naval equipment,  and  will  continue  into
the next decade. Most importantly, the department continues  to  demonstrate
its responsibility as a custodian of land entrusted to it through active co-
operation  in  the  land  redistribution   and   restitution   policies   of
Government. It co-operated in a pilot study regarding the closing  down  and
the re-use of redundant military  bases  for  the  purposes  of  alternative
economic land use initiatives.

Insecurity was one of  the  most  critical  challenges  facing  the  ANC-led
Government when it took office in May 1994. The military carved  a  powerful
role for itself in the apartheid government and  society.  Ten  years  later
the ANC-led Government has presided  over  a  far-reaching  demilitarisation
process,  establishing  effective  civil  control  over  the  armed  forces;
integrating the  seven  different  military  formations  into  a  single  SA
National Defence Force; working towards securing a  common  security  regime
in Southern Africa; and cutting the defence budget in  real  terms  by  more
than 15%.

The achievements of  South  Africa's  first  democratic  Government  in  the
fields of defence and policy are remarkable  and  considerable.  Formulating
alternative policy to that of the apartheid structure and  transforming  the
National Defence Force into a respected and dynamic core force is  laudable.
However, policy translation  and  implementation  require  more  effort  and
present a challenge to all those  who  serve  in  the  SA  National  Defence
Force,

As for Correctional Services, another challenge  facing  our  Government  is
the transformation of our prison system. We acknowledge that  while  prisons
are the right place for  some  offenders,  they  are  the  wrong  place  for
others. Contained within this  thought,  the  Correctional  Services  system
within this country  has  sought  to  exercise  its  mandate  of  delivering
correctional services with  integrity  and  commitment  to  excellence.  The
Department of Correctional Service has to be commended for  striving  ahead,
notwithstanding  the  legacy  it  has  been  burdened  with  and   for   the
achievement it has made within a relatively short period of time.

As  part  of  its  core  programme,  the  department  has  sought  to  place
rehabilitation at the centre of all its activities. The Draft Paper  of  the
Department of Correctional Services  aims  to  ensure  that  the  department
achieves its objectives. With this aim in  mind,  the  department  has  also
developed individualised training programmes to develop the  skills  of  its
personnel.

However, overcrowding remains a major factor that impacts negatively on  the
department's costs,  performance  and  service  delivery.  Our  prisons  are
overcrowded and the number of awaiting-trial detainees grows each  day.  The
awareness that comes forth is that an already  overworked  court  system  is
unable to cope with the number of cases awaiting a hearing. Overcrowding  in
prisons appears to affect both the first  world  and  developing  countries.
The number of people incarcerated in the United States reached 2 million  in
the year 2000. [Time expired.]

 Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Chairperson, Mr President, in  your  state  of  the
nation address, you quoted Pablo Neruda's poem, The  Men.  You  have  quoted
Neruda before in November 1998  referring  to  his  work  called  A  Century
Dying, where you said:


  If the poet is correct that out of time's pestilence,  out  of  an  epoch
  that is rotting away comes a literature written by flies, we foresee  for
  ourselves  a  healthier  future  of  democracy,  reconciliation,  nation-
  building, prosperity, respect for human rights and  the  emergence  of  a
  caring society.

A caring society! The hon President continuously refers to our own  national
goal to build a caring and people-centred society. Yet,  with  the  greatest
respect to the hon President, he displays no empathy and no emotion for  the
people of South Africa. And whatever the content of the words,  that's  what
the people notice. Quite simply, when the hon President says he  cares,  the
people do not believe him. The people do not believe him because  they  know
it is easy to say that you care, ... [Interjections.] ...  but  actions  and
authentic empathy speak much louder than words.

The hon President and his Government reinforce this perception with  symbols
of uncaring. For instance, a R600 million luxury jet  that  cost  more  than
R900 000 to fly from Paris to Pretoria - that, hon Minister of  Finance,  is
a symbol of uncaring; the hon Minister of Finance described  the  suggestion
that the Government should spend money on antiretrovirals as  ``a  waste  of
very limited resources'' - that, Minister, is a symbol of uncaring; and  the
President propping up the Mugabe of the Caribbean, Haiti's  President  Jean-
Bertrand Aristide, and  in  the  process  misusing  millions  of  the  South
African taxpayers' rands - that is a symbol of uncaring.

Also the President saying, and I quote: ``Personally I do not  know  anybody
who has died of Aids.  I  really,  honestly  don't''.  This  does  not  only
confirm that the President is completely out of touch with  the  people  and
the plight that is killing millions of our fellow South Africans,  but  that
too is a symbol of uncaring; the failure to roll out an  effective,  nation-
wide HIV treatment programme - that, Minister,  is  a  symbol  of  uncaring;
saying no to a basic income grant - that, again, is a  symbol  of  uncaring;
refusing to condemn the Mugabe regime's abuse of  human  rights,  subversion
of democracy and abdication of the rule of law,  as  well  as  not  applying
real pressure, to restore a democratic government that can begin to  rebuild
Zimbabwe - that is a symbol of uncaring. [Interjections.]

Mr President, a caring,  people-centred  society  requires  much  more  than
eloquent words. The President's now infamous line, and I quote: ``We do  not
foresee  that  there  would  be  any  need  for   new   and   major   policy
initiatives,'' would be met with astonishment and disbelief by  our  people,
because there is no care,  there  is  no  empathy  in  those  words  or  the
terrible meaning that they convey. The DA does care. We share  the  people's
concerns and the people of South Africa need real  change.  [Interjections.]
They know this because their lives are  scarred  by  the  reality  of  South
Africa today. They need a government that  cares.  They  need  a  government
that will provide real solutions. They  deserve  better  and  frankly  South
Africa deserves better. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Mr Chairperson, Comrade President, Comrade Deputy  President,
hon members and comrades, five days ago I was among a group of  participants
at the launch of a community empowerment programme just outside  Cape  Town.
This was a joint initiative amongst two community projects, the  engineering
faculty of the University of Stellenbosch and a Dutch foundation.  The  site
of the launch was the well-known vineyard renowned for the  quality  of  its
wine.

The purpose of  the  consortium  that  was  established  that  night  is  to
stimulate entrepreneurship among the historically disadvantaged  communities
of Stellenbosch and the Helderberg. This is one of  many  such  small  local
initiatives that have  been  stimulated  into  existence  by  your  call  of
Faranani and Vukuzenzele, Comrade President.

The consortium that was established that night was not put up  in  order  to
deny the past. Its conception and establishment are rooted in a  recognition
of the past and the moral imperative today to undo the consequences of  that
past. The relationship between the Netherlands and the  communities  of  the
Western  Cape,  black  and  white,  dates  back  to  a  time  when   African
sovereignty was being chipped away piecemeal by an  increasingly  aggressive
European colonialism. Three and a half centuries later, African  sovereignty
has been re-established and the challenge facing the African  continent  now
is how to employ her sovereignty in order to empower  Africa's  children  so
that they may survive and prosper in the 21st century.

The central plank of South African foreign policy is  to  create  the  space
for Africa, African countries and the peoples of Africa to define their  own
future by exploring and  offering  viable  indigenously-evolved  alternative
agendas to those imposed on our continent  by  former  colonial  powers  and
their allies.

The New Partnership for Africa's Development,  Nepad,  is  about  addressing
the principal challenge facing the African continent today. That  challenge,
which is universally recognised, is the eradication  of  poverty.  Nepad  is
also a programme to secure the hard-won freedom of the peoples of Africa  by
equipping our continent for  success  during  the  21st  century.  Political
stability and peace remain very illusive objectives. We nonetheless have  to
pursue these with even greater tenacity precisely because  there  have  been
such disheartening reverses in the last three years.

The flickering flame of progress in the Sudan, in Burundi and  on  the  horn
of Africa indicates that our efforts are not  fruitless.  From  day  one  of
your presidency, Comrade President, you embarked on a  bold  foreign  policy
initiative in the Congo where South Africa had become  involved  during  the
post-Mobutu interregnum. Former President Mandela's attempts  to  arrange  a
relatively peaceful transfer of power  had  collapsed  when  Laurent  Kabila
assumed power in Kinshasa with the backing of two neighbouring countries.

South African diplomacy minimised the  capacity  of  non-African  powers  to
interfere in the Congo, so as to give the Congolese and their  neighbours  a
chance to resolve their problems. After three years  of  talks,  interrupted
by outbreaks of terrible bloodletting,  the  Congolese  factions  agreed  to
constitute a  government  of  national  unity.  South  Africa  has  invested
millions of rands to keep hope alive in the Congo. Even today South  African
forces are serving  as  peacekeepers  in  that  country  and  South  African
investors have committed themselves to the rehabilitation of  the  Congolese
economy. That might not be much, but it is a beginning.

Having nailed our colours to  the  mast  of  an  African  Renaissance,  that
vision has been further fleshed out by the actions of  the  ANC  Government.
The arrival of the new  millennium  six  months  after  the  1999  elections
offered  us  a  golden  opportunity  to  mount   Africa's   most   promising
initiative. Working at first with Algeria and Nigeria,  we  jointly  crafted
what was then named the Millennium African Project or Map. Map evolved  into
Nepad. This ambitious programme for African economic growth and  development
is premised on good governance and rapid economic growth.

South Africa was given the honour of leading the  campaign  to  win  support
for Nepad amongst the political leaders of  the  developed  countries  after
being elected to chair the African Union. Commitments  from  two  successive
G8 summits and undertakings made by the ASEAN countries  and  Japan  sustain
our optimism. But we have at  the  same  time  insisted  that  Africans  and
African governments must assume first responsibility for the  upliftment  of
our continent.

Under  the  stewardship  of  an  extremely  energetic  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs, in the person of Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, South Africa  has  been
recognised as a country punching way above  its  weight  division.  We  have
hosted a number of international conferences in which our country  has  been
at the centre of crafting new policies with a  significant  bearing  on  the
future of our continent.

Africa has adopted new and far-reaching human rights instruments during  the
past four years. Though the rights contained in these charters  are  in  the
main aspirational, their adoption is indicative of and  will  reinforce  the
growing  trend  toward  democratic  governance  on  the  continent.   Though
progress towards democratisation on the continent is still very uneven,  the
struggles  of  ordinary  citizens  and  political  activists   are   gaining
momentum.

During the course of last year, for example, employing the democratic  space
present in a number of African countries, the women of  Africa,  backed  and
supported by the women of the world, saved the life of Amina Lawal.  I  want
to take this opportunity too to congratulate the  ANC  Women's  League  that
led that campaign here in South Africa. [Applause.]

Igama lamakhosikazi malibongwe! [Praise the name of women!]

Hon MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Let it be praised!]

Dr Z P JORDAN: The creation and extension  of  democratic  space  in  Africa
requires us to defend the gains of the liberation struggle,  especially  the
civil liberties that  every  colonial  and  white  minority  regime  on  the
continent had suppressed.

As a poor and recently democratised  developing  country,  South  Africa  is
naturally extremely jealous of her sovereignty. But we have recognised  that
our country cannot hope to prosper by having  recourse  to  autarchy.  Given
that globalisation is the reality of our  modern  world,  South  Africa  has
argued, multilateralism is preferable to unilateralism in addressing  points
of tension and potential conflict in the world today. We have also  asserted
that the geopolitical changes during the second part  of  the  20th  century
required the reformation of the UN  organisation,  especially  its  Security
Council.
Few Africans realise that there have been more Al  Qaeda  terrorist  attacks
on the African continent than anywhere else in the world. To the  credit  of
African states, none of them made the knee-jerk panic responses with  shades
of xenophobia that we have seen in other parts of the  world.  South  Africa
too has joined the international campaign against terrorism, but it  has  at
the same time preserved the integrity of the democratic liberties  contained
in our Constitution.

Our  presence  in  this  Chamber  and  today's   debate   testify   to   the
fallaciousness  of  the  claim  that  you  can  purchase  security   through
repression. Terrorism is the programme of  action  of  desperate  extremists
who are totally lacking in conscience. But the actions of  such  groups  can
strike resonances in societies experiencing  the  stress  of  rapid  change.
Collapsed and failed states have afforded terrorist  networks  opportunities
to  use  their  territory  for  training  facilities  and  as  co-ordinating
centres. This underlines the need for effective and  resilient  states  that
won't collapse at the first signs of stress and tension.
Mercenary activities  which  could  easily  merge  into  terrorist  networks
continue to plague the world. This is  why  South  Africa  passed  stringent
legislation outlawing mercenaries. It is my view that our Government  should
thoroughly investigate those South African mercenaries who  are  signing  up
for duty in Iraq.  And, if they are found to  have  broken  our  laws,  they
should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

When we were debating the US/UK sponsored war in Iraq in this  Chamber  some
months back none of us realised how soon the threadbare causus  belli  would
be exposed for what it was. It's extremely disturbing to hear that  the  two
heads of government who less than 12 months ago were swearing by  everything
that is holy that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction  now  pronounce
mealy-mouthed  excuses  that  place  the   blame   on   their   intelligence
communities.

We repeatedly drew public attention to the cynical  manner  in  which  these
two governments tried to mislead  the  rest  of  the  world  with  falsified
intelligence reports, plagiarised theses and just  outright  lies.  I  trust
that it is now clear to everyone that the war was not about weapons of  mass
destruction. They did not exist, so President Bush himself now  admits.  The
war was about a demonstration of  US  military  power  and  to  serve  as  a
warning to the rest of us that the United  States  has  now  adopted  a  new
foreign policy doctrine, a doctrine of pre-emptive war that  arrogates  unto
itself the right to attack any country the US suspects might in  the  future
be a threat to its security. The dangerous implications  of  such  a  policy
thrust should be clear to everyone.

The problem of Zimbabwe must continue to occupy our  attention  for  reasons
of altruism and self-interest. Zimbabwe is our neighbour and the history  of
our two countries is intertwined. South Africa and other SADC countries  are
already feeling the repercussions of the economic decline of Zimbabwe. Self-
interest alone dictates that we assist Zimbabwe back to its feet.

Helping a neighbour, however, cannot be a  pretext  for  imposing  solutions
from  outside,  no  matter  how  well-intentioned   those   solutions   are.
[Applause.] The people of  Zimbabwe  must  resolve  the  problems  of  their
country. The obligation of friends and  neighbours  is  to  assist  them  to
reduce the high degree of polarisation in their society and  to  devise  the
means to draw the two sides of the quarrel  closer.  The  promised  national
dialogue among the key players, civil society and other stakeholders is  now
set to take off. South Africa must assist and ensure that that  dialogue  is
a success.

What must be  remembered  is  that  none  of  the  megaphone  diplomacy  and
grandstanding South Africa was being advised to  adopt,  moved  the  process
forward. It was rather the slow, patient  and  low-key  diplomacy  of  South
Africa that has nudged the two sides forward.

Regrettably, the bloodletting  in  the  Middle  East  continues.  The  great
tragedy of the Middle East is that Israel appears to feel no  obligation  to
enhance the credibility of the Palestinian  Authority.  Those  who  tell  us
that  this  conflict  is  not  comparable  to  apartheid  are,  of   course,
absolutely right. I was shocked during a visit to  Palestine  last  year  by
the concrete wall that is being erected  through  Palestinian  territory  in
open defiance of international opinion. What we have in the Middle  East  is
military occupation of other people's land by a regional minipower. This  is
something far worse than what apartheid was.

The  Spier  Initiative  was  not  an  attempt  to  export  a  South  African
negotiating model to the Middle East. I don't think  that  there  is  anyone
among us so arrogant as to believe that  ours  is  a  one-size-fits-all  and
appropriate for all situations of conflict.  The  joint  Geneva  Declaration
made by those committed to peace  from  both  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian
sides was a necessary  confidence-building  measure.  It  also  demonstrated
that there are Palestinians and Israelis who want to move beyond  the  cycle
of mutual demonisation and who are ready to explore  home-grown  initiatives
that can replace what appears to be a cul-de-sac - the US sponsored  roadmap
to peace in the Middle East.

Our optimism about the future must be tempered  by  the  hard-nosed  realism
that takes full  account  of  the  challenges  that  South  Africa  and  the
continent still face. I agree on one  score  with  the  hon  Leader  of  the
Opposition and his cohorts that South  Africa  does  deserve  better.  South
Africa deserves a better opposition  party  and  a  better  leader  of  that
opposition. [Applause.]

Kodwa oyena mntu undothusileyo ngumtwan'  omhle  wakwaPhindangene.  Kucacile
ukuba abanye bethu bayitya  kamnandi  le  ngcinezelo  sasikhala  ngayo.  Ade
athi, uNdabezitha: "Kwakungcono kwaseYiphutha."

Ewe siyavuma ukuba asikafiki  kwizwe  ledinga,  Ndabezitha.  Unyaka  ka-1994
wasibeka emazibukweni. Nangoku sisawela. Ke, mntwan' omhle, ukuba  ufumanisa
ukuba lo mthwalo uyakusinda, wubeke phantsi, mntwan'  enkosi,  uphumle.  Uya
kusifumana phambili, endleleni. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [Laphela ixesha.]
Ndiya  kuwuthabatha  umbuzo,  mntwan'  omhle.   (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[But the one who surprised me the most was the Prince  of  kwaPhindangene  -
the Minister of Home Affairs. It is clear that some of us were living it  up
during the oppression we were crying out against. Ndabezitha - the  Minister
of Home Affairs - even said: "It was better in Egypt."

Yes, Ndabezitha, we acknowledge that we have not yet  reached  the  promised
land. The year 1994 placed us at the fords. We are still in the  process  of
crossing. So, prince, if you find the burden  too  heavy  for  you,  put  it
down, my prince, and take a rest. You will catch up  with  us  later,  along
the way. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

I'll take the question.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Angikhethwanga nguwe. [You did not elect me.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Andiva? [I beg your pardon?]
The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Angikhethwanga nguwe. [You did not elect me.]

Dr  Z  P  JORDAN:  Awonyulwanga  ndim,  mntwan'  omhle,  kodwa   ke   ndithi
undothusile. [You were not elected by me, but  I  am  saying  you  surprised
me.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Ngiyozizwa  mina  ukuthi  ngikhathele,  hhayi
ukuthi ngikhishwe nguwe. Angitshelwa abafana ... [I myself will decide  when
I am tired and will not be instructed to leave  by  you.  Young  men  cannot
tell me ...] [Inaudible.]

Dr  Z  P  JORDAN:  Andiva?  Hayi,  ndithi  kaloku,  mntwan'  omhle,   "ukuba
uyakusinda". Andikhange ndithi "uyakusinda", ndithe  "ukuba".  [I  beg  your
pardon. No, Prince, I am saying, "if the burden is too  heavy  for  you".  I
did not say, "it is too heavy for you". I said "if".]

The  MINISTER  OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Kufanele  uzwiwe   yimi   uma   ungowami.
Angitshelwa ngabafana lokho. [Ubuwelewele.] [Ihlombe.] [I  am  the  one  who
should feel the burden if it  is  mine.  Young  men  cannot  tell  me  that.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman, when the President told  the  nation  last  Friday
that he did not foresee any need for new and major  policy  initiatives,  it
showed just how far removed he and Cabinet are from the needs and  suffering
of ordinary South Africans. Safely insulated from South African reality,  in
the comfort of a half a billion rand presidential  jet,  endlessly  circling
the globe while making just the occasional courtesy call  to  South  African
soil.

And again today, when the Minister of Labour  tried  to  tell  us  how  much
there is to  celebrate,  he  confirmed  just  how  out  of  touch  this  ANC
Government is with the people of South Africa. Eight million South  Africans
cannot find work and more than 22 million  live  in  poverty.  More  than  a
million jobs have been lost since the ANC came to power a  decade  ago,  and
the vast majority of  400 000 matriculants  entering  the  job  market  each
year have little chance of finding employment. Yet only  9%  of  the  skills
levy collected by the Sector Education and Training  Authorities  last  year
was actually spent, with R2,8 billion of  the  R3,3  billion  available  for
skills training lying idle. Does it come as any surprise  then,  that  in  a
global entrepreneurship monitor survey  of  entrepreneural  activity  in  38
developing countries, South Africa comes stone last? [Interjections.]

Meanwhile the Department of  Labour  and  the  25  Setas  are  immersed,  Mr
Minister, in a R1 billion fraud investigation with the officials  apparently
dipping their hands into the skills fund and robbing  8  million  unemployed
South Africans of  the  moneys  earmarked  for  their  training  and  skills
development. South Africa deserves better. With such  appalling  statistics,
no wonder the ANC speakers here use spin and subterfuge to mask the facts.

And how has Cabinet met this job crisis, our  country's  gravest  challenge?
Not by making investment and economic  growth  its  single-minded  obsession
and the cornerstone of every new policy, as the DA  does,  nor  by  amending
inflexible and impractical labour laws to attract foreign investment and  to
encourage South African employers to  take  on  new  hands,  but  rather  by
promising one million jobs through its Expanded Public Works Programme  that
lacks credibility and will never solve the problem of unemployment in  South
Africa.  For  these  are  not  real  jobs,  but  short-term,  part-time  and
unsustainable work opportunities with only 20% of them  lasting  any  longer
than four months.

These jobs are as bogus as Government's moral regeneration campaign and  its
claims to be winning  the  war  against  crime.  And  such  are  the  double
standards of  Government  that  it  exempts  itself  and  its  public  works
programme from the entire edifice of labour legislation,  including  minimum
wages and UIF contributions. Yet at the same time  it  enforces  legislation
with hypocritical vigour on the private sector.

No, there is little to  celebrate.  Government  faces  a  labour  crisis  of
staggering proportions with the latest unemployment and training  statistics
an appalling indictment of the ANC's failure to deliver on  its  promise  of
jobs and the striking indication of the failure  of  the  Setas  themselves.
Even where training is taking place, the system  is  structured  to  benefit
larger organisations rather than smaller companies, which don't  participate
properly because of the burdensome administration and the hassle factor.

 And it is for those thousands of  small  businesses,  which  are  prevented
from offering jobs to the 8 million unemployed  by  Government's  inflexible
and draconian labour law regime, that the  DA  speaks  out.  Given  the  the
ANC's attitude to small business development  and  its  ineffective  support
for  skills  development,  it  is  hardly  surprising  that  South  Africa's
entrepreneural activity rate is on average 50%  lower  than  that  of  other
developing countries like Argentina,  India,  Uganda,  Chile,  Thailand  and
Mexico - all of whom compete with us for foreign investment dollars.

No, South Africa deserves better. It needs  fewer  praise  singers  and  far
more practical solutions to increase skills,  to  develop  training  and  to
create thousands of jobs. It  deserves  genuine  and  effective  broad-based
empowerment  that  focuses  on  job  creation,  on  skills  development  and
training that starts at the bottom, not the top;  that  empowers  the  many,
and not just the few; that  tackles  poverty,  unemployment  and  inadequate
education, is measured by job creation and entrepreneurship and  comes  from
giving people skills, resources and  opportunities  to  realise  their  full
potential.

The people who need and deserve empowerment are not  the  ANC  cronies,  fat
cats and wabenzi, but ordinary people - men  and  women  from  across  South
Africa. They deserve a new kind of South  Africa  of  hope  and  opportunity
where basic work has an intrinsic dignity; where criminals  are  caught  and
punished; and where every  South  African  can  look  forward  to  achieving
prosperity and  success.  South  Africa  deserves  better.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Hon Chairperson, hon President, Deputy President,  Ministers,
Deputy  Ministers  and  hon  members,  good  afternoon.  Contrary   to   the
distorted, short-sighted arguments by the likes of the hon Tony  Leon,  Koos
van der Merwe and all those who seek to keep black people, and  Africans  in
particular, at the fringes of the mainstream economy  in  our  country,  the
ANC approach has always been informed by the understanding  that  black  and
white do not only share one country, but also a common destiny.

The ANC has identified the legacy of  colonialism,  apartheid,  poverty  and
underdevelopment as the common enemies that confront  all  our  people.  The
black economic empowerment process has indeed been  triggered  by  the  past
economic inequalities that were  systematically  created  by  the  apartheid
regime to exclude blacks  from  the  mainstream  economy.  Therefore,  black
economic empowerment is one of the  key  instruments  designed  to  confront
this legacy head-on. Only those who want this legacy to endure  are  opposed
to black economic empowerment.

The  black  economic   empowerment   commission   defines   black   economic
empowerment as an integral, integrated and  coherent  socioeconomic  process
located  within  the  context  of  the  country's  national   transformation
programme,  namely  the  Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme.   This
programme is aimed at redressing the imbalances of the past  by  seeking  to
substantially and equitably transfer and confer  ownership,  management  and
control of South Africa's financial and economic resources to  the  majority
of its citizens.

Furthermore, it seeks to ensure broader and  more  meaningful  participation
in the economy by  black  people  to  achieve  sustainable  development  and
prosperity. Black economic empowerment categorises people in certain  stages
of economy development as  follows:  the  first  category  represents  those
people living on the poverty  line,  who  represent  the  people  living  in
absolute poverty and who do not have the basic needs and access  to  skills,
and who will find it difficult to be entrepreneurs.

The second category represents those people living in the economic  survival
sector. They are stable income earners,  but  need  additional  training  to
become entrepreneurs. The third category represents the  economically  ready
group. They possess the  necessary  skills  and  intellectual  resources  to
become  fully  empowered,  but  need   access   to   finance,   preferential
procurement and enterprise development. The fourth category  represents  the
economically empowered group who exercise ownership, management and  control
over economic resources and who are fully  integrated  into  the  mainstream
economy. The expansion of  the  proportion  represented  by  the  previously
disadvantaged  individuals  in  this  group  remains  one  of  the   primary
objectives of the black economic process. This has nothing to do with  race,
colour, sex or creed.

Most  importantly,  the  ANC  has  a  programme  to  advance  all  of  these
categories. They have already tasted the  fruits  of  liberty  in  the  past
decade of freedom and will continue to do so even in larger numbers  in  the
coming decade of freedom. Everything that the  ANC  has  done  is  aimed  at
empowering blacks, not because of their colour, but  because  they  are  the
most disadvantaged sector in the economy, bore the brunt of  oppression  and
as a  group  are  the  most  affected  by  the  legacy  of  colonialism  and
apartheid.

The approach that seeks to create a division between Africans and  coloureds
will  not  succeed.  These  people  emerged  from  a  past  of   inequality,
oppression  and  exploitation.  Together  they   have   became   the   major
beneficiaries of the fruits of liberty and shall  together  continue  to  be
beneficiaries to a greater extent in the coming decade of freedom.

Regarding  the  first  of  the  categories,  we  can  list   the   following
achievements: 1,9 million housing subsidies; 1,6 million houses built;  more
than 70% of houses electrified; 9 million additional people now have  access
to water; 63% of households now have access to  sanitation;  the  successful
formation of an integrated education system; nutrition and  early  childhood
interventions established to achieve better  results  for  children  from  a
poor background of all races; and 85% secondary school enrolment in  2002  -
an excellent achievement by any standard. And yet the ANC, being the  humble
servant of the people, does not gloat  about  these  achievements.  It  says
more needs to be done and will be done in the coming decade  to  consolidate
and advance these achievements.

With regard to the second category, I would  like  to  use  the  example  of
Petro SA as an indicator. There, they  define  BEE  in  terms  of  capacity-
building, employment equity, affirmative procurement, equity  participation,
financial and other support, supplier development  and  social  development.
Nothing again about race.

During the 2002-03 financial year, Petro SA spent  the  following  on  black
economic programmes: R459 million was spent on procuring goods and  services
from black businesses; R83  million  on  human  capital  development;  R15,6
million on  human  resources  development  and  training;  R8,8  million  on
capacity-building programmes; and R50  million  on  projects  in  education,
health, environment and entrepreneurship. Excellent achievements again!  And
yet again the ANC says more needs to be done and will be done in the  coming
decade to advance and consolidate these achievements.

With regard to the third category, I  would  like  to  use  the  example  of
Eskom. Eskom's statistics on  black  economic  empowerment  programmes  show
that from 1996  to  2002  their  BEE  target  for  previously  disadvantaged
individuals was set at approximately R10,140 million,  and  yet  the  actual
amount spent was R14 million towards black economic  programmes.  The  black
shareholding companies that benefit  from  black  economic  programmes  vary
from a minimum of 20% held by black  consortiums  to  100%  black-owned  and
controlled companies. The list of these companies is exhaustive,  yet  again
an excellent advance towards deracialising our economy,  but  most  striking
on this list  is  the  domination  by  ordinary  companies  with  no  single
connection to the so-called black emerging elite.

With regard to the last category, recent studies show that  black  ownership
of the joint stock exchange's top 100 companies has increased  substantially
from less than 4% in 1997 to approximately 10% in 2002. As we celebrate  the
decade of freedom, we must  admit  that  a  conducive  environment  for  all
talented sons and daughters of this land has been created to enable them  to
reach the best of their potential.  The  ANC  recognises  and  applauds  the
pioneering  role  that  has  been  played  by  the  petroleum   and   mining
industries, as well as  the  finance  sector  in  this  regard.  We  equally
encourage the other sectors to follow this example, because it is the  right
thing to do.

But what is really important is what we as parliamentarians  do  to  advance
the implementation of Government policies. Please allow me for a very  brief
moment to examine this predicament through the failings of our time. I  have
observed in my time as a  member  of  this  House  that  some  members  have
finetuned the Judas approach: Kiss him and betray him.  These  members  heap
praises on the ANC's achievements and on the  President,  and  at  the  very
next turn they betray the ANC and the President, insult what  it  represents
and distort its policies.

When hon Seremane spoke, he tried to do this. Sir,  we  know  you.  You  are
fooling no one but yourself. When you spoke, I remembered the recitation  we
were  forced  to  recite  when  we  were  very  young.   It   was   entitled
"Waghondjies" [Watchdogs]. It went:


  Ek is hier en ma is hier.
  Ons twee lê op baas se baadjie.

Mother and I are here. We are both lying on the master's jacket. Sir,  never
allow your Africanness to be used, because it is  the  most  precious  thing
you have. When your master says to you, as they prepare your speeches,  that
it would  be  appropriate  for  a  black  face  to  make  certain  unfounded
allegations, like the one that the President is a  divisive  person  and  so
on, please be man enough and refuse for the sake of your soul. [Applause.]

Now let me dwell a little bit on the so-called  new  alternative.  Typically
of hon Tony Leon, he has said nothing  new.  It  is  still  the  old  narrow
divisive message of despair. We have heard the same message for the last  10
years. He had a unique opportunity to account to the nation and  the  voters
about the chaos their short spell of governance visited upon the  people  of
this province, the Western Cape. When voters went to sleep the  Premier  was
Marais but when they woke up the Premier was Morkel.  When  voters  when  to
lunch, the mayor was Morkel. When they  reported  for  work  the  mayor  was
Marais. He still has the audacity to proclaim himself as the alternative.

People do not want an alternative of instability and chaos. They will  never
forget that the DA's short spell of  illegitimate  governance  reduced  this
great province to a circus. No, sir, they do not want  an  alternative,  but
they want the continuity of the caring and stable  governance  of  the  ANC.
They have not forgotten the ever-increasing  evictions,  discontinuation  of
services and related miseries they have experienced - and now you think  you
can call on them to vote for you.

No, sir, they will vote for the better lives that they  have  enjoyed  under
the ANC-led Government. They know the alternative you are talking  about  is
nothing new  but  the  same  promise  you  made  to  unite  the  opposition.
According to you the opposition needed to  unite  in  order  to  effectively
fight the monster which is the black Government. In  essence  you  undertook
to mobilise those who cared to listen to your misleading, tired  message  of
despair. Needless to say, you failed dismally and your attempt  to  organise
our country into hostile  camps  fell  flat,  not  because  people  did  not
listen, not because the message did not appeal to some, but  mainly  because
of your weak leadership. Weak leadership, spineless, not even able  to  lead
a street committee. [Laughter.]

South Africans want a serious, respectable and humble leader with  integrity
to  lead  this   country   out   of   the   misery   of   poverty,   hunger,
underdevelopment, and that is none other than Thabo Mbeki, the President  of
the ANC.  He is a statesman par excellence. We speak of things we  know.  We
bear testimony to things we have seen. We have in our country  a  presidency
which has positioned itself on the will of the people,  as  the  operational
centre of the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.
Yes, when the black child travels the  world,  putting  issues  of  poverty,
jobs and underdevelopment on the agenda of world bodies  like  the  G8,  the
World Economic Forum and other distinguished bodies, we  say:  This  is  the
leader. When the black child traverses Africa with a message of hope,  peace
and good governance, we proclaim: Proudly  South  African.  When  the  black
child goes to the most remote areas of our country in humility,  asking  the
masses of our country to listen and act on their tribulations  and  demands,
we exclaim: Behold the leader, the compatriot, a true  African.  Because  of
these things, and many others,  we  must  say:  Viva  ANC!  Long  live,  the
President. Amandla. [Interjections.][Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That concludes the speakers' list  and
the business for the day. The President will reply tomorrow.

Debate interrupted.

The House adjourned at 19:03.
