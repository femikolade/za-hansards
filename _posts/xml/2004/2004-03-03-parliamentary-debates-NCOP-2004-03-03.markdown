                     CONGRATULATIONS TO CHARLIZE THERON

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek sal sonder kennisgewing voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  dat 'n nuwe naam in die  Suid-Afrikaanse  boek  van  hedendaagse
           helde gevoeg word by dié van Nelson Mandela, F W de Klerk, Chris
           Barnard, die hartpionier, Desmond Tutu, Gary Player en Ernie Els
           - dit is dié van ons eie Hollywoodster en wenner van die  Oscar-
           toekenning vir die beste aktrise vir haar vertolking in die film
           Monster; en


       (b)  van die meisie van Benoni se  prestasie  in  die  lig  van  haar
           agtergrond - dit het opoffering en deursettingsvermoë  gekos  om
           dié hoogtes te bereik;


  (2) die hoop uitspreek dat sy, soos die ander ikone van  Suid-Afrika,  as
       inspirasie sal dien omdat  hulle  bewys  het  "what  man's  mind  can
       conceive and he or she can believe in, can be achieved"; en


  (3) Charlize Theron salueer.
(Translation of Afrikaans motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that in the South African book of modern-day heroes, a new  name
           has been added to those of Nelson Mandela, F W de  Klerk,  Chris
           Barnard, the heart pioneer, Desmond Tutu, Gary Player and  Ernie
           Els - it is that of our own Hollywood star  and  winner  of  the
           Oscar award for best actress for her  performance  in  the  film
           Monster; and


       (b)  the achievement of the girl from Benoni  in  the  light  of  her
           background - it took sacrifice and perseverance to  reach  these
           heights;


  (2) expresses the hope that, like the other icons of  South  Africa,  she
       will be an inspiration because they have  proved  that  ``what  man's
       mind can conceive and he or she can believe in,  can  be  achieved'';
       and


  (3) salutes Charlize Theron.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  RECOGNITION OF STEPS TAKEN BY ANC IN REVERSING RACIAL LAND DISPOSSESSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Hon Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges the untold suffering  to  generations  of  black  people
       caused by the Natives Land Act of 1913;


  (2) notes that through this and other racist laws, millions of our people
       were uprooted from their land, had their homes  bulldozed  and  their
       dignity destroyed;


  (3) recognises the steps that have been taken by the ANC  since  1994  in
       reversing racial land dispossessions and the measures it has taken to
       ameliorate the pain, grief, trauma and despair occasioned by years of
       forced removals;


  (4) expresses its joy at the R18,7 million land claim settlement received
       by 688 Blikkies/Keidebees  land  claimants  from  the  Commission  on
       Restitution of Land Rights in Upington recently;


  (5) notes that over 20 000 households have been given back their land  in
       the Northern Cape; and


  (6) commends the Northern Cape government for the commitment it has shown
       in using land to fight unemployment, poverty and underdevelopment.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  SHOCK EXPRESSED OVER BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN AND IRAN WHICH RESULTED IN LOSS
                                OF 200 LIVES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chair, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      expresses its deep horror and shock at  the  loss  of  over  200
         innocent Shiite Muslims who were bombed in Pakistan  and  Iraq  for
         purely callous political motives;


   (2)      abhors all forms of violence and grieves with all  the  bereaved
         families of those who met this painful death as  they  gathered  to
         offer their prayers peacefully and humbly to our Creator God,  also
         called Allah;


   (3)      believes that violence begets counter-violence,  hardens  hearts
         and attitudes in the process and never redresses any loss  or  hurt
         - we in the new South Africa averted similar bloodbaths because  we
         followed the Setswana idiom that says "Ntwa-kgolo  ke  ya  molomo",
         which means that the biggest and  most  effective  war  is  through
         dialogue; and


   (4)      expresses its sorrow and concern to the embassies  of  Iraq  and
         Pakistan, and our solidarity with all the people of God as we  seek
         to turn enemies into friends.


   These are God's people too. They are part of us.

  SOUTH AFRICA'S COMMITMENT TO PEACE INITIATIVES IN AFRICA AND THE REST OF
                                  THE WORLD
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, I rise to move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes that since 1994 South  Africa  has  consistently  promoted
         peace, stability and security in Africa and the rest of the world;


   (2)      further notes that our country has actively supported the United
         Nations and sought to strengthen  its  multilateral  processes  and
         mandate, including implementing UN Security Council Resolutions  on
         the combating of terrorism, reform of peace support operations  and
         upholding the UN Charter;


   (3)      acknowledges the fact that South Africa has  made  a  number  of
         interventions  that  have  generally  contributed  to   peace   and
         stability  in  several  African  countries  and  beyond,  including
         Burundi, the DRC and Rwanda; and


   (4)      reaffirms its support for  the  efforts  of  the  South  African
         Government to help resolve conflicts in Africa to  enhance  durable
         peace and sustainable development.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 GENDER TRANSFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I hereby move a motion without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)       notes  with  pride  that  the  most  recent  figures  available
         regarding gender transformation in the public service  reveal  that
         Government has managed to break through an artificial ceiling  that
         very few countries and  organisations,  both  in  the  private  and
         public sector have thus far achieved;


   (2)      further notes that women now constitute 24%  of  all  managerial
         positions in the public service,  compared  with  the  21%  in  the
         previous year  -  the  approximately  350  women  senior  managers,
         spread across all managerial ranks, including  those  of  Director-
         General and Head of Department, are a far cry from the  handful  of
         women managers that we found in 1994;


   (3)      acknowledges that when the ANC came  to  power,  the  prevailing
         situation was still one of women  being  excluded  from  the  home-
         owner allowance scheme,  unless  their  husbands  were  permanently
         medically unfit for remunerative employment;


   (4)      further acknowledges that women also contributed differently  to
         the Government Service  Pension  Fund,  increasing  their  material
         vulnerability in old age, and that the basis for taxation of  women
         was also different;


   (5)      recognises that -


         (a)     this, with the exception of the  retirement  age,  has  now
              all changed to ensure parity;


         (b)     certain progressive measures have been  introduced  in  the
              new leave dispensation  that  move  away  from  casting  women
              exclusively in the care-giving role; and


         (c)     the burden in respect of childbearing is  still  placed  on
              the  female  employee,  while  provision  has  been  made  for
              paternal leave; and


   (6)      believes that the progress that we have made is certainly  cause
         for celebration, but that it should not blind us to  the  remaining
         challenges, and that we should continue to advance to the  ultimate
         goal of achieving full representivity of women  at  all  levels  of
         society and certainly also in the most senior ranks of  the  public
         service.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          VOTERS URGED TO CENSURE ANC AT POLLS AND TO VOTE FOR ACDP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes with concern  that  South  Africa  has  now  achieved  the
        dubious status of being the dagga/cannabis  production  capital  of
        Africa, to add to our status as  the  hijacking,  murder  and  Aids
        capital of the world;


   (2)      notes that more people are murdered each  day  in  South  Africa
        than in a full year in Scandinavia - all achievements of  10  years
        of ANC rule;


   (3)      calls upon the voters of South Africa to censure the ANC at  the
        polls and vote for a value-based political party like the ACDP that
        will bring hope to the nation.


  The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF   COMMITTEES:   Is   there   an   objection?
  [Interjections.] In the light of the objection, the  motion  may  not  be
  proceeded with. The motion without notice will now  become  notice  of  a
  motion.


    CONSIDERATION OF THE ELEVENTH REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON AFRICAN
                                    UNION


  Mr M J MAHLANGU: Chairperson and hon members,  let  me,  right  from  the
  onset, point out that as we are gathered here today, we  reflect  on  the
  work of the Council in these past five years.  I  know  that  I  am  pre-
  empting a discussion  that  will  take  place  tomorrow,  but  it  is  no
  exception that we should also reflect on the work of the Working Group on
  the African Union.


  Members will recall that several reports were tabled in this House. These
  reports were meant  to  inform  members  about  progress  that  has  been
  achieved up until now and the challenges  that  face  all  of  us  as  we
  prepare for the inauguration of the Pan-African Parliament.


  Allow me to focus my statement on the Eleventh Report which is  currently
  before the House. Members  will  recall  that  in  the  10th  Report,  we
  recommended that five members be elected to represent the  South  African
  Parliament in the Pan-African Parliament. This will be done in  terms  of
  article 4(2) of the protocol. It provides that each member state shall be
  represented in the PAP by five parliamentarians,  and  at  least  one  of
  these members shall be a woman.


  We have to congratulate ourselves on the fact that we have surpassed  the
  bare minimum requirements in terms of  the  protocol  by  electing  three
  women out of the five South African delegates.  Once  more,  this  is  an
  indication that we are on course in ensuring that women play a meaningful
  role in decision-making on the African continent.


  Allow me to read out the names of those people who will  be  representing
  us at this Parliament just to remind some members of who they are.  I  am
  constantly being asked which Mahlangu has been elected to the PAP. People
  are not sure and most papers quote Dorothy Mahlangu as the person who  is
  going to go to the PAP. The names of those who are going to PAP  are:  Dr
  Frene Ginwala, the Speaker of the National Assembly; Mrs M A A  Njobe,  a
  member of the ANC in the NA; Mr M J Mahlangu, a permanent delegate of the
  NCOP; Dr B L Geldenhuys, a New NP member in the NA, and Prof H Ngubane, a
  member of the IFP in the NA.


  The names have been submitted to the AU Commission.  The  Commission  has
  also reported that they have received names from 23 parliaments. This  is
  an indication that, as a continent, we are on  course  in  ensuring  that
  African issues are discussed on a common platform by all  representatives
  of the African people.


  We can confirm that the inaugural session will take  place  on  18  March
  2004 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This session will be presided over by  the
  current  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union,  President   Chissano   of
  Mozambique. Members of the PAP will take an oath of office and then elect
  their presiding officers. This will be  followed  by  the  first  session
  scheduled for 19 to 20 March 2004. The rules of PAP will  be  adopted  in
  terms of article 11(8) of the protocol, and committees  of  the  PAP,  in
  terms of article 12(13) of the protocol, will be established.


  Some of the committees which will have to be established as a  matter  of
  urgency  are  the  rules  committee,  budget  committee  and  credentials
  committee. Some of the office bearers who will  be  elected  include  the
  president and his or her five vice presidents, in terms of article  12(3)
  of the protocol. The challenge for the newly formed PAP will be to ensure
  that among the five office bearers we have a fair share of representivity
  in terms of gender.


  As we all know, mechanisms have been put in  place  to  ensure  that  the
  regions  of  Africa  are  represented  amongst  five   presidents.   Some
  mechanisms have  also  been  proposed  to  ensure  that  among  the  five
  presidents, gender representivity is taken into account. I  am  confident
  that the PAP will rise to the challenge and include women among the  five
  presidents.


  Another issue I wish to report on is that the House still has to consider
  how to ensure that delegates sent to the PAP will be accountable to their
  parliament, especially South Africa. I am not sure how other  parliaments
  will operate. In the last Report of the Working Group, we deliberated  on
  the importance of ensuring that the PAP, AU and Nepad  issues  are  given
  the necessary attention.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  next
  Parliament should establish a permanent committee, compared to an ad  hoc
  committee, which will deal with issues emanating from these bodies.  Such
  a committee could be a link between the delegates and the PAP.


  This is to ensure that when members leave their parliaments, they have  a
  certain mandate that they put  on  the  table,  and  deliberate  with  an
  understanding of what our Parliament wants us to deliberate on. As we are
  debating issues today, we should try to get the feeling  of  both  Houses
  and put these issues on the table at the PAP.  The  linkage  between  the
  members and House is very important.


  In conclusion, allow me to remind members that one of the  objectives  of
  the PAP is to serve as a link between the  people  of  Africa  and  their
  elected leaders at a continental level. Therefore, the success of the PAP
  will be measured by the degree to which it holds  them  accountable.  No,
  not only that, but the PAP will have to  ensure  that  at  the  heart  of
  Africa's development objectives lie the ultimate and overriding  goal  of
  human-centred development that  ensures  the  overall  wellbeing  of  the
  people through sustained improvement in their living standards.  I  thank
  you, Chairperson. [Applause.]


  Debate concluded.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The
  question is that the report be adopted. As the decision is dealt with  in
  terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain  whether
  delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to  cast  their  province's
  vote. It seems as if all the provinces' delegates are present.


  In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces the opportunity
  to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. There are  none  who
  wish to do so. We shall now proceed to the  voting  on  the  question.  I
  shall do this in alphabetical order per province,  and  delegation  heads
  must please indicate to the Chair whether  they  vote  in  favour  of  or
  against, or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?


  Ms B N DLULANE: Siyavumelana. [We support.]


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?


  Rev M CHABAKU: We are in favour.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?


  Ms D M RAMODIKE: Gauteng votes in favour.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?


  Mr H J BEKKER (KwaZulu Natal): KwaZulu Natal will support.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?


  Mr M I MAKOELA: Re a e amogela. [We support.]


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?


  Ms M P THEMBA: In favour.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?


  Mr M A SULLIMAN: Ke a rona. [We support.]


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?


  Mr Z S KOLWENI: We're in support.


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?


  Mr C ACKERMANN: Ons steun. [We support.]


  The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: All nine provinces voted in favour.
  I therefore declare the report adopted. [Applause.]


  Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with  section  65  of   the
  Constitution.


                           PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT


                          (Subject for Discussion)


  The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy  Chairperson  of  Committees,  it  is
  indeed an historic moment that we arrive at today, that we  are  actually
  debating the issue of the Pan-African Parliament  before  our  colleagues
  proceed to the inaugural meeting of  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  There
  were three historic meetings of African members of parliament that  paved
  the way for the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament. In  November
  2000 a first meeting of representatives  from  African  parliaments  took
  place in Pretoria to discuss the then draft  protocol.  In  June  2002  a
  second meeting of African MPs took place in Cape  Town  just  before  the
  launch of the African Union at the Durban Summit. Opening  that  historic
  meeting in Cape Town, I said the following:


  Parliaments are the direct expression of the will of the people. They are
  best placed to take up tasks that arise  from  the  plans  Africans  have
  begun to shape.


  Since the extraordinary summit at  Surté  we  have  witnessed  a  renewed
  energy in Africans, there is a renewed determination that the  hopes  and
  aspirations of historic leaders of Africans in Africa  and  the  diaspora
  will be realised.


  The Pan-African Congresses were the seed from which the  Organisation  of
  African Unity grew. And we are here to replant that seed in  the  African
  Union and the Pan-African Parliament. We are here indeed to make history.



As a result of this meeting, a steering committee was created to assist  the
AU Secretariat in planning for the creation of the  Pan-African  Parliament.
The third meeting of parliamentarians took place in Cape  Town  during  late
June 2003. It received reports on ratifications and it urged parliaments  to
speed up this process.

In his opening address to the conference, Deputy  President  Zuma  said  the
following:


  Colleagues, the dream of a better organised and united Africa is a  dream
  that Africans have dared to dream for decades. It  is  also  this  vision
  that had inspired the formation of the Organisation  for  African  Unity,
  and last year the African Union.


  I think we all agree that one of the most important  instruments  of  the
  African Union is contained in the protocol calling for the  establishment
  of a Pan-African Parliament.


  This is so because a parliament in which the voices of all  Africans  are
  heard is a necessary tool, not only to deepen democracy but also to  give
  expression to the aspirations of Africans everywhere.


  The launch of a Pan-African Parliament will truly herald a new  dawn  for
  the peoples of Africa. It would, for the first  time,  at  a  continental
  level, give a voice to elected African  representatives  to  monitor  and
  hold accountable the leaders of our time.

So then what is the current situation? As we heard just a  moment  ago,  the
Pan-African Parliament is soon to have its inaugural meeting in Addis  Ababa
in Ethiopia. The Deputy Chairperson of the House, as a delegate to the  Pan-
African Parliament, has told this House of the most recent  developments  in
this regard. Nevertheless, as has been indicated, there  are  a  few  points
that need to be made with respect to this important and historic event.

Firstly, although the Parliament will develop into an institution with  full
legislative powers, initially it will only have  consultative  and  advisory
powers. Article 11 says that the parliament may examine, discuss or  express
an opinion on any matter, either on its own initiative or at the request  of
the  Assembly  of  the  African  Union  or  other  policy  organs  and  make
recommendations it may deem fit relating to, inter alia, matters  pertaining
to respect of human rights, the consolidation  of  democratic  institutions,
and the culture of democracy, as well as the promotion  of  good  governance
and the rule of law.

Secondly, article 12(3) of the protocol provides for  the  establishment  of
committees. We do not yet know what the focus of these committees  will  be,
but I believe one focus has  to  be  oversight  of  the  operations  of  the
African Union itself. The  African  Union  potentially  has  17  organs.  In
addition, there are seven specialised  committees.  There  are  10  distinct
topics listed as areas in which the Executive Council of  Foreign  Ministers
will be able to deliberate. If you add the portfolio areas of focus for  the
Commission of the African Union, it could be  difficult  for  committees  of
the Pan-African Parliament to be structured in a fit manner to  monitor  and
oversee all the activities  of  the  African  Union.  This  is  one  of  the
challenges that face our colleagues.

Thirdly, there is much room for improvement in the number of women  involved
in the highest decision-making roles in  the  African  Union.  Women  hardly
feature in some key bodies of the African Union. For example, no woman is  a
head of state in Africa, and therefore there is  no  woman  on  the  highest
structure of the African Union, the Assembly. There are only  two  or  three
women Foreign Affairs Ministers on the continent.  There  is  a  very  small
female presence in the very important  Executive  Council,  which  processes
all matters and makes recommendations to the Assembly, although I  must  add
that our own Minister of Foreign Affairs is a powerful presence there.

However, we have indeed made history in Africa by appointing five women  out
of the 10 commissioners of the African Union,  the  commissioners  who  will
drive policy implementation. A woman  commissioner,  Mrs  Julia  Joiner,  is
responsible for the Pan-African Parliament.

In the immediate future we have as the most important task the  inauguration
of the Parliament, so that the people of Africa  have  an  institution  that
ensures that they are full participants in  African  political,  social  and
economic development.

We have set an example here in South Africa for the  African  continent.  We
have built a new economy. We have begun to shape  a  new  society.  We  have
built  a  new  democratic  Parliament  and  we  have   established   a   new
constitutional system of governance. Our first  10  years  of  freedom  have
been 10 years of growing unity in action; 10 years of peace  and  stability;
10 years of expanding opportunities to build a better life for all.

We have brought water and  electricity  to  millions  of  households,  built
houses accommodating  millions  of  South  Africans;  opened  up  access  to
quality education, remove discrimination in access to  professions,  created
the  basis  for  the  economy  to  become  more  productive   and   globally
competitive, and placed South Africa in a strategic position  to  deal  with
international affairs. The globe is now open to our sportsmen and women,  to
our actors and actresses - and we have won the Oscar for best actress  -  to
businessmen and women, to musicians, to academics,  to  politicians  and  to
social activists. We are now  able  as  a  people  to  partner  humanity  in
building a better  South  Africa,  a  better  Africa  and  a  better  world.
Moreover, our gentle revolution has been matched by  a  renaissance  of  the
South African spirit.

We hope that this renaissance will be a driving force in  the  establishment
of the Pan-African Parliament. The issues confronting  the  Parliament  will
involve much more than good intentions and positive aspirations for  Africa.
There have been troubling signs of an  inadequate  practical  expression  of
intent. Up to now not all  of  the  AU  member  states  have  completed  the
procedures for membership of the Pan-African  Parliament.  The  reasons  for
nonaffiliation remain obscure. It  is  worrying  that  the  Parliament  will
first sit without the representation of all African countries.  The  African
Union  Commission  should  address,  as  a  matter  of  urgency,  the   full
participation of all AU members in the Pan-African Parliament.

Once established, the Pan-African Parliament, which is set to sit for  short
periods twice a year, must ensure it acts  quickly  to  catch  up  with  the
African Union. The African Union has been in full swing since its launch  in
2002. Many  of  its  structures  have  been  established  and  a  number  of
initiatives are under way. The elected  representatives  of  the  people  of
Africa must popularise these developments and make them known to our  people
and to the world.

Furthermore,  our  Parliament  must  pursue  the  peer  review  process  and
developments linked to it, and the Pan-African  Parliament  should  take  an
interest in the reasons for the reluctance of most African member states  to
allow themselves to be peer reviewed.

Many parliaments on our continent often find it difficult to  execute  their
mandate for the people, owing to the  lack  of  resources.  The  Pan-African
Parliament must be provided with sufficient  resources  for  research,  with
legal advice and other support services if it is to succeed.

Our representatives will have to investigate all the policy issues  relevant
to speeding up African unity. Economic integration  and  a  common  platform
for planning African development will have to be  pursued.  There  has  been
much progress on the continent, particularly in  the  economic  domain.  The
Parliament must  focus  on  supporting  transparency,  good  governance  and
democracy in all AU institutions and policy practices. More  than  this,  we
must tackle  the  challenge  of  creating  conditions  of  peace  and  human
security on our continent.

The inaugural session of the Pan-African Parliament  will  be  an  important
beginning. Hopefully the Pan-African Parliament  will  be  as  open  as  our
Parliament here in South Africa. Hopefully, the  ordinary  citizens  of  our
hosts for the inaugural session will be able to  attend  the  first  meeting
and, certainly, this access will continue when South Africa is  granted  the
honour of hosting the Parliament.

We believe South Africa's offer to host should receive  strong  support.  It
will be a good decision to locate the  parliament  in  a  country  that  all
Africa supported in its fight for democracy. Locating  the  Parliament  here
will make the struggle for the total emancipation of Africa complete.

South Africa is committed to supporting the development  of  the  Parliament
into  a  viable  and  sustainable  expression  of  Africa's  commitment   to
democracy.

We urge the AU Assembly to decide on the venue, so that the Parliament  gets
fully up and running. It is clear that  much  remains  to  be  done  on  the
continent. The main message we hand to the South African representatives  is
that they must  ensure  that  the  structures  and  rules  that  govern  the
Parliament serve the objective of ensuring that the  institution  is  active
in pursuing the development and progress of Africa and her people.
In conclusion, we congratulate Speaker Ginwala on the leading role  she  has
played in steering the process of establishing the Parliament. She is to  be
commended for her exemplary leadership. We  wish  our  delegation  well  and
look forward to evaluating the impact and work of the Parliament on  African
progress and development. Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you, Chairperson. We have probably had  more  speeches  in
this House on the African Union and its component bodies than  we  have  had
on the relationship between the National Council of Provinces and  the  nine
provinces.

This is perhaps not so surprising  as  one  views  the  complete  change  of
perspective on South Africa and its position, relative to the  rest  of  the
world, which has taken place in the past 10  years.  From  an  isolated  and
besieged country under racist National Party rule, confined by sanctions  to
illegal trade, exchanging guns for oil, we have moved under ANC  rule  to  a
country which is without a doubt a major player in Africa. Certainly,  South
Africa is carving  its  way  into  the  world  governance  structures  in  a
noticeable and often admirable way. For  today  I  will  not  dwell  on  the
disconcerting exceptions reflected in its stance on Zimbabwe and Haiti.

It has driven the establishment of the African Union and, latterly, the Pan-
African Parliament in a remarkable fashion.  The  Speaker  of  the  National
Assembly has played a major role  in  this  effort,  and  will  probably  be
awarded by appointment to a very  important  position  when  she  heads  for
Addis Ababa later this month.

The South African delegation distinguishes itself by its inclusion of  three
women, but Parliament must carry the shame  for  having  left  out  of  this
group  the  hon  Colin  Eglin  who  is  arguably  its   most   distinguished
parliamentarian   and   the   personification    of    democratic    values.
[Interjections.]

According  to  its  own  rules,  the  representation  of   the   Pan-African
Parliament shall  reflect  the  diversity  of  political  opinions  in  each
national parliament or other deliberative organ. This is certainly  not  the
case with our delegation. The  short-sightedness  of  this  petty  exclusion
will still come to haunt  our  Parliament.  Anyone  who  worked  with  Colin
during the Constitution-writing phase of Parliament, such as the hon  Surty,
would be hard-pressed not to agree with  me.  However,  the  final  decision
rests with the certification committee to whom the  whole  matter  has  been
referred.

The first sitting of the Pan-African Parliament comes at  a  time  when  our
own Parliament is concluding  its  five-year  term.  Fourteen  countries  in
Africa are going to the polls this year. They  include,  besides  ourselves,
Niger,  Guinea  Bissau,  Malawi,  Ghana,  Mozambique,   Equatorial   Guinea,
Algeria, Mauritius, Botswana, Tunisia, Namibia and the Sudan.

As the members of the PAP must be duly elected representatives of their  own
country, the five South African members who will meet on the 18th will  have
a very short tenure, and it is possible that  none  of  them  will  be  back
after March. On the other hand, some members from other  countries  will  be
at the beginning of a five-year term. This will present quite  a  managerial
headache in future. Only a very firm  secretarial  arrangement  will  ensure
the smooth flow of activities as membership continues to change.

One of the most challenging aspects of the  African  Union  process  is  the
enormous regional differences which underlie  every  issue  and  which  will
certainly impact on the functioning of the PAP. This is  no  different  from
the  immense  diversity  of  other  supraregional  structures  which   have,
nevertheless, been welded into power blocs, such as the formidable  European
Union, and serves as a handy model  for  our  own  union,  both  as  regards
advantages and pitfalls.

South Africa has a major role to play in the African  Parliament.  It  is  a
continental giant, and must lead by  example  on  issues  such  as  national
identity, minorities, religious differences, corruption  and  poverty.  Most
importantly, it must lead on real democracy which, by its  very  definition,
speaks for all the people, not only for some.

South Africa deserves no less,  and  this  is  what  our  delegation  should
champion in the Pan-African Parliament. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms J L KGOALI: Hon Chairperson,  Deputy  Chairperson,  colleagues,  comrades
and everyone who is present here, today as the  launch  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament draws closer, we say once more, the time for Africa has come.  In
its strategies and tactics, the ANC departed from  the  premise  that  South
Africa is an African country. Accordingly, our approach to the continent  is
underpinned by our commitment to, and an active promotion  of,  the  African
Renaissance. This approach is informed by  the  belief  that  deepening  and
consolidating the national  democratic  revolution  is  not  only  a  matter
relating to what we do inside the  country,  but  also,  equally,  a  matter
relating  to  our  position  and  the  relationships  we  develop   in   the
international arena.

The launch of the Pan-African Parliament signals the beginning of  the  new.
The dream of a better, organised and united Africa is a dream that  Africans
have dared to dream for decades. It is the  same  vision  that  led  to  the
formation of the Organisation for African Unity, the African Union  and  now
the Pan-African Parliament.

This dream was born out of the realisation that Africa has  lost  its  value
globally. With the end of the East-West conflict on our continent, not  only
have the Cold War superpowers withdrawn, but also many parts of Africa  have
now degenerated into all sorts of conflicts within and between states,  with
serious  economic  and  humanitarian  consequences.  The  challenge  is  for
Africans to assert themselves globally, but in  order  to  do  that,  Africa
needs politically and economically strong and  stable  leadership  that  the
world can reckon with.

On the economic front, the structure and orientation  of  African  economies
remain unchanged. Most of the continent's economies  are  internal  and  not
integrated, with little or no formal functioning  of  the  economic  sector.
Social issues, poverty, disease and ignorance, 40 years after  independence,
still remain high on the list of key challenges facing the continent.

According to the United Nations Economic  Commission  for  Africa,  four  in
every 10 Africans live in absolute poverty, and expectations  are  that  the
proportion of people living in poverty on our  continent  will  increase  in
this millennium.

On  the  political   front,   the   postcolonial   state   remains   largely
untransformed in some parts of the continent.  In  such  cases  the  African
postcolonial state is being used as an  instrument  for  self-enrichment  by
sections of the political elite, rather than  creating  a  better  life  for
all. It is for this reason that access to the  state  is  so  important  for
this political elite, to the extent that elections have become a  source  of
conflict in some African countries.

It is therefore against this  background  that  Africans  have  resolved  to
establish  the  African  Union  and  initiated  the  programme  for  a   New
Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad, as an attempt  to  address  all
these ills engulfing the African continent.

The vision we have to guide us as we embark on this new and  realised  dream
of this continent, has five pillars: peace and security - to  bring  an  end
to  wars  and  violent  conflict  on  our  continent;  democracy  and   good
governance - to promote democracy, popular  participation  and  respect  for
human  rights,  improve  state   capacity   and   strengthen   people-driven
governance; development - to fight  underdevelopment  and  create  a  better
life for all, including the eradication of poverty; culture - to affirm  and
protect African culture, and to improve Africa's global standing.

The African Union and Nepad are attempts to operationalise this  vision  and
create a new value system for our continent. The African Union  provides  an
organisation vehicle for the realisation of the renaissance, while Nepad  is
the programme of action.

In this regard, the Pan-African Parliament will, for the  first  time  at  a
continental level, give  a  voice  to  elected  African  representatives  to
monitor the progress in respect of the above-mentioned initiatives. It  will
hold leaders  of  our  time  accountable.  The  launch  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament will herald a new dawn for the peoples of Africa.

The Pan-African Parliament will further ensure that governments  and  states
on the continent implement the AU  programmes  by  exercising  oversight  on
governments and states. Article 2(2) of the protocol states  that  the  Pan-
African Parliament shall represent all the peoples of Africa.

In other words, the Pan-African  Parliament  will  enable  them  to  have  a
common  platform  where  they  can  air  their  views  and  be  involved  in
discussions and  decision-making  on  problems  and  challenges  facing  the
continent.

As South Africans, we are firmly  committed  to  the  promotion  of  greater
unity among all peoples of the African continent  and  within  the  Southern
African region in particular.

I am happy to say that democratic South Africa will be an integral  part  of
the process, defining the principles of equity, mutual benefit and  peaceful
co-operation  to  which  the  Pan-African  Parliament  and   other   African
organisations subscribe. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, op 18 Maart 2004 kry Afrika  nuwe  hande,  nuwe
voete, nuwe oë, nuwe ore en 'n nuwe verstand by in die  vorm  van  die  Pan-
Afrika Parlement. Die inhuldigingsitting op 18 Maart word voorafgegaan  deur
streekvergaderings wat geskeduleer is vir 17 Maart, en wat gevolg  sal  word
deur die eerste sessie van die parlement van 19-20 Maart. Ons wil  graag  al
vyf die verkose lede van die Suid-Afrikaanse parlement, wat - ten spyte  van
geluide uit sekere oorde - sekerlik  'n  diversiteit  van  politieke  opinie
verteenwoordig, baie geluk en sterkte toewens met hulle groot en  belangrike
taak.

Daar is 'n paar aspekte van die protokol  ten  opsigte  van  die  Pan-Afrika
Parlement waaromtrent daar  myns  insiens  so  spoedig  moontlik  klarigheid
verkry sal moet word, soos artikel 6 wat sê dat  Pan-Afrika  parlementariërs
in hulle persoonlike en onafhanklike hoedanigheid sal stem. Hierdie  artikel
behoort saam met artikel 4(3) gelees te word wat  voorsiening  maak  vir  'n
diversiteit  van  politieke  menings  in  elke  afvaardiging.  Dit  kan  tog
sekerlik nooit die bedoeling gewees het dat Pan-Afrika parlementariërs  maar
die  mandate  van   hulle   parlemente,   soos   verteenwoordig   deur   die
meerderheidspartye, net eenvoudig kan ignoreer nie.

Artikel 6, saamgelees met artikel 4(3), kan myns insiens  hoogstens  beteken
dat politieke minderhede in 'n afvaardiging nie  die  politieke  meerderheid
altyd hoef te steun nie, maar dat  hulle  onafhanklik  sal  kan  stem,  soos
gemandateer deur hulle onderskeie partye.  Dit  is  hoogstens  wat  dit  kan
beteken. As dit sou beteken dat elke lid maar net kan stem  soos  hy  of  sy
goed dink, dan moet daar  sekerlik  weer  na  hierdie  artikel  gekyk  word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, on 18 March 2004 Africa is getting new  hands,
new feet, new eyes, new ears and a new mind in the shape of the  Pan-African
Parliament. The inaugural sitting  on  18  March  is  preceded  by  regional
meetings that have been scheduled for 17 March, and will be followed by  the
first session of the parliament on 19 and 20 March. We would like to  convey
our congratulations to  all  five  elected  members  of  the  South  African
parliament, who - in spite of noises from certain quarters - will  certainly
represent a  diversity  of  political  opinions,  and  we  wish  them  every
strength with their major and important task.

There are a few aspects of the  protocol  with  regard  to  the  Pan-African
Parliament about which in my view  clarity  must  be  obtained  as  soon  as
possible, such as article 6 that states  that  Pan-African  parliamentarians
will vote in their personal and independent capacity.  This  article  should
be read in conjunction with article 4(3), which provides for a diversity  of
political opinions in each delegation.  Surely  the  intention  could  never
have  been  that  Pan-African  parliamentarians  could  simply  ignore   the
mandates of their parliaments, as represented by their majority parties.

Article 6, read in conjunction with article 4(3), can in  my  view  at  most
mean that political minorities  in  a  delegation  do  not  always  have  to
support the majority, but that they will be able to vote  independently,  as
mandated by their various parties. This is at most what it  could  mean.  If
it were to mean that each member could simply vote as he  or  she  saw  fit,
surely this article should be looked at again.]

I  believe  that  in  order  to  ensure  that  Pan-African  parliamentarians
represent all the peoples of Africa, as envisaged  in  article  2(2),  there
should be the closest link possible between the Pan-African  Parliament  and
the national parliaments. The idea of an election based on  universal  adult
suffrage, as contained in article 2(3), as the  ultimate  aim  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament should, therefore, in my opinion,  be  revisited.  Should
the Pan-African Parliament  ever  be  elected  on  the  basis  of  universal
suffrage, an institution will be created which has virtually no  links  with
the national parliaments.

It may even happen that the majority of members  elected  on  the  basis  of
universal suffrage may have opposite political opinions from those of  their
peers in the national parliament. This will undoubtedly create an  untenable
situation.

The concept of the closest link possible between the Pan-African  Parliament
and the national parliaments is supported by the provisions of article  5(3)
of the protocol, which reads:


  The term of a member of the Pan-African Parliament shall run concurrently
  with his or her term in the national parliament.

An important function of the Pan-African Parliament will be to  call  member
countries, which act against the objectives of  the  Pan-African  Parliament
as set out in article 3, to account. The  objectives,  inter  alia,  are  to
promote the principles of human rights and democracy  in  Africa;  encourage
good governance, transparency and accountability in member  states;  promote
peace, security and stability; contribute to a more  prosperous  future  for
the peoples of Africa by promoting  collective  self-reliance  and  economic
recovery; facilitate co-operation  and  development  in  Africa;  strengthen
continental solidarity; and build  a  sense  of  common  destiny  among  the
peoples of  Africa  and  facilitate  co-operation  among  regional  economic
communities and their parliamentary fora.

The Pan-African Parliament should, in my opinion, as soon as possible  after
its inauguration, start seeing to it that Nepad, the  overall  programme  of
action of the African Union, is implemented, so that the lives  of  all  our
people on our continent can be improved. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  hon
members, thank you once more for the  opportunity  to  participate  in  this
wonderful and most important debate today.

I would like to take you a step  back  to  May  1994,  to  what  the  former
President said during the inauguration address to the  first  South  African
democratically  elected  Parliament,  and  I  want  to  quote   the   former
President:

My Government's commitment to create a  people-centred  society  of  liberty
binds us to the pursuit of the goals of  freedom  from  want,  from  hunger,
from deprivation, from ignorance, from suppression and fear. These  freedoms
are fundamental to the guarantee  of  human  dignity.  They  will  therefore
constitute part of the centrepiece of what  this  Government  will  seek  to
achieve, the focal  point  on  which  our  attention  will  continuously  be
focused.
With these words, a new era  of  representative  democracy  began  in  South
Africa. Today, like yesterday,  represents  yet  another  milestone  in  our
efforts to improve the socioeconomic wellbeing of our people.

We are gathered here at a time when we can look back with pride  and  boldly
proclaim that we have indeed turned the tide against  poverty,  unemployment
and economic deprivation. We are slowly but  surely  fulfilling  our  legal,
civil and moral obligation to the most vulnerable and destitute  section  of
our community. As we celebrate 10 years of our constitutional democracy,  we
should take cognisance of the fact that our Constitution is a unique one  in
that economic and social rights are integrated with and placed on equal  par
with political rights. We have indeed  put  in  place  the  necessary  legal
framework, social institutions and economic  imperatives,  and  created  the
political climate to make these rights a reality for  the  majority  of  our
people.

We are, however,  aware  of  the  fact  that  our  problems  will  never  be
completely resolved unless we start to earnestly engage with the  challenges
that the African continent faces. We  have  to  engage  not  only  with  the
continental challenges, but indeed with global efforts to fight poverty  and
economic deprivation. That's  quite  important  and  relevant  to  the  Pan-
African Parliament.

It is within this context that we should review  what  brought  us  to  this
point in our history and future.  From the early years  of  our  history  to
the demise of apartheid in 1994, Pan-Africanism went  through  a  number  of
evolutionary stages. Colonialism was  overthrown.  The  dream  of  a  united
Africa has lived in the  hearts  and  minds  of  African  nationalists,  but
remained, in substance, a dream.

The creation of the OAU on 25 May 1963 offered nationalists some  hope.  The
OAU was, however, more a regional association  than  a  federation.  In  its
charter, it simply expressed the wish to  promote  unity;  it  asserted  the
sovereign equality of member  states;  and  upheld  noninterference  in  the
internal affairs of states.

The OAU continued until 2002, as you are aware, when a  new  body  conceived
as an improvement of the OAU was established with the  assistance  of  South
Africa. With the birth of the African Union, African  nationalism  and  Pan-
Africanism have entered a new stage. Notions such as  the  conceptualisation
of a Pan-African Parliament, the significance of  women  representation  and
the intended use of African languages in the affairs of the  AU  all  appear
to indicate that the parameters in pursuit of the  ideal  of  African  unity
are changing, and indeed that is so.

As Africa confronts the realities of the decomposition of  the  postcolonial
state, it has the opportunity to redesign its political  future.  Africa  is
moving away from the design of a continent imposed on  it  by  old  colonial
powers. A united  Africa,  which  acknowledges  its  diaspora,  beckons.  An
Africa united is an Africa capable of advancement.
There is an understanding that in order to shape African nationalism  within
the concept of the African  Union  and  Nepad,  it  is  essential  that  the
African private  sector  and  civil-society  structures  are  provided  with
opportunities to engage in a meaningful manner and  are  given  a  sense  of
ownership of the initiative.

Nepad is a pledge by African leaders to eradicate poverty,  to  place  their
own countries, both individually and collectively, on a path of  sustainable
growth and development and, at the same time, participate  actively  in  the
world economy and body politic. That's very important, and  I  think  people
need to grasp and understand that.

Nepad needs political  support  and  this  is  being  provided  through  the
involvement of parliaments and the  Pan-African  Parliament  itself.  It  is
intended  that  the  PAP  will  inter   alia,   facilitate   the   effective
implementation  of  policies  and  objectives  of  the  OAU  and   AE   and,
ultimately, of the African Union; promote the  principles  of  human  rights
and  democracy  in  Africa;  encourage  good  governance,  transparency  and
accountability in member states; familiarise the people of Africa  with  the
objectives of establishing the African Union;  and  facilitate  co-operation
among regional economic communities and their parliaments' fora.

The greatest role of the Pan-African Parliament would be to be the  link  to
the public, including civil-society  organisations  and  the  NGOs,  and  to
ensure that improved governance and regional  co-operation  and  integration
are  maintained.  The  Pan-African  Parliament  seeks  to  create  a  common
platform for African people and their grass-roots organisations so as to  be
more involved in discussions and decision-making processes that  are  geared
towards engaging the challenges facing Africa. It would seek to  consolidate
the vision and aspirations of African people for greater  unity,  solidarity
and cohesion in a  larger  community,  transcending  cultural,  ideological,
ethnic,  religious  and  national  differences.  Indeed,   the   Pan-African
Parliament represents an  important  tool  in  the  continental  efforts  to
promote  human  rights,  good  governance  and  democracy  in  Africa.   Its
establishment  indeed  represents  yet  another  milestone  in  these  noble
efforts.

With the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament, it is clear  that  the
strengthening of parliaments throughout Africa, as institutions which  would
effect oversight with respect to  accountability  and  good  governance,  is
critically important. We need  to  ensure,  however,  that  the  Pan-African
Parliament is developed  and  strengthened,  and  these  could  be  done  by
cementing strong parliamentary leadership; by having institutional capacity-
building; by aligning procedures and  rules  with  capacity  needs;  and  by
designing an effective committee system.

The role of individual MPs should also not be  underestimated  because  it's
quite  important.  It  is  not  only  the  representatives  of  the  various
parliaments that have a mandate to fulfil, but individual MPs  as  well,  as
we are doing here today. It is wonderful to hear your views.  You  have  the
right to make inputs that could be taken to the Pan-African  Parliament  and
also  to  sensitise  the  grass  roots  that  you  represent  in  your   own
constituencies. For the  Pan-African  Parliament  to  succeed,  we  need  to
sensitise those people on the ground. In that respect, I  think  it's  quite
important. We need to raise these issues and  place  them  on  the  regional
agendas.

Various institutions and structures will have to be put in  place  -  people
have said that - in order to ensure effective co-ordination  of  Pan-African
activities. These structures should be established in such a way  that  they
promote public participation and strengthen  the  relationship  between  the
Pan-African  Parliament  and  the  other  parliamentary  organs  of  African
countries. They have to ensure  effective  co-ordination  between  the  Pan-
African Parliament and various organs of the African Union.

I would like to go back a little to issues that were raised in  the  debate.
Ms Botha, you raised an issue which I thought I should perhaps react  to.  I
think it's important for the members to understand  that  when  we  composed
the delegation to the Pan-African Parliament, our five delegates  were  duly
elected by the two Houses. I think it's  important  for  you  to  understand
that. It's important because there was a procedure which had been agreed  to
by political parties, particularly the Whips of all the parties,  that  that
process was wonderful and needed to be followed. The results of the  process
and outcomes were there. Therefore we should agree to  the  outcome  because
it's part of our democracy and that's the only  way  our  democracy  can  be
supported. Those were the outcomes. Even if one does not like  the  outcome,
we nevertheless agreed on the process and the results are out. Therefore  we
should agree to those outcomes.

Public  participation  is  arguably  the  most  fundamental  pillar  in  the
promotion and protection of democratic governance and its institutions.  The
success of the Pan-African Parliament will depend largely on the  extent  of
co-operation that exists between the  PAP  on  the  one  hand,  and  various
national governments and  civil  society  in  general  on  the  other  hand.
Representative  institutions  within   the   Pan-African   Parliament   must
therefore be established. Article 22 of the African Union Constitutive  Act,
for instance, makes provision for the establishment of the  Economic  Social
and Cultural Council - Ecosoc - a structure through which civil society  can
be represented on the African Union.

The Pan-African Parliament is an autonomous body.  However,  as  alluded  to
before, its success will largely depend on the extent  of  support  and  co-
operation it receives from parliamentary organs of member states.  In  fact,
article 18 is instructive in this regard, as  it  requires  the  Pan-African
Parliament to  work  closely  with  parliaments  of  the  regional  economic
communities,  the  East  African  Legislative  Assembly,  SADC   and   other
structures, as well.

I have already spoken about Nepad and I think  that  is  enough.  I  am  not
going to repeat that and other people have talked about Nepad.

In conclusion, may I thank you, Chairperson, for giving support to the  NCOP
group which participated in the larger working group, namely the  hon  Enver
and Joyce Kgoali, and I also thank P A Matthee and  Sandra  Botha  who  also
participated. I wish to thank you all. I think  we  will  be  successful.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

 EXPANDED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMES AS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR
                 THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY AND JOBLESSNESS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  am  pleased  to  welcome  the  hon
Minister of Public Works who will lead the debate, the hon Sigcau.

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy  Chairperson,  hon
members of the NCOP, first of all, I must thank you for  having  invited  us
to be part of the discussion on what I believe is a very important  subject,
not only for South Africa, but  also  for  the  rest  of  the  continent  of
Africa.

The President of our country, on 11 November 2003,  announced  the  business
plan for the programme itself. All we are doing at  the  moment  is  putting
together many of the necessary programmes, so that when the  main  programme
is launched in April, we shall be in a position to say that we have all  the
tools to deal with the programme properly.

One of the mistakes of the past  which  we  have  taken  from  the  previous
programmes,  was  not  preparing  people  properly  to   run   the   various
programmes. So, what  I  intend  doing  this  afternoon  is  actually  going
through the groundwork we have covered  in  order  to  make  sure  that  the
project will become a very useful one.

I shall also, as I'm talking, take  account  of  the  fact  that  there  are
different categories of people. Some are educated,  but  with  the  type  of
education that makes them unemployable. Some  people  are  in  the  informal
sector, but do not have  the  type  of  certification  that  recognises  the
skills that they have gathered all  along.  That  is  why  then,  as  Public
Works, we have looked at a broad range of issues to make sure  that  we  lay
down a firm foundation for what we believe is definitely  one  of  the  most
aggressive poverty alleviation programmes that South Africa is  undertaking,
and also to make sure that in this aggressive programme  of  Government,  we
have a target.

It is interesting that all parties of South Africa are  in  agreement.  I've
seen it  in  the  manifesto.  We  all  talk  about  the  one  million  jobs.
[Interjections.] So, I want to indicate how  Government  plans  to  lay  the
foundation so that this becomes a reality.

In this particular programme, within the first five years of  operation,  we
shall utilise no less than R15 billion so that we will be in a  position  to
create more than one million jobs. In that we shall include learnership  and
internships through selected infrastructure development  and  other  labour-
intensive Government-funded projects.

Amongst other things, this programme will build,  as  you  might  have  been
informed previously, 37 000 km of road, 31 000 km of pipeline, 1 500  km  of
storm water drains and 150 km of urban sidewalks. I am just quoting a  small
part of a very comprehensive programme.

The  focus  of  the  Extended  Public  Works   Programme   is   to   address
underdevelopment in the  second  economy  by  building  infrastructure.  The
ultimate goal of economic policy is to develop a single integrated economy.

The second element is the skilling of our people  so  that  they  move  from
being unemployable to employable. The target groups will be  school-leavers,
graduates, retrenched workers and other categories of unskilled people  that
we have in our country. Once they  complete  that  training,  they  will  be
better positioned to be absorbed into the mainstream economy.

In addition to this, the social sector will focus  on  community-based  care
and early childhood development. The social sector, as you know,  is  highly
labour-intensive and has low overheads. This sector will have  a  budget  of
R600 million from National Treasury, which is estimated to create  at  least
20 000 jobs.

The  economic  sector  will  provide  unemployed  people  with  learnerships
relevant to that sector. This will target 15 000 employees over five  years.
General  expenditure  by  Government  on  goods  will  be  used  to  provide
practical working experience to learners.

Sector  learnerships   and   work-based   experience   and   training   will
significantly increase the chances of entering the job market for the  first
time and re-employment after retrenchment or at the end of a contract.

In the spirit of the Growth and  Development  Summit  and  through  national
agreements, three  major  financial  institutions  have  made  proposals  to
provide financial services to learner contractors, which is really a  first.


Discussions have been held with the relevant parties  at  Nedlac.  Proposals
for business support for the programme through the Business Trust have  been
formulated and will  be  submitted  to  the  board  of  the  Business  Trust
shortly. Some donor  support  for  the  programme  has  been  received,  and
further donor support is being mobilised.

The infrastructural,  environmental  and  social  sectors  of  the  Extended
Public Works Programme have completed detailed sector plans,  detailing  how
each sector will contribute to the creation of job  opportunities  in  their
respective sectors.

In the infrastructure  sector,  a  labour-intensive  contractor  learnership
programme has been established. This programme is a joint initiative of  the
Department of Public Works and  the  Construction,  Education  and  Training
Authority, Ceta, and will  be  implemented  with  partnering  provinces  and
municipalities. The Department  of  Public  Works  will  put  in  place  the
National  Qualifications  Framework  unit  standards,   qualifications   and
accredited training programmes for contractors  and  engineers  for  labour-
intensive construction. It looks  like  everybody  will  be  going  back  to
school.

The Construction,  Education  and  Training  Authority,  together  with  the
Department of Labour, will play a crucial role in ensuring  these  standards
are implemented. At least 500 individuals  across  the  country  will  enter
into learnerships for  contractors  and  construction  site  supervisors  in
order to execute the Extended Public Works Programme. I  remember  from  the
last debate we had in this House that we were also worried about  the  whole
issue of supervising the projects that we  have,  so  we  have  catered  for
that.

Consultants and contractors who participate in  the  Extended  Public  Works
Programme will have to complete these courses to ensure that they  have  the
skills to execute the work efficiently. Train-the-trainer programmes for  35
training providers are currently  running  to  ensure  that  these  training
courses will be available across the country.

A programme to visit various provinces and municipalities is under way.  The
objective is to explain the role of both the  provinces  and  municipalities
and to give comprehensive guidelines about the  implementation  of  projects
under the Extended Public Works Programme.

Salga, the SA Local Government Association, held a conference last  year  to
which they invited us.  This  gave  us  a  further  opportunity  to  make  a
presentation on the role of  provincial  and  municipal  government  in  the
Extended Public Works Programme. We have also  made  presentations  in  this
regard to the Minmec.

Under the leadership of the Minister of Public Works,  the  Extended  Public
Works Programme introduces the highest levels of  co-ordination  across  all
departments that will be involved in the Extended  Public  Works  Programme.
Informed by the experience of the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme
and improved co-ordination across the departments,  communities  will  enjoy
better  quality  infrastructure  and  services.  Public  Works  will  assist
municipalities and provinces in the simplification of implementation.

We need to congratulate the provinces on budgets  that  show  a  clear  bias
towards poverty eradication. If you really look at some  of  their  budgets,
you'll see they're going the way of job creation, job creation and more  job
creation!

So we are not playing marbles.  We  want  to  make  sure  that  unemployment
slowly becomes a thing of the past. We also want to ensure that  our  people
do not always knock at the door of welfare, but that they have  the  dignity
of working for their own livelihood which we have given them. That  is  what
we are all about - the building of a society that we can  boast  about,  the
building of a spirit of patriotism that will make people believe  that  they
are truly South Africans and can do  things  for  themselves  in  their  own
country during their own lifetimes.

It is obvious that our objective of going to the provinces, of going to  the
municipalities and of coming up with comprehensive guidelines is  to  ensure
that implementation takes place as we expect it to.  If  some  of  you  come
back after the elections, and even if you are in retirement, just make  sure
that in your communities the work that  we  intend  to  do  gets  champions,
because there is nothing as discouraging  as  coming  up  with  plans  which
start off being exciting and thereafter start fading away.

So we rely on you, hon members as representatives of  your  communities,  to
make sure that the programme works. You know, at times  when  I  sit  in  my
office, I picture this sounding like:  Kghr-kghr-kghrooo!  Kghrooo!  Phtshu!
Tshu! Tshu! Khutshu-khutshu! ... [Laughter] ... coming from all  the  people
of South Africa who are at work. Mount Ayliff has no reason  to  have  those
dongas. Something must be  done  to  make  sure  that  there  are  land-care
programmes to bring vitality to the land.

If Singapore has successfully reclaimed land from the sea, how can we  as  a
people let our land go to ruin when we can do  something  about  it?  So,  I
want  to  believe  that  the  countryside  will  begin  to  mend,  but   the
countryside won't mend if we don't work together, if we don't come  up  with
ideas which will make this programme a reality. So,  the  challenge  we  are
setting to you, hon members, is that if you think of anything that would  be
for the good of the programme, we have the biggest  ear.  I  nearly  made  a
mistake and compared myself to the biggest  ear  who  listens  to  all  your
wishes, but we have an ear and we are prepared to listen.

As I have said, the Department of Public Works is there,  the  co-ordinator.
We have visited the provinces.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order, hon  Minister!  I'm  afraid  your
time has expired. Order!

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Lastly, I really want to say ... Even  if  you
say  "Order!'',  just  indulge  me  because  you  made  me  leave   Cabinet.
[Laughter.] We are also in line with the  topic  you  have  just  discussed,
exploring linkages and possible co-operation with the  Ministry  of  Defence
to join forces in combating  poverty  and  developing  a  resource  pool  to
address the developmental imperatives of South Africa  and  through  Nepad's
peace-keeping initiative. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members must note that  I  will  not
be as indulgent with the hon members, given that  the  Minister  did  attend
this plenary, having attended Cabinet earlier today. We were  indulgent  and
it is the penultimate sitting of the House, but  such  indulgence  will  not
recur.

Nksz P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Mandibulele  kuwe  Mama  osesihlalweni,  Mphathiswa
neenkokeli zonke ezikule Ndlu.

Iinkonzo zoluntu ezandisiweyo yindlela ethe ngqo yokuphucula  ubomi  babantu
bakowethu   nokudala   imisebenzi   namathuba    emisebenzi.    URhulumente,
ngokukhokelwa yintetho eyenziwe nguMongameli wesizwe,  iZizi,  uyibhengezile
le nkqubo yokugxothwa kwendlala. Yinkqubo  apho  onke  amasebe  athi  adlale
indima  ethe  vetshe  ukuphuhlisa  uluntu.  Asengela  thungeni  linye  ukuze
kufezekiswe  ngokugqibeleleyo   intsebenziswano   noluntu,   ukudala   ubomi
obungcono.  Uluntu  luya  kuthabatha  inxaxheba  ngokuthi  lube   yinxalenye
yokuziphuhlisa  lusebenzisa  ngakumbi  izandla  zalo.  Yinkqubo  eza  kuqala
ibaqeqesha abantu, bamelane nalo msebenzi ongakanana wokuchiliza  nokududula
iinduduma zentlupheko.

Kwiminyaka  elishumi  edlulileyo,  wayengekho  urhulumente  owayevuma  ukuba
kukho amahlwempu eMzantsi Afrika;  wayengekho  urhulumente  owayevuma  ukuba
akukho  misebenzi  eMzantsi  Afrika.  Namhlanje  wonk'  umntu  ukhomba  kulo
Rhulumente uphetheyo.

Incwadi kaMarko, isahluko sesixhenxe, ivesi ye-18 ukuya kweye-19, ithi:

"Nikwanje nani na ukuswela ingqondo? Aniqiqi na, ukuba konke  okungaphandle,
okuthi kungene emntwini, akunako ukumenza inqambi?  Ngokuba  akungeni  khona
entliziyweni  yakhe,  kungena  esiswini,   ize   kuphume   endaweni   esese,
ezihlambululayo zonke izidlo."

Ndibhekisa ke kumaqela aphikisayo, athi xa efuna iivoti ababaze  ubuhlwempu.
Ayekho phambi ko-1994, bukhona  obu  buhlwempu  engathethi  ngabo,  engatsho
nelimdaka eli.  Phofu  ke,  Sihlalo,  xa  iimvula  zehlobo  zisina  kukhonya
kukhonye nomofu, athi: "Nam ndikho apha."

Ndima ngokuzingca apha kule Ndlu namhlanje,  ngakumbi  xa  ndisenza  intetho
yam  yokugqibela  apha  kule  Ndlu,  kwesi  siqingatha  sobomi  bePalamente.
URhulumente ophetheyo kudala wamela iimpula zikaLujaca.  Yiloo  nto  ke  eza
kubambisana  nabantu  kuphuhliso,  i``people's   contract''.   Umceli-mngeni
ophambili ke kukulwa indlala kubantu boMzantsi Afrika. Kaloku lo  Rhulumente
walathiwe  ukuba  ashumayele  iindaba  ezimnandi   kwabasweleyo.   Wathunywa
nguThixo ke lo Rhulumente  ukuze  avakalise  inkululeko  kubathinjwa;  avule
amehlo eemfama.  Ndicaphula ke phaya kuLuka, isahluko sesesine, ivesi  yeye-
18 ukuya kweye-19, apho athi:

Indithume ukuba ndiphilise abantliziyo ityumkileyo;  ndivakalise  inkululeko
kubathinjwa; nokubuyiselwa kokubona kwabaziimfama; ndindulule  abaqobekileyo
bekhululekile; ndivakalise umnyaka owamkelekileyo weNkosi.

Thina  asiphethanga  nje,  sivunywa  nayiNcwadi  eNgcwele.   NoYesu   Kristu
wayelihlwempu,  yiloo  nto  wazalelwa  esitalini,   kuba   kaloku   iinkonzo
zazingekho  ngelo  xesha.  Eli   phulo   ke   lisondeza   iinkonzo   ezifana
nezibhedlele  kwaneekliniki   kubantu   bakowethu   ukuze   amaziko   empilo
afikeleleke,  inkqubo  yokunqanda  ukhukuliseko  lomhlaba,   njengoko   sele
etshilo umphathiswa, nokwakhiwa kweendlela zezwe lakowethu.

Le nkqubo iphinda yoyame  naphaya  kwincwadi  kaYohane  isahluko  seseshumi,
ivesi yeyeshumi, apho kuthiwa: "Isela alizi lingazele ukuze  libe,  lixhele,
litshabalalise.'' Mna ndingu-ANC ndizele ubomi obubhetele kuni nonke.  Qhuba
Mphathiswa; qhuba nkosazana; qhuba  maFaku,  usazi  mhlophe  ukuba  abapheli
ooTomasi. Babekho mandulo,  basekho  nanamhlanj'  oku.  Kanti  banoyolo  abo
bangahlaliyo kwiimbutho zabagxeki.

Le nkqubo inika uluntu  umnatha  khon'  ukuze  uluntu  luzilobele  iintlanzi
ngokwalo, lungasoloko lunikwa  iintlanzi  imihla  nezolo.  Yinkqubo  le  eza
kushiya abantu benobungcaphephe, khon' ukuze kukhule  umgangatho  woqoqosho.
Kambe ke, Mphathiswa, abantu mabafundiswe, bachazelwe kakuhle  ngale  nkqubo
ukuba ayina kunika misebenzi  esisigxina,  koko  iza  neendlela  zokuncedisa
abantu  ukuze  nabo   bazivulele   imisebenzi   ngokwabo.   Yinkqubo   ezama
ukusiguzula ekusebenziseni  oomatshini  isibuyisele  kwimisebenzi  yezandla.
Sisebenza elimeni ke. Ukuze ke ingonakali le nkqubo,  kufuneka  sibambisane.
Xa imkile imitshini, maze kungasweleki umlandeli emkhondweni wam.

Isebe  likaMphathiswa  maliyenze  lula  inkqubo   yokhuphiswano   kwiinkonzo
ezikhutshwa nguRhulumente khon' ukuze wonke ubani axhamle. Eli  sebe  limele
ukuba libe bubuso belizwe lakowethu.

Iimeko zendlela nezakhiwo zikaRhulumente mazibe  semgangathweni.  Ndiyaqonda
ukuba kwiinkqubo namaphulo eli sebe angaphambili, noko sibe nakho  ukufunda.
Iincutshe ke  zokuphuhlisa  uluntu  luluntu  ngokwalo.  Mayihlome  ihlasele,
kuliwe indlala!

Asithethi ke ngabo  banamabhongo  kaNomathemba,  abatshambaza  nje  bengenzi
nto, bavuthelane oku koonomasele.  Le  nto  iyindlalo  kwi-DA,  yokugrogrisa
abantu  bethu  ngemisebenzi  engekhoyo,  iyintlungu  kuthi   kuba   siyayazi
indlala.  Ndiyabulela,  Sihlalo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
speech follows.)

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Thank you, Chairperson, hon Minister and all leaders  in
this House.

The expanded public  works  programme  is  an  essential  exercise  for  the
improvement of the life of our people and create  employment  opportunities.
In his state of the nation address, the President, Zizi, talked  about  this
programme, so, therefore, Government is guided by it. It is a  programme  in
which all state departments have to play a remarkable role in improving  the
living conditions of our people. They  work  hand  in  hand  effectively  to
implement policies with the public participation to better  people's  living
conditions. The public is meant to participate  by  initiating  things  that
they do with their own hands. People will first  be  trained  so  that  they
could acquire the necessary skills required so that they can cope  well  and
be able to push back the frontiers of poverty.

The government that was in power ten years ago, the government  denied  that
there were poor people in South Africa also denied that there were  no  jobs
in South Africa. Today, everybody points fingers at  this  Government.  Mark
7:18-19 goes:

Don't you understand? Nothing that goes into a person from the  outside  can
really make him unclean, because it does not go into his heart but into  his
stomach and then goes on out of the body.

This is directed to opposition parties that always mention poverty  to  gain
party-political  points.  They  existed  long  before  1994  and  there  was
poverty, but they never talked about  it.  However,  now  that  things  have
changed and a new government is in place, many have something to say.
As I rise before this House today, I fell very proud, especially because  it
is for the last time that I am addressing it.  This  Government  has  always
stood for poor people.  That  is  why  it  is  committed  to  honouring  the
people's contract. The main challenge we are faced with in South  Africa  is
fighting poverty. The Government has been given the mandate to deliver  good
deeds. This Government has been chosen by God Almighty to free  people  from
slavery and open the eyes of those who cannot see. Luke 4:18-19 goes:

The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has chosen me  to  bring  good
news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty  to  the  captives  and
recovery of sight to the blind; to set free the oppressed and announce  that
the time has come when the Lord will save his people.

The Good News Bible asserts our right to be in power. Even  the  Lord  Jesus
Christ was poor. He was born in a stable because there were no  professional
health services  available  then.  This  campaign,  therefore,  is  bringing
hospitals and clinics closer to people so that they could have easy  access.
It is also aimed at infrastructure development,  which  would  also  include
road construction. John 10:10 goes: ``The  thief  comes  only  in  order  to
steal, kill and destroy.''

We, as the ANC, have brought new  life  to  you  all.  I  applaud  you,  hon
Minister. Do continue to do out the good work, daughter of  the  Fakus.  You
know very well that there will always  be  Thomases.  They  existed  before;
they are still here even today.

This programme is preparing ground for people who  want  to  do  things  for
themselves. People are going to be empowered and enabled to gain  skills  so
that there can be sustainable economic development. However, people must  be
educated and it needs to be explained that this programme will  not  provide
permanent jobs, but that it is only an expanded way of assisting  people  so
that they too can  initiate  things,  in  that  way  opening  up  other  job
opportunities. It is reintroducing  us  to  labour-intensive  programmes  of
work. We should work as a team. In order for it to succeed, we need to  work
together. When we have introduced labour-intensive programmes, I trust  that
there will be people to fill the  gap.  The  department  that  the  Minister
heads should simply rules so that everybody could get a fair chance in  this
programme.  Roads  and  Governemnt  buildings  should  be  in  the  best  of
conditions. I believe that we learnt a number  of  things  during  the  past
campaigns that were organised by this department. The whole  of  society  is
responsible to develop  itself.  Let  us  roll  up  our  sleeves  and  fight
poverty!

I would not like to  mention  the  likes  of  the  DA  that  cannot  produce
anything they have done for  the  people  of  this  country.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon colleagues, in his address to  the
nation on 6 February 2004, the hon President of the Republic  set  the  tone
for the harnessing of Public Works initiatives  to  attack  the  scourge  of
poverty and unemployment  in  the  country.  We  have  just  heard  the  hon
Minister who has clearly defined  areas  for  Government's  intervention  in
this regard. I just want to say that I certainly welcome the hon  Minister's
statement about the situation of  soil  erosion  in  various  parts  of  our
country, and I agree with her exhortations to ensure that we must claim  our
land where erosion has ``uglified'' the landscape.

In any Public Works  Programme  the  involvement  of  local  communities  is
paramount. The DA  welcomes  the  Minister's  remarks  about  the  potential
possibilities of extended programmes in the arena of Public Works  in  order
to engage communities  in  employment  as  a  first  step  towards  fighting
unemployment and poverty. However, the DA warns: let us not dupe the  people
of South Africa into believing that getting  jobs  to  refurbish  buildings,
build roads and  infrastructure,  upgrade  storm  water  pipes,  repair  and
renovate flats, construct police stations and clinics and  a  whole  lot  of
short-term work constitute a panacea for our  ills.  The  duration  of  such
work is usually short, a few days or weeks or even months,  and  our  people
want work of a permanent nature rather than jobs for a few weeks or days.

While these programmes, if closely monitored, can contribute  to  addressing
the infrastructural backlogs  in  South  Africa,  they  certainly  will  not
arrest the unemployment crisis.  Only  higher  savings  and  investment  can
provide the golden thread to higher income and job creation.

The people of this lovely land, however, are  not  yet  out  of  the  woods.
While we celebrate a decade of democratic freedom, while  we  celebrate  the
fact that millions have access  to  potable  water  and  electricity  and  a
modicum of decent housing, there are millions yet of fellow  South  Africans
who are left behind or feel left behind. Some 8 million South  Africans  are
out of work. Some 22,5 million South Africans are living in abject  poverty.


These are not just cold statistics. They represent human  beings,  pulsating
with life, who must never be left outside on the  pavement,  peering  inside
the windows with a sense of expectancy and despair. South Africa needs  real
change for a better South Africa for all. Therefore, the DA says,  nay,  the
DA insists that the Government of South Africa reverse its position  on  the
basic income grant so that life can change for the better. The basic  income
grant of R110 per month will help millions of poor  people  enter  the  cash
economy.

My party in KwaZulu-Natal welcomes the building budget  for  the  SA  Police
Service, especially for  repairs  and  renovation  to  police  complexes  in
Inanda and Richmond, the building of new complexes at  Babanango  and  Upper
Thukela,  and  the  upgrading  and  servicing  of   sewerage   systems   and
electricity. For too long, the  Police  Service  in  our  country  has  been
expected to do a lot, but,  unfortunately,  it  is  not  given  the  credit,
recognition and, most importantly, the resources it needs.

Hon Chair, with your indulgence, I would like to  conclude  by  taking  this
opportunity to say goodbye to the House and to my fellow hon  colleagues.  I
have thoroughly enjoyed  my  sojourn  in  the  House.  I  have  enjoyed  the
cameraderie and the often heated exchanges between the hon  members.  At  no
time  did   our   confrontational   ping-pong   descend   into   fratricidal
proportions. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms  B  THOMSON:  Uyazi  Sihlalo,  oRaju  bayahlupha  ngoba  noma  sebexoshwa
ababoni. Lezi zinto azishoyo kule Ndlu singazithatha nje sihleka kodwa  [You
know, Chairperson, Raju and company are irritating because they  don't  even
see when they are being gotten rid of. These things he  is  saying  in  this
House can be taken as a joke but ...]

... it's very serious, because this is what they are saying to our people.

...  bebathembisa   ukubanikeza   imali   kadekle   uxakeke   ukuthi   imali
bazoyithathaphi bona ingekho nohulumeni engenayo.  [...  promising  to  give
people basic income grants, and you get confused as to where they are  going
to get this money that even the Government does not have.]

We also believe that the number of grants we have are quite  sufficient  for
our people. When the ANC came into power in 1994,  we  knew  that  we  would
have to correct the imbalances of the apartheid  past.  We  also  knew  that
these imbalances would require an intensive reconstruction  and  development
strategy to ensure that our people could have  some  semblance  of  normalcy
after the abnormal society we inherited.

For the ANC this meant that every single government department  in  the  new
regime would have to be transformed to  meet  the  priorities  of  this  new
agenda, and, for the past 10 years, we  have  also  set  out  systematically
reconstructing a society that addresses the  historic  underdevelopment  and
deprivation that was the cornerstone of our society.

According to Statistics SA, it is estimated that  since  1995  approximately
28% of households and 48% of the  population  have  been  living  below  the
estimated poverty line. In 1999 it was estimated that 45%  of  female-headed
households 26% of male-headed  households  were  living  below  the  poverty
line.

With this new overwhelming backlog of services to the  vulnerable  in  South
Africa, the  Department  of  Public  Works  embarked  upon  a  Public  Works
programming initiative  geared  specifically  towards  poverty  alleviation.
Indeed, the eradication of poverty by any and all means  at  their  disposal
has been part of the ANC-led Government's policy priorities  since  we  came
into power in 1994.

This Expanded Public Works Programme is not  the  only  such  initiative  to
roll back the frontiers of poverty and should not be seen in isolation,  but
in the broader context of the Government's measures to address  poverty  and
unemployment.

Ngiyacabanga  ukuthi  uyezwa-ke  mhlonishwa  uRaju  ukuthi  [I   think   you
understand, hon Raju, that ... ]

... it's not actually the sole responsibility of Public Works  to  eradicate
poverty.  They  merely  contribute  to  the  whole  exercise.  It's  just  a
contribution from the department. It  is,  in  fact,  complementary  to  the
social grant programme central to the Department of Social Development.  The
social assistance given in the  form  of  social  grants  remains  our  most
fundamental poverty eradication tool and should not  be  seen  as  being  in
competition with the Public Works Programme.

The primary focus of the Public Works Programme is to develop highly labour-
intensive projects and move away from machinery intensive of works,  thereby
creating more employment for a  large  number  of  South  Africans  in  dire
straits. Also, this  Public  Works  Programme  tries  to  provide  a  bridge
between our growing economy and  the  disproportionately  large  numbers  of
unskilled and unemployed people who  have  found  themselves  excluded  from
economic development.

Minister, we would also like to commend the department for  coming  up  with
this recognition of prior learning. I think it will tie in  well  with  what
I've just said now. So, this initiative seeks  to  create  jobs,  invest  in
social and economic infrastructure and expand human resources based  on  the
training of participants in the programme.

Indeed, the Community-Based Public Works Programme was structured in such  a
way that it targeted, primarily,  the  rural  poor.  More  importantly,  its
objective was to create short-term work opportunities for the  poor  through
the construction of  public  assets  ...  ``lokhu  besibonile  ukuthi  uRaju
akakwazi'' ... [we saw that Raju does not know this.]

... by creating business opportunities with community assets the rural  poor
is targeted.

Built into the targets of this component of the Public  Works  Programme  is
that 30% of the budgets of projects is to be  spent  on  local  labour,  50%
should be on women, 15% should be on the youth, and another 1,5%  should  be
on the disabled. Already,  there  has  been  tangible  evidence  that  these
programmes have been implemented through the creation of community  gardens,
the  building  of  public  roads,  the  Working  for  Water  projects,   and
multipurpose centres and projects that  protect  the  environment  like  the
correcting of soil erosion.

In fact, since 1998 the programme has employed 127 683 local  workers  on  3
152 projects valued at R1,4 billion. Of these workers, 52  616  were  women,
52 904 were youths and 2 335 were disabled people.

On the issue of gender  equality,  despite  our  numerous  initiatives,  one
being the identification of nodal points in the context of urban  and  rural
development programmes, we are still lagging behind.

When it comes to rural development, we have  identified  the  areas  of  our
communities where the most marginalised sectors live. It is also  here  that
we have identified the need to focus our social spending.

This is the nature of our Expanded Public Works  Programme,  a  place  where
large numbers of our unemployed can be drawn  into  productive  work,  where
they can get enhanced training in existing skills, or be taught  new  skills
necessary to become more productive members of society.

We know that we have made a lot of strides to improve the  circumstances  of
our jobless poor, but we understand that we still have a long way to  go  to
completely address all our concerns. To this end, the  struggle  of  poverty
eradication still continues. Ngiyabonga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Minister Sigcau and colleagues,  before  one
can even attempt to  analyse,  let  alone  completely  understand  the  very
complex and social concept of poverty, an effort should be  made  to  define
it  from  various  perspectives  and,  finally,  decide  on  an  operational
definition which can be used in the process of developing solutions.

S J Olivier quotes a statement by September in her doctoral thesis  in  that
it is  at  the  point  of  attempting  to  define  poverty  that  a  lot  of
controversy arises as there seems  to  be  no  single  and  all-encompassing
definition of the problem. She agrees  with  the  opinion  of  experts  like
Glewwe and Van der Gaag that different population groups are  classified  as
poor through different  definitions  and,  therefore,  that  the  strategies
employed  to  solve  the  problem  will  be  affected  by  these   different
definitions.

Traditional  definitions  categorise  poverty  into  two  concepts,   namely
absolute poverty and poverty in relative terms. Olivier quotes  Kgarimetsa's
description of the former as a state of extreme human deprivation,  a  total
lack of basic necessities and a total failure to  satisfy  the  basic  human
needs, while Kritzinger and others are of the opinion that  it  implies  the
absence of the absolute minimum required to survive  and  the  inability  to
attain a minimum standard of living. Others,  again,  use  the  basic  needs
approach to define poverty by stating that households are  defined  as  poor
if their food, clothing, medical, education and other needs are not met.

Relative poverty, on the other hand, is quoted by the same S  J  Olivier  as
the unequal distribution of resources and denial of the poor to gain  access
to opportunities to advance themselves,  that  is  opportunities  to  become
gainfully employed and that, from a development  economics  point  of  view,
poverty is described by the number of people living below  a  minimum  level
of income. Relative poverty is generally associated with a low level of  per
capita income and increasing inequalities, and the distinction  between  the
rich and poor is measured  in  terms  of  either  the  poverty  datum  line,
minimum subsistence  level,  household  subsistence  level,  minimum  living
level or supplementary living level.

As poverty is also related, in terms of household  consumption,  per  capita
food consumption, to food ratio, calorie intake and  medical  indicators  of
health and nutritional status, poverty can also  be  defined  by  measurable
indicators.

A further  concept,  namely  the  three-dimensional  perspective,  describes
poverty from the economic, social and political angles. The  economic  angle
views poverty in  terms  of  a  lack  of  resources,  land,  infrastructure,
production materials and  no  or  minimal  access  to  credit,  markets  and
production assets. The social viewpoint,  on  the  other  hand,  is  of  the
opinion that a lack of shelter and sanitation,  and  a  lack  of  access  to
health, education and recreation facilities constitute poverty.

To be able to address the issue of  poverty,  it  is  necessary  to  gain  a
thorough understanding of it  by  identifying  its  components  and  thereby
recognising it as a problem. The statement by  the  Department  of  Economic
and Social Development of the United Nations that poverty, unemployment  and
low-productivity employment are of the highest concern  to  many  developing
countries, leads one to conclude that poverty is  a  truly  global  problem,
and that this grave  social  and  economic  problem,  with  its  devastating
effects, knows no frontiers.

The  fact  that  church  leaders,  politicians,  economists  and  Government
officials are concerned about the nature and  extent  of  poverty  in  South
Africa, and that journalists regularly report about  the  plight  of  street
children, the poor, the aged and the disabled, conclusively shows that  even
in South Africa poverty has been recognised to be a problem. The  fact  that
regular conferences and  seminars  on  poverty  are  held,  illustrates  the
degree of seriousness with which this problem is being considered  in  South
Africa.

The following are identified as the  major  components  or  key  factors  of
poverty and could be seen as the critical performance areas for  a  strategy
to combat poverty. In terms of lack of food  and  the  provision  of  social
services in general, according to Maslow's hierarchy of  needs,  food  would
be the basic  human  need.  The  fact,  however,  that  sufficient  food  is
produced in a country does not necessarily  mean  that  nobody  suffers  the
lack of it or that it is accessible to all households.

Those who produce food do so as an economic activity which would produce  an
income for themselves. They sell their products to the consumers who have  a
source of income which would enable them to purchase  the  products.  Except
in cases where it is done as part of a welfare or charity exercise, food  is
nowhere available free of charge.

According to the United Nations, famine and hunger are caused  primarily  by
a lack of purchasing power which is a characteristic of  poverty.  The  poor
have neither an adequate income, nor assets that can be exchanged  or  sold.
The unemployed who do not  have  a  regular  source  of  income,  therefore,
suffer from a chronic shortage and, even worse, a total lack of food.

Wilson and Ramphele state that there is widespread hunger and  malnutrition,
and that  diseases  associated  with  poor  nutrition  take  a  heavy  toll,
particularly amongst children. Other particularly vulnerable groups are  the
elderly, pregnant and lactating mothers and  schoolchildren.  Secondly,  not
only is there a backlog in the provision of housing  in  South  Africa,  but
all too often the existing shelters are inadequate in  that  there  is  poor
sewerage, refuse removal and ability to  keep  up  with  the  South  African
climatic extremes of rain, damp weather and cold or heat.

The poor's major constraint in increasing  their  economic  productivity  is
the large amount of time needed to  deal  with  daily  necessities  such  as
fetching water and fire wood - an activity on which more  than  three  hours
is spent per day. Because of poor access to clean water and proper  sanitary
conditions, poor people suffer from added disadvantages  resulting  in  poor
health, which further impacts on their productivity and quality of life.

In the third instance, illiteracy and education are the  issues.  Illiteracy
is also a major  component  of  poverty  in  South  Africa.  The  impact  of
illiteracy and poor education in South Africa  is  mostly  of  a  political,
social and economic nature. It results in low  productivity,  slow  economic
growth, low personal per capita income,  underemployment  and  unemployment,
and a high dependency rate on  a  limited  number  of  breadwinners  in  the
extended family.
In the last instance, there are the issues of unemployment and  insufficient
income. Income, in the most basic economic sense, is  the  reward  that  one
obtains for one's labour and which is used to purchase  goods  and  services
designed to satisfy one's needs. The root of poverty in a market economy  is
therefore an inadequate income, which fails to buy the products or  services
which are required to provide for basic human needs.

When the question is posed as to what causes poverty in  South  Africa,  the
most consistent answer is the chronic lack of sufficient  income  caused  by
unemployment.  This  leads  one  to  conclude  that  unemployment   can   be
considered to be a  major  determinant  of  poverty  in  South  Africa.  The
problem of unemployment in South Africa is compounded by the total  lack  of
assets of large parts of the population, and this leads them to rely  solely
on their labour to improve their income opportunities.

Unemployment is  by  far  the  most  important  cause  of  poverty  in  most
countries and the most  serious  economic  problem  in  the  world.  Closely
linked is insufficient income, which is a grave problem of the poor  in  all
countries of the world.

Unemployment is the root of poverty. Unemployment and  underemployment  are,
according to the United Nations, the most serious economic problems  in  the
world and by far the most important causes of poverty in all  countries.  No
employment means no income. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M G VANTURA (Western Cape): Madam Chairperson,  I  bring  greetings  from
the provincial legislature of the Western Cape. I would  just  like  to  say
that the ANC members in  the  legislature  welcome  the  announcements  made
yesterday by the MEC for finance, MEC Ibrahim Rasool, in his budget speech.

A better life for all is our promise to the people.  As  Government  we  are
collectively accountable to delivering on this promise.  People  in  general
do not see Government as  being  made  up  of  separate  spheres  which  are
distinctive,  interdependent  and  interrelated,   as   set   out   in   the
Constitution. Instead, the majority of people see Government as  government,
and not as national, provincial or local.

We are, and will continue to be, held responsible collectively. One  of  the
primary objectives of the local government, as set out  in  section  152  of
the Constitution, is to promote social and economic development. Since  1994
the chronic need for infrastructure development has dominated the agenda  of
local government, and correctly so. Access to  basic  services  with  viable
shelter is the foundation on which we must build.

Without having adequate drinking water, sanitation, clean energy and  access
to transport, we cannot hope to stimulate social and  economic  development,
because our people would expend all their resources just to  overcome  those
obstacles. We have  made  impressive  progress  in  the  roll-out  of  basic
services and infrastructure development at local level.  We  are  now  in  a
position to put the next level of development in place.

Local government must be commended for having achieved so much in the  first
10 years of democracy. Indeed, that experience  is  invaluable  in  ensuring
delivery of the social and economic development agenda. The  declaration  of
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme,  the  Urban  Renewal
Strategy,  the  nodal  development  areas,  the  LED  programmes  and,  very
importantly,  the  IDPs,  are  all  about  ensuring   the   integration   of
infrastructure and  basic  service  development  with  social  and  economic
development.

This is a profound shift in the focus of local government which  impacts  on
the other two spheres of government. However, no  longer  can  we  make  the
assumption that infrastructure development will automatically give  rise  to
socioeconomic  development,  or  that  basic  services  will   automatically
empower people to develop sustainable  livelihoods  for  themselves.  Whilst
these  conditions  are  a  prerequisite,  they  can  sometimes   result   in
unintended consequences, such as the cost of  services  being  unaffordable,
resulting in hardships and loss.
It is important that development becomes systematic, in  other  words,  that
we develop people along with the resources  around  them.  We  must  develop
people to be able to take up the  opportunities  and  equip  them  with  the
tools that will enable them to participate in  the  local  economy  so  that
they can generate their own income, their own  food  and  their  own  social
safety nets. In order to do so, we have to critically  analyse  the  concept
of community development and what we mean by it.

In recent times a new buzz word has emerged that  attempts  to  measure  the
value of community,  so  that  one  can  understand  the  sustainability  of
development projects in  specific  communities.  Here  I  am  talking  about
social  capital.  The  term  "social  capital"  means  different  things  to
different people. The definition varies  quite  considerably,  but  for  the
purpose of this discussion, I will refer to the  one  that  the  World  Bank
uses. Social capital refers to the  institutions,  relationships  and  norms
that shape the quality and the quantity of a society's social interactions.
Increasing evidence shows that social cohesion is critical for societies  to
prosper economically and for development to be sustainable.  Social  capital
is not just the sum of the institutions which can underpin a society. It  is
the glue  that  holds  them  together.  It  is  the  latter  statement  that
characterises social capital as the glue which holds civil society  together
that is most insightful.

It goes without saying that this can only come about through  trust  between
people  and  structures  of  Government  and  society,  be  they  formal  or
informal, be they governmental or nongovernmental. Without  trust  there  is
no social capital. That, I believe, is the essence of  community,  and  that
is what we must seek to build when we talk about the community. It is  about
building strong communities that will  bring  about  our  aim  of  a  caring
society, a caring and self-reliant society; the way in  which  we  go  about
ensuring that as government we provide integrated service  delivery  to  our
people.

Without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest national priority now and for  the
foreseeable future will be the fight against poverty. This will  inform  our
strategy, as well  as  our  vision  for  the  way  forward.  Whatever  one's
definition of poverty, whatever one attributes to being the root  causes  of
poverty and whatever one's ideological  viewpoint  is,  we  all  agree  that
sustainable development  is  the  answer.  Debates  will  not  feed  people,
research will not feed people and ideology will not feed  people.  Practical
implementation, however, will.

Having said that, moving ahead  without  research,  strategic  planning  and
debating our implementation plan is  not  sustainable,  but  self-defeating.
Therefore the key  aspects  for  further  development  are:  one,  community
participation, because communities must own the strategy - without a  buy-in
at community level, any intervention  will  not  be  sustainable;  two,  the
transversal nature of  poverty,  because  poverty  is  multidimensional  and
affects every aspect of life; it is not only about  money,  but  also  about
nutrition, health, safety, access  to  assistance,  opportunity,  education,
skills, employment, etc. Poverty must be tackled at all levels in  order  to
make a real change.

I now  come  to  Vuk'uzenzele  and  regenerating  the  moral  fibre  of  our
communities. Centuries of oppression, active discrimination and  the  social
ills that befell our society must be  addressed  to  the  extent  that  they
eroded the very fabric of our society. We cannot  hope  to  succeed  in  the
fight against poverty without being anchored in a strong society.

Local government is always at the coalface of government implementation  and
therefore the IDP processes are absolutely crucial in the implementation  of
Government  strategy  on  poverty.  The  development  and   maintenance   of
infrastructure is what the rest of us can only  build  on.  A  strong  local
government sector is an absolute necessity.

Public Works programmes  will  be  used  to  kick-start  employment,  skills
development, economic activity and  infrastructure  development,  but  their
success is dependent on sustainability which, in turn, depends on all  other
aspects also becoming realities.

Co-ops  and  home-industry  support  networks  are  areas  of  microbusiness
development that  will  be  the  most  productive  in  creating  sustainable
livelihoods. Clothing manufacturing, fishing,  agriculture,  building,  etc,
are all activities that can provide an income for survival. Co-ops can  also
provide the platform for the distribution of benefits  and  the  pooling  of
resources. With co-ops communities  have  the  opportunity  to  access  much
greater assistance for funding and financial backing than  they  would  have
as individuals. Once again, this depends on the structures that are  put  in
place to support the co-ops and to stop them from becoming conflict-ridden.

Government provides a safety net in  a  variety  of  ways.  With  regard  to
social services and poverty alleviation, we pay social grants  and  pensions
to the vulnerable, such as the elderly and the disabled and to children  who
qualify for the child support grant.
In addition, we fund subsidised projects, programmes and  institutions  that
further strengthen that social safety net. Further still, we do a  range  of
capacity-building projects and funding which seek to strengthen  the  social
fabric of communities.

Our vision is to build  a  self-reliant  society.  We  believe  that  it  is
obvious that the Government cannot do this  alone  and,  in  any  event,  by
definition a self-reliant society means that the measure of our  success  is
the extent to which we can develop people and the social structures  in  our
community so that they are not reliant on Government.

This Government is a caring government, and therefore  self-reliance  cannot
ever mean that we will not take care of the vulnerable in  our  society.  On
the contrary, the concept of self-reliance is the very  basis  on  which  we
have been able to make more resources available to those who are  unable  to
be self-reliant, such as the aged, the severely  handicapped,  children  who
are food-insecure, and the indigent. At the moment we have  half  a  million
people in this province alone  receiving  grants/pensions  from  Government,
totalling more than R280 million per month.

The building of our communities is the building of our  common  destiny.  By
building strong communities we are building a bright  future  and  a  better
life for all. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Hon Chairperson,  I  welcome  the  presence  of  the  hon
Minister of the department. I will also take  this  opportunity  to  welcome
back the hon Raju from his record-breaking one-day suspension  inflicted  by
the DA. It is just a pity that this one-day  suspension  inflicted  so  much
pain on the hon member that he had a memory lapse, a memory  lapse  in  that
he forgot that you cannot forever be building a police station.  There  must
be a time when it is completed and you thank the workers. You  cannot  build
a school forever; there will be a stage when the  school  is  completed  and
you thank those workers. The same goes for clinics and so on.
It would be interesting to know where Mr Raju was after those  clinics  were
built. He forgot that there are nurses who  are  appointed  permanently.  We
must make a distinction between the two. Waar was jy, mnr Raju? [Where  were
you, Mr Raju?] It would be interesting to know where Mr Raju was  after  the
schools were built. There are teachers who were appointed permanently. O  ne
o le kae, Mna Raju? [Where were you, Mr Raju?]

I would also like to respond  to  the  issue  of  the  basic  income  grant,
because our Government has  a  very  comprehensive  social  security  system
which includes the recently increased pensions, the  child  support  grants,
the support grants for the  disabled,  food  parcels  and  feeding  schemes.
Those children who are guarded by the old pensioners, the  old  mothers,  do
participate in these feeding schemes at school and so on.

However, it is unfortunate that  some  people  decided  not  to  be  in  the
country when such noble programmes were being implemented. We say  that,  in
the spirit of Vuk'uZenzele, we do not want  a  society  of  dependants,  but
responsible citizens who will  realise  their  potential  and  patriotically
utilise such for the betterment of South Africa.

Mgcinisihlalo, kanye nemalunga lahloniphekile, kuyintfokoto  lenkhulu  kutsi

[Chairperson and hon members, it is a great  pleasure  for  me  to  have  an
opportunity to be part of this debate. As we approach the end of the  second
Parliament, a time which we intend to combine with  the  celebration  of  10
years of independence, it  is  very  important  that  we  talk  about  these
services that form  part  of  poverty  eradication,  as  they  help  in  job
creation when they are implemented.]
  On 11 November 2003, when addressing this august  House,  His  Excellency
  President Mbeki said, and I quote:


The Expanded Public Works Programme is  a  nationwide  programme  that  will
draw significant numbers of the unemployed into  productive  employment,  so
that workers gain skills while they  are  gainfully  employed  and  increase
their capacity to  earn  an  income  once  they  leave  the  programme.  The
Expanded Public Works Programme is targeting one million  unemployed  people
in the first five years.

This was the President outlining policy direction of Government on  how  and
what pragmatic programmes are being put in place to deal  with  poverty  and
job creation at the same time. This has been translated into real  budgetary
items worth billions  and  billions  of  rand  to  ensure  success  of  this
programme through the relevant departments.

Today, I speak as a proud South African who participated in the  ANC's  51st
national conference; proud that the resolutions  taken  at  that  conference
are now being put into action as a people's contract to  fight  unemployment
and poverty. It is quite interesting,  though,  that  the  DA  is  now  also
talking about one million - they say real jobs, whereas they  don't  have  a
real programme and are not running any budget to realise such.

The evolution  from  the  Community-based  Public  Works  Programme  to  the
Expanded Public Works Programme is quite an informed one as  it  widens  and
broadens the  net  to  deal  with  unemployment  and  poverty  from  various
sectors. The hon Minister has adequately  outlined,  in  terms  of  all  the
sectors and clusters, they are going to assist in dealing with  poverty  and
also, on the other hand, creating job opportunities. I  would  not  like  to
bore the House by repeating the well-said words of the hon Minister.

I must also comment on the fact that  we  were  very  heartened  during  the
presentation of the department in  the  select  committee  by  how  the  co-
ordination is going to take place on the national level. This  will  involve
a forum of directors-general of the affected or  relevant  departments,  and
will  filter  down  to  provincial  levels  and  take  on  board  the  local
government, as well as those linkages with what is happening in  the  Public
Works sector under Nedlac as such.

Noko  kufanele   ngicindzetele,   Sihlalo,   kwekutsi   kubaluleke   kakhulu

paragraphs follows.)

I must, however, emphasise how important it is that we,  as  representatives
of our communities here in Parliament, quickly  grasp  the  information  and
knowledge that we  gather  about  these  widespread  services  from  various
departments so that we can pass it on to our constituencies.

The other very important issue is that because we have  this  responsibility
of oversight in terms of the various sections, we  must  ensure  that  those
services that have been budgeted for do reach the right people,  those  that
must benefit from them, whether they are in provinces or municipalities.

I have to say that our people are now very proud of the services  that  have
been delivered to them by the  ANC-led  Government.  There  were  no  tarred
roads in the previous regime. In the area where I live, at  Nkomazi,  tarred
roads were only in the so-called white  area.  When  one  proceeded  to  the
black townships, one would be met  by  a  cloud  of  dust  on  those  roads.
However, these days one just glides through in one's  car.  Car  parts  have
now become  much  cheaper.  People  who  are  transported  by  ambulance  to
hospital travel smoothly because there are no rugged roads anymore.

We also see shops slowly  emerging  there  through  the  projects  that  the
Government is implementing in  partnership  with  the  private  sector.  The
people who are working at Nkomazi Plaza are very proud, Mr Raju,  especially
those who are working at the Spar, because  they  are  permanently  employed
now and their services are within reach.

One no longer has to catch a bus all the way from Mbuzini  to  Nelspruit  to
go shopping. The bus fares that were paid can now  be  utilised  for  buying
more bread, children's milk and sugar for any  homestead.  This  shows  that
slowly but surely a better life for  all  the  people  of  South  Africa  is
taking place.

What is painful is that some people  are  still  sleeping  while  change  is
taking place. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS:  Ndiyabulela,  Mhalingaphambili.  [Thank  you,
Chair.] The debate, broadly speaking, has been an  encouraging  one  because
it shows that our membership understands what the Government is  all  about.
What was further encouraging was that there is now precise  knowledge,  even
of what happens in the various sectors of government -  the  three  arms  of
government. One of the speakers went on at length about what  should  happen
in the community.

The programme we are talking about actually had its birth at  Nedlac  during
the Growth and Development Summit which  involved  Government,  labour,  the
communities and business. I want to assure those members who think  that  we
are only dealing with short-term priorities, that once we talk in  terms  of
a collective of initiatives, which also includes  business,  you  definitely
put sustainability into the pot. People  forget,  apart  from  what  we  are
talking about here today, that there  are  other  programmes  of  Government
that are huge.

I know that there was a time when Port Elizabeth and  Uitenhage  were  dying
because people in the car manufacturing industry had decided  to  leave  the
country during the apartheid regime. However, today there  is  this  hub  of
activity in that area. It is not just a  revival,  but  also  a  process  of
moving forward. Who would have thought that today we would  be  thinking  in
terms of the big Port of Nxuga, which is employing so many people and  which
will actually form the development centre for  most  of  the  projects  that
will be taking place in the Eastern Cape. I am saying this  so  that  we  do
not close our eyes to the broader economy. That is why, in my  presentation,
I actually said that we are creating a pathway,  a  road,  which  will  lead
from the second economy to the first economy, so that at some  time  in  the
future we will speak broadly about the economy of South Africa as a whole.

Because of what we found on the ground, there were times  when  we  did  not
concentrate so much on those projects that would carry on for  long  periods
of time. What do you do if you  are  in  Mbazwana  and  have  to  travel  80
kilometres to Hluhluwe just to get an ID or to get a birth  certificate?  As
that hon member was saying, we also had to put  social  cohesion  programmes
into the package so that we would have  the  type  of  infrastructure  which
would stop our people from having meetings under trees  and  our  kids  from
doing their schooling under trees, and so forth.

This process has focused on creating jobs and, at the  same  time,  ensuring
that the right infrastructure is there for the people. We all know from  our
experience that if you do not have the proper infrastructure, you can  never
ever attack investors; hence this concentration  on  making  sure  that  our
country really spends a lot of money on putting the right infrastructure  in
place.
Who would have thought that today I could say that  I  can  move  from  Port
Edward through Flagstaff, through  Lusikisiki,  through  Port  St  Johns  to
Umtata on a tarred road, whereas  prior  to  1994  there  were  only  little
patches of tar and gravel. All I am saying is: Let us embrace this  Expanded
Public Works Programme, because it is our push and it is  making  sure  that
we carry the vast majority of our people forward through  skilling  them  so
that on their own they can become entrepreneurs,  and  that  in  the  future
they can be part and parcel of those participants in the greater economy  of
this country.

I must thank you for the participation and also for some of the lectures  we
got. Someone even gave us a clear definition of  poverty.  A  number  of  my
officials are here because they felt that this was a very  important  debate
to listen to.

As we leave this House and do a little bit of talking to the people,  it  is
clear, even with some of the other parties, that the issue of  job  creation
is paramount. The only point of difference is how we deal with it. The  only
other point of difference  is  who  will  have  the  budget  to  make  these
promises, and are all going to turn dreams into a reality?  Already  we  are
cushioned by the budgetary allocations which were made at  a  time  when  it
seemed that perhaps it was going to be difficult to  make  them.  They  were
made right here in Parliament. They are going to make it possible for us  to
effectively say: ``We have a contract for the development of  our  people.''
I thank you for the opportunity. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 16:14.

TABLINGS

National Council of Provinces
1.    The Chairperson


     Report of Delegation to 7th Session  of  African,  Caribbean,  Pacific-
     European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,  12
     to 19 February 2004:


     The 7th Session of the African, Caribbean, Pacific-European Union Joint
     Parliamentary Assembly (ACP-EU JPA) met in Addis Ababa,  Ethiopia  from
     16 to 19 February 2004. As usual, the joint  plenary  was  preceded  by
     meetings of the ACP and Joint Bureaus (of which South Africa is  now  a
     member), of the ACP plenary and also of the three  Standing  Committees
     on Political Affairs, on Economic Development, Finance and Trade and on
     Social Affairs and the Environment.


     The delegation consisted of Dr Rob Davies and Ms  Ntshadi  Tsheole.  We
     were accompanied by Mr Saul Pelle of the South African Embassy  to  the
     EU in Brussels  and  Mr  Mtutu  Masiza  of  Parliament's  International
     Relations Unit. Ahead of the JPA there was also a workshop on  Economic
     Partnership Agreements and  their  implications  for  the  Eastern  and
     Southern African region (of which Ethiopia, the host country, is part).
     This was an informal activity of the  Economic  Development  Committee,
     sponsored by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, at which Rob Davies made  an
     input.


     The 7th Session operated  according  to  the  new  rules  of  procedure
     adopted ahead of the 6th session. These provide for resolutions  to  be
     tabled via the Standing Committees with the  possibility  of  only  two
     "urgent resolutions" per session being tabled independently  on  topics
     agreed by the Joint Bureau. The motivation for this new procedure is to
     encourage the JPA to focus its attention on the common issues of ACP-EU
     relations, rather than the bilateral issues that have in the  past,  in
     practice, dominated JPA proceedings. It was agreed at the Joint  Bureau
     meeting held in Brussels in January that the "urgent resolutions" would
     be on "Cotton and other basic commodities: Problems encountered by  ACP
     countries" and "Damage caused by Cyclones in the Pacific, Indian  Ocean
     and Caribbean and the need for a rapid response to natural  disasters".
     This meant that the JPA proceedings were  largely  focused  on  generic
     rather than bilateral issues. Although the crisis  in  Haiti  was  also
     included on the agenda, the Joint  Bureau  agreed  to  an  exchange  of
     views, but no resolution. However, the discussion was  led  by  Caricom
     delegations, who argued in support of  the  Caricom  plan  calling  for
     dialogue,  but  rejecting  any  violent  overthrow  of   the   Aristide
     government.


     The  resolutions  emerging  from  the  Committees  were  on   "Conflict
     Resolution and Lasting Peace" (Political Affairs Committee);  "Economic
     Partnership Agreements"  (Economic  Affairs  Committee)  and  "Poverty,
     diseases and Reproductive health in ACP countries in the context of the
     ninth European Development Fund" (Social Affairs Committee). There  was
     a fair degree of consensus on the  first  and  the  third  reports  and
     resolutions, as well as on  the  two  urgent  resolutions.  There  was,
     however, a degree of disagreement on the EPA resolution. The resolution
     was adopted by the Committee with a majority made up by the ACP  voting
     together with the European PSE (socialist), Green and GUE (left) groups
     against  the  PPE  (conservative)  group.  The  PPE  indicated  in  the
     Committee that they would call  for  a  vote  in  plenary  by  separate
     houses, and would  vote  against  the  resolution  emanating  from  the
     Committee if it were put unamended to the plenary. As  the  PPE  has  a
     majority in the EU house, there was a possibility that this  resolution
     would be defeated, as was a resolution on the WTO  post-Cancun  at  the
     6th session in Rome. This led to a process of negotiation, in which our
     delegation participated at the request of the ACP Secretary General.  A
     compromise was eventually reached, which resulted in fudging clauses on
     additional funding to address restructuring and revenue losses  arising
     from the introduction of reciprocity, the  introduction  of  "Singapore
     issues" into EPA negotiations and trade in service negotiations in  the
     EPA context allowing for the retention of the right of ACP countries to
     maintain public services in key areas. Although the original clauses on
     these issues were significantly "watered down" in the  compromise,  the
     aim was to leave space for further debates. The debate on  this  topic,
     during which we took the floor, was attended by EU trade  commissioner,
     Pascal Lamy. In his input, the Commissioner spoke of "reinforcement  of
     regional integration" being "a heart of EPAs". Since the  regions  that
     will be negotiating EPAs, particularly in Eastern and Southern  Africa,
     do not correspond either with any existing Regional Economic  Community
     or the AU defined region, a major challenge of aligning the EPA process
     with regional and continental initiatives clearly exists.  Commissioner
     Lamy also spoke of reciprocity in trade being  introduced  through  the
     EPA process in a "progressively and harnessed  manner".  Clearly  there
     are many issues here; including the  extent  of  reciprocal  duty  free
     opening up of ACP countries' markets to EU imports,  the  length  of  a
     transition to reciprocity, preserving the  rights  of  Least  Developed
     Countries to non-reciprocal duty free access to the EU, and the funding
     of adjustment costs by ACP countries. All of  these  issues  have  been
     taken up by the ACP side, as the input from Mauritian Minister Cuttaree
     for the ACP Council made clear. Differences, however,  exist  on  these
     and other issues. A view beginning to  emerge  from  discussions  among
     parliamentarians in the Southern Africa group (which in the EPA context
     will be the five SACU countries plus Mozambique, Angola  and  Tanzania)
     is that the issue of reciprocity has already been settled in our region
     by the fact that the  bilateral  Trade,  Development  and  Co-operation
     Agreement with South Africa de facto extends reciprocity to other  SACU
     countries. With the EU having half promised to allow duty  free  access
     for all products from ACP countries involved in the  EPA  process,  and
     LDCs having this right on a non-reciprocal basis, the  Southern  Africa
     EPA  should  focus  largely  on  developmental  issues  and  non-tariff
     barriers in the EU market (subsidies and technical barriers to trade).


     The Economic Development Committee (on which we serve) will prepare its
     next report on the controversial issue of  "budgetising"  the  European
     Development Fund, which currently operates on the  basis  of  voluntary
     contributions by EU member states. In the debate  on  this  issue,  the
     development  commissioner,   Paul   Nielson,   spoke   in   favour   of
     budgetisation (i.e. including EDF  funding  in  the  European  budget),
     arguing this was the best way to ensure funding for development in  ACP
     countries,  particularly  with  EU  enlargement  on  the  horizon.   He
     declined, however, to offer an assurance that no ACP country  would  be
     worse off after budgetisation, saying that the focus of funding was now
     on performance, and that funds would not be disbursed to countries that
     could not perform.


     The JPA also received a short input on AU  processes  from  the  Deputy
     Chairperson of the AU Commission, Mr Patrick Mazimhaka. While there was
     general support for AU programmes from the floor,  it  became  apparent
     during this debate that there is an  urgent  need  to  promote  greater
     alignment between the Cotonou and the AU processes.


     As usual workshops were held  on  issues  of  importance  to  the  host
     country - Food Security in Ethiopia, Health and Education  and  Private
     Sector Development. We participated in the first  two,  which  involved
     visits to water security projects and  programmes  for  sufferers  from
     HIV/Aids. These gave a vivid  impression  of  the  enormous  challenges
     facing Ethiopia, but also of the efforts being made  to  address  them.
     For  example,  Ethiopia  is  about  to  introduce  an   anti-retroviral
     programme.


     A feature of the JPA session was  that  Ethiopian  Prime  Minister,  Mr
     Meles Zenawi, made himself available for an hour's Q and A session with
     participants, and later for a  similar  ninety-minute  engagement  with
     members of the Joint Bureau. These covered  a  wide  range  of  themes,
     including the border dispute with Eritrea. The Eritrean delegation  did
     not participate in the 7th JPA, after objecting to the venue.  The  Co-
     Presidents, however, visited Eritrea ahead of the JPA. On  this  issue,
     the Prime Minister essentially argued that  some  of  the  UN  Boundary
     Commission's recommendations were "irrational" as they divided  houses,
     churches, villages and roads. He said that under normal  circumstances,
     his country could probably have lived with them,  but  that  there  was
     serious tension in the relationship with  Eritrea  and  that,  in  this
     context, acceptance could fuel such tensions. He  said,  however,  that
     Ethiopia had renounced war as an option in resolving  this  issue,  and
     was looking for a process of dialogue similar to that  between  Nigeria
     and Cameroon on their border issues.


     The ACP Bureau, of which we are now members, recommended that  we  take
     the vacant position of Co-Vice President for Human Rights. We accepted,
     after pointing to the uncertainties  arising  from  our  election.  The
     position is essentially awarded  to  our  delegation  and  not  to  any
     individual and will be held by whoever leads our delegation to the  JPA
     after our elections. This appointment came too late for us to engage in
     ACP structures on a report drafted only by the EU Co-Vice President. In
     the Joint Bureau meeting, Rob Davies offered a number  of  comments  on
     this, suggesting that there was a need  for  greater  balance  through,
     inter alia, addressing more substantially issues  in  the  EU  such  as
     immigration policy, racism and the rise of far right populism and their
     impact on ACP relations.


     The Joint Bureau, unfortunately, did not have time for any  substantial
     discussion of the  workings  of  the  new  committee-based  system.  In
     numerous discussions, we indicated our view that it  was  necessary  to
     strengthen  the  Committees'  work  in  the   direction   of   creating
     opportunities for  ongoing  oversight  of  the  EPA  processes,  public
     hearings and the receiving of reports on e.g. impact studies. The Joint
     Bureau did,  however,  decide  that  reports  from  the  Commission  on
     implementation of resolutions (dealt with up to now  in  a  perfunctory
     manner in plenary) should be referred to relevant Committees  for  more
     substantial processing. All of this may well require making  more  time
     available for Committee meetings.


     The 7th JPA is the last that will be held before  EU  enlargement  (May
     1st) and the European Parliamentary elections  in  June.  A  number  of
     regular participants in JPA sessions will not be returning,  and  there
     is much uncertainty about the political complexion of the new  European
     parliament. Generally, however, it is expected  that  enlargement  will
     bring in a number of countries with little experience of,  and  perhaps
     limited interest in, matters of ACP co-operation and that there will be
     major challenges to raise the profile of these issues.


     The next Bureau and Committee meetings have been tentatively  scheduled
     to  begin  on  the  5th  October  in  Brussels,  and  the   8th   Joint
     Parliamentary Assembly to take place in The Hague, Netherlands from  22
     to 25 November 2004.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Finance on the Division  of  Revenue
     Bill [B 4B - 2004] (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 3 March 2004:


         The Select Committee on Finance, having considered the  subject  of
         the Division of Revenue Bill [B 4B -  2004]  (National  Assembly  -
         sec 76), referred to it, reports the Bill without amendment.


         The Committee also wishes to point out that in Clause  5,  on  page
         5, in line 36, "2003/04" should read "2004/05".

3.    Report of the Select Committee on Local Government and  Administration
     on the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Bill [B 19B  -  2003]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 3 March 2004:


         The  Select  Committee  on  Local  Government  and  Administration,
         having considered the subject of the  Local  Government:  Municipal
         Property Rates Bill [B 19B - 2003] (National Assembly  -  sec  75),
         referred to it, reports that it has agreed to the Bill.


         The Committee further reports, as follows:


              Having considered various pertinent Clauses of the  Bill,  the
              Committee would have liked to propose amendments to Clauses 17
              and  18.  However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  envisaged
              amendments would require further investigation and  assessment
              before a specific proposal can  be  formulated.  Consequently,
              the Department of Provincial and Local Government is requested
              to investigate and assess the appropriateness of the threshold
              amount of R15 000 referred to in Clause 17(1)(h), with a  view
              to increasing it, and report back within  12  months  on  what
              should be the appropriate amount. In  view  thereof  that  the
              said exclusion of R15 000 may be reversed in terms  of  Clause
              18, the Department should also consider an amendment to Clause
              18 that will omit the reference to paragraphs (g) and  (h)  of
              Clause 17(1).  It  would  also  be  appropriate  for  such  an
              amendment to be accompanied by an amendment to Clause 84  that
              will  make  provision  for  regulations  to   be   tabled   in
              Parliament.


              In respect of Clause 24(2)(b), the Committee  recommends  that
              the Department, by way of  guidelines,  provide  the  criteria
              that will assist municipalities to make a proper choice as  to
              the applicability of subparagraph (i) or  (ii),  depending  on
              the circumstances.  These  guidelines  should  be  mindful  of
              relevant social issues.
