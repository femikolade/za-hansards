                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that
at the next sitting of the Council I will move:

   That the Council -

     1) debates the decision by the Cabinet to withdraw a Bill, published on
        17 June 2009, to amend the Constitution in terms of the existing
        rights and duties of a municipality to distribute electricity
        despite the long delay and uncertainties that have already inflicted
        a heavy toll on the economy;
     2) further debates the direct and indirect costs to the productive
        economy as a result of inefficiencies in the current electricity
        distribution industry structure, delays in restructuring and
        distribution, and the backlog in maintenance and refurbishment,
        which has been stated as being a ticking time bomb; and

     3) calls on the Minister to provide the strong political support and
        executive sponsorship necessary for the continuity and follow-
        through of this fragmented R30billion-a-year industry.

I so move.

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that
at the next sitting of the Council I will move:

   That the House -

     1) debates the dismal failure of the Department of Basic Education to
        provide a safe learning environment for pupils at its schools, so
        much so that many learners, even those who are underage, are
        frequently subjected to violent crimes which have become the order
        of the day;

     2) further debates the failure of our education system to discourage
        the use of violence in society and in schools to resolve conflict,
        as evinced when a Grade 10 learner stabbed a Grade 9 learner with a
        pair of scissors, inflicting several injuries to the head; and

     3) calls for urgent intervention by government to address society’s
        propensity to use physical violence as frequently as it does in our
        country.

I so move.

Mr D B FELDMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that at
the next sitting of the Council I will move:

   That the House -

     1) debates government allowing the National Youth Development Agency,
        NYDA, to overstep its allocated budget of R29 million to host the
        National Youth Development Agency World Festival of Youth and
        Students;

     2) further debates the failure of government to put an end to the
        unnecessary and wasteful spending of government-sponsored entities;
        and

     3) calls on the Presidency to halt this spending which, because of the
        invitation to youth leagues, including the youth league of the
        Workers’ Party of North Korea and Zimbabwe’s Zanu-PF youth league,
        is perceived as being supportive of the nations concerned.

I so move.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: Chairperson, on behalf of the DA I hereby wish to give
notice that at the next sitting of the Council, I will move:

   That the House -

     1) notes that the information submitted to the NCOP Select Committee
        on Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs by the Kou-Kamma
        municipality or the provincial department is not altogether correct
        as per pp 4213 to 4214 of the ATC dated 23 November;

     2) further notes that there are a number of errors that have been made
        in the financial department of the municipality, such as:

           a) of the 4 730 debtors who owed the municipality, an amount of
              R47 million cannot be correct as there are residents in
              Clarkson, Church and Basia Streets as well as residents in
              Smartie Town who have been taxed by the municipality on
              properties not owned by the residents;
           b) the DA has submitted a motion, which is attached, to the Kou-
              Kamma council requesting that the land be transferred into
              the names of the residents at the cost of the municipality
              for the following reasons:

                 i) the Church donated the land;

                ii) USAID donated the money;

               iii) Kou-Kamma Municipality has not transferred the property
                    since 2005; and

                iv) the municipality was requested to reverse the illegal
                    charges against these residents by writing off the debt
                    against their names;

     3) requests the Kou-Kamma Municipality to implement the Kou-Kamma
        Council decision taken in this regard on 12 October 2010, to write
        off the debt of the Clarkson communities and to transfer the land
        in terms of the motion into the names ...


[Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, this is not a comment on the
notice that has just been given, but I would like to advise that it would
actually be proper to raise certain kinds of matters in the committees on
which members serve. If so, correct action can be taken; merely moving a
notice might not see a situation being corrected at all.

If the information is not correct, we should allow the committee to debate
it and report back to the House by way of a proper report. This is just
some advice that I wish to give to hon members.

Mnr D A WORTH: Agb Voorsitter, namens die DA gee ek kennis van my voorneme
om die volgende voorstel voor die Raad te laat dien:

   Dat die Raad -

   (1)      kennis neem dat die DA die antwoord van die Minister van
        Samewerkende Regering en Tradisionele Sake, mnr Sicelo Siceka,
        rondom die ondersoek na verskeie aangeleenthede in die Matjhabeng-
        munisipaliteit verwelkom;

   (2)      verder kennis neem dat die Minister aangedui het dat die
        Vrystaat se LUR vir Samewerkende Regering, Tradisionele Sake en
        Menslike Nedersettings, mnr Msebenzi Zwane, aangedui het dat hy,
        ingevolge artikel 106 van die Wet op Plaaslike Regering: Munisipale
        Stelsels, Wet 32 van 2000, ’n ondersoek in Matjhabeng geloods het;

   (3)      verder kennis neem dat die Minister die ondersoek reeds op 15
        November 2010 begin het en dat ’n evaluering van die implementering
        van die omstrede Ramathe Fivaz-verslag ook ondersoek sal word;

   (4)      erken dat hierdie ondersoek nodig is omdat die verslag al ’n
        geruime tyd beskikbaar is, maar deur die munisipaliteit weerhou
        word, en dat ’n opdrag van die wetgewer om die verslag bekend te
        maak ook deur die munisipaliteit verontagsaam is;

   (5)      verder erken dat hoe langer die omstrede verslag vanaf die raad,
        wetgewer en publiek weerhou word, hoe meer omstrede dit raak; en

     6) die hoop uitspreek dat die LUR se ondersoek saam met die Ramathe
        Fivaz-verslag aan die Raad en die wetgewer bekend gemaak sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr D A WORTH: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move the following on behalf of the DA:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that the DA welcomes the reply of the Minister of Co-
        operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Sicelo Shiceka,
        regarding the investigation of several incidents in the Matjhabeng
        municipality;

   (2)      further notes that the Minister has indicated that the MEC for
        co-operative governance, traditional affairs and human settlements
        in the Free State, Mr Msebenzi Zwane, indicated that, in terms of
        section 106 of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, Act 32
        of 2000, he has launched an investigation in Matjhabeng;

   (3)      further notes that the Minister already started the
        investigation on 15 November 2010 and that an evaluation of the
        implementation of the controversial Ramathe Fivaz report will also
        be investigated;

   (4)      acknowledges that this investigation is necessary because the
        report has been available for quite some time, but is being
        withheld by the municipality, and that a directive by the
        legislature to publish the report has also been ignored by the
        municipality;

   (5)      further acknowledges that the longer the controversial report is
        withheld from the Council, legislature and public, the more
        controversial it becomes; and
   (6)      hopes that the MEC’s investigation along with the Ramathe Fivaz
        report will be made available to the Council and legislature.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, on behalf of Cope I give notice that I intend
moving:

   That the House -

     1) debates the friendly warning of Dr Pallo Jordan, one of the most
        respected intellectuals in the ANC, regarding the silly attempt by
        the government to muzzle the modern media as being “a fool’s
        errand”;

     2) further debates the warning that the party would be putting itself
        into a lose-lose situation that would detract from the credibility
        it had acquired by being in the vanguard for media freedom from the
        time of Chief Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo;

     3) acknowledges Dr Jordan’s further friendly caution that the Bill
        would in all likelihood face constitutional challenges and be
        defeated, which, if it happened, would leave egg on the face of the
        government.

I thank you.
Mr Z MLENZANA: Chairperson, on behalf of Cope I hereby give notice that at
the next sitting of the Council, I will move:

   That the House -

     1) debates the enormous danger to the main water source in and around
        the Ventersdorp district on account of the municipal sewerage pump
        station having been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that
        sewage is now seeping out on a daily basis;

     2) acknowledges the impact of polluted water, not only on chickens and
        other livestock, but also on the general population of the area;

     3) notes the failure of government to halt such deterioration of
        essential infrastructure in many towns and cities around the
        country;

     4) acknowledges the need for government to start addressing these
        mounting problems of infrastructure collapse before the problem
        becomes too big.

I so move.

Mnr T B BEYLEVELDT: Voorsitter, namens die DA gee ek kennis van my voorneme
om die volgende voorstel voor die Raad te laat dien:

   Dat die Huis -

     1) kennis neem dat daar die afgelope tyd verskeie voorvalle van geweld
        in Khayelitsha voorgekom het onder die voorwendsel van swak
        dienslewering;

     2) verder kennis neem dat drie voertuie verlede week aan die brand
        gesteek is gedurende sogenaamde dienslewering proteste;

     3) toegee dat dit ironies is dat al drie voertuie besig was met
        dienslewering aan die gemeenskap in die sin dat —

          a) een besig was om matriekeksamen vraestelle af te lewer;


          b) een besig was om gestremde persone te vervoer met ’n voertuig
             wat deur die Kaapstad Metro voorsien is; en


          c) die derde besig was om kinders na ’n plek vir misbruikte
             kinders te vervoer;

     4) daarop let dat ’n vierde voertuig – ’n ambulans wat besig was om te
        reageer op ’n noodoproep van iemand in die gemeenskap –
        brandstigting vrygespring het deur te ontsnap, maar onder die
        klippe gesteek was;

     5) erken dat dit ironies is dat dienste vernietig word onder die naam
        van dienslewering; en

     6) ’n beroep doen op alle partye om hul ondersteuners te maan om
        verantwoordelik op te tree om sodoende ’n beter lewe vir almal te
        help skep.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr T B BEYLEVELDT: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move the following on behalf of the DA:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that several incidents of violence have taken place in
        Khayelitsha recently under the pretext of poor service delivery;

   (2)      further notes that three vehicles were set alight last week
        during the so-called service delivery protests;

   (3)      recognises that it is ironic that all three vehicles were
        rendering services to the community in the sense that -
        (a)      one was delivering matric examination papers;

        (b)      another was transporting disabled people by means of a
               vehicle which was provided by the Cape Metro; and

        (c)      the third was transporting children to a place for abused
              children;

   (4)      notes that a fourth vehicle – an ambulance that was responding
        to an emergency call from someone in the community - got away
        before being set alight, but was stoned;


   (5)      acknowledges that it is ironic that services are being
        disrupted in the name of service delivery; and

  (6) call on all parties to urge their supporters to behave responsibly in
        order to help create a better life for all.]

                              OUTOILET WEBSITE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T A MASHAMAITE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council -
   (1)      notes that Vodacom has blocked access to the controversial
        gossip site Outoilet after the posting of the sex video which
        featured a 15-year-old girl and two boys who were aged 14 and 16
        years at Jules High School;


   (2)      further notes that the Outoilet website is being used to defame
        people and has resulted in several suicides and depression of
        disgruntled teenagers; and


   (3)      takes this opportunity to commend Vodacom for such a bold step
        and calls on other cellular network providers to follow suit.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     ANC VICTIMISATION IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs N W Magadla): Chairperson, I hereby move without
notice:

  That the Council –

     1) notes with utter dismay concerns raised by the leadership of the
        ANC in KwaZulu-Natal;
     2) notes that ANC members are being victimised for campaigning for the
        party by traditional leaders aligned to the IFP in KwaPhindangene
        in northern KwaZulu-Natal;

     3) further notes that the ANC members who attended a meeting called by
        the ANC recently in the area will be prosecuted in a traditional
        court for campaigning for the ANC;


     4) takes this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible terms
        such a blatant attack on the constitutional rights and the freedom
        which many of the people of South Africa fought for with their
        lives; and


     5) calls on the House of Traditional Leaders and the Minister of Co-
        operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to engage the
        traditional leaders in KwaPhindangene about such an unfortunate
        practice which is an attack on the rights of our people and an
        attack on our hard-earned democracy. I so move.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Any objection to the motion? In the light of
the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without
notice will now become a notice of motion.

                     TRAGIC DEATH OF RETLABUSA MOKONYANE

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms B V MNCUBE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


   That the Council –


   (1)      notes with profound sadness the tragic death of Retlabusa
        Mokonyane, who was the son of Gauteng Premier Ms Nomvula Mokonyane;




   (2)      further notes that Retlabusa Mokonyane reportedly shot himself
        to death yesterday, 23 November 2010; and


   (3)      takes this opportunity to express its heartfelt condolences to
        the Mokonyane family and friends and wishes them strength in this
        difficult time.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  RESULTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR MIGRATION’S STUDY IN RESPECT OF
                                     HIV

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D Z RANTHO: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council –


   (1)      notes that a study conducted by the International Organisation
        for Migration on 23 farms in Malelane, Tzaneen and Musina found
        that 39,5% of the farming workforce who anonymously gave blood
        specimens for testing are HIV-positive;


   (2)      further notes the study found that almost half of women working
        on farms around Limpopo and Mpumalanga are HIV-positive, compared
        to only a third of the male workforce; and


   (3)      takes this opportunity to call on government, particularly the
        Department of Health and the Department of Labour, to establish
        programmes targeted at raising awareness among farmworkers about
        exposure to concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, irregular
        condom use, and sexually transmitted infections.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      RAPE AT GREENSIDE PRIMARY SCHOOL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs M C DIKGALE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council -
   (1)      notes with utter dismay two incidents at Greenside Primary
        School, which is situated between Seshego and Polokwane, where an
        eight-year-old pupil was allegedly raped in the school’s toilets,
        and a Grade 2 pupil is unable to return to school for fear of being
        attacked again after she escaped being raped by locking herself in
        one of the school’s toilets;


   (2)      further notes that the two incidents follows the Jules High
        School incident in which a 15-year-old girl was reportedly raped by
        two boys, aged 14 and 16 years, and their charges were later
        converted to statutory rape for engaging in sex while underage; and




   (3)      takes this opportunity to condemn the rape of the eight-year-old
        girl and calls on education authorities to strengthen safety in our
        schools and ensure that life skills education covers sexual
        education in order to alert our learners about the dangers of
        underage and unprotected sex.

I so move. Thank you, Chairperson.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr W F FABER: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that the parliamentary rugby team will leave on a tour to
        Argentina on 28 November 2010 and play against Argentina’s national
        parliamentary rugby team;


   (2)      further notes that two of the NCOP members will be playing for
        the South African team and will also take part in functions with
        the South African ambassador in Buenos Aires; and


   (3)      wishes the team the best of luck.


I so move.

                              METRORAIL TRAGEDY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:
   That the Council -

   (1)      notes reports that indicate that 300 commuters died and 230 were
        injured on Metrorail trains throughout South Africa from March 2008
        to February 2009;


   (2)      further notes that 119 injuries and 9 deaths in train accidents
        were the result of people being thrown or falling off moving
        trains;


   (3)      takes this opportunity to call on all train users to refrain
        from dangerous antics when using trains; and


   (4)      further calls on Metrorail and the police to strengthen rail
        safety by deploying more security personnel and police to control
        overcrowding on trains, which results in people hanging out of
        train windows and doors, and even sitting on the rooftops of
        trains.


I so move.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                           SPREAD OF HIV and AIDS

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms M G BOROTO: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that only a few days before World Aids Day, which takes
        place on 1 December of every year, the United Nations has released
        a report indicating that progress is being made worldwide against
        the spread of the HI and Aids virus, as fewer people are becoming
        infected and fewer are dying from the disease;


   (2)      further notes that the report states that antiretroviral
        treatment has had a profound effect on mortality rates across the
        globe, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in
        countries such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and
        Zimbabwe; and


   (3)      takes this opportunity to congratulate all stakeholders involved
        in the fight against the spread of the epidemic and on their
        relentless efforts to ensure that more people get access to life-
        saving drugs and that communities become even more aware of the
        dangers of unprotected sex.
I so move.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 CONGRATULATIONS TO TELKOM ON LAUNCH OF 8.TA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr H B GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice on behalf of
the DA:

   That the Council -

   (1)      congratulates Telkom on the launch of 8.ta, their cellphone
        component;


   (2)      believes that 8.ta’s contribution to the South African public
        will bring many benefits to each and every household in our
        country; and


   (3)      further believes that the cost per unit will also be to the
        benefit of the South African public.


Chairperson, there is a new finger sign for the deaf people, and it is like
this, not like that - 8.ta.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          POLICE OPERATION TARGETING ILLEGAL SHEBEENS IN GUGULETHU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T E CHAANE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that police swooped on illegal shebeens in Gugulethu on
        Sunday, 21 November, arresting 44 people for alcohol-related
        offences like drinking in public;


   (2)      further notes that about 138 police and traffic officers took
        part in the operation, targeting illegal shebeens that have been
        identified as major contributing factors to the mugging, hijacking
        and drunk driving in Gugulethu; and


   (3)      takes this opportunity to congratulate the police on their

        been identified by Gugulethu residents as a major source of
        nuisance and criminality in the area.

         increased alarmingly;

                       TAKING PARLIAMENT TO THE PEOPLE
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice on behalf of the DA:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes the negative and ill-informed report with regard to the
         recent Taking Parliament to the People in the Sunday Times of 21
         November 2010, which once again highlights the general ignorance
         about the work of the NCOP and underlines the need for a
         promotional strategy to improve the image of the Council and to
         rename it the National Senate; and


   (2)      further notes that this image would be greatly improved if
         Cabinet Ministers of the government took the Council seriously and
         attended sittings for which their attendance is designated on the
         programme prepared and confirmed weeks in advance.


I so move.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.


                    HIGHER EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL





                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)


              HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING LAWS AMENDMENT BILL




                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)



                  SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LEVIES AMENDMENT BILL





                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)


Ms M W MAKGATE: Thank you, Chairperson and hon members. These three linked
amending Bills can be considered as a trilogy arising out of the division,
in May 2009, of education legislation at the national level between the
Department of Higher Education and Training and the Department of Basic
Education. This division precipitated the need for technical corrections
and legislation applicable to skills development that had been transferred
from the Department of Labour to the Department of Higher Education and
Training.

The amending Bills are technical in nature, addressing the legislative
consequences of the departmental restructuring, do not impact on the
substance of any legislation and do not introduce any new policy or
legislation.

They are rather intended to make their principal Acts more explicit and
specific and to tighten any generalities; to clarify existing policy,
concepts and qualifications that are dealt with in different pieces of
legislation; and to clarify definitions and objectives of the legislation
and to include them in a readily accessible source.

The first of the three amending Bills tabled by the Department of Higher
Education and Training is the Higher Education Laws Amendment Bill, which
deals primarily with the National Qualifications Framework Act and the
Skills Development Act. It also seeks to align core education legislation
with the new education dispensation.

The pieces of legislation to be amended include the Higher Education Act,
the Skills Development Act, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme Act
and the National Qualifications Framework Act. This will ensure that all
higher education programmes offered in South Africa by a foreign-based
institution are registered with the National Qualification Framework. In
addition, all higher education institutions that offer degrees, diplomas or
certificates must be registered with the National Qualifications Framework.

The second Bill, the Higher Education and Training Laws Amendment Bill,
also seeks to bring about alignment of the following core pieces of
legislation with the new education dispensation that came about in 2009,
when the former Department of Education was split into the Department of
Basic Education and the Department of Higher Education and Training as a
result of the transfer of administration and powers.

Even though the Bill seeks to introduce new sections in the Adult Basic
Education and Training Act and the Further Education and Training Colleges
Act, these sections are, in fact, incorporations of existing statutory
provisions applicable to these institutions before the transfer.

The existing statutory provisions, currently contained in the National
Education Policy Act of 1996 and in the Employment of Educators Act of
1998, are laws that have been primarily transferred to the Minister of
Basic Education and that are relevant to adult education and training
centres and further education and training colleges only in so far as the
laws relate to those institutions.

The Skills Development Levies Amendment Bill, the third amending Bill of
the trilogy, aims to effect certain amendments to take into account the
transfer in 2009 of the skills development responsibility from the
Department of Labour to the Department of Higher Education and Training.

It amends the principal Act’s definition of “director-general” and
“Minister” from Labour to Higher Education and Training. The Select
Committee on Education and Recreation considered and adopted the three
Bills without amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Higher Education Laws Amendment Bill agreed to in accordance with section
75 of the Constitution.

Question put: That the Higher Education and Training Laws Amendment Bill be
agreed to.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Higher Education and Training Laws Amendment Bill accordingly agreed to in
accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Skills Development Levies Amendment Bill agreed to in accordance with
section 75 of the Constitution.


                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL


                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule)

Mr T E CHAANE: Chairperson, hon members, the Adjustments Appropriation Bill
was tabled in Parliament on 27 October 2010 by the Minister of Finance
during the tabling of the 2010 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. The
Bill effects adjustments to the appropriation of money from the National
Revenue Fund for the requirements of the state in respect of the financial
year ending on 31 March 2011.

During the 2010 adjustment period, additional allocations amounting to
R5,854 billion were added to the baselines of the national departments. The
additional allocation of R5,854 billion was distributed among the
government clusters as follows: Central Government Administration was
allocated R1,801 billion; R344,109 million for Financial and Administrative
Services; R334,189 million for Social Services; R1,811 billion for Justice,
Crime Prevention and Security; and R1,564 billion for Economic Services and
Administration.

The additional allocations were allocated to all departments except for the
six departments that received downward adjustments amounting to
R1,033 billion: International Relations and Co-operation, R108,608 million;
National Treasury, R10,502 million; Defence and Military Veterans,
R272,742 million; Environmental Affairs, R119,280 million; Mineral
Resources, R34,174 million; and Science and Technology, R487,558 million.

With respect to economic classification, the following adjustments to the
appropriations were effected. Current Payments received an additional
allocation of R5,770 billion, which was distributed as follows:
Compensation of Employees, R4,641 billion, with R2,762 billion for the
Department of Defence and Military and R1,267 billion for Police - these
were the major beneficiaries. Goods and Services received R1,122 billion;
and an allocation amounting in aggregate to R6,629 million was allocated to
other.

The main appropriation for Transfers and Subsidies was adjusted downwards
by R1,056 billion during the 2010 adjustment period. The downward
adjustment was mainly effected in the Department of Defence and Military
Veterans, whereby the transfers and subsidised economic classification
category was adjusted downwards by R2,884 billion.

Capital Assets Payments received an additional allocation of
R106,230 million, with the Department of Public Works, at R143,321 million,
being the major beneficiary during the 2010 adjustments period.

Financial Assets Payments received an additional allocation of R560 000,
which was distributed as follows: The Department of Home Affairs was
allocated R100 000; and the Department of Justice and Constitutional
Development R460 000.

The committee, having considered this amending Bill on 17 November 2010,
recommends that this House adopt the Bill without adjustments. I thank you,
Chair. [Applause.]

 TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS - PROGRESS REPORTS ON INTERVENTIONS IN KOU-KAMMA LOCAL
                         MUNICIPALITY, EASTERN CAPE

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Hon Chair, the select committee has considered the progress
reports on the three municipalities. Alfred Nzo District Municipality has
reported progress ever since the committee’s visit.

However, there is a need to bail out the Sunday’s River Local Municipality
with about R20 million to assist the administrator to conclude the
intervention. There is a report about Kou-Kamma Local Municipality, though
we still have to make a greater effort to curb political and administrative
interference.

We therefore recommend that the House notes and approves the progress.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report on Progress Reports on Interventions in
Alfred Nzo District Municipality, Eastern Cape be adopted.

                           2007-08 FINANCIAL YEAR


Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, the statement provides an examination of the
2007-08 Municipal Performance Report. The committee observed a remarkable
improvement though there are still some financial challenges.

On the basis of the observations, the committee recommends that the
provincial executive should improve the employment profile of disabled
people and that they should further improve in respect of critical skills
and the filling of vacant positions. The committee therefore recommends the
report for endorsement. Thank you [Applause.]

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, the committee observed that there now is
political, financial and administrative stability. However, there are cases
of fraud and corruption. The committee, after interacting with
stakeholders, recommends that forensic investigations be suspended and, in
their place, the Hawks should take over.

The Speaker and the mayor should deal with the issue of the absence of
councillors and, therefore, the committee recommends to the House that it
endorses the interventions and further recommends that the MEC ensures that
regular reports are submitted to the House. I thank you. [Applause.]

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS – MEDIUM-TERM
                           BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

Mr T E CHAANE: Chairperson, hon members, the Minister of Finance tabled the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, MTBPS, on 27 October, outlining the
Budget priorities of government for the medium-term estimates. The MTBPS
spending issues portion was referred to the Select Committee on
Appropriations to consider and report on in accordance with their mandate,
as outlined in the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act,
Act 9 of 2009.

Among its responsibilities and as per section 6(1) of the Act in respect of
the MTBPS, the committee is required to consider and report on the
following issues: the spending priorities of national government for the
next three years; the proposed division of revenue between spheres of
government and between arms of government within a sphere for the next
three years; and the proposed substantial adjustments to conditional grant
allocations to provinces and local government, if any.

With regard to medium-term spending priorities, the government prioritised
its resources in the following areas: job creation initiatives, enhancing
the quality of education and skills development, improving the provision of
quality health care, driving a more comprehensive rural development
strategy and, finally, intensifying the fight against crime and corruption.


The MTBPS reflects Public Service delivery commitment as informed by an
agreed set of development and transformation goals. In making strategic
choices over the medium term, the government will focus on outcomes that
have the greatest potential to impact on economic growth and development.
The overall increase over the medium-term period is R7,3 billion for the
2010-11 financial year, and R67 billion over the following three years.

With regard to amendments to the Division of Revenue Bill, the total
allocation to national departments decreased by R7 billion; the allocation
to provinces increased by R4,2 billion; and the allocation to local
government increased by R0,4 billion. Furthermore, the further education
and training college grant is the only grant that received an additional
allocation during the 2010 adjustment period. Its allocation increased by
R31,297 million.

With regard to Schedule 5 grants, the following new allocations and
amendments were noted in respect of specific purpose grants to provinces. A
sum of R50 million, which forms part of an agricultural disaster management
grant, was allocated to the Western Cape province for expenses related to
agricultural disasters such as drought. This grant is allocated as the need
arises.

Furthermore, a sum of R214,398 million was allocated to KwaZulu-Natal for
the rehabilitation of infrastructure destroyed by flooding. This forms part
of the provincial infrastructure disaster relief grant, which is allocated
as the need arises.

The comprehensive HIV/Aids grant increased by R40 million; the human
settlement development grant increased by an amount of R15 million; and the
devolution of property rates fund grant increased by R769,035 million.

With regard to Schedule 6 grants, the following amendments were noted in
respect of specific purpose grants to municipalities. The water services
operating subsidy grant increased by R8,399 million, and the municipal
drought relief grant also increased by R92 million.

In accordance with Schedule 7 grants, the following amendments were noted
in respect of allocations in kind to municipalities designated for special
programmes. The integrated national electrification programme grant was
adjusted downwards by R31,97 million, and the water services operating
subsidy grant increased by R13,678 million.

Coming to public hearings, after considering the 2010 MTBPS and engaging
extensively with the following stakeholders, the Financial and Fiscal
Commission, the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional
Affairs, the SA Local Government Association, the Human Science Research
Council and the People’s Budget Coalition, the Select Committee on
Appropriations noted the following key concerns.

Firstly, government is cautioned against the potential negative effects
resulting from its approach of focusing on targeted funding for poorer
municipalities to the detriment of the middle-income municipalities.

Secondly, it was highlighted that the current practice that is used to
determine the local equitable share is unconstitutional in respect of the
revenue-raising component.

Thirdly, the availability of credible data on key variables relating to the
socioeconomic, demographic and special profiles of municipalities needs to
be addressed, not only to update the data underpinning the local government
equitable share formula, but also to enable a more fundamental review of
the structure of the formula itself.

Fourthly, concerns were raised regarding whether the proposed minor
adjustments to the local government equitable share formula to allocate
more funding to poorer municipalities are substantive enough to address
institutional challenges such as the need to appoint skilled personnel to
manage finances, the human resources service delivery function and core
administrative functions.

Fifthly, government’s efforts to chart a new, inclusive growth path that
serves as an agenda for collective action is applauded. However, government
is required to provide more details on the proposed new growth path or
economic policy direction of the country.
Sixthly, it was further highlighted that government, at the provincial
level, seems to be spending more funds on the compensation of employees
rather than on programmes.

Lastly, government is not doing well with respect to health spending and,
therefore, the downward revision is justifiable.

After meeting and considering all these things, the committee recommended
the following. Firstly, the overall expenditure of government at the end of
the second quarter of each financial year needs to be at 50%. This will
most likely lead to an improved quality of spending and reduce the level of
unauthorised spending and fiscal dumping at the end of a financial year.

Secondly, the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs
should consult government and other relevant stakeholders with respect to
the proposed special vehicle unit to avoid duplication of government
programmes.

Lastly, we recommend that the Department of Health should investigate
reasons for the underspending of grants and discourage the tendency of
returning funds to National Treasury as this works against the plans to
transform our health institutions. We therefore move for the adoption of
the report by this House. I thank you.

Debate concluded.
Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Report accordingly adopted in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE – MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET
                              POLICY STATEMENT

Mr C J DE BEER: Chairperson and hon members, the Minister of Finance tabled
the 2010 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, MTBPS, before Parliament on
27 October 2010 in terms of section 28 of the Public Finance Management
Act, PFMA, and section 61 of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and
Related Matters Act.

The MTBPS describes the economic context in which the 2010 statement is
tabled and the considerations that inform the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework for the 2011-14 financial years and its funding.

Fiscal policy guides government’s decisions on revenue, spending and
borrowing. South Africa’s fiscal policy enables government to deliver on
its developmental mandate by providing resources in a manner that is
sustainable and that reinforces the stability of the economy. The Budget is
a function of the economic growth that underpins the sustainable
development goals of government.

The MTBPS has based its proposals on the assumptions of how the economy
might perform globally and locally. South Africa is a role-player in the
global economy, and what happens in the global economy affects us. We have
experienced this since 2008.

In the last 16 years of democracy we have succeeded in perfecting our tools
of analysis and therefore the MTBPS has become a reliable tool or resource
of information upon which policy-makers and government departments develop
their strategic plans. It is not, as the DA indicated in a debate on
Friday, a dismal failure. Acknowledgement must be given to the Minister of
Finance as well as the National Treasury.

We must remind ourselves of how the late Comrade Oliver Tambo outlined his
vision for the postapartheid economy. He said: “Our starting point is what
the economy should serve – the people.”

Like we did last week when we went to Phuthaditjhaba. That’s an excellent
example.

The economic downturn has forced us to think better, to be more innovative
and to act. South Africa managed to cushion the impact of the recession on
its economy through a large expansion in the fiscal deficit, so as to
protect and increase social spending and to invest in infrastructure.

It is important that the MTBPS should factor in the possibilities of
unforeseen and unavoidable situations that might be beyond our control – as
we have experienced in the 2009-10 financial year.

We need closer co-operation on economic thinking between the developed and
the poor nations. We should support the proposal made by the G20 nations of
moving towards stronger multilateral co-operation; focusing on structural
reforms to sustain global demand; fostering job creation and increased
growth potential; and realising the need to complement financial repair and
regulatory reforms, as in the case of Germany.

Our approach should be underpinned by our understanding that globalisation
is not about bridging the economic divide between developed and emerging
markets. Big economies like that of the United States have resorted to
currency depreciation by pumping billions of dollars into the market. This
will have serious consequences for emerging economies such as South Africa.


The currency war debate is dominating the recovery path of the global
economy. It is therefore important to focus internally on the value of the
rand and exchange rates coupled with low inflation and a sluggish economic
recovery.

It is important to note that the economies of countries such as Brazil and
China, which are export-driven, have chosen to retain weak currencies to
stimulate their economic growth, based not only on exports but on domestic
demand and savings.

There is a need, in our case, to balance the external and domestic demand
for the goods and services we produce. The 2010 MTBPS indicates that the
net capital inflows to South Africa have risen strongly over the last two
years, reaching 5,5% of GDP in the first half of 2010, as compared to 4,7%
in 2009 as a whole.

The economic questions that require our attention are the following: What
are the implications of retaining high interest rates as compared to
developed and developing nations? What are the implications of short-term
speculative capital inflows? Can a weaker currency improve domestic demand
and productivity and what will its impact be on foreign reserves?

We must remind ourselves that our key priority is spending on
infrastructure projects such as roads and stadiums, and social spending,
particularly on health and education, so that these are also sustained. The
creation of decent work and youth employment also remains a priority.

The current economic challenges cannot only be addressed by monetary policy
alone. We must look at other possibilities that emerge from this crisis,
and we must aim to improve our competitiveness and productivity, in order
to stimulate our economy. We are all in this together. We have to focus on
what needs to be done to improve the lives of our people. The MTBPS puts us
on a new growth path that will propel economic growth from 6% to 7%.

The Select Committee on Finance had joint public hearings with the Standing
Committee on Finance in the National Assembly on 10 and 11 November 2010,
where stakeholders made their inputs on the MTBPS. The committee commended
the Minister of Finance on the balanced approach that was followed in the
2010 MTBPS.

Having considered the 2010 MTBPS, the Select Committee on Finance
recommends that the Minister of Finance should provide details to
Parliament on how the National Treasury will supplement the proposed new
growth path. These details are to form part of the 2011 national Budget.

The Minister of Finance must consider providing details on how the state
plans to design and fund the much-needed universal health care system. This
information may be included in the 2011 national Budget.

The Minister must provide more and updated details on how South Africa is
dealing with an appreciating rand. This information is also to be included

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I can see that everyone wants to
go home and is very happy. I can see the happiness and I can read the mood.


Chairperson and hon members, as we bid one another farewell, this is also
an important moment to reflect on the work we have done during the course
of the year. As we conclude this year, we can highlight some of the
achievements and indicate areas where we need to improve in the new year.

Firstly, through several initiatives we managed to put co-operative
government and intergovernmental relations firmly on the agenda of the
NCOP. Secondly, we have used the Provincial Week to facilitate and co-
ordinate oversight and understand the challenges facing provinces.

However, we need to ensure that the Provincial Week and the Taking
Parliament to the People programme talk to each other, especially for the
following purposes. Interaction between the NCOP and the provinces has
improved greatly. For example, for the first time we now get regular
progress reports on section 139 interventions. I want to thank the
committee for that; they are doing a good job. [Applause.]

The most recent reports we received this week were progress reports on
interventions in the Sunday’s River Valley Local Municipality, the Kou-
Kamma Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape and others. This is important
because, as the House, we need to know if the interventions are working and
also draw lessons for future actions.

Thirdly, judging by the thrust of the debates in this House, one notes that
members share a common understanding of the role of the NCOP as a House
that represents the interests of provinces and that has the responsibility
to promote co-operation and co-ordination among the three spheres of
government.

In March, and as recently as last week, we successfully hosted the Taking
Parliament to the People programme in the Limpopo and Free State provinces
respectively. What is important is that these were the first activities
since we remodelled the programme to provide for more detailed planning and
follow-up.

Although we have not yet gone back to check up on progress in the Greater
Sekhukhune District Municipality, I am happy that work is going ahead
amidst some challenges. For example, the plan to build a road and bridge at
Mankele by 2010 to replace the makeshift “segwaigwai” [cable car] is said
to be under way. Also, a bridge is being planned for the Olifants River.

The Mogale Wa Bagale Technical School has been put on the infrastructure
priority list for the 2010-11 financial year and renovations of the Taung
High School were expected to start two months ago.

Progress to create a structure to liaise with mines, the community and
government is said to be under way and infrastructure development is being
unlocked, especially at Atok Mine, where they are targeting 45 households.

However, we still need to see if the reports we continue to get are true
reflections of the interventions being made. This must be our priority
early next year. We need to go back there and do our work. We, and the
committees particularly, need to do report-back visits there.

The configuration of the portfolios of House Chairpersons is beginning to
show some positive impact with regard to the management of our work.
Although much work still needs to be done to smooth some committee
activities, I must commend our administration for beginning to provide more
support to the programmes of the institution.

It is important that in rendering support the administration component is
informed by the needs of members of this House and not by what the
administration thinks members need. Therefore, we need to interact very
closely with the members so that we can understand what their needs are in
terms of the support they need.

The time has come for delegates to this House to return home for
their constituency work and for the end-of-the-year recess. I would like to
remind them to remain vigilant during the constituency period by paying
particular attention to how government is responding to the call to ensure
that we prioritise, among other things, education, health, fighting poverty
and creating job opportunities.

I wish to thank fellow presiding officers, the Whippery, the chairpersons
of committees and officials for raising the banner of the NCOP even under
difficult circumstances. As you have seen at the weekend, for the first
time the Sunday Times devoted much space to commenting on our work.

While we do not necessarily agree with them - I agree with Mr Watson that
they chose to project our work - it was clear that they appreciated the
interventions we made. The more attention they pay to this House, the more
they will realise our impact in achieving the medium- and long-term goals,
chief among them being the bringing of democracy into action to the people
in remote parts of the land as part of our contribution and nation-
building.

We will keep on teaching these things until all the people understand how
the NCOP functions and works. We should not tire of doing that.

It should be noted that the people and many role-players and stakeholders
have expressed support for this programme, not least among these is the
Presidency itself. I’m sure you heard the comment of the President on
Friday endorsing this programme - that we should continue and that it is a
wonderful programme.

I am looking forward to a well-deserved holiday after my last engagement in
the second week of December. I wish you the same. May you come back
refreshed next year to continue with the wonderful work you are doing for
the institution. May God bless you as you go back home and enjoy your
holidays with your kids. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, it is indeed an honour to stand here again today,
taking part in this debate on this topic for the seventh year in
succession.

At a time like this, I would have loved to reflect on all of my colleagues,
both the quiet and the rowdy ones, but I would not be able to do justice to
all your unique characters in such a short speech. I would therefore urge
you all to take the time that lies ahead and write a book about yourselves
so that we can read and cry about you, or maybe read and laugh about you,
at our own leisure.

Maybe I can reflect on just a few and ask Hon Toenka Matila to write a book
which should definitely be titled Show me the way to Bloemfontein. Hon
Lewis Nzimande should write a book on “How to get married twice in one
month without considering a divorce”! Hon Michael de Villiers can write a
handbook on how to manage 10 motions in one sitting, while hon Willem Faber
can pen his memoirs on “There is more to politics than just sport” or maybe
“a sport” - I don’t know.

Not entirely politically correct, maybe, but hon Papi Tau must publish a
book called A chip off the old block, or maybe it is A Chip off John Block,
I don’t know. And the Chief Whip must undoubtedly write a psychology
handbook on how to overcome a fear of Helen Zille.

I would ask the Chairperson to write an Afrikaans book Ek droom van ’n
plaas met net my as baas [I dream of a farm with only myself as “baas”]
while the Deputy Chairperson of this institution’s book must simply be
titled Mama of the House. Hon Kenneth Sinclair’s book should be titled
Getting the best out of all parties, and as for the commissioner sitting
there, his biography should be titled From a general to a corporal in one
short leap – I mean a “cope-peril” not a “corporal”! And of course hon
Bloem must write a book on how to cope with two Copes within one Cope.
[Laughter.]

In all sincerity, colleagues, I would like to reiterate what I said about
our Chairperson last night and, once again, say thank you to him for his
leadership. May he and other presiding officers enjoy a well-deserved rest.

We just hope that we will be able to see more of you next year because we
have our work cut out for us, not only with regard to our duties as
mandated by the Constitution, but also in building the image of the NCOP
and establishing it in its rightful place as the upper House of Parliament,
or, as I so often have said, as the national senate.

I have also said that our Chief Whip is one of the most difficult and
unpredictable politicians to encounter. Although I enjoy political sword-
crossing immensely, I must say here publicly that Nosipho Ntwanambi is a
very good Chief Whip. Thank you for listening to suggestions, and
particularly for always considering the interests of the members foremost.

I would also like to thank all the staff of the NCOP for all their friendly
help and understanding at all times. While I cannot single out any one of
them, I must also pay tribute to the Secretary of the NCOP, Adv Phindela.
Thank you for guiding the administrative and operative ship of the Council,
Mr Secretary, and congratulations once again on your official appointment.

I am sorry that I could not give you a review on all the books that you
have to write, colleagues, but I can say that it has been a pleasure
working and associating with all of you, be it from the ruling party or the
opposition party or the best party. That one is important - the DA, if you
didn’t realise what I meant.

When we started this term, most of my DA colleagues were newcomers to the
NCOP. But we have since bid farewell to two of our members and now we have
two more newcomers to the NCOP. So, one old hand along with me is hon
Darryl Worth. Therefore, in welcoming the two new kids on the block, hon
Theo Beyleveldt and hon Beverley Abrahams, to our DA team, I must once
again say that my whole team has been a great one and has done a fantastic
job. I thank you all.

May the Almighty Father hold and guide all of you always, and may that
beautiful message of Christmas, a message of goodwill among all mankind,
find its way into your hearts and all your homes.

And now, on a point of order, Chairperson: I thank you! [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms T C Memela): Thank you very much,
hon Watson, I’ll definitely write the book.

Mr D V BLOEM: Deputy Chairperson, you see, Mr Watson, there’s only one Cope
and I am coping within that Cope.

Deputy Chairperson, thank you very much. This House is one House that is
unique in the politics of South Africa. It brings together all three
spheres of government - national, provincial and local governments - under
one roof.

This House created a very important opportunity for me personally to meet
and interact with people whom I had never met before. I want to single out
some of the people that I worked with over the past year, namely the
chairperson of the committee on Co-operative Governance and Traditional
Affairs, Cogta, AK-47 or Mr Mokgobi; then Mr Matila, whose name is Hit-and-
Run; and Mr Watson, or Rough-and-Tumble. I’ve worked with these people and
they are very good.

Let me not forget to mention my old comrade friend, also from the Free
State, the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Security and
Constitutional Development, Mr T Mofokeng, one of the Terrible Twins of
Bloemfontein. I have known this comrade for a very long time.

I must confess that since I’ve met and worked with these colleagues, I have
learned a lot from them. I can say without any doubt that in these
committees, Cogta and the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional
Development, we are working as a solid unit. I must tell the Chairperson
and the House that these two committees have very good leadership and I
want to wish them luck.

Since the House is rising today, we are going to go our different ways. It
is therefore time to say farewell to one another. I see that my time has
run out, but I also want to thank the Chairperson of the Council, Mr
Mahlangu, for his humour and help. He is always there to assist, help and
give guidance.

To Mama here, I know that yesterday I was called to order but you’ll always
stay a Mama to me. You are also very, very good and strict but are there to
help us.

To everybody in the House, may I say happy Christmas and a very good new
year.

Lastly, Mr Nzimande is getting married next month. And I am promising you
that I will be there, singing ...

... tswang, tswang, tswang, le boneng, ngwana o tshwana le Lekhalate.
[Setswana traditional song.]

Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, hon members, colleagues and all staff members,
William Shakespeare once wrote:

   Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.

It has been a long and tiring year. I hope those who came to Parliament
thinking that it was always parties and endless dinners are now aware that
all those niceties come with a lot of hard work.

When we look at the bigger picture, colleagues and friends, it is
encouraging that we managed to tolerate and co-operate with one another for
the good of the country and for a better life for all, irrespective of our
colour, political affiliation or religion.

Ba re ntwa ke ya madulammoho. Sena se bolela hore re a lwana re le mekgatlo
ya dipolotiki empa qetellong re bana ba thari e le nngwe, Afrika Borwa.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[They say fighting happens among people who live together. This means that
even though we compete as political parties, at the end of the day we
belong to one country, South Africa.]

We have had our differences but we did not let that deter us from our
common objective, which is prosperity for the country. We might have been
offended in whatever way as individuals or you might have been a thorn in
the flesh of someone in the House, so this is the time to say let bygones
be bygones, for it is the season of goodwill.

In the language of science they say, “Where there is friction, there is
progress.” For any one of us to be able to take a step forward it is
because of the friction between your feet and the surface.

Let us go back home to rest and have a jolly time with our loved ones. But
let us go back to our depository of ideologies and wisdom so that we come
back with our minds sharpened and ready to carve a better future for the
country we’ve been entrusted with.

Wees versigtig op die paaie gedurende die vakansie. Ek weet dat baie lede
jaagduiwels is! Onthou dat die agteros ook in die kraal kom. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Be careful on the roads during the holidays. I know that many members are
speedsters! Remember that it’s better to arrive late than never.
[Applause.]]

Mr J J GUNDA: Hon Deputy Chair, hon Chair, and hon members, indeed, let me
start by saying that this was a good year.

The NCOP has once again proved that Taking Parliament to the People is of
utmost importance in serving our people in order to show that this
government cares for them. I would like to mention the example – as I said
in Qwaqwa - of the hon Premier of the Free State, Ace Magashule, who
assisted local artists to record his second CD, which proves that he cares
for his people.

Let me just quote what Martin Luther King once said:

  Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve. You don’t have to have
  a college degree to serve... You don’t have to know about Plato and
  Aristotle to serve... You don’t have to know the second theory of
  thermodynamics in physics to serve. You only need a heart full of grace,
  a soul generated by love.


Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela quoted in his inauguration speech in 1994:


  Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that
  we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that
  most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
  talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? We are all meant to
  shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God
  that is within us.


Let me conclude with the greatest man who ever walked in this earth, known
by the name of Jesus. He said in Matthew 7:12:

  So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for
  this sums up the law and the prophets.
In conclusion, let me take this opportunity to say these few words to all
members of this House, their families and the staff: Have a blessed,
peaceful and wonderful Christmas and may God bless them and every one of
you this festive season.

I also wish to thank every one of you for your assistance, especially the
staff and Advocate Phindela, the Secretary. Have a prosperous 2011 and may
God bless you. [Applause.]

UMntwana M M M ZULU: Phini likaSihlalo wale Ndlu, uSihlalo wale Ndlu kanye

[Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Prince M M M ZULU: Deputy Chairperson of this House, Chairperson of this
House and all our colleagues, we worked well in this current year that we
are finalising, even though there were some arguments. But then arguments
should not take place in this House because we are all representing certain
structures in our provinces. We must see how the government operates, or
how the government could be assisted in all the departments.

Our development of our thinking is that we work as a family when we are in
the committees. There are instances when we work as political parties,
whereas the bitter truth is that this should not be the case. We must work
for the needs of all the people who were oppressed.

Mr Mahlangu, you showed leadership to me as a young man, who comes from the
province of KwaZulu-Natal, the son of Maqhawe. Nevertheless, we fought in
order for you to lead this House with honesty together with your deputy,
the Chief Whip of this House, who led by example.

I know that no one is perfect because every person has some shortcomings
which he or she is criticised for in life. You must accept criticism, and
you must also criticise me where I have made mistakes. To the Secretary: My
colleague, you have worked with loyalty although you are young. I thought
you were deployed here together with all your workers. In your deployment
you showed no bias whatsoever. We must work together as the citizens of
this country, and work with loyalty.

On the other hand, I view the Taking Parliament to the People programme as
a waste of the provinces’ money, but in this House I clearly see what is
needed by our people. Bring all the Ministers and the officials to tell us
what they could do to help these people.

May God bless you. Nomqalajuba liyabaleka ihobhe kithi kwaSoshangane,
ingcungcu ephuza kwezimbi iziziba. [Praise song.] May the Lord keep you and
all the kings of these nations, namely the Pedi, Xhosa, Sotho as well as
the Swazis, so that you are able to work well and still be available next
year. Thank you.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Deputy Chair, let me first thank the
Chairperson of the Council, without whom all of us here wouldn’t be able to
work. He tried every possible means to make sure that as Members of
Parliament and as parties we all agreed. Sometimes I disagreed with Mr
Watson, he would plead with me saying, “Leave that”.  You know how
difficult I am, Mr Watson, as you yourself have said.

Deputy Chair, today marks the last day of session of our Council in the
second year of our fourth democratic Parliament. We are aware that this
year was a very momentous one; it was one of the busiest for our hon
members and select committees. It was also a year in which we have seen the
expansion of our select committees from 11 to 13 since the third democratic
Parliament.

We have also seen the involvement of our hon members in various statutory
bodies and commissions, as well as continental and global institutions and
structures. We are indeed proud and we would like to sincerely thank our
hon members for doing their work in great strides and for showing their
commitment to advancing the lives of our people. But I must also say that I
have noted those who really do not attend to parliamentary work. I know who
they are and maybe very soon we will name and shame them.

This year we had more motions passed than in any other year of the Council,
more committee meetings were held and we undertook a very successful
Provincial Week and two Taking Parliament to the People programmes.

We have seen many Bills being passed by the NCOP. More questions were asked
and we witnessed our select committees taking on issues that affect the
daily lives of our people – a true indication of the dedication and hard
work of our hon members.

We are indeed humbled by the fact that many of our hon members are heeding
our call to build an activist Parliament that proactively responds to the
challenges facing our people.
As the NCOP, we have taken the call to build an activist Parliament very
seriously. We say this because we are aware that the NCOP has specific
functions with regard to building a better South Africa. Our work must give
voice to the perspectives of the country’s nine provinces and provide a
platform for local government to participate in legislative deliberations.
This provides Parliament with a mechanism to ensure that a centralised,
national government perspective does not dominate the development of
legislation that needs to serve the diverse needs of the country as a
whole.

As the Whippery, we hosted a very successful workshop where the leadership
of the NCOP and provinces convened to look at better ways of enhancing our
collective responsibility in the implementation of the mandate of the NCOP.

I also want to say that I am humbled by the support, co-operation and
understanding of all political parties. It is not easy to work with Mr
Watson, but I must also say I won his heart and I know very well that his
wife should be careful lest I overtake her! [Laughter.]

The most important role of the NCOP in the evolution of our young nation is
reflected in the advances that our Council is making in the deepening of
our democratic systems and ensuring that more people, especially those in
our provinces, become involved in our parliamentary processes. Our
committees have visited various communities and conducted oversight over
many issues that are imperative to our commitment to ensure a better life
for our people.

We are also grateful for the participation of the various political parties
in putting the needs of our people first and making sure that we continue
to work together despite some of the political differences that we have.

Our Council hosted delegations and dignitaries from many parts of the
world, who are drawn by its uniqueness. We recently hosted a delegation
from Namibia, which came to learn about the unique way in which the NCOP
carries out its mandate. We were humbled by the feedback that they gave us
on their last day.

Chairperson, I know that while we have come to the last sitting day of the
Council for the year, many of our hon members, as the servants of our
people, will be hard at work in their constituencies. Your outstanding work
and dedication demonstrate your courage to work tirelessly for our people,
who have been ravaged by centuries of apartheid underdevelopment and
systemic exclusion.

The week marks the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism against gender-
based violence and, of course, violence towards girl-children in
particular. We must all join the various activities organised in our
communities, make a call on our communities to speak out and stand up and
commit them and ourselves to preventing violence against women and children
in our communities. We must encourage themselves not to look away but to
act and speak out against violence and abuse of women and children.

As we continue to communicate the message of hope to our people, we must
take the opportunity to rest, recuperate and re-energise our rigour and
determination to be the servants of our people.

Allow me to pass on our profound appreciation to our staff members for
their tireless efforts to support us in their work. But I will be failing
and dishonest if I don’t specifically thank the two ladies and the
gentleman who work with me directly in my office.

As we depart from the precincts of Parliament and drive to our various
destinations, let us be safe and continue to preach the gospel of safety on
our roads. As the Irish blessing and farewell toast says:

   May the road rise up to meet you ... May the sun shine warm upon your
   face, and rains fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may
   God hold you in the palm of his hand.


I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a year  full  of  successes.  I  thank
you, Chair. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms T C Memela): Thank you very much.
May I make one announcement? Could all the hon members make themselves
available for a photograph just outside here?

The Council adjourned at 12:27.
