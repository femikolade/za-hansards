                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL (Mr S S Mazosiwe): House Chairperson,
I would like to inform the House that at the next sitting of the Council I
shall move:

   That the Council -

       1) notes that September 12th marks the 33rd year since the death  of
          distinguished anti-apartheid activist and outstanding young anti-
          apartheid revolutionary Steven Bantubonke Biko;


       2) further notes that Steven  Bantubonke  Biko  was  arrested  under
          apartheid anti-terrorism legislation by the apartheid regime  and
          brutally  beaten  into  a  coma  during  interrogation  while  in
          shackles before being transported  hundreds  of  kilometers  from
          Port Elizabeth to Pretoria where he later died;

       3) acknowledges the profound thoughts and the  immense  contribution
          that Biko and the rest of his militant generation of  the  1970s,
          including Teboho "Tsietsi" Macdonald Mashinini, Hector  Pieterson
          and many more, made in the fight for freedom in South Africa; and

       4) takes this opportunity to join the people of South Africa to  pay
          homage to this great  stalwart  and  outstanding  leader  of  our
          people who stood firm in his resolve and determination  to  fight
          for  the  liberation  of  our  people  from  the  brutality   and
          dehumanisation that they endured from the  apartheid  regime  and
          its vicious forces.

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the Council I will move:

   That the Council –


     1) notes that the illegally dumped medical waste at five different
        sites in the Welkom, Matjhabeng-area in the Free State have still
        not been removed and disposed of;


     2) further notes that the final date for removal of the medical waste
        is the end of this month, August 2010;


     3) recognises that there are still nine million tons of waste which
        have to be removed and that it is unlikely that this date will be
        complied with; and


     4) deplores the situation in the strongest terms as this waste poses a
        health risk and requests the Department of Water and Environmental
        Affairs to ensure that this matter is speedily resolved.

Mr D B FELDMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that I
shall move:

   That the Council debates the statement by the South African Communist
   Party that government should impose a moratorium on all salary and
   benefit increases for Ministers, as the gap between the lowest and
   highest paid had ballooned out of proportion.

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that
at the next sitting of the Council I shall move:
   That the Council debates the economic and political implications of South
   Africa’s determination to become a member of Bric so as to achieve
   significant support for optimal beneficiation of our ores and minerals.

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, on behalf of the DA, I hereby give notice that I
will move the following motion at the next meeting of the House:

   That the Council –


     1) notes with concern the closure of 85 factories that employ
        approximately 8 000 people who in turn sustain about 40 000 people
        and were established by Chinese investors mainly in the globally
        competitive textile industry, which has largely collapsed in South
        Africa as a result of strong foreign competition;


     2) also notes that these closures are a direct result of the imposition
        of minimum wage rates imposed against the wishes of many of the
        affected employees;


     3) further notes the devastating impact upon thousands of the most
        vulnerable people in the Newcastle district that the permanent
        closures of these factories will have; and


     4) therefore calls on the Minister of Labour to intervene without
        further delay to ensure that a solution is found whereby the
        thousands of jobs under threat will be saved and the people of
        Newcastle will be saved any further suffering as a result of the
        loss of their jobs.

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, on behalf of the DA I hereby give notice that at
the next sitting of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council –


     1) notes with sadness the brutal murder of the parents of 18-year-old
        Zhaida Makda in Standerton, Mpumalanga, allegedly orchestrated by
        the very same Zhaida Makda;


     2) further notes that Zhaida Makda admitted in court on 31 August 2010
        that he contracted the two alleged killers to murder his parents in
        return for a large sum of money which he hoped to inherit after
        their death;


     3) also notes that the two alleged murderers fled in the family car
        which they overturned 15 km out of town, killing one of the alleged
        murderers and landing the other in hospital in a critical condition;
        and


     4) acknowledges that this incident is a further manifestation of the
        lawlessness and utter greed for money that has become emblematic of
        the ANC government’s rule of lawlessness in this country.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I was going to move that the Northern Cape is
the best province in South Africa but, given the fact that you are the
Chairperson, I have changed that! [Laughter.] I hereby give notice ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): What does that imply?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: I’m just afraid that you will ask me to leave the House,
Chairperson!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Okay.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, on a serious note, I hereby give notice on
behalf of Cope that I shall move:


   That the Council debates the need for a quarterly audit of all tenders
   issued by government, at all levels, to evaluate discernible trends and
   to check whether any payments are being made to contractors prematurely.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: I have a problem with my glasses now; let me just fix
it.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Is it the Western Cape ``spook’’?

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: It’s all right! I have got it.

Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting of the House, I
shall move:

   That the Council –


     1) notes that the Cape Times of 31 August 2010 carried a statement that
        the Cape Bar Council resolved in April that the portraits of
        President Jacob Zuma, his Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe,
        Justice Minister Jeff Radebe and his Deputy Minister Andries Nel be
        removed from the walls of the Western Cape High Court;


     2) further notes that legal practitioners said that it is not
        appropriate to hang portraits of politicians in courts of justice or
        vice versa because it is in violation of the separation of powers as
        contained in the Constitution of South Africa;


     3) recognises that the courts of justice must show that courts are
        neutral in politics and that the public is entitled to believe that
        the constitutional promise and rights are guaranteed; and


     4) resolves to address this situation speedily and with no hesitation
        by the Justice fraternity.

Mr H B GROENEWALD: I hereby give notice that at the next sitting of the
Council I shall move:

   That the Council –


     1) notes that Matlosana Local Municipality in Klerksdorp in the North
        West province has suspended its municipal manager Moses Moadira on
        allegations of mismanagement of funds of over R500 million;


     2) further notes that Mr Moadira was appointed municipal manager after
        leaving Moqhaka Local Municipality in Kroonstad under a cloud of
        controversy; and


     3) acknowledges that the DA moves that the ruling party stop employing
        unskilled cadres and then re-deploying them when they are in
        trouble, where they then do more damage than good to service
        delivery all around South Africa.
Mr O DE BEER: Chairperson, on behalf of Cope I would like to give notice
that I intend moving at the next sitting:

   That the Council debates the tougher measures that government should
   adopt to ensure that taxi drivers meet higher standards of training.

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL (Mr S S Mazosiwe): Chairperson, I move

      1) notes that the Chief Whip of the Council, hon N  D  Ntwanambi,  was
         admitted to the UCT private hospital on Monday, 23 August 2010  and
         that she was released on Saturday, 28 August 2010 and is  currently

     1) congratulates the Free State Cheetahs rugby team on their stunning
        29-24 points win last Friday against the Western Province in the
        Currie Cup tournament;


     2) notes that this magnificent win was even more significant as it took
        place at Newlands, in Province’s own backyard; and


      3) congratulates the Cheetahs – Viva, Vrystaat!

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             J S ROUX COURT CASE

                             (Draft Resolution)

   That the Council –

        appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Monday for the brutal
        beating of Tshwane metro policeman Ntshimane Johannes Mohale last
        Friday morning;

     2) takes this opportunity to condemn, in the strongest possible terms,
        such a brutal and senseless murder of Mohale on his son's ninth
        birthday; and;


     3) extends its profound condolences to the Mohale family, particularly
        his wife Margaret Mohale and their children.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Is there any objection? There is an

motion.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B NESI: Chairperson, I want to move a motion without notice:

   That the Council -

     1) notes that an elderly farmer Mr Dirk Odendaal, who is 80  years  old
        and his wife  Mrs  Sophia  Odendaal,  who  is  79  years  old,  were
        viciously assaulted and robbed on their return home from  church  to
        their farm in Verdun, near Bethlehem in the Free Sate province;


     2) takes this opportunity to condemn in the  strongest  possible  terms
        the violent attack on the Odendaals and the  utter  disregard  shown
        for their age by the perpetrators of this senseless and  cruel  act;
        and

     3) calls on the police to ensure that the perpetrators of this inhumane
        and senseless crime are brought to justice.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, I move a motion without notice:

   That the Council -


     1) debates the statement by the Minister of Public Service and
        Administration, Mr Richard Baloyi, that expensive upmarket sedans
        were ministerial tools of the trade; and


     2) notes that his statement sounds similar to those of the old
        apartheid government whereby wrong things were justified even if
        everybody was saying that it was wrong.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Is there any objection to the motion?

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): In the light of the objections, the

Mr T M H MOFOKENG: Chairperson, I would like to move without notice:

   That the Council -

     1) notes with utter disdain that a  31-year-old  man  was  arrested  at
        Chochocho near White River in Mpumalanga and appeared in the  Masoyi
        Magistrates Court for repeatedly raping his 10-year-old  niece  when
        her mother was away; and

     2) takes this opportunity to condemn in the  strongest  possible  terms
        the malice of the uncle who was supposed to be the guardian  of  the
        niece and calls on the police and the justice sector to ensure  that
        justice for the child is carried out with expediency.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    KWAZULU-NATAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT FRAUD

without notice:

   That the Council -

     1) notes the raids and arrests in connection with fraud in the KwaZulu-
        Natal health department;


     2) further notes with concern that some persons whose assets were
        seized were arrested, whilst the former Treasury head was not
        arrested; and


     3) calls on the SAPS to treat all the accused in the same way without
        reference to their political connections and to ensure that those
        involved in the fraud, wherever they may be found in civil society
        or even in government, are charged and face the consequences of
        their criminality.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

notice:

   That the Council -

        Nelspruit at Mbombela Stadium to qualify for the Africa Cup of

 POINT OF ORDER BY MR A WATION ON 17 AUGUST 2010 ON UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Order! Hon members will remember that
at some point I made a commitment to the House that I would come back to
make a ruling on two points of order raised by Mr Watson and Mr Harris
during the plenary of 17 August 2010.

In respect of the point of order raised by hon Watson, my ruling is as
follows. During the debate on the report on the Taking Parliament to the
People programme – Limpopo, hon E S Maake, special delegate from Limpopo,
said that:

   We are confident that through our deeds this trend of choice shall
   continue whenever elections are called in this country, despite lesbian
   marriages which are being witnessed. We are prompted to say that the
   democratic dispensation in South Africa is very sweet and progressive;
   hence the kind of choices in relation to marriages, lest we witness
   domestic abuse of one partner by the other.

Mr Watson raised a point of order, saying that Mr Maake must withdraw the
reference to lesbian marriages, as it was unparliamentary and irrelevant to
the subject matter.

I then undertook to study the Hansard and make a ruling. With regard to the
content of the statement, it is evident that even though the member’s
comments did not refer expressly to any specific person or persons and
or/member or group, such marriages are recognised in our law. Any negative
reference to such marriages cannot be condoned by this House. Therefore,
members are called upon to be careful and sensitive in making reference to
issues that have particular bearing on the legislation that we as the House
have passed.

My ruling is therefore that the point of order raised by hon Watson be
upheld.

 POINT OF ORDER RAISED BY MR T D HARRIS ON 17 AUGUST 2010 ON UNPARLIAMENTARY
                                  LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Order! Hon members, regarding the
second ruling, during the same debate on the report on the Taking
Parliament to the People programme – Limpopo, hon Harris raised a point of
order regarding whether it was parliamentary to accuse another member of
lying to the House.
I then undertook to study the Hansard translated version of Mr Mashamaite’s
statement. Having considered the content of the statement, I find it is
apparent that there was inconsistency between his speech and the
simultaneous English interpretation. The hon member never mentioned the
word “lying” during his speech on the said date.

My ruling is therefore that the point of order raised by hon Harris cannot
be upheld.

              Criminal law (forensic procedures) amendment bill

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr B NESI: Chairperson, the House, the Deputy Minister and the committee
sat and studied the Bill. The Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment
Bill originally contained provisions dealing with the storing of
fingerprints and DNA samples, the creation of a national DNA database, and
the expansion of the SAPS Automated Fingerprint Identification System to
include fingerprints stored by the Department of Transport and the
Department of Home Affairs.

In order to allow the Department of Police to address the concerns in
respect of capacity for the effective implementation of the provisions of
the Bill in respect of DNA evidence, the Portfolio Committee on Police
decided to split the Bill into two phases. Phase 1 of the Bill deals only
with the fingerprint evidence, while DNA evidence will be dealt with in
phase 2. The Bill that was considered by the Select Committee on Security
and Constitutional Development, although still called the Criminal Law
(Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill, dealt only with the collection and
storage of fingerprints, body prints and images. The Bill is hereinafter
referred to as the fingerprint Bill.

An interdepartmental task team for the implementation of phase 1 of the
Bill consists of the Departments of Police, Home Affairs, Transport,
Correctional Services and the State Information Technology Agency. This
task team is facilitated by the Office for Criminal Justice System Reform.
The Portfolio Committee on Police was informed on 11 November 2009 that
Cabinet had approved that the implementation of the Bill would take place
incrementally over a period of time in order to allow time for detectives,
the development of systems and the IT infrastructure.

The Fingerprint Bill aims to give the police access to the Home Affairs
National Identification System, Hanis, the Department of Home Affairs, and
the electronic National Traffic Information System of the Department of
Transport. Currently, the police have only a limited number of fingerprints
of convicted persons on their database.

The Department of Home Affairs reportedly has over 31 million fingerprints
of South African citizens and over 2,5 million fingerprints of foreigners
on its database. The Department of Transport database is reported to
contain over 6 million thumbprints. The Bill will also amend the Criminal
Procedure Act and the South African Police Service Act. This will
necessitate consequential amendments to the Firearms Control Act and the
Explosives Act.

The select committee was informed that some challenges remain with regard
to the retaking of fingerprints and the electronic scanning of
fingerprints, as in the alignment of fingerprints between especially the
Department of Transport’s electronic National Traffic Information System,
eNatis, and the system of the police for facilitating effective searching.

Currently, the Department of Transport does not store fingerprints of all
10 fingers of drivers and learner drivers, which will limit the scope of a
search as required by the police. These challenges must be addressed in
order for the Bill to be effectively implemented, only and for the
availability of an effective and complete fingerprint database for
comparative searching.

Some amendments in the Bill came as a result of issues raised in
submissions and presentations to the portfolio committee, and one of the
most important issues was the alignment of the Bill with the Children’s
Act. The fingerprints of children must be taken with due regard for the
privacy, dignity and bodily integrity of the child, and an adult must be
present when fingerprints are taken. The child must be treated and
addressed in a manner that takes into account the child’s gender and age.
When a child perpetrator reaches adulthood, application can be made for the
removal of his or her fingerprints from the criminal database.

The Bill provides for 15 years’ imprisonment if a person is convicted of
abusing or manipulating the fingerprint database. Although no sanctions are
provided for the misplacement of fingerprints by mistake, the Bill provides
for the retaking of fingerprints and it is hoped that this will be limited
through intensive training. The retaking of fingerprints is also allowed
where the fingerprints cannot be read.

The select committee adopted the Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures)
Amendment Bill without amendments. The Bill is commended to the House as an
important step in the review of the criminal justice system as a whole. It
enhances the crime fighting and intelligence capabilities of the police, in
particular by expanding the number of fingerprints in their database, and
allows for certain circumstances when the police are obliged to take
fingerprints.

Debate concluded.

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson ... [Interjections.] ... the hon member Nesi was
just telling me that an ATM swallowed his card and he is without a card. He
tried to withdraw money from the ATM with this card! So, there is a problem
here. [Laughter.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                      SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon Members of
Parliament, comrades and friends, esteemed ladies and gentlemen, I thank
you for the opportunity to address the NCOP on the occasion of the Third
Reading of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill.

This Bill is part of the ANC government’s efforts to build a caring
society. It also bears witness to our ongoing work in ensuring the
progressive realisation of the constitutional right of access to social
assistance. The Ministry of Social Development has stated before that our
social assistance programme is witness to the ANC government and our
society’s way of putting the values of social solidarity into practice.

With these small but important resources that we are providing to older
persons, parents with young children, people with disabilities and others,
they are able to buy the bare necessities, primarily food for themselves,
their families and their children. This provides the indigent with a
measure of dignity, as they feel that they are part of society.

For as long as our society remains one of the most unequal in the world,
with high levels of structural unemployment and accompanying social
exclusion, it will continue to state unequivocally that the ANC government,
as the leader of our social transformation agenda, will through state
instruments lead in our efforts to mitigate the worst impacts of poverty
and unemployment. It will also implement programmes aimed at reducing
inequalities.

We are often confronted with comments and suggestions that our social
assistance programme is unsustainable. Yet research has indicated that our
cash transfer programme has been the key intervention in reducing the Gini
coefficient, which is the measure of inequality. This is an important
point, as international research has proved that unequal societies perform
less well economically and socially than societies that are generally more
equal.

Brazil has until recently been the most unequal society in the world. But a
rapid escalation of their social assistance programme, known as Bolsa
Familia, has resulted in an unprecedented reduction in their inequality
rate. The reduction in inequality spurred on economic growth, increased the
number of jobs created and generally contributed to a more cohesive society
in Brazil.

With the deepening of our own social assistance programme, we are on a
similar path. Therefore, it is time that we change the discourse here in
Parliament and in society. Our new discourse should focus on the
unsustainability of inequality in our country, as this is the key inhibitor
of real economic growth and progress towards a more stable and cohesive
society.

That means your questions to us should focus on what our progress is
towards building a comprehensive social security system that will, over
time, facilitate a more socially inclusive South Africa.

Chairperson, for us to extend our social assistance programme, we need to
improve on how we administer it. The Social Assistance Amendment Bill
therefore sought to do three things: firstly, to introduce a new definition
for disability; secondly, to provide a mechanism for the SA Social Security
Agency, Sassa, to review its decisions when a beneficiary is not satisfied
with the outcome; and thirdly, to enhance the appeals process.

Coming to the issue of the definition of disability, which is a key area of
leakage in the system, we are deeply concerned about the fact that every
cent lost due to bad administration, fraud and corruption in our system
diverts resources from those in our society that need them most. The
nonreporting of an increase in a beneficiary's income constitutes an area
of fraud and leakage too. Corrupt officials and government employees have
over the last five years felt the retribution of government as the Special
Investigating Unit and courts have dispensed justice for their wrongdoing.
We once again call on all members of our society to work with us in dealing
with leakage, fraud and corruption in the grants system.

Disability targeting presents a key challenge in any social security
system. In our case, we lack a common assessment tool for disability. This
results in errors of inclusion and exclusion in the administration of
disability grants. Effective targeting for the disability grant requires
the reliable and objective implementation of a uniform disability
assessment tool. The passing of this particular amendment will enable us to
make a distinction between permanent and temporary disability, and people
with chronic illnesses.

The debates in the Portfolio Committee on Social Development on this aspect
of the initial Bill were vigorous. After much constructive deliberation the
committee felt that whilst this aspect of the Bill was noble, with good
intentions, it might lead to unintended consequences, such as the exclusion
of people with chronic conditions. The Department of Health indicated to
the portfolio committee that it was not ready to implement the new
disability assessment. It outlined challenges it has in developing a
comprehensive response in assisting people with chronic illnesses and
indicated that it would require more time.

Chairperson, based on the fact that as government we will not be able to
provide adequately for chronically ill people, who may be removed from the
system, and based on a new approach to defining disability, the portfolio
committee felt strongly that the provision regarding the definition of
disability should be referred back to Cabinet for further deliberations. We
will, together with the Department of Health, work towards an appropriate
response in addressing the needs of those suffering from chronic
conditions.

The right to fair administrative action is a basic human right. The
Constitution guarantees that administrative action must be reasonable,
lawful and procedurally fair. It also makes provision that applicants for
social grants have the right to request reasons for administrative action
that affects them negatively.

The Social Assistance Amendment Bill facilitates a process wherein social
grant applicants and beneficiaries are treated with fairness, dignity and
respect. It makes provision for applicants and beneficiaries to request
Sassa to review its decisions in order to expedite the resolution of
disputes and avert unnecessary and costly litigation. The Bill also makes
provision for applicants and beneficiaries to appeal against a decision of
the agency, and for the appointment of an independent tribunal, in a manner
to be prescribed by regulations.

Tribunals are a key part of the administrative justice process and make it
possible for applicants and beneficiaries to present their grievances and,
if there are merits to their claims, to obtain simple and speedy
resolutions to their cases.

I am indeed pleased that, as elected representatives of our people, and
recognising its critical importance for the poor and vulnerable members of
our society, we have put our political differences aside and adopted this
important piece of legislation. Notwithstanding its size, this Bill will
impact positively on the lives of many of our most deserving citizens. It
aims to ensure that our government fulfils its constitutional obligation in
terms of section 27 of the Constitution.

The final product, the Bill we have before us, bears testimony to the
robustness of the legislation-making process in this country. Aside from
the extensive public consultation processes, the portfolio committee was
rigorous in its examination of the implications of the Bill in its original
format. It also asked for informative inputs from advocacy groups in civil
society.

The select committee too, led by Comrade Nomonde Rasmeni, undertook public
consultation processes which provided platforms for the electorate
throughout the country in order to engage with the contents of the Bill.
The collective wisdom that emerged from these processes is gratifying and
testifies to the enduring democratic spirit prevailing in this young
democracy. I would like to express my gratitude to the members of the
select committee, and indeed civil society, for their inputs, which served
to improve this Bill. That is what a robust policy-making process should
do.

We should be heartened by the fact that we have such an open system, and
perhaps bear in mind that we should not always have to resort to shrill and
alarming ways of proposing or opposing policy ideas in the public domain.
The debate regarding the protection of information Bill and the proposed
media tribunal is a case in point, but I shall not digress and speak on
that matter now. What we are assured of is that we have a democratically
elected ANC government and a robust decision-making system to ensure that
we make decisions for the collective good of all South Africans.

In conclusion, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the
officials of the Departments of Social Development and Health for their
hard work on this Bill.

Finally, I thank members of the House who have contributed to the debate at
various stages. Chairperson, I support the passing of this Bill by the
NCOP. [Applause.]

Ms R N RASMENI: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Social Development and
hon members, social assistance is a socioeconomic right guaranteed in the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The Constitution furthermore
specifically guarantees the right to social assistance for those who cannot
provide for themselves.

In 1994, the ANC government inherited a social security system that was
massively underdeveloped by international standards. It was characterised
by policy gaps, duplication in delivery and fragmented institutions. The
social security system failed vulnerable groups that faced risks such as
poverty, ill health, disability, unemployment, injury on duty and a range
of other challenges. This resulted in their effective exclusion from
participation in society.

As we enter the second decade of freedom, with the strengthening of
democracy and the acceleration of the programme to improve the quality of
life of all our people, the ANC recognises that we are at the beginning of
a long journey to being a truly united, democratic and prosperous South
Africa in which the value of all citizens is measured by their humanity,
without regard to race, gender and social status.

In 2001, the ANC government set up a committee of inquiry into a
comprehensive system of social security for South Africa chaired by Prof
Vivienne Taylor. The committee was mandated to conduct research and to
advise the government on social policy reform and the new system. The
commission found that most people, who numbered around 22 million at the
time, depended to a very large extent on the social grants that they
received from the government. It also pointed out that the social grant
system inherited from the apartheid era was inadequate to meet the
challenges of rooting out poverty, and that not all people qualified for
these grants.

The committee came to the conclusion that the social security programmes
failed to satisfy the constitutional imperatives, and thus made the state
vulnerable to Constitutional Court challenges, and were clearly inadequate.
The commission mainly recommended that a comprehensive social protection
package, which addresses not only income poverty but also capabilities
poverty, asset poverty and special needs, must be available. This package
must also include free and adequate public health care, free primary and
secondary schooling, free basic water and sanitation, free basic
electricity, accessible and affordable public transport, access to
affordable and adequate housing and access to jobs and skills training.

According to the 2009 report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, social security assistance directly reduces poverty
through improved health outcomes, increased school attendance, hunger
reduction and livelihoods promotion. Social security assistance makes
growth more pro-poor by enabling household investment in productive
activities and human capital. It helps poor and vulnerable households to
safeguard their assets and adopt effective coping strategies to meet
challenges arising from man-made and natural disasters. It builds self-
reliance, not dependency, as it strengthens the employability of poor women
and men, and enables them to seek and obtain better and more remunerative
work. It also reinforces the social contracts that can help legitimise and
strengthen the state, which is particularly important in fragile contexts.

The report further concludes that poverty can only be alleviated through
economic growth and social assistance. According to the report of the
study, a profile of social security beneficiaries in South Africa
commissioned in 2006 revealed that 82% of recipients of disability grants
indicated that food was their largest expenditure item, followed by payment
for basic services. Seventy-five percent of recipients said that the
disability grant helped them to care for other ill members of the
household. By far the largest demographic group that receives disability
grants, 75,4%, are black African people, of whom 54,3% are women. On
average, few have completed secondary education and almost a third have had
no formal education.

In our quest to build a caring society, the ANC is determined to create a
comprehensive social security system that is built on the fundamental
principle of social solidarity. We advocate a system that ensures that the
majority of South Africa’s poor benefit from expanded noncontributory or
social assistance measures. By 2010, over 13 million people received some
form of cash grant, thus complying with the Constitution.

The need to amend the Social Assistance Bill became evident when the 2003-
04 uptake of disability grants spiked to more than three times the
projected figure for that period. An investigation was done to establish
the cause of this sudden increase. The core findings were that there was no
common definition of what constituted a disability. There was also no
uniform assessment method or tool to determine whether a person had a
disability. This situation resulted in errors of both inclusion and
exclusion. Most of the stakeholders participating in the public hearings
were concerned about the health system’s ability to assess disabilities,
and the fact that the definition as it stood excluded people with chronic
illnesses.

Also, clause 18(1) of the Bill permitted only applicants or persons acting
on their behalf to appeal against decisions of the SA Social Security
Agency relating to any matter regulated by the Act. The section did not
permit beneficiaries whose grants had been terminated or suspended to
appeal against any decision of the agency relating to any matter regulated
by the Act. A beneficiary, thus, had no choice but to approach the court
for review.

The amending Bill allows a beneficiary to appeal against a decision of the
SA Social Security Agency, Sassa. The Bill also allows Sassa to reconsider
a decision by means of the process of an internal review. The amending Bill
also allows an applicant or a beneficiary to lodge an appeal with the
independent tribunal after the lapse of the 90-day period from the date
that the grant was terminated; this was not the case before. It therefore
provides more time for the applicants or beneficiaries to appeal.

The committee has learnt that the independent tribunal is ready to carry
and perform this mandate. In addition to that, the committee noted that
there are some challenges and that progress has been made by the
Independent Tribunal. Thus far, the appeals backlog has been reduced. On
average, 4 161 appeals are being processed per month compared to the
400 per month in past years. The reduced backlog can be attributed to the
leadership and management in this institution and the department itself, as
well as the fact that 60 persons have been employed through the Expanded
Public Works Programme, EPWP. Medical doctors and lawyers have been
enlisted to process appeals faster.

There are still minor challenges that are being experienced in this area.
The visibility of the tribunal at the provincial and national levels has to
be realised. Fast-tracking in the processing of the backlog also has to be
done. Lastly, a lack of necessary equipment is being experienced in the
call centres. The ANC supports the Bill as amended.
Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, and hon members, the primary objective
of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill is to amend the Social Assistance
Act, Act 13 of 2004.

It is my duty to make the following statement as a member of the DA: My
party believes in an open opportunity society, where people must have the
opportunity to make choices to better their lives for a better outcome.

One of the opportunities is the choice of employment. This opportunity is
very scarce in South Africa, and it is the duty of government to develop
circumstances and economic situations for people in South Africa, and to
make these opportunities available to the poor. Too many people are
unemployed, poor, vulnerable and dependent on grants.

That is not to say that the DA does not support the policy that a safety
net for the disabled, the sick, the poor and the permanently disabled and
others must exist in the policy of government. We must try to create a
citizen who is self-reliant and has the dignity not to be dependent on hand-
outs.

The DA agrees then that in the absence of these work opportunities for the
poor and the vulnerable such amendments to the Social Assistance Act are
important - very much so! Grants give a pot of gold to loan sharks.
Therefore, government must use all its resources to clamp down on practices
which make the poor poorer.

Sections 14 and 18 of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill speak to the
appeals measures: the right to reconsider the application, the right to
appeal the decision made by the agency, the right to clarification of the
decision and process they have taken, condonation and appeal to be handled
within 90 days, and applications received after 90 days has expired to be
considered.

Section 5 will still prevail and be referred back to Cabinet. This section
speaks to chronic illnesses, and the Department of Health said that they
were not ready to implement the harmonised assessment tool and related
matters.

We therefore agree with the view that redefining disability and
implementing the harmonised assessment tool must be cleared, because no
misunderstanding and misinterpretation must prevail. The referring back to
Cabinet of section 5 is supported. The Western Cape provincial parliament
supports the Social Assistance Amendment Bill. I thank you, Chairperson,
for allowing the debate on this Bill in the NCOP. [Applause.]

Mr J J GUNDA: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and hon members, it is good
to be back in the House. It’s a good thing to see you, my colleagues.
The goal of this Bill is to assist the poor, but how much say have the poor
had in its drawing up? South Africa is known as one of the countries with
the largest inequality gap between the rich and the poor.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Is there a point of order?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Yes, Chairperson, it’s a point of order. Now that the DA
has swallowed up the ID, in what capacity is the hon member speaking?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon member, I don’t think that is a
point of order. Hon Gunda, please proceed with the debate.

Mr J J GUNDA: Thank you, Chair, for protecting me. South Africa is known as
one of the countries with the largest inequality gap between the poor and
the rich. Approximately 57% of individuals living in South Africa are below
the income poverty line. The vulnerable groups are the rural poor, female-
headed households, Aids orphans, people with disabilities, farm workers,
and the unemployed. They are the ones affected. I therefore plead with the
government to really listen to and hear the plight of our people.

As some of my colleagues here today will know, I am an evangelist, and I
would like therefore to start by quoting three verses from Ecclesiastes
9:14-16 in the Bible:
   There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great
   king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
   Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered
   the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. Then said I, Wisdom
   is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised,
   and his words are not heard.

Sometimes I wish that King Solomon was here to guide us with his wisdom, so
that we as the leaders of today could learn and understand that the true
value of humanity is not measured by our status and our belongings.

Mnr J J GUNDA: Ek hoop en vertrou dat hierdie wetgewing nie net op papier
sal wees nie, maar dat dit regtig aan die pleidooie van ons mense aandag
sal gee en dat die regering nie aalmoese sal gee om ons mense beter te laat
voel nie. Ons moet ons mense ontwikkel sodat hulle regtig ’n sê kan hê in
hulle eie toekoms sodat dit ’n permanente verskil kan maak in hul lewens.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr J J GUNDA: I hope and trust that this legislation would not be mere
words on a piece of paper, but that it will really address the appeals of
our people and that the government will not hand out alms to make our
people feel better. We have to develop our people so that they can really
have a say in their own future in order to make a permanent difference in
their lives.]

I would like to close with this, Chair. Yes, this ANC government of today
has failed, but they have done something very, very important - they have
recognised the plight of the poor. I hope that this Bill will truly assist
our people – assist them to see to it that people have a much, much better
life! We as the ID support this Bill.

Mr M G E WILEY (Western Cape): Chairperson, the hon member Mr Sinclair has
a problem with alliances that are being formed. I wonder what he has to say
about alliances that are exploding at the moment. [Interjections.] Maybe
one of these days we will have one party speaking with three voices!

The Western Cape considered this Bill, and we support it. We believe that
it is going to close a couple of loopholes that exist at the moment.

Some of the evidence that was presented to the committee was from the Black
Sash and they had some pertinent points to make, one of which was that the
five-day notice period given to respond to the proposed Bill simply did not
provide for the public. They especially alluded to the fact that those
members of the public with limited resources would not have had adequate
time to engage properly with its content and make critical and meaningful
input.
They also said that they felt there should be both an internal and an
external or independent review mechanism. This was because the internal
review mechanism was more of a bureaucratic one where, if a technical
mistake was made with regard to the application, it could easily be handled
by the department. However, there needed to be some sort of an independent
mechanism, to which matters that were not just of a technical nature could
be referred.

Lastly, the Black Sash, an organisation of many years standing in dealing
with this specific category of indigent population requiring grants,
expressed their concern that there had been no agreed definition of
disability or consistent application of a standardised tool to assess it.
This has subjected many of our clients to the discretion of medical
practitioners and officials, which contradicts the basic principles of
administrative justice. These are important points. I hope that they will
be taken into account in the regulations.

However, the whole debate on this Bill raises some other pertinent points,
such as the issue of the war on poverty or poverty as such. I would like to
quote from Premier Zille’s newsletter of last week where she says:

  Almost everyone in South Africa agrees that our country’s major challenge
  is poverty and unemployment.

The question is, how can we enable people to move out of poverty, and earn
an income, in a sustainable way?

The “War on Poverty” programme, which is one of the major initiatives of
President Zuma’s office. It is spearheaded by the Deputy President, Kgalema
Motlanthe. Its key strategy is “community profiling”. In theory this
involves compiling a detailed survey of each household in a community, so
that the state can target its interventions with the purpose of enhancing
the capacity of the households to move out of poverty and earn a living.

I am sure that every member in this House religiously reads Helen Zille’s
newsletter every week, and so you will know that she gave a couple of
examples and anecdotes about what happened when she visited the community
to see the exposition of this particular profiling mechanism.

I want to quote just one example, because it really is illuminating. In
this particular case, the person was obviously an alcoholic, who was blind
drunk in the middle of the morning. The conclusion of the profiling was
that the way to alleviate that person’s poverty was to fix the crack in the
wall of his house. The state is going to have to mobilise its resources and
fix the crack in the wall of the house. Nowhere did it say in the profiling
that his alcoholism needed to be addressed, and nowhere did it take into
account that the man was a skilled bricklayer, tiler and plasterer and
could have done it himself if his alcoholism had been addressed in the
first place.

That, unfortunately, is one of the idiosyncrasies of a purely bureaucratic
approach. When she addressed the Deputy President in the meeting, she
further said:

   I used the opportunity to talk bluntly about some of the “unmentionable”
   causes of poverty: teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, the spread of HIV
   through unprotected sex, the failure of many fathers to take
   responsibility for their children. I said that if we were to wage a real
   and effective “War on Poverty” we would have to be honest about these
   issues and devise effective strategies to address them. This would
   require both the government and individuals to take responsibility. The
   current approach was entrenching poverty and dependence, not eradicating
   it.

Currently, the Western Cape’s strategy as far as poverty is concerned is
that the effects of poverty may be eliminated through state intervention,
but ultimately people can only be said to be out of poverty when they are
able to take care of their own basic needs. The state has a responsibility
to facilitate opportunities to escape poverty. It is necessary for people
to accept responsibility for making the most of the opportunities. No one
can escape poverty through state action alone. It must be a joint effort
between the state and the individual, in which each has responsibilities.
Nowhere in the discussion by the Deputy Minister did I hear about the
responsibility of the individuals concerned. There are many different
definitions of poverty in use today. The Western Cape provincial government
has chosen to take a capability deprivation approach borrowed from the
economist Amartya Sen and consistent with our vision of an open society for
all. At its heart is the understanding that substantive freedom, the
ability to lead a life of value, is the objective of development and that
poverty consists of not having the power, opportunity or means to do so.

Therefore, it follows that while the state has the responsibility to
facilitate opportunities to escape poverty, it is necessary for people to
accept the responsibility for making the most of these opportunities. No
one can escape poverty through state action alone. It must be a joint
effort between the state and the individual, in which each has a
responsibility.

One of the speakers has alluded to Brazil. With Brazil, I think you will
find, there are very few comparisons to be made with South Africa as far as
productivity is concerned. In its industry Brazil is per capita one of the
most productive nations in the world at the moment. South Africa has an
abysmal rate of productivity in world terms. We also have one of the
highest dependency rates per capita in the world as far as social grants
are concerned.

Therefore, contrary to what has been stated, it is not currently
sustainable. We must be careful - just as with the economy, we need to
create an environment where people want to participate and not one where
people are demotivated in regard to participating in the economic centre.
The DA believes that we should have a hand-up society and not a handout
society. We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Madam Chairperson, in the light of section 27 of the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which obliges the state to
achieve the progressive realisation of the right of everyone to social
security by taking reasonable legislative and other measures within its
available resources towards that end, all persons in South Africa who are
unable to support themselves and their dependants are, by virtue of section
27, entitled to appropriate social assistance. Cope, therefore, supports
the Social Assistance Amendment Bill.

The inadequacy of the definition has led to many grievances because of an
uneven determination of disability. In some cases, deserving applicants
were turned down, and in other instances cases were approved which clearly
should have been turned down. The need to refine the definition of
disability became necessary. We do not believe that this is the end of the
matter. This matter will have to be further revisited going forward.
Amending the Social Assistance Act was unavoidable.

The Bill also facilitates a quicker resolution of the disagreements among
the concerned parties. Applicants and beneficiaries who have issues with
the SA Social Security Agency, Sassa, can now request Sassa to reconsider
any decision that it might have taken, on the grounds that certain issues
or material points may have been overlooked or given lesser weight than
they actually merited.

Chairperson, this amendment will also allow Sassa to hear the other side,
maybe to uphold the rule of audi alteram partem and make sure that before
they take a decision relevant facts are taken into account. The Bill is
also asking for Sassa to apply its mind to every decision it takes. Where
the matter still remains unresolved, it will also go before the independent
tribunal in a manner that regulation will prescribe.

By its name and nature, social assistance is an attempt by government to
alleviate poverty. It should not, therefore, be used or seen as a salary.
Government and this House must keep a wary eye on the outcome of this
amendment. Already the state, in seeking to provide a security net, has
unintentionally created everlasting dependency.

In conclusion, Chairperson, because we know that at present the government
is providing this security, all people in this country will have recourse
to the Bill and be listened to when they have a problem with it. Cope
supports the Bill. [Applause.]

[Prince M M M ZULU: Chairperson of this House, hon Deputy Minister Dlamini,
hon members of this House, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the IFP, supports the
Social Assistance Amendment Bill. We know that there are experts in our
country who research the density of the population. In their research their
findings are that 82% of the population live below the poverty line, and
then it is said that between 50% and 58% are faced with unemployment. The
experts say that by the end of 2010 the Department of Social Development
would have given grants to more than 14 million people.

Deputy Minister, I sometimes ask myself what it is that can be done by your
department and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to
cater for people in the rural areas. You know that we believe that growing
crops might help us because if we look at our economy, we do not have
adequate resources for certain things to happen.

We have to encourage this by all means so that it can happen in our
country. I know that this government’s example is encouraged by our
Constitution, which states clearly that all people must have access to
resources. We support this amending Bill because it gives the Minister the
authority to review, thoroughly, the applications that were not taken into
consideration. That is why we support this amending Bill as the IFP,
because we are quite aware that it will help our needy and poor people. We
won’t involve ourselves in many things in order to score political points.
We, or rather I, as a Zulu man, sometimes wonder how people can be assisted
in making an application and get an instant response whether their
application is successful or not. Or maybe they could get something that
they can cook while they are waiting. I say this because I have first-hand
experience of hunger.

This can puzzle someone who has not experienced hunger, because it becomes
difficult to understand what is happening if you have never experienced
hunger. In the townships they know how to prevent hunger; they eat bread
for breakfast and for lunch. I have my breakfast, my lunch and my dinner.

Well, hon Minister, we support you as the IFP and the people of the Kingdom
of KwaZulu-Natal, because all the parties in that province support and
fully accept the amending Bill. We think that the people of Cetshwayo or
Dinizulu and Zwelithini will have a good life. Thank you.]

Ms B V MNCUBE: Chairperson, the introduction of the Social Assistance
Amendment Bill is a response to the stark reality that the ANC government
has had to face. This reality has its origins in the legacy of apartheid
and colonialism. In our current conjuncture, this reality reflects more
people being relegated to the outer fringes of the labour market, and the
social grant system being the main support for many families facing poverty
and unemployment.

The strengthening of the rights of claimants in such a context is a
fundamentally important responsibility that the ANC government has taken
up, informed by the ANC policy on social security. Since 1994 the ANC-led
government has endeavoured to create a comprehensive social security net to
cushion many of our people from economic deprivation. This is in line with
the ANC’s vision to create a caring society and an integrated system of
social development services that facilitates human development and improves
the quality of life.

The impact of the ANC government’s economic and social policies has seen a
significant reduction in the level of severe poverty and an improvement in
the quality of life of millions of South Africans. These policies have had
a particularly important impact on the lives of women living in poverty.
Female-headed households receive a larger than average share of the social
wage. This is largely because women are disproportionately affected by
poverty.

The ANC’s 52nd national conference in Polokwane in December 2007
strengthened this position. ANC policy views the social security net as a
critical pillar in a basket of measures aimed at stimulating the economy of
our country. This means that social grants should not be viewed in
isolation from the broader mandate of the ANC government to create
employment and economic growth in our country.

Having said this, we are also aware that this comprehensive security net is
not an end in itself, but is aimed at helping our people to keep afloat so
that they graduate to other economic opportunities and self-sustainability.
In this regard, one of the critical tasks that the ANC faced when it
assumed political power was not only to rationalise and restructure the
social security system, but to eradicate the racial skew of that system, a
legacy of the apartheid-driven system of disbursing of grants.

Social grants have many advantages for individuals and communities. Over
the past 16 years the positive outcomes of giving social grants to the
impoverished and vulnerable have had a substantial impact on the ability of
the most impoverished to survive. Grants are used to purchase essential
food and clothing, and to improve nutrition and basic human welfare.
Households that receive grants have been statistically proven to be less
likely to have malnourished or stunted children. Households receiving
grants have also been able to better access essential state services such
as health, clinics and schools.

Social grants generate economic benefits by improving recipients’ ability
to manage risk and insecurity. They also facilitate productive economic
activities such as informal trading or enable other household members to
migrate in search of work, thereby strengthening prospects for their
livelihoods.

Social grants enable our people to enter into the existing ubuntu system of
social reciprocity and mutual support which continues to mark our
impoverished communities. Hon Wiley, these are the revolutionary reasons
which have resulted in the ANC getting overwhelming results in the past 16
years, because South Africans, and Africans in particular, have realised
that ...

... setlhare sa motho e motsho, ha se lekgowa empa ke ANC ... [the notion
that black people can’t get anything done unless watched over by a white
man does not ring true, but the ANC can assist].

Many people living with HIV and Aids or other chronic illnesses require
social assistance to survive. These chronic illnesses, with all their
debilitating side effects, require those living with such illnesses to
access medication and adequate nutrition in order to live with dignity.
Many are currently eligible for the disability grant, but concerns have
mounted over the past seven years in relation to the manner in which the
proposed grant system operates and, in particular, what impact any
legislative amendment will have on those living with HIV and Aids or other
chronic illnesses.

Mr A WATSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Sesotho was put in the
English where, to my mind, the member said, “ha se lekgowa ke le-ANC” [not
by the white man but by the ANC]. That to me is hate speech and, unless
I’ve heard it wrong, the member must please explain or withdraw it.

Mr A G MATILA: Chair, it is unfortunate that Watty does not understand
Sesotho. The hon Watty does not understand Sesotho. It is an old saying of
the African people. Watty devolved from Europe to Africa - that is the
situation.

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order: A point of order
was raised by the hon Watson. It is up to the Chair to make a ruling and
not open a debate on the matter. Whether the hon Mncube was correct or not,
we are going to rely on the Chairperson’s ruling. I therefore, Chair, ask
you to close this debate. You can either make a ruling now or make it
later. You are not compelled to make a ruling on the matter now. Let us not
debate it.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): I’m closing the debate. I will make
a ruling next time.

Ms B V MNCUBE: The responsibility for providing care for the thousands of
people whose health has deteriorated because of poverty places challenges
on our ability to realise the right to health care for all of our people.
The purpose of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill is to amend the Social
Assistance Act of 2004; to define disability; to regulate the application
process of grants; of critical importance, to regulate the work of the SA
Social Security Agency in reconsidering its decisions with regard to the
approval or otherwise of grant applications; and to clarify the process of
appeals against the decisions of the agency.

While the availability of both health care and medication is critical in
maintaining the wellbeing of individuals with chronic illnesses, the
ability to take control of the given condition is often inhibited by the
inability to afford extra medication, transport to and from clinics,
adequate nutrition and basic necessities.

Section 27 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa obliges the
state to achieve the progressive realisation of the right of everyone to
social security by taking reasonable legislative and other measures within
its available resources towards that end. All persons in South Africa who
are unable to support themselves and their dependants are entitled to
appropriate social assistance.

As with other socioeconomic rights, the right to social assistance must be
interpreted against the values of the Constitution, including the
protection of a person’s right to human dignity. Treating people with
dignity requires the state to act in a reasonable manner towards those
claiming social security rights.

According to the memorandum on the Bill, and in regard to its objects, the
purpose is to insert a definition of disability in order to provide clarity
on eligibility for a disability grant. The United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognises the diversity of definitions
of disability that are applicable globally. Central to these definitions is
a person’s inability to maintain himself or herself through employment by
virtue of his or her disability.

In our considering the amending Bill, it was felt that it would be a grave
mistake to hastily approve an amendment that could result in the reversal
of gains made over the past 16 years, given the implications of the
proposal in regard to disability.

It is therefore clear that there is a general consensus that the clause
containing the definition of disability be withdrawn from the amending Bill
in order to address unintended consequences. This implies that at a future
stage further amendments will have to be brought to Parliament. The ANC
supports the Social Assistance Amendment Bill.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, firstly let me
thank all the parties for supporting this Bill, and say that this is going
to help us take our programme to fight poverty forward.

Also, we are used to fighting all the time and engaging.

Kepha okumnandi ukuthi ngesintu bathi impangele enhle ekhala igijima. [What
is interesting is that in our culture we say, “Make hay while the sun
shines.”]

So, we’ve heard what you are saying and some of the issues that have been
raised are reasonable. We note the concern about ongoing discretionary
decisions about disabilities. What is important is that we should
understand that doctors have been trained, and we are continuing to train
them in parts of the assessment tools to improve the objectivity and
reliability of assessing for disability. This issue was raised by the hon
member Mr Wiley.

Regrettably, the argument of the DA about the causes of poverty is very
simplistic. Poverty is multidimensional in nature and it’s a lot more
complex. What we need to understand is that when our government took over,
there was a very high level of poverty, squalor, hunger and unemployment.
It takes years to eradicate poverty. We have been called upon by the United
Nations to halve poverty by 2015 and that is what we as the government of
the ANC are trying to do. That is what the Millennium Development Goals are
demanding of us as governments.

Mexico, one of the countries that has a good social assistance programme,
takes seven and a half years to take people out of the cycle of poverty. I
think we should be proud of the work that our country is doing. This
programme is for vulnerable groups only but, from what I’ve heard here, it
sounds as if the programme is also for people who are eligible for work,
people who belong to the working class, who can contribute to the economy
of the country, and who are between the ages of 19 and 59. This programme
is only for older persons, children and the disabled. These are the
vulnerable groups. It’s not for able-bodied people.

I also want to remind the hon member Mr Wiley that this government’s
response to poverty is to provide not only toilet bowls, but also walls.
[Laughter.] So, it’s a comprehensive programme.

Mr De Villiers of the ID, the open opportunity society should not be an
argument aimed at ignoring ... [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: Madam Chairperson, on a point of order: Mr De Villiers is not
from the ID. I ask the Minister to withdraw that and state the correct
party, please. [Laughter.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): What do you mean? The DA and the ID
are the same. [Interjections.] Did Mr De Villiers speak as a member of the
DA? What do you ...?

Mr A WATSON: He is the member of the DA, ma’am.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: But I said “Mr Wiley”.

Mr A WATSON: He is not a member of the ID!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): At the end the Minister said “Mr
Wiley”.
Mr A WATSON: Her last words were “Mr De Villiers of the ID”!
[Interjections.]

Mr A G MATILA: Chairperson ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): Let us move on. I’ve made a ruling
- sit down.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, to Mr De Villiers
of the ID, the open opportunity society should not be an argument aimed at
ignoring ...

Mr A WATSON: The Minister is repeating it! Shhhhhhhh!

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Oh, I’m responding to the DA
now, yes, to Mr Wiley. Mr Wiley. Okay, I’m changing now.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): The Deputy Minister was responding
to the DA member.

Mr A WATSON: Yes, but she said “ID”!

HON MEMBERS: No! [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): Okay. Continue, Deputy Minister.
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: I made a mistake - I’m very
sorry. [Interjections.] Okay. All right.

Secondly, it is clear that many of us endeavour to create an
individualistic society and South Africa is not an individualistic society.
People have been arguing for people to help themselves, even when it is
clear that the grants are targeted at the sectors that I’ve spoken about.

I also want us to talk about the fact that we’ve been speaking about the
social movement and the partnership between the government and civil
society. We proved that we could do that when there was an economic
downturn. Government, civil society, business and labour worked very
closely in the National Economic Development and Labour Council, Nedlac.
This presented us with an opportunity to prove that we were able to work
together. During the 2010 Fifa World Cup we also proved that we are a
united country, and a united society. Some of the things that are being
raised here are very artificial. South Africa is a united country and we
are aspiring to be a democratic, nonsexist, nonracial, united and
prosperous country.

Lastly, the issue of community profiling is going to be continued. The
Deputy President started with that programme and councillors in our wards
are also busy with it. Community-based organisations and nongovernmental
organisations are busy with profiling because it’s going to help us to
target families that are poor and it’s going to help us to be able to deal
directly with poverty, because you can’t just throw resources at it anyhow.
To be able to deal with poverty, you need to understand where it is, so
that you are able to root it out.

There has been talk about people who can’t repair their houses, and who are
waiting for the government to repair those houses. We all know that our
people do not have artisanal skills and the government has also pronounced
on that. We as the government of the ANC have a programme focusing on that,
and so we are on course. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): Thank you, Deputy Minister. Your
debate was hot!

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 15:53.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces
Report of the Constitutional Review Committee On 2009 Public  Submissions

1.    Introduction

      In terms  of  section  45  of  the  Constitution,  Parliament  has  to
      establish a joint  committee  to  review  the  Constitution  at  least
      annually.

      In  giving  effect  to  this  provision,  the  Constitutional   Review
      Committee placed advertisements in the media on 17,  18  and  19  July
      2009  inviting   public   submissions   regarding   changes   to   the
      Constitution.  In all, 15 submissions were received.


      The Committee requested the Parliamentary  Legal  Services  office  to
      consider  each  of  the  submissions   in   the   light   of   current
      jurisprudence.


      Hereunder are brief summaries of the submissions  of  the  public,  as
      well as the Committee’s views and its recommendations.


2.    Summaries of public submissions

      Submission 1 by Mr Jerome Veldsman

      The  submitter  suggests  that  “the  value  of  human  dignity,   the
      achievement of equality  and  the  advancement  of  human  rights  and
      freedoms” require that “the Constitution ought to be sanitised of bias
      in favour of religious persons to the disadvantage of persons  who  do
      not hold supernatural or deity beliefs.”  He proposes  the  review  of
      sections 6(5)(b)(ii),15(2), 16(2)(c), 35(2)(f)(iii), the first item in
      the Table of Non-Derogable Rights in section 37, and Schedule 2 of the
      Constitution.

      Section 6(5)(b)(ii)
      Section 6 (5) (b) (ii) requires that  the  Pan-South  Africa  Language
      Board (Pansalb)  “promote  and  ensure  respect  for  Arabic,  Hebrew,
      Sanskrit and other languages for religious purposes in South  Africa.”
      The submitter argues that Pansalb is  an  organ  of  state  funded  by
      public resources.  Therefore the use of public resources “is repugnant
      to the rule of separation of State  and  Church”.   He  suggests  that
      section 6(5) (b) (ii) to be deleted in its entirety.


      The Committee feels that the suggestion that section 6  (5)(b)(ii)  be
      deleted would not be necessary.  The rule which the submitter uses  as
      a premise; namely, the rule of separation of state and church  is  not
      part of South African constitutional jurisprudence.


      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the  opinion  that  the  proposal  made  does  not
      warrant a review of the Constitution.


      Section 15(2),


      Mr Veldsman argues that the provision in section 15(2),  which  allows
      “religious observances”  at  state  or  state-aided  institutions,  is
      logically inconsistent.  He submits that the practice at any state  or
      state–aided institutions is to integrate  religious  observances  into
      meetings where attendance is not free and voluntary.  Further he holds
      that the national policy on religion and education is  “intellectually
      dishonest” in its provision that pupils may be excused on  grounds  of
      conscience  from  attending  a  religious  observance  component.   He
      suggests that the inclusion of sub-clause  (d)  to  section  15(2)  in
      order to provide that “no religious observances may  be  conducted  at
      state or state-aided institutions at any meeting or activity at  which
      attendance is not free and voluntary”.


      The Committee acknowledges that the  argument  by  Mr  Veldsman  is  a
      constitutional matter.  However, it is of the view that the suggestion
      is tautologous, as  section  15(2)  (c)  already  provides  for  this.
      Furthermore, the Constitution is not opposed to religion,  but  values
      the role it plays in the society.


      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the opinion that the submission does not warrant a
      Constitutional amendment.


      Section 16 (2) (c),


      Mr Veldsman suggests that section 16 (2) (c), which provides that “the
      right to freedom of expression dose not extend to advocacy  of  hatred
      that is based  on  race,  ethnicity,  gender  or  religion,  and  that
      constitutes incitement to cause harm” is deficient,  as  it  does  not
      include the  full  ambit  of  human  contemplation.   He  argues  that
      advocacy of hatred based on conscience, thought, belief and opinion is
      as repulsive as the advocacy of hatred based on religion.  He suggests
      that the omission of these words in section  16(2)(c)  might  even  be
      construed as permitting advocacy of hatred based  on  conscience.   He
      therefore suggests that the terminology used in  section  15,  namely:
      “conscience, thought,  belief  and  opinion”  should  be  included  in
      section 16(2) (c).


      The Committee is of the view that section 16(2)(c)  circumscribes  the
      right to freedom  of  expression.  However,  developing  the  inherent
      limitation  contained  in  section  16(2)(c),  as  suggested  by   the
      submitter, would limit the right to freedom of expression..


      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the opinion that the suggestion by  the  submitter
      is  a  policy  matter  and  does  not  warrant  any  review   of   the
      Constitution.


      Section 35(2)(f)(iii)


      Mr Veldsman argues that there is no  logical  or  rational  reason  to
      restrict the nature of counselling  in  section  35(2)(f)(iii),  which
      permits everyone who is detained , including every sentenced prisoner,
      to communicate with, and be visited by, the persons “chosen  religious
      counsellor”.  He suggests that section  35  (2)(f)(iii)  ought  to  be
      amended by omitting the word “religious” and substituting it with  the
      insertion of the word “contemplation”.


      The Committee, in deciding on its position on this matter,  considered
      the approach of the Constitutional Court in  the  Christian  Education
      case, in which the  Constitutional  Court  found  that  the  right  to
      freedom of religion, belief and opinion  in  an  open  and  democratic
      society contemplated by the Constitution  is  important.   Further  it
      decided that, although the rights of non-believers and minority faiths
      must be fully respected , the religious  beliefs  held  by  the  great
      majority of South Africans must be taken seriously” (at par [89]).


      Conclusion
      The Committee is of the opinion that there is no need to amend section
      35(2)(f)(iii), if the view of the  Constitutional  Court  is  accepted
      that not all religions are deistic.


      Table of Non-Derogable Rights found in section 37


      Me Veldsman argues that there exists no logical or rational reason  to
      distinguish between the protection of  the  right  to  equality  “with
      respect to unfair discrimination solely on grounds  of  …religion”  in
      the first item in the Table of Non-Derogable Rights found  in  section
      37,  from  “any  derogation“  under  a   state   of   emergency,   and
      contemplation that does not include  supernatural/deity  beliefs.   He
      therefore suggests that the word “religion” be replaced with the words
      “conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion”.


      The Committee does not agree with the proposal of replacing  the  word
      “religion” with “conscience, thought, belief and opinion”.  Developing
      the non-derogable rights as suggested by  the  submitter  would  allow
      less scope to achieve the aims of the state of emergency, which is  to
      restore peace and order.  The Committee views this as a policy  matter
      that does not warrant a review of the Constitution.


      He further argues that the inclusion of the words “(In the case of  an
      oath: So help me God.)” in the  oaths  found  in  Schedule  2  is  not
      necessary and contradicts the Constitutional  Court’s  view  that  the
      Constitution is secular.  He therefore suggests that  those  words  in
      Schedule 2 should be deleted.


      The Committee is of the view that the  approach  applied  in  the  two
      cases, namely Christian Education South Africa v Minster of  Education
      (2000 (10) BCLR 1051 (CC) at par [36 ]  and Minister of  Home  Affairs
      and Another v Fourie and Others; Lesbian and Gay Equality Project  and
      Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others (2006 (3) BCLR 355  (CC))
      , in which  the  Constitutional  Court  indicated  the  importance  of
      religion, should be applied here.


      In reading the two cases, the Committee is of the view  that  it  does
      not  appear  that  the  Constitutional  Court  regards  protection  of
      religious communities in the  Constitution  as  contradictory  to  the
      secular nature and legal interpretation of the text.


      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the opinion that  the  submission  made  does  not
      warrant a review of the Constitution.
      Submission 2 by NABCAT Limpopo

      The  submission  proposes  a  review  of  the  Construction   Industry
      Development  Board  Act  38  of  2000.   NABCAT   alleges   that   the
      Construction Industry Development  Board  (CIDB)  was  established  to
      groom emerging contractors  and  capacitate  them  to  participate  in
      government projects, but has failed to do so. It further alleges  that
      the CIDB’s rating of construction companies disadvantages  black-owned
      construction  companies  and  perpetuates  past  imbalances   in   the
      construction industry.
      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the view  that  the  NABCAT  submission  does  not
      propose the review of  a  constitutional  provision,  but  rather  the
      possible review of an Act of Parliament relevant  to  this  particular
      issue.


      The Committee recommends that matter  be  referred  to  the  Director-
      General of the Department  of  Public  Works  and-  the  submitter  be
      advised as such.


      Submission 3 by Rashid Patel & Company


      The submission is on the infringement of Constitutional  rights.   The
      submitter  proposes  that  the  Constitution  should  be  amended   to
      incorporate a provision which  will  give  subjects  a  right  to  lay
      criminal charges against officials when they  infringe  Constitutional
      rights.


      The Committee is of the view that the submission does not specify  the
      Constitutional right(s) that  officials  allegedly  breach.   However,
      section 38 of the Constitution deals with the enforcement of rights.

      The Committee is therefore of the view  that  the  proposal  does  not
      warrant any amendment to the Constitution.

      Conclusion

      The Committee has recommended that this  matter  be  referred  to  the
      relevant Parliamentary Committee and/or the  Director-General  of  the
      Department of Public Service and Administration  -  the  submitter  be
      advised as such.
      Submission 4 by Mr McLeod


      It was submitted that all  references  to  God  be  removed  from  the
      Constitution to confirm the secular nature of  the  Constitution.   It
      was also suggested that the Constitution should establish and  include
      basic rights in accordance with the precepts of  Ubuntu  for  sentient
      beings, including animals.


      The Committee is of the opinion that the Constitution  is  founded  on
      the equality principle and is the supreme law.  As such  there  is  no
      confusion or conflation of the Constitution with ‘God’s law’.  Section
      15(2) indicates that the state has  a  strong  interest  in  religious
      bodies.  Further it found that the  Constitution  is  not  opposed  to
      religion, but values the role it plays in the society.


      On the proposal on the establishment and inclusion of basic rights  in
      accordance with the precepts of Ubuntu for sentient beings,  including
      animals, the  Committee  does  not  support  the  suggestion  for  the
      inclusion of positive rights for animals in the Constitution. It draws
      its conclusion on this matter from the judgements in the cases of Port
      Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers 2004 (12)  BCLR  1268  (CC)
      and the Azanian Peoples Organisation and Others  v  President  of  the
      Republic of South Africa and Others 996 (8) BCLR 1015 (CC), as well as
      the judgment of Mokgoro J in S v Makwanyane and Another 1995 (6)  BCLR
      665 (CC) which recognized that fundamental rights were already infused
      with the precepts of Ubuntu. It feels that legislation that guarantees
      the protection of animals is sufficient.

      Conclusion

      The Committee is of the view that the submission does  not  warrant  a
      constitutional review..
      Submission 5 by Sekwele Centre for Social Reflections (SCSR)

      The submissions by the SCSR are as follows:

      (1)   Children’s Rights: section 28


      The proposal is for the limitation of section 28 of  the  Constitution
      so as to “restrict the conditions in which  termination  of  pregnancy
      should be performed”.  The submitter recommended that abortion  should
      be limited to instances where pregnancy poses a  health  risk  to  the
      baby or the mother, and where pregnancy was a result of rape.


      The Committee is of the view that section 28(2)  of  the  Constitution
      provides that the child’s best interests are of  paramount  importance
      in every matter that  concerns  the  child.   This  section  does  not
      regulate abortion.  The Choice of Termination of Pregnancy  Act,  1996
      (Act No.92 of 1996) deals with the termination of pregnancy.  It would
      seem  that  the  submitter  proposes  for   the   amendment   of   the
      Constitution,  bypassing  legislation   that   gives   effect   to   a
      Constitutional right.  The Committee notes the legal principle applied
      in the case of NAPTOSA and others v  Minister  of  Education,  Western
      Cape and Others 2001 (4) BCLR 388 (C).


      Conclusion


      The Committee is of the opinion that the submission does  not  warrant
      any constitutional review.


      (2)   Education Rights: section 29(1)(a)(b) and section 29(3)


      The SCSR proposes that an amendment should be made to section  29  (1)
      to provide for free basic education at least up to a Grade  12  level.
      The Committee is of the opinion that it  would  not  be  necessary  to
      amend the relevant section, as it already places a positive obligation
      on the state to take reasonable measures to  progressively  make  both
      basic and further education available and accessible to everyone.

      SCSR also suggested that section 29(1)(b) should be amended so  as  to
      relieve graduates of the legal obligation of repaying a loan  obtained
      through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NASFAS).


      Conclusion


      The  Committee  decided  that  these  should  be   referred   to   the
      Parliamentary committees on Basic and Higher  Education  respectively,
      and the submitter should be advised as such.



      (3)   Section 25  Property


      The SCSR proposes the scrapping of section   25 of the Constitution in
      its entirety.  The argument  is  that  this  section  is  serving  the
      interest of the rich at the expense of the poor. It further holds that
      section 25 is the cause of the widening gap between the rich  and  the
      poor.


      Conclusion


      The Committee has decided that  the  submission  be  deferred  pending
      further consultation by the political parties.

   Submission 6 by Dr M Pheko

   The  submission  proposes  an  amendment  in   section   25(7)   of   the
   Constitution.  The proposal concerns the effectiveness of section  25  of
   the Constitution in addressing past injustices.


   Conclusion


   The committee decided that the submission  be  deferred  pending  further
   consultation by the political parties.


   Submission 7  by  Mpumalanga  Provincial  House  of  Traditional  Leaders
   (MPHTL)


   The submission by the MPHTL suggests the following:


   (1)      The roles and functions of Traditional Councils must be  defined
        in Chapter 12 of the Constitution.
   (2)      The status of the House must be defined - whether it is a public
        entity or part of Parliament.


   (3)      Recognition of traditional leadership must include all layers of
        traditional leadership.


   (4)      Intergovernmental relations  must  be  amended  to  include  the
        institution of Traditional Leadership.


   (5)      The House’s  financial  management  must  be  regulated  by  the
        Financial Management of Parliament Act.


   The submission by the MPHTL is still under consideration.


   Submission 8 by Mr or Ms Ruiters

   The Committee could not consider the submission as it was not legible and
   the submitter could not be traced.


   Submission 9 by Anne-Marie Robb


   The submitter requests the  Committee  to  address  the  issue  of  legal
   capacity, especially in  relation  to  mental  health  care  users.   She
   suggests that the Constitution should make it clear that  legal  capacity
   of persons cannot be taken away from them arbitrarily.  She also  submits
   that  the  term  “conscience”  may  seem  to   suffice,   but   including
   “psychosocial/physical disability “will enrich the Constitution  in  line
   with  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  People  with
   Disabilities.


   The Committee is of the  view  that  the  request  by  the  submitter  is
   sufficiently addressed in the Constitution, the Mental  Health  Care  Act
   and in general in the South African law of persons.


   Conclusion


   The Committee recommends that the submission be referred to the Director-
   General of the Department of Justice and Constitutional  Development  for
   further explanation on issues of legal capacity status- the submitter  be
   advised as such.


   Submission 10 by Mr Thamsanqa Robert Ncube
   The submission deals with the connections between material and  political
   inequality.  However, while the submission makes reference to the  inter-
   relationship between “material and political inequality and how  protests
   formed  around  demands  to  address  the  former   may   have   positive
   consequences”, the  submitter  does  not  propose  an  amendment  to  the
   Constitution as such.


   Conclusion


   The committee is of the view that the matter does not warrant a review of
   the Constitution.
   Submission 11 Advocates for Transformation (AFT) - Gauteng

   The submission recommends that Parliament should amend  sections  168(3),
   and 172, as well as sections 8 and 38 of the Constitution.  In regard  to
   section 168(3), the proposal is for the exclusion of  all  matters  which
   fall within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Labour  Appeal  Court  from  the
   jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Appeal.


   The AFT also argues that section 8 has  been  interpreted  to  mean  that
   common law or legislation must be relied on to invoke right in  the  Bill
   of Rights.  They argue that this is an incorrect interpretation and  that
   Parliament should amend this clause to make it clear  that  this  is  not
   what is intended.


   The AFT is of the view that section 38 of  the  Constitution  has  to  be
   dealt with in conjunction with section 172, which makes  it  clear  that,
   once a court has found that the law or conduct is inconsistent  with  the
   Constitution, it has to declare such law or conduct invalid to the extent
   of its inconsistency.


   Conclusion


   The Committee decided that the matter should be referred to the Portfolio
   Committee on Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and  advises  the
   submitters to make a submission when the Superior  Courts  Bill  and  the
   Constitution 19th Amendment Bill are tabled.

   Submission 12 by Mr Mkhalipi


   The submission is on the distortions in the copies  of  the  Constitution
   which mark 10 years of  freedom.  The  submitter  questions  whether  the
   significance of the Constitution is appreciated in respect of the  manner
   in which the  text  is  distributed  and  its  value  is  promoted.   The
   submission indicates that the “most recent copies of the Constitution  in
   circulation contain several embarrassing  errata”  and  argues  that  the
   “oversight authority”, which is Parliament, might need to proof-read  and
   certify all updated editions of the Constitution.


   The Committee is of the view that the  issue  is  not  a  “Constitutional
   matter” that would require a Constitutional review.


   Conclusion


   The Committee recommends that the matter needs to  the  referred  to  the
   Director-General  of  the  Department   of   Justice   &   Constitutional
   Development and the publishers.


   Submission 13 by the National House of Traditional Leaders (NHTL)


   The submission proposes amendments to Chapter 12 of the Constitution. The
   NHTL also argues that the chapter of the Constitution, which  deals  with
   Local Government, deprives traditional leaders of their right  to  govern
   their own communities.  It proposes that the powers, functions and duties
   of any Local Government be performed by  traditional  leaders  to  ensure
   that service delivery and development  in  traditional  communities  take
   place rapidly.  It further suggests that, where an  organ  of  state  has
   allocated a role or  function  to  traditional  councils  or  traditional
   leaders, the organ of  state  must  monitor  the  implementation  of  the
   function and ensure that the implementation of the function is consistent
   with the Constitution.  Where a traditional council does not  perform  an
   allocated function, any resources  given  to  a  traditional  council  to
   perform that function may be withdrawn.   The  NHTL  also  suggests  that
   traditional leaders  should  be  represented  in  all  legislative-making
   bodies, including Parliament.


   The submission by the NHTL is still under consideration.


   Submission 14 by IDASA
   The  submission  proposes  an  amendment  to   section   47(1)   of   the
   Constitution.


   Conclusion


   The  Committee  has  decided  to  defer  the   submission   for   further
   consultation by parties.


   Submission 15 by Mr Ismail

   The submission by  Mr  Ismail  is  not  a  submission  in  respect  of  a
   Constitutional amendment, but rather a request for legal  advice  on  the
   legal remedies available to restitution claimants  who  are  dissatisfied
   with compensation paid to them in respect of their land claims.


   Conclusion


   The Committee is of the view that this matter does not  fall  within  its
   jurisdiction. The Committee has decided that Mr Ismail should be  advised
   to approach the nearest justice centre for advice on the legal remedies.

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Social  Services  on  its  oversight
   visit to Princess Mandisa Health Care Centre,  Benedictine  Hospital  and
   Hlabisa Revitalisation Hospital, in Nongoma, Kwazulu Natal  on  17  March
   2010, dated 28 July 2010

   1. Introduction


   The Select Committee on Social Services undertook an oversight  visit  to
   two (2) health  centres  as  well  as  one  (1)  hospital  revitalisation
   programme in Nongoma, Kwazulu - Natal on Wednesday  17  March  2010.  The
   visit also aimed to contribute to the  Committee’s  mandate  of  ensuring
   that Provincial interests are taken into account in the  National  Sphere
   of Government.


   Delegation


   The committee consisted of a Multi-Party  delegation  led  by  Hon.  R  N
   Rasmeni (Chairperson,  ANC, North West), Hon.M  W   Makgate  (ANC,  North
   West), Hon. M J R de Villiers (DA, Western Cape), Hon. M L Moshodi  (ANC,
   Free State), Hon. W F Faber (DA, Northern  Cape),  Hon.  T  A  Mashamaite
   (ANC, Limpopo), Hon. M G Boroto (ANC, Mpumalanga), Hon. D Z Rantho  (ANC,
   Eastern Cape) and Hon. Prince M M M Zulu (IFP, Kwazulu - Natal).




    The following officials accompanied the delegation:

    Ms. M Williams, Committee Secretary, Mr. M Dlanga,  Committee  Secretary
   and Ms. C Adams, Committee Assistant.




    2.      Activities and Proceedings

    The Committee interacted with the officials from the Health  centre  and
   hospitals. The Committee was then briefed on the challenges facing  these
   hospitals and the health centre. The main issues  that  took  the  centre
   stage in the meetings were the challenges faced, such as lack  of  water,
   electricity, roads, infrastructure, staff and resources.



    3.      Princess Mandisi Health Care Centre [Ulundi]


    The Committee was informed that the  establishment  of  the  centre  was
   triggered by the increasing rate of orphans in the area. Services offered
   include voluntary counselling and testing, health education,  mentorship,
   food gardening and adult basic education and training as well as a ground
   breaker programme, which is a programme similar to mentorship.


    The Committee identified the following challenges:


    ►a vacant post for a professional nurse exists because  of  insufficient
   funds to fill the post.
    ►After testing patients for HIV/ AIDS and TB, counselling is given  then
      patients are referred to surrounding hospitals for treatment. ARVs are
      not administered at  the  centre,  due  to  the  unavailability  of  a
      professional nurse.
    ►the municipality has donated seedlings with the aim of starting a  food
      garden  to  assist  in  supporting  the  centre   financially.   These
      vegetables are sold as an income for the centre.
    ►The centre receives no funding, however sponsors are being approached.


    Recommendations
    The Department of Health and Social Development should be approached  to
    assist with funding initiatives.
         ➢ The Department of  Health  should  assist  by  making  resources
           available in terms of training, human resource and medicines.
         ➢ The centre should aim to strengthen campaigns and initiatives.
         ➢  The  centre  should  register  as  an  NGO  with  the  relevant
           Department as soon as possible.
         ➢ The Department of Health should fill the  vacant  nursing  posts
           that exist.


    4.      Benedictine Hospital
    The Committee was informed that services offered include gynaecological,
   mental health, occupational health,  rehabilitation,  casualty,  surgery,
   paediatrics, forensics as well as out patient services. Support  services
   include anaesthetics, theatre and radiology. Also, pharmacy,  laboratory,
   blood bank and dental clinic services.


    The Committee identified the following challenges:
    ►There are no available hospitals in the district, thus there is a  high
      demand placed on Benedictine hospital.
    ► Sanitation is a big threat due to the lack of running water.
    ►Electricity is scarce and unreliable.
    ►Roads are in a very bad condition.
    ►Due to the low employment rate, poverty is a disturbing factor.
    ►HIV and TB infections are high as well  as  meningitis,  as  is  herbal
      infections in adults due to communities treating themselves with herbs
      before seeking medical attention.
    ►High rates of gastro and herbal intoxication by children.
    ►The outpatient head count is extremely high.


    Recommendations
       ➢ The Provincial and National Governments  should  be  requested  to
         intervene with regards to water  supply  and  assist  by  erecting
         green water tanks.
       ➢ Service  delivery  must  be  addressed,  for  example,  the  empty
         reservoir at the hospital and the turning off of the water  supply
         by the municipality, mostly during the evenings.
       ➢ There should be an integration of service delivery  plans  at  all
         spheres of government.
       ➢ The Department of Health should consult with  traditional  leaders
         with regards to service delivery issues.
    5.      Hlabisa Revitalisation Hospital


    The Committee was informed that the  hospital  revitalisation  programme
    has  four  components  to  it.  These  include  infrastructure,   health
    technology, equipment  and  furniture,  organizational  development  and
    quality assurance.
    Furthermore, the Committee was informed that the hospital was undergoing
    revitalisation in 2 phases. Phase  1  includes  doctors’  accommodation,
    housing for nurses, a  pathology  laboratory,  recreational  facilities,
    refurbishments of the sterilisation department and a guard house.  Also,
    the conversion of the boiler house to a laundromat,  the  relocation  of
    the mortuary and miscellaneous demolitions.  Upgrades    of  female  and
    male wards are also included. This culminates in a revamp at a  cost  of
    R113 million.


    Phase 2 is fully designed, documented and ready  to  go  to  tender.  It
    comprises a pharmacy, X-ray department, medical, surgical and  maternity
    wards, theatres, laundry and a mortuary. Currently phase two was put  on
    hold because of other projects taking priority. The estimated total cost
    is calculated at R775 million.


    The Committee identified the following challenges:
    ►The supply of water is a continuous problem at the hospital.
    ►The water pipeline will only  reach  completion  within  the  next  two
   years.
    ►The entire process of tendering, planning, construction and
      finalization of projects at the hospitals various stages is time
      consuming.
    ►The hospital is dilapidated and in a  very  bad  condition,  structures
      could collapse at any day more especially the OPD and pharmacy.


    Recommendations
       ➢ The Committee reiterated the words uttered  by  the  President  of
         South Africa that the project management team should work  faster,
         harder and  smarter  as  the  hospital  is  a  necessity  in  this
         location.
       ➢ The HOD present at the meeting  should  raise  and  present  these
         problems to the MEC and consider reprioritisation of the hospital.


    6.      Conclusion

    The visits to the health centres as well as the hospital  revitalisation
    programme in Nongoma provided the Committee  with  an  overview  of  the
    challenges faced by these centres/ hospitals.  The  Committee  commended
    the staff at the various centres for their inputs and agreed that theses
    challenges will be addressed with the relevant departments.
