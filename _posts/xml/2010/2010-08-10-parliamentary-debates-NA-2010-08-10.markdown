Thank you.

Mr G R MORGAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DA:

   That the House –

Mr D A KGANARE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of Cope:

   That the House debates the inability of government to manage the health
   system, in the light of more than 16 years in which hospitals have
   deliberately been ignored by government and in the light of the recent
   incident of a mother at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital who was left

   the roads have led to an increase in accidents, some of which have been
   fatal, as well as motorists incurring higher vehicle operation costs.

Thank you.

   (1)      notes that three-quarters of China’s provinces have been hit  by
        flooding with record-high  water  levels,  and  that  flooding  has
        destroyed houses, killed  and  displaced  hundreds  of  people  and
        caused billions of rands’ worth of damage;


   (2)      further notes that with the flooding season far from over,  this
        year’s floods are possibly going to be the most  devastating  since
        the floods of 1998, which were the worst in 50 years;


   (3)      expresses its sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to  the

        Organisation for Women in Science, took place in June 2010 under

     2) further notes that South African laser physicist, Dr Christine
        Steenkamp, was one of three African women scientists who received
        international recognition for excellence in research;


     3) believes that the win by these three African women scientists will
        inspire and motivate young women in Africa and particularly in
        South Africa to pursue science and mathematics, which are fields in
        which  women are under-represented; and


     4) congratulates Dr Steenkamp for winning the mathematics/physics
        prize for Africa and for her excellent contribution to science,
        particularly her pioneering work in the field of vacuum ultraviolet
        laser spectroscopy.

Agreed to.

      CONGRATULATIONS TO LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN ON WINNING BRITISH OPEN GOLF
                                CHAMPIONSHIP

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move without
notice:

   That the House -


     1) notes that on Sunday, 18 July 2010, South African golfer, Louis
        Oosthuizen, won the British Open Championship with a seven-stroke
        victory over Lee Westwood;


     2) further notes that this win was the 27-year-old Oosthuizen's maiden
        Major title, and that it occurred in the 139th edition of this
        esteemed championship, held this year at the Old Course at St
        Andrews in Scotland;


     3) recognises that this accomplishment allows Oosthuizen, who was
        ranked 54th in the world going into the British Open, to join an
        esteemed list of South African golfers who have won the British
        Open, including Bobby Locke, Gary Player and Ernie Els, and thus
        raised the sought-after Claret Jug;


     4) further acknowledges that prior to the tournament, Oosthuizen had
        missed the cut in his three previous appearances at the British
        Open and that his previous best performance in a Major was a 73rd-
        placed finish at the 2008 PGA Championship;

                   WELCOMING THE “FLY THE FLAG” INITIATIVE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without

        mobilised all South Africans, both black and white, to proudly wear
        the national colours every Friday;
     3) believes that, with the same patriotism and enthusiasm, South
        Africans from all walks of life will actively embrace and continue
        with the spirit that has been created during the African World Cup;
        and


     4) calls on all South Africans to continue with the mood of
        celebration by wearing the colours of the flag and to keep the
        flags flying in their vehicles, offices and their homes.

                    COMMEMORATION OF NATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms S V KALYAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move without notice:

   That the House -


     1) notes that 9 August is National Women’s Day;


     2) recognises that this day commemorates the courage of the  group  of
        20 000 women, composed of all the racial groups  in  South  Africa,
        who on 9 August 1956 marched to  the  Union  Buildings  in  protest
        against the iniquitous “pass laws” imposed upon persons  deemed  to
        be “nonwhites” by the apartheid government;

     3) further recognises that racial and  gender  inequality  constituted
        the cornerstones of apartheid and the struggle against apartheid;

     4) acknowledges that today in a democratic South  Africa  equality  is
        enshrined within our Constitution and that many positive steps have
        been taken in the past 16 years to redress the  injustices  of  the
        past in order to realise  the  principle  of  equality  within  our
        society, but that even more still needs to be done to fully realise
        this constitutional right; and

     5) calls upon the leaders of the country,  including  the  Government,
        civil society, labour and business, to redouble  their  efforts  to
        address  issues  that  further  enhance  gender  equality  and  the
        creation of opportunities for women.

Agreed to.

                PASSING AWAY OF MR MZIKAYISE SYDNEY MBANGULA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move without
notice:

   That the House -

      1) notes with profound sadness the passing away  on  Friday,  18  June
         2010,  of  the  Manager  of  the  Corporate  Services  Division  of
         Parliament, Mr Mzikayise Sydney Mbangula;


      2) further notes that “Bra Mzi’’, as he was affectionately known,  was
         a loyal servant of Parliament from 1 June 2002 until his death  and
         leaves behind  his  wife,  Thembeka,  three  children,  his  mother
         Nomzikayise, two brothers and four sisters;


      3)  recognises  his  invaluable  contribution  to  the  activities  of
         Parliament as a  whole  and  the  Corporate  Services  Division  in
         particular; and


      4) expresses its sincere condolences to his family, friends and  loved
         ones.

Agreed to.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, we obviously have
no objections to that motion, but the matter I want to raise is that the
photograph that was pictured on the screen was highly inappropriate because
it had the ANC flag on it. Mr Mbangula was an official of Parliament first
and foremost, and nothing else. Political affiliation should be completely
irrelevant and I object to that. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: But you are not objecting to the motion?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Not at all.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, thank you very much.

               PROGRAMME TO CREATE 10 000 JOBS FOR RURAL YOUTH

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms P P XABA (ANC): Hon Deputy Speaker, the ANC-led government views rural
development as a central pillar of our struggle against unemployment,
poverty and inequality. Hence the ANC supports the initiative to create an
estimated 10 000 jobs for unemployed rural youth through a programme
recently launched on 19 July 2010 by the Department of Rural Development
and Land Reform.

The National Rural Youth Service Corps will be targeting youth from deep
rural areas, including those living with disabilities, between the ages of
18 to 35 and who have passed Grade 12. The National Rural Youth Service
Corps is a two-year programme aimed at empowering rural youth from each of
the 30 rural wards across the country. Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

           ARREST AND DETENTION OF JOURNALIST MZILIKAZI WA AFRIKA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms L D MAZIBUKO (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, the arrest and detention of
Sunday Times journalist Mzilikazi wa Afrika in Rosebank last week bore all
the hallmarks of apartheid-era police action and detention without trial.

Certainly, the nature of the arrest and what seems to be the deliberate
spectacle surrounding it are cause for serious concern to the DA. Wa Afrika
was publicly accosted outside the Sunday Times offices. He was bundled into
an unmarked car and driven four hours from Johannesburg to Nelspruit in
Mpumalanga to explain why he was in possession of a fax. Why?

The arrest involved six Hawks vehicles and almost a dozen armed officers
and came just a day after National Police Commissioner Bheki Cele referred
to wa Afrika as a “shady journalist” on national television - and just
three days after the Sunday Times published a story about Commissioner Cele
flouting tender procedures.

Was this intended as a message to the free press? Will we now see a return
to the cloak-and-dagger arrest of journalists who dare to speak out against
the state, as was the norm under apartheid?

Among the questions wa Afrika was asked during interrogation, the police
wanted to know: “Are you destroying the image and integrity of the ANC in
Mpumalanga?” Police resources and intimidation tactics are now being
deployed in defence of the ANC and its factions. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker!

Ms L D MAZIBUKO: Given the mounting evidence that the motive behind wa
Afrika’s arrest was purely political, it is incumbent upon the Police
Commissioner and the Minister of Police to explain this action to
Parliament and the public. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, I would like
to rise on a point of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, there is a point of order.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, this was
raised as a motion without notice.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay. Cope is next.

Ms S P RWEXANA (Cope): Madam Deputy Speaker, women in South Africa are
facing the same challenges, whatever their political affiliation ...
[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: On a point of order, Madam Deputy
Speaker. The previous speaker, my colleague, was unable to finish her
statement and I would like you to ask her to finish her statement. Thank
you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, no, no, her time had expired when I took the point
of order. Cope is next.

                       WOMEN’S DAY–SOLIDARITY OF WOMEN

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms S P RWEXANA (Cope): Madam Deputy Speaker, women in South Africa face the
same challenges, whatever their political affiliation.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of
order, the previous speaker, my colleague, wasn’t able to finish her
statement ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, she did.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: No, she didn’t finish her statement and I
would like you to ask her to finish it. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, her time had already expired when I said there was
a point of order.

Ms S P RWEXANA (Cope): Women in South Africa face the same challenges,
whatever their political affiliation. They suffer physical abuse, they are
under constant threat of being raped, they experience prejudice in the
workplace, and they are subjected to cultural practices that are
pertinently discriminatory. For women it is a huge uphill struggle. The
struggle has to be intensified. The struggle has to be kept alive.

In the past, women stood up against racial discrimination and unjust laws
in our country. Thousands of women left the country for various
destinations in Africa and Europe to wage war against racial oppression.
Every woman wants to be accorded respect and be treated with dignity. Every
woman wants to enjoy equality with men. Every woman is therefore first and
foremost a woman. The women of South Africa may have different views on
many issues but they are united in their resolve to stand together and be
counted as one.

By showing solidarity with one another we will create a future for our
children in which girl children and women will be accorded the respect they
rightfully deserve. Yesterday marked the 53rd Anniversary of Women’s Day.
Instead of it being celebrated for its universality, it was disheartening
to find the ANC Women’s League trying to monopolise the event that
commemorated the march of our mothers that ended up at the Union Buildings
in Pretoria on 9 August 1956 against the imposition of the pass laws. We
commemorate the struggle of all women from all persuasions.

                         ACCESS TO RURAL HEALTH CARE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr A J WILLIAMS (ANC): Hon Deputy Speaker, the African National Congress
believes that health reform involves the mobilisation of available
resources in both the private and public health sectors to ensure improved
health outcomes for all South Africans. As a result, a total of 18 new
mobile clinics were launched in Mpumalanga to provide health care access to
rural villages and farming areas that have no clinic facilities nearby.

The Member of the Executive Council, MEC, for the Department of Health and
Social Development, Dikeledi Mahlangu, launched the mobile clinics at the
Leroro Community Hall in Matibidi Township near Sabie on Friday, 02 July
2010. These mobile units will make a difference in the lives of many rural
and farming communities who are underserved because of the shortage of
mobile clinics. The allocation of these mobile clinics will mean that
people living in remote areas will not have to travel long distances to
access basic services. This initiative is part and parcel of the ANC-led
government’s resolve to reduce inequalities in our health system and
improve quality, care and access to public health care facilities for our
people. Thank you.

                          NATIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr A M MPONTSHANE (IFP): Mhlonishwa Sekela Somlomo [Hon Deputy Speaker]
when we look at the results of the national matric supplementary exams held
earlier this year, the IFP is extremely disappointed with the failure of
our education system. The overall pass rate of 19,1% is shocking, to say
the least. Mpumalanga achieved 11,9%, KwaZulu-Natal 19,2%, Free State 10%,
Western Cape 26,2% and Gauteng was the top scorer in our country with only
31,5%.

Our education system is quite clearly failing the youth of this country and
we therefore urge the Minister of Basic Education to take immediate action
in identifying, addressing and rectifying all the factors that have
contributed to this most appalling state of affairs. Our failure in this
regard robs our children of a better future. I thank you.

                     ACID MINE WATER DRAINAGE IN GAUTENG
                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr L W GREYLING (ID): Deputy Speaker, there is an environmental crisis
unfolding in Gauteng and decisive action is needed from government to
arrest it. The central basin upon which Johannesburg sits is filling up
with acid mine water at the rate of almost a metre a day. Unless a decision
is taken within the next few weeks we will not have the time to put in
place the engineering solution to deal with the impending catastrophe.
Already acid mine water is flowing out of the western basin at a rate of
6 million litres a day. The treatment works are proving entirely
inadequate, with devastating effects for the surrounding environment.

In the eastern basin, the debacle of Aurora Empowerment Systems’ ownership
of the Grootvlei Mine has led to millions of litres of untreated acid mine
water being pumped daily into the surrounding wetland. Serious questions
need to be answered as to how a few politically connected individuals could
be given the rights to a mine when they did not have the financial
resources or experience to take responsibility for its operations. The ID
hopes that the impending lawsuits against these directors go ahead and that
they are held criminally reliable for their negligence in allowing an
environmental and human rights disaster to occur there.

The ID also calls for action to be taken against the liquidator of the
Grootvlei Mine, who should never have awarded the purchase to Aurora
Empowerment Systems without first conducting a proper due diligence on
them. The ID believes that it is now time for the Department of Mineral
Resources to force mining companies to properly comply with all of their
environmental responsibilities. Thank you.

                   UPLIFTMENT PROJECTS FOR POOR HOUSEHOLDS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Prince B Z ZULU (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC-led government is leading a
massive public investment programme for growth and employment creation as
part of the Expanded Public Works Programme’s 2010 allocation. More than
R8 billion has been targeted for road development and job creation through
the implementation of labour-intensive road projects.

As such, more than 8 000 poor families in the North West are benefitting
from a new road maintenance programme. The programme, entitled “Do it
yourself”, employs people from poor households in an effort to alleviate
poverty and create sustainable livelihoods. The programme was rolled out
across the province in the month of July 2010, specially targeting
households headed by women in the rural areas, which have been identified
in the four districts of the province.

Approximately R60 million has been budgeted for the programme and
beneficiaries are poised to earn at least R520 a month for working eight
days on identified roads. This shows the ANC-led government’s commitment in
implementing the Expanded Public Works Programme to support poor
households. The ANC also believes that more can be achieved if we employ
these kinds of programmes throughout the country. Thank you. [Time
expired.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): Hon members, we are conversing too
loudly and I don’t think we can hear each other any more.

                      VICTIMISATION OF WHISTLE-BLOWERS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Chairperson, the report in today’s Cape Times
about a whistle-blower whose salary was frozen and his official car taken
away raises serious concerns. This action undermines the Protected
Disclosures Act, which encourages employees to “disclose information
regarding improprieties by his or her colleagues, other stakeholders and
employer”. According to this Act, government will not tolerate the
harassment or victimisation of a whistle-blower and will take action to
protect employees when they raise a concern in good faith.

Government has also promised to do its best to protect an individual’s
identity when he or she raises a concern and does not want his or her
identity to be disclosed. The ACDP wants to know why employees who want to
expose corruption are suspended and in some cases even expelled from their
jobs. If informants are not protected but victimised, then what hope do we
have for ever winning the war on corruption? We believe whistle-blowers
should be treated as heroes and not villains. Those who are victimising
whistle-blowers are condoning corruption and should be investigated.

Earlier this year, a Member of Parliament was lambasted for exposing
contents from a leaked document showing how Eskom has been charging, and
will continue to charge, some companies such as BHP Billiton discounted
electricity tariffs. Had it not been for whistle-blowers this would not
have come to light. Government must do more to gain the confidence of
members of the public who are aware of corruption. If they are convinced
that their identities will be protected, more will come forward in order to
expose the corruption that is plaguing our society. Thank you.

               STATE INTERVENTION NEEDED IN BASIC HEALTH CARE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms S P LEBENYA-NTANZI (IFP): Hon Chairperson, the IFP has on numerous
occasions expressed its concern that South Africa’s ailing public health
care system is facing critical challenges and that it is on the verge of
collapse. Recent examples of gross neglect and negligence are proof that
the IFP has good reason to be concerned.

Last week, it was reported that a woman who had suffered a miscarriage had
been left unattended for hours and told to sit on a bench at the Prince
Mshiyeni Hospital in Umlazi, Durban. This followed the discovery of a
decomposed body in an air duct at the Addington Hospital in Durban. In
addition to that, in Cape Town the bodies of a boy and a girl were recently
found dumped at a waste-removal company in Airport Industria. The identity
bracelets on the babies identified them as coming from the Retreat
Maternity Hospital.

During his state of the nation address in Parliament earlier this year,
President Zuma renewed his government’s commitment to work harder to
improve South Africa’s health-care system. It is clear from the examples
above that this pledge has remained mere rhetoric and that government has
not acted on its promise. The IFP calls on government and in particular on
the Department of Health to recommit themselves to solving the many crises
that have beset our failing health care system. It is clear that without
urgent interventions the health care system will continue to fail dismally
in providing basic health care to the millions of South Africans who rely
on the system for their health care needs. I thank you. [Applause.]

                INTRODUCTION OF NEW CUSTOMS PROGRAMME BY SARS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr Z LUYENGE (ANC): From October the South African Revenue Service, Sars,
will begin using a new and modernised programme when dealing with customs.
The programme, which will be phased in over a number of years, will enhance
both service and security at customs. The programme will assist in
enhancing Sars’s ability to identify illicit goods and will go far in
promoting South Africa as a secure and reliable trading partner.

Part of the programme entails customs operations moving from a partially
paper-based environment to a simplified, automated and more cost-efficient
environment which will make customs operate faster and more efficiently,
because delays can be costly. Some of the initiatives of the modernisation
programme include electronic supporting documents, whereby people will be
able to electronically submit any supporting documents required by customs
for the finalisation of a transaction. This will reduce the paper load and
the burden of a trader having to physically deliver them to Sars.

In addition, the Sars contact centres will be increased to accommodate
customs queries through Sars-trained call-centre agents. Sars will also
introduce a single solution as opposed to the 37 systems that are currently
in place. This is proof that the ANC-led government is committed to making
government work faster and smarter. Together, we can do more. [Applause.]

          SCORPION’S INVESTIGATION OF SELEBI-AGLIOTTI RELATIONSHIP

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD (DA): Chair, on 19 November 2006 I asked the then
Minister of Safety and Security how it was that everyone in this country
was talking about the close relationship between the former Police
Commissioner, Jackie Selebi, and the Kebble murder suspect Glenn Agliotti
and what his response was.

That relationship was dominating news headlines at the time, but the ANC
National Executive Committee seemingly believed that the problem would just
go away if they ignored it for long enough. They missed an ideal
opportunity to prove the ANC’s commitment to the fight against crime and
chose not to discuss the Selebi-Agliotti friendship.

What I said then was that Commissioner Selebi should not remain in office
while the investigation into Agliotti and the murder of Brett Kebble
continued, and that it was totally improper for him to keep his position
until the Scorpion’s investigation had been wrapped up. I said that an
objective investigation would be extremely difficult while Selebi was still
in the driving seat. It was obvious then, as it is now, that the person
tasked with leading the fight against crime should be above reproach when
it comes to the people he or she associates with.

The President and the Minister of Safety and Security ignored me then, as
they did the extensive in-depth reports by our free media on the matter.
They could not ignore the Scorpions, who, against the greatest odds, have
won probably the last great case in court, resulting in Selebi receiving a
15-year jail sentence. Thanks to the ANC, we no longer have a unit that
would necessarily have investigated a crooked National Commissioner. The
Hawks is the National Police Commissioner’s hand puppet and would never,
ever, as I said on that dismal day, 30th January last year when the ANC
shut down the Scorpions, contemplate such an investigation now would they?
[Applause.]

                   NATIONAL PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS’ STRIKE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D A KGANARE (Cope): Chairperson, once again our country is about to be
crippled by a major public sector workers’ strike beginning today. We
regret that negotiations failed to resolve the disputes. We in Cope are
fully sympathetic to the unions demanding a higher pay for their members.

For the ANC-led administration, characterised by excessive bling, lavish
and ostentatious spending, pervasive corruption and wide-scale futile
expenditure, the chickens are coming home to roost. If the public
perception is that money is not a factor for Ministers in government, why
should it be a factor in addressing the pay demands of the public sector?
After all, workers and government members were supposed to be in the same
boat after 1994.

Therefore, worker solidarity should have prevailed and the fat of the land
should have been spread evenly across all segments, legally deriving
benefits from the fiscus. This has not happened, and the income inequality
has been exacerbated. Therefore, this strike is not only about the rapidly
rising costs of living but about income equalisation as well.

Unfortunately, with the extended school holidays granted this year, a new
and further loss of school time through strike actions in schools would be
most injurious to the children of working-class families. It would also be
iniquitous. We just cannot afford to make innocent children pay for the
failures and excesses of government. They have a future to secure and
therefore, to help them reach it, no stone should be left unturned.

Cope also recognised that President Zuma and the hon Minister of Higher
Education and Training, prior to their coming into government, created
certain expectations in 2008. Those who voted for the government in 2009
are now demanding their payback. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): Hon member, your time has expired.

               56 COURTS SET UP DURING THE 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M GUNGUBELE (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC-led government’s vision to have
dedicated courts to handle cases during the World Cup has paid off. The
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has set up 56 courts
across the country, specifically dealing with World Cup-related crimes.

According to figures released by the department, the courts dealt with 172
cases since they opened on 28 May up to 04 July.

The majority of those cases - about 139 in total - have already been
finalised. There has been 104 convictions; 33 postponements; 28 cases were
withdrawn and 7 people were acquitted. Approximately 45,35% of the cases
were in Gauteng; while 25% were in the Western Cape; followed by the
Eastern Cape with 12,21%. Of the cases that were heard by the courts, 59
were theft related, with the selling of World Cup tickets; 23 were common
robbery; 11 were fraud; and 10 also featured high up on the list.

We commend the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development’s
foresight in the opening of these dedicated courts as an integral part of
the national security plan intended for the 2010 Fifa World Cup tournament.
We have shown the world that together, we can do ngcono [better.]

                   FARMWORKERS SUMMIT IN THE WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member’s Statement)

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (DA): Hon Chairperson, the DA is finding it
unacceptable that at the recent so-called Farmworkers Summit in the Western
Cape the ANC misrepresented the DA’s plan for equity share schemes,
describing them as a confiscation scheme to divide all farms in half and
give away 50%.

This is a clear misrepresentation of the DA policy for propaganda purposes.
Equity share schemes generally worked well for both farmers and workers in
the Western Cape until they were stopped through a moratorium last year.
The DA’s proposal allows for farmworkers to become part owners of farms
that are available for sale and to gain access to high-value agricultural
land while retaining the involvement and investment of the commercial
farmer, a crucial determinant of long-term viability in land reform
initiatives.

The current land reform system has failed to empower the intended
beneficiaries in any meaningful way and has, in fact, compromised South
Africa’s agricultural productivity and the rural communities that rely on
it. It is certainly not empowering farmworkers. Just four months ago,
Minister Gugile Nkwinti admitted in Parliament that 90% of the 5,9 million
hectares of land bought by the state for emerging farmers was not
productive. The DA’s equity share scheme venture has been a success in the
Western Cape because it spreads ownership, shares risk and reward, brings
the expertise and experience of both the farmer and the worker together.

The DA will continue to push for equity share schemes on the basis that
they are voluntarily, that state subsidies are made available for
farmworkers to buy shares and that safeguards exist to protect farmworkers
from being exploited. These schemes are and must remain a win-win solution
for all. [Applause.]

            ENERGY EFFICIENCY AGREEMENT WITH SWISS CONFEDERATION

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr G J SELAU (ANC): Chairperson, South Africa and the Swiss Confederation
have signed an energy efficiency agreement, which will be a major boost to
the government energy programme. The agreement on the Energy Efficiency
Monitoring Project entails the Swiss Agency for Development and Co-
operation funding a R120 million climate change programme in South Africa.

The agreement is going to assist the ANC-led government in reaching our
goals and objectives of realising energy efficiency in our buildings. The
aim of the agreement is to provide financial support to the Ministry of
Energy in order to contribute to the Energy Efficiency Monitoring and
Implementation Project. The programme will run from 2010 to 2014 and will
be implemented through collaboration of national and local government,
research institutions as well as the private sector, among others.

The ANC-led government recognises that climate change is a risk to
development and that energy efficiency is one of the most cost-effective
mitigation options in South Africa. The ANC welcomes the agreement with the
Swiss Agency, as it will assist the Department of Energy in ensuring that
new constructions and the retrofitting of existing houses and buildings
comply with the building codes.

The municipalities of Sol Plaatje, Rustenburg, Polokwane, Mbombela and King
Sabata Dalindyebo have already been earmarked for capacity-building and the
implementation of this phase of the project at local government level. This
will be done under the auspices of the South African Local Government
Association, Salga, at a cost of R13 million. I thank you. [Applause.]

                  UPLIFTMENT PROJECTS FOR POOR HOUSEHOLDS:

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Hon Chairperson, we thank the hon member for
his statement about the 10 000 jobs that will be created in the North West.
This is a good-news statement and an indication of how the Expanded Public
Works Programme, EPWP, is looking at best practice within the provinces and
emulating them.

Do-it-yourself is modelled on the successful programme of Vukuzenzele in
KwaZulu-Natal. KwaZulu-Natal and North West are leading in labour-intensive
service delivery models. We encourage MPs to engage provincial MECs, local
government and us to form partnerships in developing service delivery
models that can make an impact on the lives of rural people. Thank you.
[Applause.]

                     Acid mine WATER DRAINAGE IN GAUTENG

                            (minister’s Response)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY-NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: Chairperson,
I’m not quite sure why but, in respect of a number of issues raised as
motions without notice and members’ statements, the same issues are
arising. Perhaps we need to ask the cross-party Whippery to try and resolve
this issue.

Regarding the issue that the hon Greyling raised in respect of acid mine
water drainage, I just want to make an appeal that we try to be rational,
because it does appear that there are all manner of private sector
interests driving particular agendas here.

What we need is a rational discussion and debate informed by an empirical
basis, because this idea that there will be acid mine water drainage
running through the streets of Johannesburg next week and that we should
all walk around in gumboots is completely ridiculous. But there are private
sector interests that we need to guard against, so that we can take
rational decisions about these issues.

There are some mines on the east and, for a whole host of reasons, there
are also some disused mines. It’s a complex set of issues that we need a
discussion about without pointing fingers this way and that, because that
is unlikely to allow us to resolve this issue in a reasonable period of
time.

The hon Meshoe’s issue about whistle-blowers directed at the DA is a City
of Cape Town issue; they can’t have an executive response here. But I think
the origin of it is directed at the DA, hon Meshoe. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

                 56 COURTS SE UP DURING 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,
in thanking the hon member Gungubele for his statement regarding the
success of the dedicated World Cup courts, I’d like to start by indicating
that this was a success not only of the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development, but in fact of the whole justice, crime
prevention and security cluster. It demonstrated what we can achieve by
working together in a co-ordinated and integrated manner, involving the
police, the prosecution, Correctional Services, Home Affairs, state
security and Legal Aid SA.

The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development has indicated that
we will be studying and evaluating this experience very thoroughly and
identifying those best practices that we can extract from it to apply to
the ongoing work of our criminal justice system. We would appeal to all
members to join us as we implement the seven-point plan designed to give
effect to the recommendations identified by the Criminal Justice Review,
and in so doing work towards achieving the goal of having a South Africa
that is both safe and in which all citizens and others feel safe. Thank
you. [Applause.]

                     FARMWORKERS SUMMIT IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Ms T V Tobias-Pakolo): Hon
Chair, I want to respond to the statement made by the leader of the DA. In
my opinion you cannot say equitable share is equitable enough if you expect
subsidies from government. You are actually reducing ownership and control
to a business transaction, because the manner in which this equitable share
is viewed for land reform purposes is that of government having to pay
market-value prices for farms that were actually basically obtained through
subsidies from government. So the best way is to focus on our policy of
land restitution and land reform with the intention of ownership and
control by the ordinary citizens of South Africa who do not have equal
opportunities of tilling the land they live on and should have the benefit.


Government’s responsibility is to make sure that people have access to
land. If we have to take certain measures to make sure that they have
access to land, we can even go to the extent of looking at expropriation to
have them accessing land. But equitable share is not just a business
transaction by making government pay for your opinions and thinking that
you must bring in people and we must pay. Thank you. [Applause.]

                     FARMWORKERS SUMMIT IN WESTERN CAPE
               PROGRAMME TO CREATE 10 000 JOBS FOR RURAL YOUTH

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND REFORM: Hon Chairperson,
I just want to deal, again, with the issue raised by the hon member from
the DA on the share equity scheme. The reason this scheme was temporarily
suspended was that we picked up that this scheme was being abused by some
of the land owners. The scheme was used as an easy way of accessing public
funds for the purpose of upgrading their farms without the workers, who are
supposed to be shareholders, benefitting in any way in terms of these
schemes. Land owners would hide the profits in the operations of the farm.

Over many years, after government has invested on behalf of the farmworkers
on these farms, you find that, year after year, no profit is declared.
Everything is hidden under the cost for the farm, and the ordinary workers
ultimately do not benefit. That was the reason why we had to intervene in
making sure that, at the end, we can have proper control over the share
equity schemes to make sure that indeed the people for whom this scheme has
been invented actually do benefit. So that is the reason why we had to
intervene: to make sure that this scheme is not abused.
We would also like to welcome the hon members’ support for the South
African Rural Youth Corps programme, as already supported by the hon member
from the ANC. This scheme is meant to address unemployment in all 3 000
rural wards in the country. As the hon member has indicated, its aim is to
create 10 000 jobs, which will also make it possible for the young people
in rural areas to acquire soft skills in terms of household surveys and
facilitation in an organisation, but also hard skills in various programmes
which are meant to upgrade rural communities, from construction and
plumbing to skills in electricity installation. This is meant to last for
two years ... [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

                          NATIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION: Hon Chairperson, we certainly would
like to improve on the results of the supplementary examination. I just
want to remind the hon member that, consistently in the past, the pass rate
in supplementary exams had been less than 18%. As a result of the extended
support and advocacy, we had a much larger number of learners who sat for
the supplementary examinations. This translated into more that 100 000
learners, which never occurred in the past.

If you were to look at the average passes, which were less than 18%, and
compare it to the 30% and more in Gauteng and the 25% in the Western Cape,
where the highest number of learners enrolled, it would mean that there has
been a significant improvement. I’m not suggesting that it’s optimal or
that it’s good, but what it does say to us is that more that 25 000 people
have had better opportunities as a result of the effort by the then
Department of Education and the current Department of Basic Education.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]


                  SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT BILL


                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, Cabinet colleagues and hon members,
on 21 April 2010  the Cabinet announced the need to amend the South African
Reserve Bank Act of 1989 to ensure that it meets its constitutional
mandate. These amendments are designed to enhance the governance of the
Reserve Bank and to uphold its public interest role.

The “public interest” principle forms the cornerstone of a central bank and
particularly that of the South African Reserve Bank. The central bank
derives its mandate from the Constitution, read together with the South
African Reserve Bank Act of 1989. The Constitution of this country mandates
the Reserve Bank to protect the value of the Rand in the interest of
balanced and sustainable growth. It must do so without fear, favour or
interference.

The Reserve Bank is also responsible for the supervision of commercial
banks. As the US financial crisis has reminded us, the supervision of banks
is a crucial task. South Africans did not experience the financial crisis
partly because of the quality of work of the supervision department of the
Reserve Bank.

The Reserve Bank also manages the country’s foreign exchange reserves and
flows of money between South Africa and the rest of the world. It is also
responsible for the national payment system, which enables the transfer of
money from one party to another. I am sure that you will agree with me that
an institution to which we have delegated such important responsibilities
must be stable at all times. There’s too much at stake for us as South
Africans. The Reserve Bank cannot be distracted from its mission by self-
interested shareholders.

As members of this House will be aware, there has been a lot of debate and
speculation about the role of private shareholders in the Reserve Bank. Our
approach in this matter is driven by practical considerations and by what
is in the best interest of South Africa. The nature of ownership of the
Reserve Bank does not matter that much, as long as the bank fulfils its
public-interest role. This is borne out in reality by the fact that you
have other central banks in the world, including those in Japan, the USA
and Switzerland, that have private shareholders.

The amending Bill tabled in this House today seeks to strengthen the
balance between the interest of the country and the interest of
shareholders. This balance is important, since we all need a Reserve Bank
that focuses on its constitutional mandate without undue interference by
self-interested shareholders. It is for this reason that existing private
shareholders should not treat the Reserve Bank as a profit-making
institution. Private shareholders must have rights, but limited rights.

From its inception, it has always been the intention that the rights of
public shareholders will be secondary to the public-interest role of the
Reserve Bank. Even the current South African Reserve Bank Act of 1989
provides for and limits ownership of shares by an individual to no more
than 10 000. It also restricts the dividend payable to shareholders to a
fixed amount. In addition, it restricts the ability of shareholders –
irrespective of nationality – who are not ordinarily resident in South
Africa, to vote. Finally, it prohibits shareholding by nominees. These
restrictions seek to ensure that there is no excessive and negative
influence on the operations and management of the Reserve Bank as a public-
interest entity.

It has come to light that some shareholders have been trying to get around
these restrictions. Their ultimate aim is to derive private gain. These
shareholders have, for example, acquired shares above the existing limit of
10 000 by using associates; they have offered payments to fellow
shareholders to vote them in as directors; and they have also demanded the
right to share in the profits of the bank but without the right to share in
the losses of the bank.

These are not the actions of shareholders who believe in the public-
interest role of the Reserve Bank or have the interest of South Africa at
heart. However, private shareholders, with limited rights, still have an
important role to play in a public-interest entity like the Reserve Bank.
In particular, they support and enhance the independence of the Reserve
Bank and its governance.

The Amendment Bill tabled in the House today seeks to uphold the nature and
importance of the Reserve Bank as a public-interest entity, created by
Government for the benefit of all South Africans. The Bill seeks to achieve
this by doing the following: Firstly, it stops shareholders from
circumventing the current Act’s limitation of a maximum of 10 000 shares
per shareholder. [Interjections.]

Yes, but even that takes some time to cure, you know.

Secondly, it allows for the nomination of directors by a broader base of
South Africans and for the broadening of representation on the board of the
bank. Thirdly, it provides for the establishment of a panel for the
election of directors. Fourthly, it defines clear criteria for the
disqualification of persons from serving on the board. Fifthly, it provides
for the confirmation of board nominees against fit and proper and fiduciary
criteria. Sixthly, it clarifies the powers and functions of the board of
the Reserve Bank. Lastly, it provides for the possibility of the Governor
and Deputy Governors to be reappointed to serve a term of less than five
years.

These amendments have won praise from the international community. In its
2010 survey of South Africa, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, OECD, described the Reserve Bank Amendment Bill as “a sensible
response to the problem of rogue shareholders seeking to undermine the
independence of the SA Reserve Bank”.

In concluding, I would like to touch upon another important principle
regarding the Reserve Bank. The role of the board of the Reserve Bank
should never be confused with the role of the Monetary Policy Committee.
The MPC, which is constituted by the executive directors, that is, the
Governor and the three Deputy Governors, as well as professional members of
the Reserve Bank, implements the monetary policy framework of the country.
The board of the Reserve Bank is purely a governance and management board,
not a policy board. In this regard, the independence of the Reserve Bank in
meeting its constitutional mandate remains very intact, despite the current
amendments.

I would also like to explain the urgency of the Bill. The board of the
Reserve Bank currently has three vacancies. It is the desire of the
Governor and government that these vacant positions be filled with fit and
proper persons with the assistance of the panel. This would also mean that
the best candidates should be available for election at the Reserve Bank’s
AGM, due later this year.

Secondly, both Cabinet and the Governor felt that the potential
destabilisation of the Reserve Bank by a few shareholders warranted urgent
attention. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Governor of
the Reserve Bank and her legal team for their hard work and assistance in
drafting this Bill, Deputy Minister Nene, the National Treasury Director-
General, Lesetja Kganyago, and his team for contributing to the Bill, and
the Standing Committee on Finance, under the steady hand of Mr Thabadiawa
Mufamadi, for their sterling work with regard to the processing of the
Bill.

I hereby request that this House pass the South African Reserve Bank
Amendment Bill 2010. Thank you.

Mr T A MUFAMADI: Hon Chairperson, hon members, Ministers present here and
Minister of Finance, let me start by reading from Marianne Williamson’s A
Return to Love which says:

   Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that
   we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that
   most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
   talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?

The above extract from the book, and these words in particular, have become
like nylon to us, signaling the change shining through the women who dared
to challenge the barricades of social limitations which do not only
restrict creativity, freedom and expression, but linger to affect every
other area of an individual’s wellbeing.

Before I confine myself to the report and recommendations of the Standing
Committee on Finance to this House, allow me to salute, with respect, the
relentless effort of our democracy in embracing the evident torch of light,
achievements and paradigms demonstrated by the women of our nation in all
spheres of life. The debate on the South African Reserve Bank Amendment
Bill takes place when the entire country is celebrating the success of our
efforts to liberate women from years of oppression suffered on the basis of
their race, class and gender.

It is during this month that we assess the impact of our government’s
corrective policies and the positive effects that such policies have had in
creating a national democratic society in which the women’s role is at the
centre of development.

The implementation of such corrective measures should not assume that the
consequences of democracy will automatically translate into the eradication
of patriarchy, which was and still remains the embodiment of economic,
social, religious, cultural and other forms of oppression of women in a
democratic society.

As we strive to create the ideal society that Tat’uMandela, Tat’uSisulu,
together with many other heroes and heroines of our struggle, sought to
create, we must never forget to appreciate the first steps they took to
make us feel the need to rise even when we thought and felt that we did not
have the means to make our case known beyond our borders. Through their
courage and commitment, they made it possible for even the most hesitant to
realise the need to challenge the everyday reality of life and struggle.

The demand for progress around this particular issue can be decoded in the
loud voices whose echoes have broken the walls of silence in our economic
corridors. This is a clear indication that time has come for us to honestly
introspect the contributions that the financial sector has made in the
feminist fight against poverty evident in the physical marginalisation,
psychological abuse and the undermining of the potential of women. We must
also assess how the sector has assisted in the redirection or lack of equal
opportunities for women in positions of authority and power in the economy.

Most importantly, we must, from our political perch, focus on specifics so
as to answer the question: Have the financial institutions succeeded in
creating unambiguous structures, systems, as well as conducive cultural
conditions that embrace the abilities of women so that they flourish and
enrich the life of our nation?

The Minister has adequately dealt with the important role of the South
African Reserve Bank, particularly in the economy, as well as the relevance
of the amendments to the existing Act to address the challenges that the
Reserve Bank has encountered in the past few years.

In the processing of this Bill, the committee had an opportunity to
interact with various stakeholders, including some of the shareholders,
through written and oral submissions. Once again, the committee, in
processing this Bill, had to strike a balance between public interest and
participation and the challenges that these amendments seek to address
within a stipulated period in terms of the Reserve Bank regulations.

Members of the House will be aware of the debate in the public domain
regarding the role of the Reserve Bank which has been going on in the
recent past and now recently, since the publication of the Bill for public
comment. Prior to the publication of the Bill, the debate was whether it is
desirable to have private investors as shareholders in the bank or whether
it should be entirely owned by the state. These questions arose out of the
concern that private shareholders could use their shareholding power to
influence the bank and monetary policies to the detriment of the nation and
its interests.

Proposed amendments, among others, reflect on the composition of the board.
Guided by making the minimum interventions in the Bill, the committee
confined its work and aimed at ensuring that the substance of the key
mandate of the Reserve Bank remains the domain of the Governor and the
Deputy Governors of the Reserve Bank.

In this regard, the proposed amendment of the composition of the board
gives effect to the separation of responsibilities between the executive
and the board. In terms of the current legislation, as it stands, the board
delegates the executive authority to the Governor of the Reserve Bank,
which is not healthy. The amendments therefore ensure that the board
remains focused on governance matters while the functioning and day-to-day
activities of the Reserve Bank are the responsibility and the domain of the
Reserve Bank Governor.

The Bill also proposes that four directors be appointed by the President in
addition to those who will be nominated through the public process. It is
our considered view that this will strengthen the board’s functionality in
observing governance matters in the day-to-day activities of the bank.

It is important to indicate that the Reserve Bank, unlike other commercial
banks, is a statutory body that derives its mandate from the Constitution,
which guarantees its independence from external influence. Therefore the
role of shareholders is very limited and is outlined in the regulations.

It is in this regard that each person is allowed to own a maximum of 10 000
shares, irrespective of the size of their pocket or the institution that
seeks to participate in the shareholding scheme of the Reserve Bank. This
ensures that ordinary people can have an equal vote as ordinary
shareholders in the bank in terms of the decisions that they need to make.

The consequence of the activities of the shareholders may result in
narrowing public participation of ordinary citizens in the bank as some of
them seek to manipulate share prices. Ordinarily, the issued shares of the
Reserve Bank were, at the beginning, between R1,20 and R1,50. At the time
of this amendment being presented before the committee, some of the
shareholders had actually manipulated share prices to the value of R6 000
per share. That tells all of us that ordinary people are not able to be
participants in the affairs of the Reserve Bank. It begins to be the domain
of the few, the rich and those who are driven by nothing else but profit
motives. [Applause.] Therefore the committee is in support of the
establishment of the panel which will ensure that fit and proper persons
will serve on the board.

How is this going to happen? The Amendment Bill seeks to establish a panel
that will process nominations, and such a panel will be checked by the
Reserve Bank Governor. A retired judge, three representatives from the
National Economic Development and Labour Council, Nedlac, and one person
appointed by the Minister will be part of it. Its responsibility is only
confined to processing and interviewing those who will have been nominated
to participate or to serve as directors of the Reserve Bank.

With regard to some shareholders who are opposed to the role of the central
bank as defined in the Constitution, the ANC strategy and tactics direct us
on how we should deal with these matters. They clearly outline that as we
surge forward, the key question that should remain uppermost in our minds
is: What kind of a society do we seek to create? In other words, what is
the character of the national democratic revolution?

It is in this understanding that transformation will encounter resistance
from time to time, precisely because colonialisation of a special type
contained in itself contradictions which cannot be resolved through
reforms.

The changes proposed in this Bill will stand or fall on the basis of
whether or not it is able to eliminate the main antagonism of the system we
currently have in the administration of the bank. Perhaps the question we
need to ask now is whether or not the current form and structure of
ownership of the bank, with private ownership of shares, is in fact
desirable.

Given our history and our experience, which has now necessitated the
amendment of the current legislation, it is significant to note that ours
is one of the few - nine - central banks in the world that have this kind
of arrangement, where private shareholders participate. Among the nine are
Australia, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Switzerland and the
USA.

Even though the committee is aware that there are different types of
management models of the Reserve Bank, it did not venture into assessing
the operations of different models in the world. To us, it remains work in
progress. It is evident that after the financial economic crisis, the
majority of governments in the world are beginning to review the role of
the central banks in the economy.

In our case, the central bank has a critical role, through its monetary
policies, to ensure price stability which, in turn, will ensure low
inflation or inflation targeting, as envisaged in our macro-economic
policy. However, hon members are aware of the debate about the correctness
of this approach.

In conclusion, we note that through a corrective policy mix and choices,
the central bank can determine the rate of inflation, which influences the
size of consumer baskets. Therefore it is essential that the value of money
remains stable, because no modern economy can function well if its currency
continuously loses value.

The committee is in support of the establishment of an open process of
nomination of directors to the board, because the creation of a legitimate
state and public institution can only be derived through the regular and
popular participation of ordinary people.

Only through this process can we safeguard the independence of the Reserve
Bank, by ensuring that those who are nominated to serve will do so with the
full understanding that the primary objective of the bank is not to satisfy
the whims and aspirations of shareholders whose primary motive is to make
super profits at the expense of the poor. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr D T GEORGE: Chairperson, the DA is a patriotic party. We love our
country and we cherish its institutions. That is why we work relentlessly
to ensure that their functionality is not eroded by the selfish actions of
any interest group or any political party.
The SA Reserve Bank was established in 1921. It was modelled on the Bank of
England and its primary objectives were to issue banknotes, act as
custodian of cash reserves of other banks, lend cash to other banks in the
event of shortages of liquidity, clear and settle interbank transfers and
act as custodian of the country’s gold and foreign-exchange reserves. From
the outset shareholding in the bank was intended to be symbolic.
Shareholding was limited to ensure that the broader public could
participate in ownership of the bank and dividends were limited to restrain
the profit motive for share acquisition.

One of the current shareholders who appeared before the committee during
the public hearings presented a detailed history of the bank and confirmed
that, historically, shareholders played a very limited role in the affairs
of the bank and that the bank divulged little, if any, information to its
shareholders. Over time, the shareholder said, the bank began to exchange
more and more information with its shareholders as governance trends
changed over the years and shareholders became more vocal about their
demands for access to information.

The relationship between the bank and its shareholders appeared to be
progressing in the right direction until a few years ago, when a noise
emanating from a group of shareholders started to increase significantly.
It was not immediately obvious, but this marked the beginning of a specific
strategy by one shareholder in particular, who was determined to unlock the
so-called value of the investment in the bank and embarked on a programme
to encourage other shareholders, and new shareholders, to do the same. Part
of this strategy included attempts to circumvent legislated limits on the
number of shares any individual or entity could hold in a bank, with a view
to mobilising a block of shareholders to appoint directors to the bank who
were sympathetic to their cause.

The strategy included plans to increase the limited dividend payable to
shareholders, access capital at the bank and share in their annual profits
but not in any losses. An approach was also made to the ANC to nationalise
the bank. Their primary motive was to liquidate the bank and receive a
massive windfall.

We will never know how the relationship between the bank and its
shareholders would have evolved on its current trajectory, because there is
no doubt after the public hearings that a legislative intervention is
required to match the expectations of the shareholders with those of the
bank.

The proposed amendment limits an individual or entity to ownership of
10 000 shares, including the shares held by their associates. Limited
shareholding is not new, and strengthening this position will make it more
difficult for individuals and entities to yield more influence than the
original legislation intended.

Some shareholders claim that the proposed amendment is unconstitutional, is
an act of expropriation and contravenes bilateral international agreements
on compensation for acts of nationalisation. The basis of their argument is
that the bank is a company similar to any other company, is subject to the
Companies Act and that they, as its shareholders, are its owners and can do
whatever they want with their asset.

The fact is that the bank is a unique policy institution, established in
terms of a special Act of Parliament, the Currency and Banking Act, No 31
of 1920, and its shareholders have always known the limits that are
associated with ownership of its shares. The bank’s view is that the
actions of a group of shareholders are undermining its ability to properly
perform its functions. The amendment, they argue, will improve and clarify
governance of banks.

It is unfortunate that the expectation mismatch between the bank and its
shareholders arose, requiring legislative intervention. We need to accept
the reality that the SA Reserve Bank performs a crucial policy function and
that it also has private shareholders, many without ulterior motives.
Despite the noisy dispute, the actual question is how the SA Reserve Bank
should be structured to best serve the interests of all South Africans.

The DA recognises the need for government to intervene when the market
fails. The world financial crisis has revealed substantial gaps in
classical economic theory, especially the assumption that all the
information is available and that markets can always self-correct. In this
instance, the failure is the misaligned objectives of the bank and some of
its shareholders. This problem is not unique and arose at the Bank of
England, prior to its nationalisation in 1947. Hansard records of debates
in the House of Commons in 1945 and House of Lords in 1946 reflect the
primary reason for the bank’s nationalisation. Both sides of the Houses
agreed that the bank was a unique policy institution and that shareholders
should not be permitted to influence the bank for their own benefit.
Although the solution, to nationalise the bank, was not unanimously
supported, the British government paid £58 million, in 1947, to buy out the
shareholders.

During our parliamentary hearings, some SA Reserve Bank shareholders made
clear their opposition to current monetary policy and declared a need for a
fundamental change in the operation of our entire banking and financial
system. This is well beyond their mandate and reflects broader aspirations
to influence key aspects of our economy. Board members are not intended to
represent a particular interest group and must act in the best interests of
the bank. The amendment sets out the corporate governance functions of the
board and introduces a mechanism to consider the suitability of directors
who will be nominated by a wider group of stakeholders. The number of
directors is increased to 15, 7 of whom are elected by shareholders. Any
shareholder, current director or member of the general public can nominate
a director for election.

A panel will confirm that a candidate is suitable for possible election to
the board. This process should screen out unsuitable candidates and retain
those who are fit and proper and possess the required skills and
experience.

During my recent visit to the United Kingdom, I had an opportunity to meet
with the governance department at the Bank of England and had a close look
at developments in their corporate finance over their long history - since
1694. Their view is that governance is evolving and this is reflected in
ongoing amendments of the Bank of England Act.

Similar to the Bank of England, the SA Reserve Bank operation in pursuit of
its mandate is independent, but the inflation target is set by government.
While the Crown appoints all directors to the Bank of England, the SA
Reserve Bank Amendment Bill proposes the election of seven directors, a
more transparent and inclusive approach than that of the Bank of England.

Having considered the deliberations before the committee and the role of
the SA Reserve Bank in our economy, an amendment to clarify shareholder
expectations and improve governance procedures to ensure ongoing stability
at the bank is required. The proposed amendment does move in this
direction. Governance evolves over time and Parliament must exercise more
vigorous oversight over this institution.

It is likely that further amendments will be required over time to
strengthen governance and ensure that the most optimal structure is
maintained. In this regard, the Bank of England and other central banks,
including those that have private shareholders, can provide useful
guidelines.

At the peak of the world financial crisis in 2008, a group of 15 leading
financial economists met at Squam Lake, New Hampshire, to consider the
question of how we can prevent a repeat of the world financial crisis. The
resulting Squam Lake report sets out several recommendations, including the
need for one organisation in each country to be responsible for overseeing
the health and stability of the overall financial system. They argue that
the central bank should be charged with this important responsibility. The
DA agrees. The role of the SA Reserve Bank is far wider than implementing
monetary policy and protecting the value of our currency. It needs to drive
macroprudential policy and the necessary microprudential reforms.

The role of Parliament is to hold the bank to account, to provide oversight
and to ensure that the bank operates in a stable environment. Although the
proposed amendment does improve this stability, it is likely that further
amendments will be required in future, especially to enhance transparency
and inclusivity. Given that this amendment takes a step in the appropriate
direction, the DA will support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N J J KOORNHOF: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The debate around the
shareholding, the so-called nationalisation and the independence of the
Reserve Bank created quite a stir. The financial columns were full of
speculation - why the sudden need for these amendments? However, as far as
I can remember in my political life, in the committees I have served on,
the amendments published in this Bill went through the committee unchanged.
There were no objections from those parties present at the meetings. Full
marks go to Governor Marcus and her team, who have so eloquently argued for
the adoption of these amendments.

In 1999, S K Apea wrote, “To ensure that the central bank commands the
confidence of the financial system, the Governor, in particular, must
possess the following qualities: strong academic and professional
background, strong personality and ability to influence opinions through
persuasive argument.” The Governor lived up to this definition during our
hearings.

Fabian Amtenbrink wrote for the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, on
the three pillars of central bank governance and according to him the first
one is independence. There is large consensus worldwide on the need for
central bank independence. This independence concerns the relationship that
exists between the bank and the government. It is therefore desirable that
the bank and its board are not subjected to political orders or pressures.
We, as politicians, must always remind ourselves that the very nature of
our positions makes it impossible for us to be impartial to the short-term
benefits of an expansive monetary policy. The focus must be long-term
stability rather than short-term monetary temptations.

The second pillar of governance is accountability. To the extent that
central banks are independent, mechanisms of democratic accountability are
required in order to legitimise the position of the bank within a given
constitutional system. The legislation is silent – quite correctly – on
this, and therefore it is important that Parliament and, in particular, the
Standing Committee on Finance, should become more active in this role.

The third pillar of governance, according to Amtenbrink, is that the
central bank must be transparent. Transparency includes the public’s
understanding of decisions taken by the bank and the reasoning behind those
decisions. In the words of Deane and Pringle, “an open, democratic society
has the right to demand a broad degree of understanding of what central
banks do and how they do it”. We should design our own parliamentary
process to assist in a way that does not compromise the independence of the
bank nor apply undue political pressure for the wrong reasons.

Cope will support these amendments. And, in closing, were it not for the
various international treaties and the possibility of sending a negative
signal to international investors, we would have supported an amendment
that only South African citizens should be allowed to buy shares in the
Reserve Bank.

We are looking forward to a stable era under the governorship of Gill
Marcus. Be strong, defend your independence and do not allow the debate and
disagreement on economic policy within the alliance to undermine your
independence. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. In a salient showing of
the limits of democracy, this Bill does just the opposite of what it
proposed to achieve, a fact clearly highlighted in all the public input,
but ignored by the media and commentators.

The Bill increases the composition of the board with people without the
required specialised, relevant experience, but takes all the powers of
management away from such a bloated board and places them exclusively in
the hands of the Governor and the bank’s inner and secretive circle. The
Bill does nothing to deal with private profits on the bank’s shares – the
very reason given for its introduction by the Minister. It does nothing to
create transparency, representation and accountability where it matters -
in the Monetary Policy Committee, which creates and destroys money at will,
without any public official or public representative involved in, or aware
of, this process. Effectively, this Bill is an internal coup d’état to
concentrate even more power away from public accountability and
transparency. It excludes and silences the individual shareholders who,
warts and all, are the only existing public watchdog within the bank.

The Bill leaves fundamental issues unaddressed. Who does the Reserve Bank
really serve: the country or the banking community? Its constitutionally
required independence is threatened more by the incestuous embrace of the
banking community than by the ineffective and tenuous liaison with our
government.

The secretive “black box” within which the operations of the Reserve Bank
take place has remained unaffected. The bank can do as it wishes in
creating and destroying fiat money as long as it does so within the broad
inflation targets set by government. And, in so doing, it partakes in the
broader process through which central banks generate recessions or economic
booms at the time they deem best.

Neither the Minister nor this Parliament has the statutory power or the in-
house skills base to check on what goes on within the black box, or to
answer the allegations we heard during public comments, such as that the
gold reserves of South Africa have been moved to England; that the huge
losses posted by the Reserve Bank this year are really losses of the
banking system transferred to the Reserve Bank by shifting reserve
requirements and titular ownership; and that there are preferential tracks
for application under the Exchange Control Acts which are said to be
applied differently, depending on who the client is. Even the Minister has
no power to shine a light into the “black box”.

The Reserve Bank has been promising to be accountable and transparent,
exactly because this Bill does not create any legal obligation for it to do
so, and we must rely merely on its promises. The public input we received
about this Bill ... Under these conditions we cannot but oppose this Bill.
[Time expired.]

Ms P E ADAMS: Hon Speaker, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, given the
difficulties that the Reserve Bank has been experiencing in the past, as
evidenced by the recent public debate regarding the changes being proposed
by this Bill, amendments to clarify the different roles of shareholders,
the executive and Parliament are welcomed.

In the main, the role of the shareholders in the context of the Reserve
Bank is to safeguard its independence as stipulated in the Constitution of
the Republic and to ensure that it fulfils its mandate as set out in the
South African Reserve Bank Act. Collectively, the role of the shareholders
must be seen as that of the board of directors as a whole. Clauses seven
and eight strengthen the public character of the SA Reserve Bank. They will
assist in building the credibility of the bank. Shareholders have to act in
the interest of the bank and the public.

The Bill identifies roles of the board in terms of its responsibilities,
powers and duties. These include corporate governance matters, such as
compliance, rules adoption and policy determination, approving the budget,
reports, appointment of bank secretaries and assistants, remuneration
policy, allocations of funds to the retirement fund, authorising the
establishment of branches, making recommendations to the Ministers and
performing any function assigned to it in terms of the Act.

Most of the problems affecting public institutions are as a result of
unclear mandates between the various stakeholders such as the board of
directors, executive management and government. The Bill clearly defines
the role of the board as that of governance, authorising and reporting. It
provides for clear demarcation of responsibility between the board and
operational management, vested with the governor and the deputies. These
functions are consistent with best practice and principles of good
governance internationally as far as central banks are concerned.

Directors must be fit and proper to act in the interest of the SA Reserve
Bank and not of shareholders. The establishment of a panel and its proposed
composition is viewed as the most appropriate mechanism to ensure nominees
are fit and proper, as the SA Reserve Bank plays a vital role in the South
African economy. The amendments of sector allocations are intended to
ensure that the board has persons with knowledge of relevant sectors.
Presidential appointees will contribute to this knowledge.

The role of the executive management, on the other hand, is a dedicated one
from the Governor and the Deputy Governors. Their role is that of
implementing policy and management. They do not take decisions that are of
governance nature. They account to the board, who in turn accounts to
Parliament. Parliament’s role is critical in the sense that the bank is
also independent of the executive arm of the state. Its role is to seek
accountability from the bank through its board of directors. Parliament is
entitled to summon the bank to account at any point in time, should it be
necessary to do so. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the Reserve Bank, as we know, is a crucial
independent institution in South Africa, mandated inter alia with
determining monetary policy. Public hearings on this Bill exposed a very
high level of mistrust between shareholders and government, as well as
confirming concerns that some shareholders seek to influence not only
executive management decisions but also operational issues, including
monetary policy decisions.

This is clearly beyond the mandate of shareholders, as previous speakers
have indicated. This is a situation that is untenable, resulting in these
amendments before us. The amendments require that board members – certain
board members - must be screened by a panel to determine their suitability,
whether they are fit and proper persons with appropriate skills and
experience, taking into account the requirements contained in the Banks Act
of 1990.

The amendment clarifies that bank directors owe their fiduciary duty and
that of care and skill to the bank, and to no one else. The bank must serve
the public interests and not a personal shareholder’s objective. Directors
must therefore avoid any conflict of interest between his or her interests
and those of the bank.

The ACDP raised certain questions as to why this panel will only screen the
shareholders-nominated directors and not the directors appointed by the
President. We accept the explanation that this would impinge upon the
President’s powers, but it did seem slightly odd to us during
deliberations.

The President’s appointments must in any case satisfy the same
requirements, of being fit and proper persons to be appointed with
appropriate skills and experience. Significantly, the whole policy debate
as to whether there should be shareholders at all has been postponed to a
later occasion. In view of this and of the concerns surrounding the
shareholders, the ACDP will support this amending Bill.

As the last issue, relating to what Mr Oriani-Ambrosini said, may I just
say that these are valid concerns that we as parliamentarians also need to
consider. Clearly the Reserve Bank is accountable to Parliament in the
final instance. At least in future we should engage and consider some of
those concerns that Mr Oriani-Ambrosini raised, particularly to the secrecy
box and in the view of the fact that the Reserve Bank is accountable to
Parliament. I look forward to engaging with the Reserve Bank in more detail
to discuss those concerns. I thank you.

Mr E M MTHETHWA: Hon Chair, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, the ANC has
gone through this Bill. The Minister has alluded to a number of issues,
which include governance and some technical aspects. One focus is that of
corporate governance leading to the proposed amendment.

The main objective of the Reserve Bank, in terms of the Constitution, is to
protect the value of the currency of the Republic in the interest of
balanced and sustainable economic growth in the Republic. This places a
premium on the importance of good corporate governance in the way the bank
is being managed.

Although the reasons for this Amendment Bill are not only about corporate
governance, as was correctly alluded to by my chairperson, a lot of the
issues that led to the amendment are of a governance nature. In recent
years, evidence suggesting that the current Act might be open to potential
abuse has come to light. This relates to the potential for private
shareholders to increase their shares above the prescribed maximum of
10 000 shares per shareholder by purchasing shares through their relatives.
These shares could then be used to influence the bank through acquiring the
so-called “voting powers”. I wonder why some people are asking why the Bill
is being challenged now, as some of my colleagues from Cope have been
doing.

The main aim of the Bill is to amend the SA Reserve Bank Act, No 90 of
1989, in order to stop the bank’s shareholders from circumventing the
prescribed maximum of 10 000 shares per shareholder; to broaden public
involvement in the nomination of directors and board representation; to
provide for the establishment of a panel for the election of directors; and
to clarify the power of the board and those of the Governor and the deputy.
In so doing, the aim is to improve the bank’s governance.

The most important amendment in relation to corporate governance is the
stipulation of the limitation on the number of shares that the shareholders
may hold in relation to associates and the setting of measures to prevent
the circumventing of the limitation on the maximum number of shares a
shareholder may hold. The Bill sets the limits for private shareholding by
stipulating that “no shareholder shall hold, or hold in aggregate with his,
her or its associate, more than 10 000 shares in the Bank” and sets the
limits for voting rights of private shareholders by stipulating that “no
shareholder ... shall either directly or indirectly exercise any vote as a
shareholder in respect of the number of shares in the Bank held by him, her
or it, either alone or in aggregate with his, her or its associates in
excess of 10 000.” The same conditions apply to companies with interlocking
directorates.

The proposed amendment, as the chairperson also alluded to, will help to
ensure that the bank is seen as truly fulfilling its public-interest role
and acting independently from private shareholders’ narrow interests. It
will also assist in strengthening good corporate governance in the bank,
thus improving its credibility and public confidence. Currently, this is
not the case.

We also had the privilege to listen to shareholders when they presented the
history of 1921 on the establishment of the bank. All in all, the ANC
supports this Bill on the basis that it will now be open to the public to
allow them to participate freely and not just serve the interest of the
minorities. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I thank all the representatives of
the various political parties for their contributions. I also thank the
various stakeholders who made presentations to the standing committee for
their contributions and thoughts, whether we agreed with them or not. That
is relevant. Their participation is important.

The majority of the parties shared the view of the government that the
Reserve Bank is an institution which is central to our national interests.
No individual, shareholder or groups of shareholders should try to
interfere with its mandate in any kind of way. Any attempt to do so must
require us to act, as we have done in this regard.

The only lone voice out there is that of hon Ambrosini. I must certainly
assure him that this is no internal coup d'etat. In response to both him
and hon Swart, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and her colleagues do
appear before the standing committee. You have adequate opportunity to
raise any matter that you wish to raise with them. I am sure that they will
account to you as they account to South Africa more generally.

All in all, thank you very much for the support for this amending Bill.
Once again, I thank the standing committee for processing the Bill so
effectively. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr A M MPONTSHANE: Agb Voorsitter, kan u die IVP se beswaar op rekord
plaas? [Hon Chairperson, can you put the objection of the IFP on record?]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Inkatha Freedom Party dissenting).

The House adjourned at 16:03.

COMMITTEE REPORTS
1. REPORT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HIGHER  EDUCATION  AND  TRAINING  ON
   ITS OVERSIGHT VISIT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ZULULAND, DEPARTMENT  OF  HIGHER
   EDUCATION  AND  TRAINING,  TSHWANE  UNIVERSITY  OF  TECHNOLOGY  AND   THE
   UNIVERSITY OF THE FREE STATE, DATED 2 JUNE  2010

The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training, having  undertaken
an oversight visit to the University of Zululand  (UZ),  the  Department  of
Higher Education and  Training  (DHET),  Tshwane  University  of  Technology
(TUT) and the University of the Free State (UFS), reports as follows:

1. Introduction

The Portfolio Committee  on  Higher  Education  and  Training  undertook  an
oversight visit to the University of  Zululand,  the  Department  of  Higher
Education and Training, Tshwane University of Technology and the  University
of the Free State on 12 – 15 April 2010 as part  of  its  ongoing  oversight
visits to institutions of higher learning.  The  purpose  of  the  oversight
visit was primarily to interact with the  above  mentioned  institutions  on
critical issues  such  as  admissions  policy,  enrolment  planning,  merger
processes,  their  transformation  plan,   student   access   and   success,
challenges  of  student  accommodation  in  residences  as  well  as   those
experienced by student leadership at higher education institutions.

The Committee also interacted with representatives of  the  National  Skills
Fund and Sector Education and  Training  Authorities  (SETAs)  in  order  to
ascertain the impact of these entities on  skills  development  in  KwaZulu-
Natal.  The  oversight  was  conducted  within  the  context  of  the  newly
reconfigured higher education and training landscape which incorporates  the
Skills Development functions transferred from the Department of  Labour.  At
the centre of the new arena is the need to facilitate flexible  and  dynamic
linkages between universities, FET colleges, the SETAs and the NSF  to  meet
the differentiated demands and opportunities for skills  development  across
various segments of the sector. By conducting this oversight, the  Committee
aimed in part to ascertain how the  reconfigured  sector  is  responding  to
this new challenge.

2. Background

The oversight visit formed part of the committee’s  plan  to  visit  the  23
public higher education institutions with the aim of revisiting  the  notion
of transformation and social cohesion holistically, focusing  on  issues  of
student access and success, equity  and  equality,  examining  the  role  of
higher  education  in  a  developmental  state,  disbursement  of  financial
assistance in higher education institutions, discussing the need for a  more
systematic and structured student support systems,  feasibility  of  a  more
effective skills development strategy and  other  relevant  matters  in  the
higher education and training spectrum.

The  committee  interacted  with   the   three   public   higher   education
institutions, the department, and representatives of  the  Sector  Education
and Training Authorities  (SETAs)  responsible  for  skills  development  in
KwaZulu-Natal province. The interaction with the  institutions  provided  an
opportunity for the committee to  comprehensively  ascertain  the  level  of
progress made in relation to the agendas of the visit. Although  the  visits
were relatively brief, it was empirical to note that a visit of this  nature
added much needed value to the committee as part of its oversight  function.
The discussion on skills development focusing specifically in  KwaZulu-Natal
provided the  committee  with  an  opportunity  to  identify  the  level  of
development and  progress  made  thus  far  in  the  skills  sector  in  the
province. It was clear  from  these  proceedings  that  increased  focus  to
tackle the challenge of the 5 million  illiterate  adults  in  the  province
would be required.

Mr H Mashabane,  Acting  Chief  Director  of  Skills  Development,  led  the
presentation. The presentation highlighted the following:

    • The NSF was established under the Skills Development Act of 1998.  The
      NSF is responsible for funding projects  identified  in  the  National
      Skills  Development  Strategy  (NSDS)  as  national  priorities.   The
      Director-General of the Department of Higher Education and Training is
      the accounting authority of the fund.
    • The NSF projects  a  total  budget  of  R2  billion  for  the  current
      financial year. The key programmes  of  the  NSF  include  the  Social
      Development Initiatives and Critical Skills Support  which  have  been
      allocated 62% of the total budget for the past five years.
    •  The  key  challenges  of  the  NSF  include,  inter  alia,  improving
      institutional mechanisms and capacity, creating a stronger  link  with
      the department and addressing under-disbursement of funds.

4.2 KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Skills Development Interventions

The Acting Chief Director  of  Skills  Development  drew  attention  to  the
following key issues regarding the Skills Development interventions in KZN:

    • A  total  budget  of  R97  million  was  allocated  to  KwaZulu-Natal,
      targeting approximately 17,520 learners. Interventions  were  directed
      towards the development of Adult Basic Education and Training  (ABET),
      learnerships, apprenticeships,  and  Extended  Public  Works  Projects
      (EPWP).
    • Approximately R92 million (98.4%) of the total budget of  R97  million
      has been spent. The project is due for completion in  June  2011.  The
      ABET project was allocated R72 million, and it reached the most remote
      areas and empowered the more marginalised sector in the province.
    •  Learners  who  completed  the  ABET  programme  received   recognised
      qualifications and some of these have  been  absorbed  by  the  labour
      market.
    • Facilitators of the project were  drawn  from  local  communities  and
      literacy rates have increased. Other initiatives  include  the  Social
      Development Funding  window,  critical  skills  support  through  SETA
      projects and informal sector support.
5. Presentations on the SETAs

5.1 The Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services  Sectoral  Education
and Training Authority involvement in KwaZulu-Natal

Dr R Patel, Chief Executive Officer of MERSETA; led  the  presentation.  The

5.2 The Clothing, Textile,  Footwear  and  Leather  Sectoral  Education  and
Training Authority involvement in KwaZulu-Natal
Mr P Naicker, Chief Executive Officer, CTFL SETA, led the presentation.  The
presentation highlighted the following critical issues:

    • The CTFL SETA has approximately  1230  eligible  member  companies  of
      which 33% operate in the KZN province.
    • The CTFL SETA  supports  the  CTFL  Centre  of  Excellence  at  Durban
      University of Technology (DUT) by providing bursary support to Textile
      and Clothing Technology students studying at DUT.
    • It also supports  Industry  Training  Unit   operating  from  DUT  via
      projects funded from discretionary funding such as Technical  Training
      for clothing firms and New Venture Creation  training  and  monitoring
      programme.
    • Support is also given to firms operating in  the  province  through  a
      discretionary grant funding window and Education and Training  Quality
      Assurance (ETQA) support to 23 accredited workplace providers.

5.3 The Agriculture Sectoral Education and  Training  Authority  involvement
in KwaZulu-Natal

Mr J Madiba, Chief Executive Officer, AgriSETA led the  presentation,  which
highlighted the following critical issues:

    • AgriSETA deals with approximately 35000 commercial enterprises and 450
      000 under-resourced enterprises with a total of 4100 levy payers.  The
      total income of the SETA is R142.6 million with a  discretionary  fund
      of R65 million. The agricultural sector contributes 25% to change rate
      in Growth Domestic Product (GDP).
    • Over the past 3 years, agriSETA  invested  R38  million  discretionary
      funds and R32 million mandatory grants in KZN and trained in excess of
      2000 beneficiaries (employed or unemployed).  The  SETA  delivers  its
      programmes through 41 accredited private training providers in KZN,  4
      FET  colleges  active  in  agricultural  skills  development,  and   2
      agricultural colleges.
    • The major challenges of the SETA  is  the  fact  that  the  levy-grant
      system is not ideal for economies or sectors dominated  by  small  and
      informal sectors, climate change,  and the land reform process.

6. Presentations on the University of Zululand

6.1 The Senate Report of the University of Zululand

Prof  F  Mazibuko,  Vice-Chancellor;  University   of   Zululand   led   the
presentation  proceedings.  The  presentation  highlighted   the   following
critical issues.

    • The University of Zululand is one of six comprehensive universities in
      South Africa and is strategically situated in the Durban-Richards  Bay
      Corridor. Like all  South  African  universities,  the  University  of
      Zululand is expected to  have  an  ongoing  deliberate  transformation
      agenda that examines practices and philosophies that underpin its core
      business, intellectual projects and other  scholarly  activities.  Its
      vision and mission is to be a leading  rural-based  university  and  a
      comprehensive university providing quality education.
    • The Vice-Chancellor of the university was  appointed  on  01  February
      2010. On her arrival  at  the  university,  she  discovered  that  the
      university did not have a  permanent  Student  Representative  Council
      (SRC), a matter of serious concern. An SRC Caretaking Team  consisting
      of two staff members was appointed as an  administrator  of  the  SRC.
      Political tensions are  said  to  be  the  major  contributor  to  the
      collapse of the SRC at the university. Management  of  the  university
      has met with students and discussed the issue resulting in the setting
      of a possible date for the next SRC elections.


   Specific Actions


      • Registration practices and academic implications: The  registration
        process, staffing and technologies of  the  university  require  an
        overhaul.
      • Safety and security: The  university  security  portfolio  will  be
        transferred from the office of the Registrar and all security units
        will be unified and required to report to the office of  the  Vice-
        Chancellor. A list of all the university suppliers of services  and
        materials will be drawn up and scrutinised.
      •  Installation  of   the   Chancellor   and   Vice-Chancellor:   The
        installation of the new Vice-Chancellor will take place  on  Friday
        30 April 2010 and Mr S Ndebele (Minister  of  Transport)  confirmed
        his availability.
      • Student Residences: Residences will be secured from intrusions from
        people coming from outside or invading from  inside  and  immediate
        action will be taken to restore what is physically damaged  in  the
        residences. A modern and  decent  facility  will  be  part  of  the
        student centre.

6.2 Presentation on  Transformation  Initiative  (From  Human  Resources  to
Human Capital perspective)

Dr M Mokoele, Director Human Capital, led the presentation proceedings.  The
presentation highlighted the following:

    • The impact of globalisation has led to a decline in quality  qualified
      academic staff, in particular women. The University  of  Zululand  has
      lost a number of qualified young academic staff who were attracted  by
      better offers in the private sector.
    • The university needs to place emphasis on the  retention  of  academic
      staff  and  to  review  both  academic  and  non  academic  structures
      concurrently. Human Capital Management  (HCM)  must  be  strategic  in
      transforming the university to access funding and achieve its mission.
      It also needs to focus on staff training  and  development,  including
      research orientation.
    •  Essentially,  the  university   needs   to   reposition   itself   by
      incorporating good  governance,  capitalising  on  human  capital  and
      fostering collaborations with other institutions.
    • Current HCM projects: In 2007, the university committed itself to  job
      evaluation and job description writing which was  completed  in  2009.
      Remuneration alignment and performance management are currently  being
      implemented. A review of strategic and action plans is  scheduled  for
      May 2010.

6.3 Presentation on Admission Policy and Enrolment Planning

Mr J  Doeseb,  Acting  Registrar,  led  the  presentation  proceedings.  The
presentation highlighted the following:

    • The university, like any other comprehensive university  still  offers
      higher certificates, bachelor  degrees,  and  national  diplomas.  The
      university uses the National Senior Certificate (NSC) as  a  benchmark
      for admitting students to various  courses.  Students  without  Matric
      endorsement are accepted for national  diplomas  and,  those  with  an
      endorsement are admitted for bachelor’s degree programmes.
    • Like the majority  of  other  universities  in  the  country,  UZ  has
      experienced  a  huge  demand  for  admission  in  the  education   and
      humanities programmes. The introduction  of  certificate  and  diploma
      programmes as well as the introduction  of  foundation  programmes  in
      science, engineering  and  technology  and  business  management  will
      provide increased access to scarce skills areas.
    • The university currently enrolls 12500 students  of  which  11005  are
      undergraduates and 1495  are  postgraduates.  The  majority  of  these
      students 5350 (41%) are enrolled in the humanities, and 4000 (40%)  in
      education. African students constitute the majority of  students  with
      12299 currently enrolled, followed by Indians who total 114 and  other
      races.  The  large  proportion  of  black  students   represents   the
      geographical location of the university which is surrounded  by  local
      rural areas. Most of the students in the  university  are  drawn  from
      nearby schools.

7. Department of Higher Education and Training


Tour of the department

The Director, Mr H Ramapheka, led the tour of the department. The  following
issues were observed during the tour:

    • The committee was informed that the Sol Plaatjie Building, Head Office
      of the department, was a privately owned property and  the  Department
      of  Public  Works  did  not  reserve  any  rights  to  the   building.
      Construction work and building maintenance were solely handled by  the
      department.
    • The Department of Basic Education which  was  previously  sharing  the
      building with the department, had occupied  another  nearby  building.
      At the time of the tour, the committee discovered that  documents  and
      other furniture items belonging to the Department of  Basic  Education
      were being removed to the nearby building.  Though  the  building  was
      quite old, its overall condition was conducive as a workspace.


8. Tshwane University of Technology

8.1 Presentation on Academic Restructuring at TUT

Prof E Tyobeka,  Vice-Chancellor  led  the  presentation.  The  presentation
highlighted the following:

    • The presentation began by reflecting on the state of the three  former
      technikons that merged to form TUT, namely, Technikon Northern Gauteng
      (TNG),  Technikon  North  West  (TNW)  and  Technikon  Pretoria  (TP).
      Graduation rates, number of post  graduates,  and  level  of  research
      output were below national average at both the TNG and  TNW  prior  to
      the merger.
    • The motivation for the merger of TNG, TNW and  TP  was  based  on  the
      premise that the new institution would overcome the apartheid  induced
      legacy of division between historically white and  historically  black
      institutions  and  ensure  effective  and  efficient  utilisation   of
      resources through effective planning processes.
    • The relocation  of  faculties,  which  still  in  progress,  has  been
      accompanied by infrastructural improvements where  the  faculties  are
      being accommodated. Duplication of programmes has been eliminated.
    • Challenges still remaining include: the finalisation in the relocation
      of faculties, resources for relocation support services and  attention
      to issues of staff relocation.
8.2 Presentation on merging and consolidating research at TUT

Dr  P  Nevhutalu,  Deputy-Vice-Chancellor  of   Research,   Innovation   and
Planning, led the presentation. The presentation highlighted the following:

    • At the time of the merger in 2003, the subsidies research  outputs  of
      the three independent institutions  were  as  follows:  TP  had  total
      subsidies research output of 44.48% compared to 4.17% in TNG and 7.97%
      in TNW. Before the merger in 2002, TP had  a  total  number  of  37501
      postgraduates as compared to  11056  in  TNG  and  5077  in  TNW.  The
      percentage of staff with doctoral  qualification  was  13%  in  TP  as
      compared to 2% in both the TNG and TNW.
    • The number of staff  with  postgraduate  qualifications  has  improved
      significantly after the merger.  In 2008, the total  number  of  staff
      with postgraduate qualification was 422 as compared to  262  in  2004.
      TUT has the highest number of rated researchers (28 in 2008) than  any
      other university of technology in the country.
    • TUT has a number of spectacular innovations that include, but not  are
      not  limited  to,  the  electronic  bicycle  (A  HI  FAMBENI),   power
      management systems and smart vehicle harness. The  current  challenges
      in research and  innovation  include  insufficient  funding,  research
      space and equipment, research management capacity and  recruitment  of
      personnel with doctoral degrees.

8.3 Pre and post merger undergraduate success rate at TUT

Prof L van Staden, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Learning  and  Technology,  led
the presentation. The presentation highlighted the following:

    • The TUT consists of  seven  faculties  and  56  departments  in  three
      provinces (Gauteng, North West and Mpumalanga). The  enrolment  target
      of the institution is 56 000 students with  436  academic  programmes,
      1000 permanent academic posts and R700 million academic budget.
    • The three former institutions differed widely in their philosophy  and
      approach  to  academic  development.   The   pre-merger   period   was
      characterised by fragmentation,  and  a  lack  of  common  vision  and
      framework for academic development.
    • The undergraduate success rate increased with  7.32%  since  2003  and
      surpassed the department’s target set for TUT by 2010 with 2% in 2008.
      Its undergraduate headcount enrolment increased with 4647 since 2003.

8.4 Presentation on infrastructure support for the merger process

Prof  S  Molefe  Deputy  Vice-Chancellor  of  Institutional   Planning   and
Operations  led  the  presentation.   The   presentation   highlighted   the
following:

    • The reasons for the merger were constituted by a number of  government
      objectives which included, amongst others,the  transformation  of  the
      higher education landscape to  a  single  but  differentiated  system,
      ensuring better access, the elimination  of  duplication  of  academic
      programmes and the opportunity to improve service delivery and overall
      quality.
    • TUT developed an Institutional Operating Plan (IOP) to give effect  to
      the merger. The merger initially cost R700 million. Only R302  million
      was provided by the department to fund 33 infrastructural projects  in
      order to effect relocation. 20 projects in total are completed,  seven
      are under construction and six  are  under  the  tender  process.  The
      outstanding 13 projects will be completed by December 2010.
    • The infrastructure projects funding summary includes R48  million  for
      Ga-Rankuwa campus, R135 million for Soshanguve campus, R36 million for
      Pretoria campus and R32 million for other projects.

8.5 Presentation on accommodation, residence life and catering

Ms G Mashabela, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Finance and  Business  Development
led the presentation. The presentation highlighted the following:

    • TUT consists  of  30  student  residences  in  272  buildings  with  a
      population of 10382 students.  There  is  an  Institutional  Residence
      Committee (IRC) which is made up of chairpersons of the campuses,  All
      Residence Committees (ARC’s) and Secretaries as  well  as  ARLC  staff
      members.
    • Residential committee’s are  responsible  for  emergencies,  security,
      residence life  and  sporting  activities.  ALRC  is  responsible  for
      leadership  training,  life  skills  development,  community  service,
      academic support for residence students.
    • The Soshanguve and Garankuwa campus residences  at  the  time  of  the
      merger were found in the following state: up to four students  resided
      in one room, there was no sufficient furniture in  student  rooms,  no
      security  and  access  control,  no  student  social  life  and   poor
      discipline.
    • Transformation achievements in residences include the  integration  of
      students  through  placement  policy,  and  an  improvement   of   the
      management of residences. Students are placed per faculty and are only
      guaranteed accommodation if they achieve at least 50% pass rate.
    • TUT strives to provide sport facilities of  a  high  standard  at  all
      campuses. This is achieved through a  budget  allocation  as  well  as
      assistance from the LOTTO fund.
    • Four years after the merger, the Soshanguve and Ga-Rankuwa  residences
      have significantly improved with rooms fully equipped  with  furniture
      and fluorescent lights.

8.6 Presentation by the Central Student Representative Council (CSRC)

Mr F Phooko, President of the CSRC led the  presentation.  The  presentation
highlighted the following:

    • Enrolment planning: The main challenge for students  with  regards  to
      the  enrolment  planning  of  TUT  is  that  it  changes   constantly.
      Bureaucracy  during   the   registration   period   affects   students
      negatively. Most students coming  from  other  provinces  are  delayed
      since their applications are processed and approved at the main campus
      in Pretoria. No financial support  or  accommodation  is  provided  to
      these students while they wait to be admitted to the institution.
    •  Residences:  The  Ga-Rankuwa  and  Soshanguve  residences  are  still
      operating without an adequate infrastructure. The institution has only
      renovated and painted the residences  when  they  should  rather  have
      constructed new buildings. Facilities at the residences  are  still  a
      cause of concern for students and little has been done to address this
      issue. Residences in satellite campuses are poorly maintained and some
      students are not accommodated.
    • Constitution of the SRC: There is a notion that the management of  the
      institution undermines the Constitution of the SRC. The SRC is  seldom
      consulted on critical decisions of the institution. The main challenge
      is that there is currently no SRC structure at the  Soshanguve  campus
      which affects the representation of the students needs to  management.
      No date was set for the election of a new SRC for this campus.
    • National Student Financial Aid (NSFAS):  Students  currently  enrolled
      for the Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degrees are not  assisted  with
      NSFAS funding. This has  contributed  to  a  high  drop  out  rate  of
      economically challenged students enrolled for this  degree  and  there
      were no plans to address this issue.
    •  Merger:  The  merger  process  has  disadvantaged  the   historically
      disadvantaged merged institutions. As a result, enrolments  have  been
      capped significantly at the Soshanguve campus. The aspirations of  the
      merger were positive. However, the SRC showed concern that those  with
      the mandate  to  fully  implement  the  merger  were  not  effectively
      carrying out the task.

9. University of the Free State

9.1 Presentation on state of UFS

Prof J Jansen, Rector of the UFS, led the  presentation,  which  highlighted
the following.

    • The UFS  has  approximately  30000  enrolled  students  for  the  2010
      academic year with 60% of the  majority  being  black  students,  5.4%
      Coloureds, 0.5% Indians and 34% Whites.  The  institution  attracts  a
      large number of students from nearby provinces and is committed to the
      developmental goals of transformation to move forward.
    • At the time of his arrival (Prof Jansen, Rector), there was a dent  on
      the image of  the  institution.  The  institutional  culture  was  not
      conducive  to   certain   races   within   the   institution.   Racial
      disintegration tensions were evident among the students in the  campus
      and this was a serious concern for  the  Rector.  The  Reitz  incident
      overshadowed the image of the institution even nationally.
    • During the period of 10 months upon the appointment of the new Rector,
      significant progress has been achieved in restoring the image  of  the
      institution. Students were divided in 50-50  ratio  in  residences  to
      promote racial integration. Approximately 16 residences have completed
      this phase and four are still in progress. An enormous amount of  work
      in integrating students has been achieved.
    • In terms of knowledge, the Rector has proposed a curriculum review  of
      the institution to Senate to allow students to  study  core  knowledge
      including  on  how  to  be  human  and  reflect  on  the  meaning   of
      integration. There is also a proposal for the institution to conduct a
      study on race in higher education.
    • The institution has a challenge of a low throughput rate  and  already
      the issue is being addressed through  extensive  work  to  change  its
      teaching model and admission criteria to improve success rates.
    • The institution is currently working with disadvantaged  high  schools
      in the province to encourage first generation students to succeed  and
      reach higher education.
    • In a bid to bring about greater  staff  equity  and  to  position  the
      institution among the leading universities in the continent, the  UFS,
      through the Vice Chancellor’s  initiative,  has  set  aside  funds  to
      recruit 25 of the most promising young scholars  (new  PhDs  students)
      for  intensive  training  in  becoming  the  next  generation  of  UFS
      professors.
    •  The institution  has  submitted  its  transformation  report  to  the
      department. The Rector promised the committee that if the situation of
      the institution does not change, he will take responsibility  for  its
      failure.

9.2 Presentation on access with success

Mrs M Wilson-Strydom led the presentation. The presentation highlighted  the
following:

    • The UFS has a long history of commitment to  the  goal  of  increasing
      participation and providing alternative access  routes  to  counteract
      the impacts of low quality schooling. The challenge of student  under-
      preparedness for university level is growing at the  UFS  specifically
      and nationally.
    •  The  UFS  currently  offers  four  different  access  routes  to  the
      university, namely, a 3-year mainstream undergraduate programme, a  4-
      year extended degree programme,  a  University  Preparation  Programme
      (UPP) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).
    • Since 1993, 4159 students enrolled at the  UFS  after  the  UPP  year.
      Since 1996, 1111 degrees have been awarded at the UFS.  The  UPP  pass
      rate at the end of 2009 following specific focus  on  student  support
      was 74%.
    • The UFS has  four  main  projects  /  programmes  to  enhance  student
      success. These  are:  student  engagement  research,  a  new  academic
      tutorial programme, student orientation and academic advising.

9.3 Presentation by the Student Representative Council (SRC)

Mr M Masitha, President of the SRC led the  presentation.  The  presentation
highlighted the following:

    • Social Integration:  Black  and  white  students  are  still  racially
      disintegrated in residences. The new placement policy has  not  worked
      well in  addressing  this  challenge.  White  students  are  resisting
      integration with the predominantly black students’ residences. The 50-
      50 placement ratio has failed to integrate students to share the  same
      rooms. Black students are still sharing rooms with their  counterparts
      though there are white students living in the  same  block.  Only  30%
      integration has been achieved in residences.
    • Employment Equity: The UFS has a majority of white  males  through-out
      its academic ranks. Promotion has been predominantly based  on  racial
      status rather than academic capabilities and work  performance.  There
      is currently no move to employ black academic staff and  this  affects
      students negatively.
    • Security: Security and access control of  the  campus,  especially  in
      residences is not adequately managed. Lighting is a serious  challenge
      on campus and this has led to an increase in the  rate  of  thefts  in
      residences. Cameras situated around the campus  are  not  sufficiently
      monitored and evaluated.
    • Deregistration of Students: Some students were registered on condition
      that they settle their accounts in April 2010. This is unacceptable as
      the  majority  of  these   students   are   economically   challenged.
      Approximately 1500 students have been deregistered due to debt and the
      SRC appealed to the management to extend the date  until  negotiations
      are completed.
    • Learning: The UFS uses a parallel medium of instruction for  learning.
      This divides the students according  to  their  language  of  tuition.
      Black students are often disadvantaged as their classes continue until
      evening due to lack of  capacity  in  English  classes.  There  is  no
      shuttle services provided for students  living  off  campus  and  this
      leads to non-attendance of classes.


10. Discussion

10.1 Manufacturing Engineering and Related services SETA,  Agriculture  SETA
and Clothing Textile Footwear Leather SETA

    •  The  committee  remained  extremely  concerned  with  the  level   of
      commitment of AGRISETA and  CTFLSETA  towards  skills  development  in
      KwaZulu-Natal. One of the reasons provided by the  CTFLSETA  was  that
      the clothing and textile industry was experiencing  a  downward  trend
      and most of the industries in the sector were closing  down.  AGRISETA
      indicated  that  farm  workers  required  Adult  Basic  Education  and
      Training (ABET) just to be able to count money only.
    • A concern was raised with the contribution of the  SETAs  in  training
      per learner. It was noted that most manufacturing industries were  not
      keen in training learners due to the high costs involved  in  training
      of artisans. The department was requested  to  intervene  in  ensuring
      that more funding is allocated in the training of learners.
    • It was noted that the country was faced with the shortage of engineers
      and by 2020 research shows that there will be  insufficient  engineers
      in the country. A proposal was made that Technical High Schools should
      be fully supported to increase their output in scarce skills.  MERSETA
      was requested to explain its plans to address the shortage  of  scarce
      skills.
    • It emerged that the  three  SETAs  adequately  supported  centre’s  of
      excellence rather than emerging small medium enterprise. The committee
      was concerned that well established enterprises were  benefiting  from
      the SETAs while emerging service providers were being excluded.
    • It was noted that some service providers  were  not  submitting  their
      workplace skills plan annually to the SETAs. This often leads to  less
      accountability  to  the  discretionary  grants  allocated  to  service
      providers. The committee requested a report from the  three  SETAs  on
      the issue.
    • It was highlighted that there is still a lot of work that needs to  be
      done by SETAs in  addressing  the  challenge  of  skills  development.
      Insufficient funding is said to  be  the  main  backlog  that  hampers
      progress in skills development. The department is negotiating with the
      SETAs to reach a specific target  annually  in  line  with  government
      priorities.  It  was  noted  that  well  established  companies   were
      benefiting from mandatory grants and the department was in  a  process
      of reviewing the allowances in line with the SETAs mandates.
    • The level of involvement in the training of artisans is indeed limited
      due to lack of funding. The training of artisans in some countries may
      cost up to R300 000 per year. Legislatively, the SETAs  pay  only  20%
      discretionary grants. The challenge is the need for government to look
      at international trends and become more involved in skills development
      since the training of artisans is very costly.
    • It is not possible to place all learners who participated  in  various
      programmes of the SETAs due to  the  lack  of  capacity  in  industry.
      Emerging service providers are supported by the SETAs. However,  great
      emphasis is  placed  on  the  centre’s  of  excellence  due  to  their
      capacity.

10.2 Meeting with the University of Zululand

    • The committee was of the view that leadership of  the  university  was
      supposed to guide the process of the SRC elections  to  encourage  non
      violence. A concern was raised that there was no SRC in the university
      and no clear indication of the proposed date for  new  SRC  elections.
      The committee requested a copy of the SRC’s constitution  for  further
      scrutiny.
    • The committee commended the work of  the  interim  administrators  who
      were taking care of students needs. The university  was  requested  to
      explain the way forward on the matter and to include  a  timeframe  of
      activities. The committee was concerned that as much as the university
      agreed to meet with the committee, there  was  no  effort  to  include
      students as part of the meeting proceedings.
    • It emerged that there was a notion of affiliating to past events which
      transpired at the university. The committee highlighted  that  history
      cannot legitimate what happens at the university. A concern was raised
      that there were no success stories about the university  available  to
      the public. Credibility of qualifications offered  by  the  university
      were also a cause of concern.  There  were  rumours  that  examination
      papers of the university were being marked off  site.  The  university
      was requested to explain the situation in this regard.
    • The committee commended the Rector’s  approach  in  dealing  with  the
      challenges of the university and supported the implementation  of  the
      one year turn-around strategy.
    • It emerged that the Information Technology Communication (ITC)  system
      was of serious concern and contributed to  the  mismanagement  of  the
      registration and procurement process. The university was requested  to
      explain its plans to address this challenge.
    • It emerged that the university introduced a course known as a Bachelor
      of  Correctional  Studies  in  2002.  This  later  backfired  on   the
      university as many students who graduated  in  this  course  were  not
      finding employment. The committee was interested to know whether there
      was proper research conducted before offering the degree  and  whether
      it was  accredited  by  the  South  African  Qualifications  Authority
      (SAQA).
    • The committee remained extremely concerned that the reason  given  for
      little progress in transformation among academic staff  (predominantly
      black) was that the university was  situated  in  a  rural  area.  The
      committee was of the opinion that it was  the  responsibility  of  the
      university to make it attractive to accommodate  other  races  amongst
      the academic staff.
    • The university was faced with the challenge  of  historical  political
      tension that existed in the surroundings of the university. This often
      influenced the SRC elections as the two main student parties,  namely,
      the South African Students Congress  (SASCO)  and  the  South  African
      Democratic   Students   Movement   (SADESMO)   were   often   fighting
      consistently before the SRC elections. The  process  of  the  previous
      elections was not free and fair as the results were adjusted to create
      a victory for a particular party. The  university  has  set  up  clear
      measures to ensure that the next elections will not be mismanaged  and
      the date would be confirmed in due course.
    • The university is in  the  process  of  overhauling  its  ITC  systems
      because most of the registration challenges  are  caused  by  outdated
      systems. The security service was located in the office of the  former
      Registrar and they were not investigating serious cases such  as  loss
      of data. This office has since been moved to the office of the  Rector
      to minimise potential manipulation.

10.3 Meeting with the department

    • The committee remained extremely concerned with the under-spending  of
      the NSF. The misalignment between the fund and the provinces was  said
      to be the major contributor to under-spending. The fact that there was
      no sufficient monitoring  and  evaluation  by  the  NSF  to  provinces
      concerned the committee.
    • It was noted that the NSF is not a banking scheme and  the  manner  in
      which funds are disbursed to provinces required urgent review. It  was
      highlighted that the NSF is supposed to be an arm to develop and  grow
      skills throughout the provinces. The committee  further  requested  to
      know as to why certain provinces were not allocated funds.
    • It was highlighted that the current status of the NSF was  of  serious
      concern. The committee was concerned with the fact that the department
      had promised to intervene urgently in the challenges of  the  NSF  and
      thus far little has been achieved in addressing its challenges.  As  a
      result, this delay  has  negative  implications  down  the  line.  The
      committee requested an explanation on rumours that the NSF  ceased  to
      disburse funds in 2009.
    •  The  committee  requested  a  breakdown  of  the  use  of  the   fund
      provincially and to include objectives and key outputs of  the  funded
      projects. The  current  mandate  of  the  NSF  to  disburse  funds  to
      provinces  without  assisting  in  developing  a   provincial   skills
      programme needed urgent review.
    • The department acknowledged the challenges of the NSF and promised  to
      fast-track the process of appointing the new Chief  Executive  Officer
      (CEO).  A team to administer  the  operation  of  the  fund  would  be
      appointed in due course. The department agreed that the entire  system
      of the NSF would be reviewed and a  conclusion  of  the  challenge  of
      provincial capacity was a main priority.
    • It  was  noted  that  certain  provinces  delayed  in  drafting  their
      provincial skills plan and as a result the NSF is unable  to  allocate
      funds without specified projects. The NSF had not  stopped  disbursing
      funds to provinces. However, there was a decrease in its activities.

10.4 Meeting with TUT

    • The committee commended the success rate, research initiatives, strong
      focus on student life, staff compliment and progress of the  TUT.  The
      institution was requested to explain  the  reasons  for  the  protests
      during its registration period as well as the current  status  of  the
      matter.
    • The TUT was requested to explain challenges with regards to the moving
      of faculties to other campuses and the process of the merger.
    • The student leadership body was requested to submit a  written  report
      on the challenges of students.
    • It was noted that the process of the merger was fairly complex and the
      model adopted by the TUT had brought people  together.  The  technical
      and mechanical aspect of the merger has been completed. The  issue  of
      the salary dispute was resolved by the institution.


10.5 Meeting with the UFS

    • The committee was concerned  with  the  low  throughput  rate  of  the
      university and requested an explanation for it.
    • It was observed that the university implemented the parallel medium of
      instruction. A  concern  was  raised  regarding  the  non-  Afrikaaans
      speaking students within the university and that  this  could  have  a
      negative impact on their academic performance. The committee requested
      clarity on the impact of the language policy  on  student  access  and
      success.
    •  The  committee  commended  the  university  for   the   Undergraduate
      Preparedness Programme (UPP).  Clarity was requested on the impact  of
      the programme with regards to  student  support  and  whether  it  was
      efficient enough in preparing students for higher education.
    •  The committee commended the 50-50 ratio project of the university  in
      student residences as a positive step towards transformation.  It  was
      highlighted though that this should be prioritised by  the  university
      and the process of the remaining six untransformed residences  process
      should be fast-tracked.
    • It was noted that the Rector of the university was extremely committed
      in turning around the institutional culture of the university. This is
      supported by his strong leadership skills in unifying different  races
      of the university and his approach towards  transforming  the  student
      residences.
    • The committee requested a reflection on the new  emerging  culture  of
      the  university  including  progress  in  new  policies  dedicated  to
      transforming the university. The university was further  requested  to
      explain the relationship between staff members who were victims of the
      Reitz incident and management and,  whether  there  were  any  further
      support mechanisms provided to them.
    •  A  concern  was  raised  regarding  the  employment  equity  of   the
      university. Though there were drastic measures in place  to  implement
      transformation, at top management level of academic staff white  males
      were in an overwhelming majority. The committee enquired  whether  the
      university supported the approach of change at top management level.
    • The university acknowledged that its teaching and  learning  model  is
      not adequate and it  might  be  a  contributing  factor  to  its  poor
      throughput rate. The admission requirement of the  university  is  not
      stringent and as a result many average students had been admitted  and
      some had not managed to maintain a higher standard of education.
    • The language policy of the university racially disintegrates students.
      This has disadvantages as students are not  able  to  communicate  and
      assist one another with their academic work.
    • It was noted that the litigation process regarding the Reitz  incident
      was still proceeding and the victims of the incident have been removed
      from working at the residences. Regular meetings between  victims  and
      management have been conducted with the objective  of  giving  support
      and as a result they have integrated well  into  the  university.  The
      university was working close  with  the  Human  Rights  Commission  in
      arranging compensation for the victims.

11. Findings

11.1 The University of Zululand

    • The institution was without an SRC due to  political  tension  between
      the two main student organizations (SASCO and SADESMO) and the process
      of the new elections was not yet finalized. Two staff  officials  were
      appointed as SRC administrators.
    • Politics among student leadership bodies were taken personally  to  an
      extent whereby students engaged in violent acts resulting in  personal
      injuries or damage to property.
    • The information communication technology system of the university  was
      outdated and loss  of  data  was  quite  frequent,  often  leading  to
      corruption and mismanagement of important files.
    • There were certain academic staff  members  who  were  being  promoted
      without merit and most  of  the  staff  members  were  employed  on  a
      contract basis. Literally, there  was  disjuncture  and  no  effective
      guidelines in the employment system of the university.
    • The procurement of external service providers was not transparent  and
      this  led  to  less  accountability  for  services  rendered  to   the
      university.

11.2 Department of Higher Education and Training

    • There is a serious misalignment between national implementation of the
      NSF with the provincial skills forum and as a result millions of rands
      meant to address the challenge of skills development in provinces were
      being returned to the NSF.
    • The head office of the department was being renovated  to  accommodate
      staff members from  the  Department  of  Labour  dealing  with  skills
      development.
    • The department has not yet succeeded to appoint a new Chief  Executive
      Officer for the NSF and the agreement with the provincial skills forum
      has not yet been concluded due to the recent split of the department.
    • There is a serious challenge of capacity to deliver within the NSF and
      the entire system of the NSF would require an urgent review to address
      the challenge of under-spending.

11.3 Tshwane University of Technology

    • The institution is the largest university of technology in the country
      and  it  is  currently  making  progress  in  terms  of  research  and
      innovation.
    •  There  was  no  SRC  in  the  Soshanguve  Campus  and  most  of   the
      infrastructure  backlogs  were  in  that  campus  since   it   was   a
      historically disadvantaged institution prior to the merger.
    • There is a strong focus on development of student life  in  residences
      and this programme is well managed  and  can  be  a  model  for  other
      institutions.
    • The process of the merger though very complex was managed  in  a  very
      efficient way and the model  adopted  brought  people  from  different
      backgrounds together.

11.4 University of the Free State

    • The university has a challenge of a very low throughput rate  and  one
      of the major reasons given was that the  university’s  teaching  model
      was ineffective.
    • The litigation process of the four Reitz students was still  in  court
      and no final verdict on their fate had been concluded.  The  employees
      who were victims of the incident were  removed  from  working  in  the
      residence and they have integrated well with the university. A process
      is currently in place to arrange their compensation.
    • The 50-50 placement ratio in residences  has  not  yet  addressed  the
      challenge of racial disintegration between black and white students in
      residences.  White  students  are  still  resistant  in  migrating  to
      predominantly black residences. The  completion  of  this  process  is
      expected to be concluded at the end of the year.
    • The demographics of the university do not reflect  equal  represention
      among academic staff. White males are in the majority of the  academic
      staff up to the senior level.
    • The university implements the parallel  medium  of  instruction.  This
      automatically divides students and they are  unable  to  share  common
      knowledge regarding their academic work.

12. Summary

The three day oversight visit to  the  UZ,  DHET,  TUT,  and  UFS  was  very
fruitful and  provided  sufficient  insight  into  some  of  the  underlying
challenges  that  affect  higher  education  institutions  and  the   skills
development sector. It was evident throughout the  visits  that  most  HEI’s
faced common challenges related to transformation, throughput rate,  student
accommodation and financial assistance  to  needy  students.  On  the  other
hand, the skills development sector was lagging behind in terms of  reaching
its millennium goals and  targets  by  2020  and  this  affects  the  masses
negatively. In theory, there are various  measures  in  place  to  implement
government’s objectives to reduce illiteracy and half unemployment by  2014.
However, the critical challenge is the implementation of these policies  due
to bureaucratic challenges within the three spheres of  government.  A  huge
amount of investment has been made in skills development over  the  past  16
years of the new democracy. However, to date, little has been achieved  with
the resources at hand. The involvement of the SETAs has achieved  little  in
addressing the shortage of skills and illiteracy in the country. One of  the
common challenges observed during the oversight visit is  that,  more  funds
were needed to effectively address the challenge of the skills sector.

There has been a significant change in the higher  education  landscape  for
the country to be proud of. Improved participation rates and  better  access
to young black students is a major achievement of higher  education  in  the
last 16 years. However, in general, transformation in the  sector  has  been
limited. This has been observed by  the  committee  through  its  engagement
with various HEI’s even the ones visited during this  oversight  visit.  The
common excuse that has been highlighted  to  the  committee  is  that  black
academics  were  fleeing  the  sector  due  to  its  environment   and   its
remuneration challenges. One of the main findings during the  oversight  was
that graduation rates were still skewed among black  and  coloured  students
and this concerned the committee as there was little achieved to  addressing
this challenge at both the level of HEI’s and  the  department.  The  merger
process has not yet been measurable as many merged institutions  were  still
finding their identity  and  common  objectives.  Political  tensions  among
student leadership bodies  have  been  a  significant  challenge  among  the
historically disadvantaged institutions mainly due to the violation  of  the
SRCs’ constitutions and a lack of adequate leadership  from  the  management
of the institutions during the SRC election periods.

The committee has however, promised to  table  recommendations  made  during
the oversight  visit  in  the  National  Assembly  for  debate  and  further
consideration.  It  further  promised  follow-up  visits   in   future   and
comprehensive interaction through communication  with  the  institutions  to
monitor progress and challenges thereof.

13. Recommendations

The following formed part of the key recommendations:

13.1 The University of Zululand

    • The leadership of the University of Zululand should urgently  finalise
      the proposed date of the  SRC  elections  and  a  conflict  resolution
      structure or mechanism should be put in place to ensure free and  fair
      elections.
    •  The  overhauling  of  the  university’s   information   communication
      technology  systems  should  be  prioritised  with  the  objective  of
      reducing mismanagement of valuable data.
    • The new Vice-Chancellor of the university should be supported  by  the
      members of the executive management in her turn  around  strategy  for
      the university.


13.2 The NSF

    • The appointment of the CEO for the NSF should  be  urgently  concluded
      and the review of the NSF entire system would be very instrumental  in
      reducing the challenge of under-spending.
    • The department should consider  addressing  the  capacity  constraints
      within the NSF so as to assist delivering the key output of the fund.
    • The National Skills Authority (NSA) should  play  an  active  role  in
      ensuring  that  the  NSF  is  a  strong  arm  of  delivery  in  skills
      development. The current surplus of 2.7 billion of the NSF  should  be
      transferred for other deserving under funded critical programmes  such
      as ABET and the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).


   13.3 Tshwane University of Technology


    • The leadership  of  TUT  should  urgently  address  the  lack  of  SRC
      structures at the Soshanguve Campus and other relevant challenges such
      as accommodation on the campus.
    • The process of the  merger  should  be  urgently  concluded  to  allow
      efficiency and efficacy at the institution.
    • TUT should apply for more funding from  NSFAS  to  assist  more  needy
      students, especially from satellite campuses and to  minimise  further
      violent protest during registration period.


   13.4 University of the Free State


    •  Transformation  in  the  UFS  should  be  a  major  priority  of  all
      stakeholders involved in  the  university  and  especially  among  the
      student population.
    • The Committee welcomes and supports the UFS’s proposed plan to  review
      its teaching model, as this is of critical importance in achieving the
      objective of increasing the institution’s  low  throughput  rate.  The
      university should, in particular, consider pursuing new  teaching  and
      learning models that accommodate a larger  and  more  diverse  student
      population.
    • Appointments of black lecturers should be  prioritised  to  strengthen
      support  for  first  generation  students  and  to  reflect   on   the
      demographics of the university where the majority are black  students.
      To this end,  the  Committee  commends  the  initiative  of  the  Vice
      Chancellor to  recruit  25  promising  young  scholars  for  intensive
      training as part of a drive to ensure equitable access and progression
      in the academy for previously disenfranchised groups.
    • The language policy of the university needs to be reviewed as it is  a
      critical element in the process of transformation.

Report to be considered.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

REPORT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN  DELEGATION  TO  THE  122nd  INTER-PARLIAMENTARY
UNION (IPU) ASSEMBLY IN BANGKOK, 27 MARCH TO 1 APRIL 2010

1. Introduction

Established  in  1889,  the  Inter   Parliamentary   Union   (IPU)   is   an
international organization of Parliaments of sovereign states.  The  IPU  is
one of the leading organizations in the promotion and strengthening  of  the
institutions of parliamentary democracy.  The IPU consists of the  Assembly,
the Governing Council, the Executive Committee  and  the  Secretariat.   The
Assembly is assisted in its work by three Standing Committees which  prepare
reports and draft resolutions for the  Assembly  to  consider,  namely,  the
Standing  Committee  on  Peace  and  International  Security,  the  Standing
Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and  Trade  and  the  Standing
Committee on Democracy and Human Rights.  The current President of  the  IPU
is Mr T-B Gurirab from Namibia.

The IPU supports the efforts of the  United  Nations,  whose  objectives  it
shares, and works in close co-operation  with.   It  also  co-operates  with
regional inter-parliamentary organizations as  well  as  with  international
inter-governmental and civil society organizations  that  are  motivated  by
the same ideals.

The IPU’s membership currently comprises of 155  member  parliaments  and  9
international parliamentary assemblies who are associate members.

2. Agenda
The agenda of the 122nd IPU Assembly was as follows:

i) Election of the President and Vice Presidents of the 122nd Assembly
ii) Consideration of possible requests for the inclusion  of  an  emergency
    item in the Assembly agenda.
iii) General debate on the political, economic and social situation  in  the
    world with the overall theme of “Parliament at the heart  of  political
    reconciliation and good governance”.
iv) Cooperation and shared  responsibility  in  the  global  fight  against
    organized crime, in particular drug trafficking,  illegal  arms  sales,
    human trafficking and cross  border-terrorism  (Standing  Committee  on
    Peace on International Security).
 v) The role  of  parliaments  in  developing  South-South  and  Triangular
    Cooperation with a view to accelerating achievement of  the  Millennium
    Development  Goals  (Standing  Committee  on  Sustainable  Development,
    Finance and Trade).
vi) Youth participation in the democratic process  (Standing  Committee  on
    Democracy and Human Rights).

3. Delegation
The delegation to the 122nd IPU Assembly consisted of: Mr  M  V  Sisulu,  MP
(Speaker of the National Assembly and Leader of Delegation), Ms M T  Kubayi,
MP (ANC), Adv Z L Madasa, MP (ANC), Ms B V Mncube, MP (ANC), Ms S C N Shope-
Sithole, MP (ANC), Ms D  Kohler-Barnard,  MP  (DA),  Mr  L  Ramatlakane,  MP
(COPE) and Prof C T Msimang, MP (IFP).  Ms M N Oliphant (House  Chairperson:
International Relations) and Ms M Wenger (DA) attended as  advisers  to  the
delegation (observers).

The delegation was accompanied by Mr P Lebeko (Office of the Speaker), Ms  M
Cannon (Office of the Speaker), Ms Z Gcwabe (Office of the  Speaker),  Ms  T
Lyons (National Assembly Table), Ms N Sonjica (International Relations)  and
Ms Z Jardine (International Relations),

Mr Z A Dingani (Secretary to Parliament), Mr M K Mansura (Secretary  to  the
National Assembly), Adv M E  Phindela  (Acting  Secretary  to  the  National
Council  of  Provinces)  and  Ms  P  Davids  (Office  of  the  Secretary  to
Parliament) attended the meeting of the Association of  Secretaries  General
of Parliaments.

The South African delegation  was  met  on  arrival  by  Ambassador  Douglas
Gibson.  The Ambassador briefed the  delegation  on  the  current  political
situation in  Thailand.   His  input  covered  the  recent  history  of  the
political situation in the country.  He highlighted that power  could  shift
swiftly between factions. He advocated that South Africa should  retain,  as
far as  possible,  a  neutral  stance  to  the  current  political  impasse.
Speaker Sisulu also pointed out that the approach of  South  Africa  was  to
always firstly pursue and encourage the  route  of  dialogue  to  resolve  a
political crisis.

4. Meeting of Women Parliamentarians
The Meeting of Women Parliamentarians took place on Saturday, 27  March  and
continued on Wednesday, 31 March.  Ms Shope-Sithole, Ms  Kohler-Barnard  and
Ms Wenger attended the meeting.

The meeting elected Dr. Tassana  Boontong,  Second  Vice  President  of  the
Senate of Thailand as the  President  of  the  Meeting.   The  meeting  then
proceeded to look at gender activities of the IPU including the work of  the
Coordinating   Committee   of   Women   Parliamentarians,   the   work   and
recommendations of the Gender Partnership Group and recent  specialized  IPU
meetings.  It was noted that of the 130 countries and 1334  participants  to
the 122nd Assembly, 193 were women (28,2%).  This  was  slightly  below  the
desired 30%.  The meeting  was  also  informed  that  the  delegations  from
Malta, Qatar, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia  would  be  reduced  by  one
person as a result of being composed exclusively of parliamentarians of  the
same sex for three consecutive sessions of the Assembly.

Participants then divided into  two  groups  to  discuss  the  subject  item
before the  Standing  Committee  on  Peace  and  International  Security  on
“cooperation  and  shared  responsibility  in  the  global   fight   against
organized crime, in particular drug trafficking, illegal arms  sales,  human
trafficking and cross border terrorism”.  The sub-themes for the two  groups
were:

     i. Trafficking of women.  This group discussed concrete ways and means
        to prevent trafficking of women,  punish  perpetrators  and  secure
        support  to  ensure  the  rehabilitation  of   women   victims   of
        trafficking.
    ii. The role  of  women  in  combating  drug  trafficking.  This  group
        discussed the impact on women and families and the role of women in
        terms of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.


The rapporteur of each discussion group was tasked with drafting  amendments
to  the  resolution  submitted  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Peace  and
International Security for discussion.  The amendments  would  be  aimed  at
introducing a gender perspective to the resolution.

In her input to the first discussion group, Ms  Kohler-Barnard  stated  that
South Africa was currently very focussed on the Soccer World  Cup,  however,
it was also very aware that with it would come  the  trafficking  of  women,
youths and children.  It was noted that the  South  African  Police  Service
had  secured  a  total  conviction  rate  of  just  five  cases  for   human
trafficking in the last financial year, with only 29 successful  detections,
despite it being known that South  Africa  was  a  source,  destination  and
transit country for trafficking in  persons  and  was  on  an  international
human trafficking watch list.  
 
It was reported that some 40 000 women and children were  trafficked  during
the 2006 German World Cup and it was estimated that South  Africa  could  be
facing figures as high as 100 000 over the World Cup in June and  July  this
year.
 
Ms Kohler-Barnard stated that as a parliamentarian she did not believe  that
the issue had, prior to this stage, received sufficient attention  from  the
South African police, although South Africa had, just  days  ago,  made  its
first  conviction  for  human  trafficking  for  the  purposes   of   sexual
exploitation.  This  conviction  was  secured  by  using  racketeering  laws
related to sexual exploitation to convict a couple, a South  African  and  a
Thai national.  South Africa’s Human  Trafficking  bill  was  only  recently
introduced in Parliament.  She noted this  in  light  of  point  11  of  the
resolution which stated that member Parliaments had to be more proactive  in
combating  trafficking  by  drawing  up  laws  to   do   so,   criminalizing
trafficking and including prevention, protection  and  assistance  measures.
The two men arrested were due to be sentenced on May 10 and faced a  maximum
sentence of life imprisonment or R100  million  fine.   They  had  recruited
women from Thailand who were kept in a brothel on the east  coast  of  South
Africa.   Therefore, it was noted that although human  trafficking  for  the
purposes of sexual exploitation  could  currently  draw  long  sentences  in
South Africa, it was not necessarily the case  with  human  trafficking  for
other reasons.  It was hoped that the new legislation would address this.

It was further stated that the situation was  expected  to  worsen  markedly
during the run-up to the Soccer World Cup, as South  Africa’s  borders  were
extremely porous.  The movement of  vehicles  carrying  trafficking  victims
remained an issue which was being focused on by role  players  ranging  from
security to social services.  It was further highlighted that there  was  an
integral  link  between  human  trafficking,   drug   dissemination,   money
laundering, under the umbrella of organized crime, as well  as,  in  certain
cases, terrorism and that South Africa was focussing on  this  with  extreme
vigilance and energy.  As a nation South Africa was determined not to  allow
its hard fought battle for democracy to come under  threat  politically,  or
economically.  In this manner and as with  the  other  areas  that  required
focus during the pre-world cup period, this was one area in particular  that
was causing  concern  and  ensuring  a  greater  focus.  The  fight  against
transnational organized crime had to be strengthened and intensified  so  as
to find a solution involving the sub-Saharan sector.

In her input to the second discussion group,  Ms  Shope-Sithole  noted  that
the  South   African   parliament   had   a   high   percentage   of   women
parliamentarians  who  were  focused  on  addressing   issues   of   poverty
alleviation within their constituencies.  This was  especially  relevant  as
it was often women in poverty stricken  areas  that  turned  to  drugs.   By
targeting women for poverty alleviation programmes progress  could  be  made
in alleviating drug abuse.

The Meeting of Women Parliamentarians also held a dialogue  session  between
men and women on “Combating violence against women, with a particular  focus
on women held in places of detention and imprisonment” was also held.   This
session was introduced by a keynote address by HRH,  Princess  Maha  Chakira
Bajrakitiyabha, UNIFEM Goodwill Ambassador on violence against  women.   The
debate  that  followed  focused  on  the  general  role  of  parliaments  in
combating violence against women.  Particular emphasis  was  placed  on  the
situation of women in prisons and immigration detention centers.

Participants were presented with the latest Map on  Women  in  Politics  for
2010.  This Map was jointly produced by the IPU and the United Nations.

The Meeting of Women Parliamentarians was also called upon to renew half  of
the membership of its Coordinating Committee, to replace those  titular  and
substitute representatives whose term expired in  April  2010,  as  well  as
those members that had lost their seat.  Ms S Shope-Sithole was  elected  as
substitute member for the Africa group.  On her  election  Ms  Shope-Sithole
expressed her thanks for the  faith  that  had  been  placed  in  her.   She
expressed her desire to work for general good of women of the world.

After  the  elections,  the  meeting  was  suspended  to  allow  the   newly
constituted Coordinating Committee to meet in camera and  select  candidates
for it bureau (President, First Vice-President and  Second  Vice-President).
 It was then announced that Mrs Syada Greiss was the new  President  of  the
Meeting of Women Parliamentarians while Dr Nurthayati  Assegaf  was  elected
as First Vice-President and Ms M Mensah-Williams  was  appointed  as  Second
Vice-President.

As part of the programme of work of the Meeting of  Women  Parliamentarians,
three field visits were undertaken on Monday 29 March, namely:


     i. Field visit related to early childhood development which went to
        the Silapadje Early Childhood Development Center.  Ms Shope-Sithole
        attended this field visit.
    ii. Field visit to look at issues around migrants and trafficking to
        the Sapansiri Community.  Ms D Kohler-Barnard and Ms M Wenger
        attended this field visit.
   iii. Field visit to look at matters related to newborn care to the
        Charoenkrung Pracharak Hospital, the first baby friendly hospital
        in Bangkok.


5. Meeting of Southern Africa Group

The meeting was held on Saturday, 27 March and chaired  by  Speaker  Sisulu.
Mrs Margaret Mensah-Williams, a member of parliament from  Namibia,  briefed
the meeting on vacancies to be filled during the 122nd IPU as follows:

Bureau of the Africa Geopolitical Group

The meeting was informed that, according to the rules of the Group,  Central
Africa, by virtue of being first on the alphabetical list  of  sub  regions,
would nominate a chairperson from the group.  Each  sub  region  would  also
need to nominate a member to serve on the bureau of the Africa  Geopolitical
Group.

Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians

Two vacancies existed for the Africa Geopolitical Group for  a  titular  and
substitute member.  It was agreed that Ms Shope-Sithole would  be  nominated
as a substitute member, on behalf of the Southern Africa sub region, on  the
Coordinating Committee.

Standing Committees

There  were  no  vacancies  on  the  First  Standing  Committee  (Peace  and
International Security).  On  the  Second  Standing  Committee  (Sustainable
Development, Finance and Trade) there was one vacancy for  a  titular  vice-
president from the Africa Group.  The meeting agreed that  Ms  Lucy  Changwe
from Zambia would be nominated on behalf of the Southern Africa sub  region.
 The Third Standing Committee (Democracy and Human  Rights)  had  a  vacancy
for a titular vice-president from the Africa Group, but it was  agreed  that
the sub region would not put forward a nomination for this position  to  the
Africa Geopolitical Group.
In conclusion the meeting looked at consolidation of the reform of the  IPU,
specifically the legal foundation of  the  IPU.   On  the  proposal  of  the
meeting it was agreed  that  Speaker  Sisulu  would  be  the  representative
serving on the task team to  look  at  the  documentation  that  had  served
before the Executive Committee of the IPU  related  to  changing  the  legal
nature of the IPU to that of an international organisation.

6. Meeting of the Africa Geopolitical Group

The meeting was held on Friday, 26 March and continued on Monday  29  March.
.

Report  from  representatives  of  the  Africa  Geopolitical  Group  on  the
Executive Committee

The representatives  from  Algeria  and  Benin  briefed  the  Group  on  the
meetings of the Executive Committee held on 25 and 26 March.  The  following
matters were reported on:

     i. The report of the President of the IPU on  his  recent  activities,
        specifically the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change.
    ii. The Secretary-General’s financial report which had highlighted that
        the IPU was still in a strong financial position despite the  world
        economic crisis.
   iii. The consideration  of  requests  for  reaffilitation  to  the  IPU,
        notably by Djibouti, the Seychelles and Guinea Bissau.
    iv. The referral of  the  disappearance  of  a  number  of  members  of
        parliament from Nigeria to the Committee on  the  Human  Rights  of
        Parliamentarians.
     v. The forthcoming meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the  Third
        World Conference of Speakers taking place in June.  In this  regard
        members  were  requested   to   make   the   necessary   logistical
        arrangements for their participation in the conference in good time
        as a number of events were being held in Geneva at this time.


The Executive Committee also looked at cooperation with the  United  Nations
system, specifically  the  relationship  between  the  IPU  and  the  United
Nations in line with the cooperation agreement which gave the  IPU  observer
status at the United Nations and aimed to add a parliamentary  dimension  to
the work of the United Nations.  This agreement was concluded  in  1996  and
required updating.

In addition, the Executive Committee looked  at  the  consolidation  of  the
reform of the IPU by changing the legal nature of the  IPU  to  that  of  an
international organisation.  It was proposed that this  should  be  done  by
way of an international  convention  concluded  by  states.   The  Secretary
General would specifically focus  on  this  matter  when  he  addressed  the
Group.

After deliberation it was agreed that each sub regional group  would  select
a  representative  to  serve  on  a  task  team  to  look  closely  at   the
documentation that served before the Executive  Committee  on  changing  the
legal nature of the IPU to that of  an  international  organisation.    This
task team would be set up after the  Secretary  General  had  addressed  the
Group on this matter.


The request by Canada to host the 127th IPU Assembly  in  October  2012  (it
was practice for this Assembly to be held in Geneva) was discussed.   Uganda
would host the 126th IPU Assembly in  April  2012.   Canada  had  previously
requested to host the 2011 Assembly (which would now be hosted  by  Panama),
but had been unsuccessful as it  could  not  guarantee  that  all  countries
would be granted visas to enter Canada.  Canada had now  indicated  that  it
would grant visas to all countries to whom the United Nations would grant  a
visa.  Furthermore,  should  a  visa  not  be  granted  as  a  delegate  was
perceived as a security risk, Canada had undertaken  to  handle  the  matter
directly with the delegate concerned.   It was the position of  the  meeting
that the conditions laid down by Canada went against the spirit of  the  IPU
as a platform for world  wide  parliamentary  dialogue.   In  addition,  the
conditions were contrary to the statutes of the IPU in  so  far  as  it  was
parliaments that determined their delegations and not individual members.

The Executive Committee  also  discussed  the  procedure  for  electing  the
Secretary General of the IPU.  In this regard a procedure would need  to  be
developed to allow for more than  one  candidate  for  the  position  to  be
considered.

Emergency Items

Three requests had been received for consideration  as  an  emergency  item,
namely:

     i. The Israeli violations of Islamic  and  Christian  holy  sites  and
        consideration of the Harem Ibrahimi Mosque and the Bilal Ibn  Rabah
        Mosque as part of the Jewish Heritage  (proposed  by  Palestine  on
        behalf of the Arab Group).
    ii. The solidarity of the international community, and in particular of
        parliaments and parliamentarians of the world, with the  people  of
        Haiti and Chile in the face of the tragedy  they  are  experiencing
        (submitted by Cuba and Uruguay).
   iii.  Parliamentary  action  to  ensure  an  immediate  halt  to  Jewish
        settlements as well as the physical and intellectual protection  of
        all historical and religious sites in the Palestinian  territories,
        in particular Al-Aqsa  Mosque,  from  all  aggressive  and  illegal
        actions of the occupying power (submitted by the  Islamic  Republic
        of Iran).

Support for those emergency  items  which  were  related  to  Palestine  was
expressed, as was support for the emergency item on Haiti  and  Chile.   The
meeting did not conclude finally  which  proposal  it  would  support  as  a
Group.

Vacancies to be filled during the 122nd IPU

Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians

It was reported that the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians would  be  called
upon to renew half of the  membership  of  its  Coordinating  Committee,  to
replace those titular and substitute  regional  representatives  whose  term
expired in April 2010.

Posts to  be  filled  included  one  titular  and  one  substitute  regional
representative per geopolitical group, for a four year  term.   Geopolitical
groups  were  requested  to  submit  candidatures  accompanied  by  a  brief
curriculum vitae of the candidates.

From the Southern Africa sub  region,  Ms  Shope-Sithole  was  nominated  by
acclamation as substitute regional representative for the  Africa  Group  on
the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians.

The meeting agreed that sub regions should give consideration to persons  to
be nominated for election to the bureau of the  Africa  Geopolitical  Group.
The bureau would be elected during the 123rd IPU Assembly  taking  place  in
Geneva in October.

Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians
It was indicated that membership of this committee  would  not  be  done  by
submission from geopolitical groups, but rather on submission of  individual
candidature, and based on relevant interest and experience.

Standing Committees

Each standing committee had a bureau composed of a President and five  Vice-
Presidents – one from  each  of  the  six  geopolitical  groups.   For  each
titular member of the Bureau there is also a substitute member  representing
the same geopolitical  group.   The  bureau  meets  at  every  Assembly  and
performs a number of statutory tasks.

In conformity with Rule 7.2 of the Rules of  Standing  Committees,  officers
of the Committee would be elected or re-elected at the first annual  session
of the Assembly by an absolute majority of the votes cast.

The attention of the meeting was also drawn to  proposed  rule  changes  for
standing committees where, in order to ensure a fair distribution  of  posts
among members of the IPU, a member could not hold a post in  the  same  body
for more than four years even if he or she had held different positions.

It  was  agreed  that  the  Group’s  secretariat  would  draw  up  a  roster
indicating which sub regional groups had held positions in  the  past.   The
principle of rotation between the sub regional groups would be applied  when
deciding  which  candidates  to  put  forward  on  behalf  of   the   Africa
Geopolitical Group.

Mrs L Changwe from Zambia was nominated  by  acclamation  as  titular  vice-
president  for  the  Africa  Group  on  the  Second  Standing  Committee  on
Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade.
Consolidation of the reform of the IPU

The Secretary-General of the IPU, Mr Anders Johnsson, briefed the  Group  on
the “Consolidation of the reform of the IPU” and “The  draft  convention  on
the IPU”.  He informed  the  meeting  that  the  IPU  does  not  conform  to
traditional  legal  doctrine  according  to  which  the  term  international
organization  was  defined  as  those  created  by  multilateral   treaties.
Although the IPU had a legal personality that  allowed  it  to  act  in  the
international arena it was not based on  an  international  convention.   It
was  proposed  that  by  inviting  states  to  conclude   an   international
convention that had the effect of conferring the formal legal status  of  an
international organization, the IPU  would  “recreate”  itself.   In  short,
concluding an international agreement would  demonstrate  states  commitment
to work together – through their parliaments – to promote democracy  at  the
national  and  international  level.   It  would  also  give  political  and
diplomatic support to the IPU and would strengthen its  ability  to  promote
democracy as  well  as  place  the  IPU  on  an  equal  footing  with  other
international organizations.

Practical benefits to the IPU of such a move  would  be  that  a  convention
would spell out the privileges and immunities  of  delegates  attending  IPU
meetings.  These privileges could also be extended to officials working  for
the IPU.  Furthermore, as the IPU was  not  an  international  organizations
its officials are subject to double taxation this  is  currently  offset  by
the IPU through revenues received from members.

A number of political reasons for the establishment of a convention  on  the
IPU were also highlighted:

   i. The PU had  a  unique  mandate  and  expertise  in  the  promotion  of
      democracy and rule of law both at national and international level.
  ii. The IPU was increasingly working at country level in close cooperation
      with states represented by governments therefore the legal basis  will
      confer on the IPU the authority to fully engage with governments.
 iii. The IPU had extended its democracy  activities  to  the  international
      level and started to  promote  the  participation  of  parliaments  in
      international affairs.  The participation of the  IPU  at  this  level
      would fill this current gap.
  iv. The legal change to an “international organization”  would  assist  in
      facilitating greater cooperation with governments since  international
      cooperation is organized by states acting through their governments
   v. The IPU’s vision was to work as the global  parliamentary  counterpart
      to the United Nations. This depends largely  on  the  IPU  becoming  a
      fully-fledged international organization.

The proposed treaty would therefore give the IPU the power to enter  into  a
binding relationship agreement with defined roles and responsibilities  with
the UN.  This would also increase the level of influence that the IPU  would
have on the UN and other international bodies as it would  be  on  the  same
level as recognised international organization.   The  IPU  would  have  the
authority to represent  parliaments  at  the  global  level  to  democritise
international  participation  by  providing  a  parliamentary  dimension  to
international discussions and decisions.
Speaker Sisulu stated that the  discussions  on  the  establishment  of  the
treaty  should  be  used  as  an  opportunity  to  discuss  the   reform   /
transformation of the IPU. The re-creation of the IPU into an  international
organization should be preceded by a  discussion  on  the  transformation  /
reform of the IPU to  ensure  that  the  treaty  provided  for  what  member
parliaments intend the re-created IPU to look like.  In addition,  it  would
be useful to locate the debate on the reform of the IPU within  the  broader
debate of the reform of the United Nations. He enquired whether the  project
was bound by any time frames and whether the governance  structures  of  the
IPU would need to be adjusted because of  this  initiative.  He  added  that
individual parliaments would need to consider  the  proposal  by  commencing
their initial discussions on the matter.

The meeting agreed that the Group’s members on the Executive  Committee  and
the representatives from each sub region would work together to look at  the
proposal further.  Speaker Sisulu would form part of this  group  on  behalf
of the Southern Africa sub region.

7. First Standing Committee on Peace and Security

The First Standing Committee met  on  Sunday,  28  March  and  continued  on
Tuesday, 30 March.  Adv  Madasa  and  Ms  Kohler-Barnard  represented  South
Africa in the meeting.   The  committee  considered  the  report  and  draft
resolution on “Cooperation and shared responsibility  in  the  global  fight
against organized  crime,  in  particular  drug  trafficking,  illegal  arms
sales, human trafficking and cross border  terrorism”   presented  by  Ms  M
Ortuno (Mexico) and Mr A Wiriyachai (Thailand).   This  was  followed  by  a
debate.

In her input to the debate Ms Kohler-Barnard stated  that  the  2010  Soccer
World Cup was imminent,  and  as  such  cross  border-issues  had  become  a
priority for South Africa.   The need  to  implement  an  integrated  border
management strategy was a priority.  In  November  2009  the  South  African
government had stated that the South African National  Defence  Force  would
be redeployed to protect borders in order to prevent the transfer of  stolen
property, and mitigating the risk  of  a  predicted  spike  in  cross-border
human trafficking during the 2010 World  Cup.   It  was  stated  that  South
African  borders  currently  allow  for  an  easy  exit  for  stolen  goods,
particularly  cars,   illegal   drugs,   illegal   immigrants,   and   human
trafficking.  She stated that South Africa had recognised  the  problem  and
was addressing it in line with the awareness of the  integral  link  between
human trafficking, drug  dissemination,  money  laundering,  all  under  the
umbrella of
organized crime.  As a result  South  Africa  had  realised  that  effective
border security was critical to  combat  these  crimes.   The  International
Conference on Maritime  Security  held  in  South  Africa  had  pointed  out
serious gaps in border security particularly along the coastline.

In his input Adv Madasa focussed on the issue of terrorism.  He stated  that
South  Africa  had  passed  laws  in  respect  to  terrorism   as   required
internationally and was sure that the World Cup would be a safe  event.   He
further  stated  that  terrorism  was  a  radical  response   to   political
situations.  Democrats across the world  should  work  together  and  combat
terrorism within the framework of the law.  He  concluded  by  stating  that
political problems required political solutions.

At the conclusion of the debate a drafting team was established to  look  at
possible amendments to the resolution.  On completion of  the  work  of  the
drafting committee, the resolution, as amended, was adopted by  acclamation.


Adv Madasa was re-elected as substitute vice-president for the Africa  Group
on the bureau of the committee.  The current chairperson of the  bureau  was
Mr T Boa (Côte d΄ Ivoire).

8. Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade

The Second Standing Committee met on  Monday,  29  March  and  continued  on
Wednesday, 31 March.  Ms Mncube  and  Prof  Msimang  represented  the  South
African delegation at the meeting. The committee considered the  report  and
draft resolution on “The role of parliaments in developing  South-South  and
Triangular Cooperation with  a  view  to  accelerating  achievement  of  the
Millennium Development Goals” as presented by Ms  F-X  de  Donnea  (Belgium)
and Mr G Lubinda (Zambia).  This was followed by a debate.

In her input Ms Mncube stated that the strategic plan of the  South  African
Department  of  International  Relations  and  Cooperation   for   2009-2012
outlined South-South Cooperation as one  of  its  key  strategic  directives
most significantly to enhance  South  Africa’s  developmental  agenda.   For
South Africa, South –  South  cooperation  was  a  key  platform  to  pursue
cooperation in the critical fields of science,  technology  and  trade.   It
also provided for the strengthening of solidarity  amongst  the  nations  of
the  South  and  could  be  used  as  an  avenue  to   form   interdependent
relationships which had the potential to address  issues  such  as  poverty,
education,  unemployment,  health  and  the  general  development   of   the
population.

The current framework of South-South Cooperation was in the  spirit  of  the
Marrakech Declaration.  The declaration stated that no single country  could
reach its developmental objectives on its own.  Cooperation  was  necessary.
For South Africa cooperation was not just a mere  choice  for  pursuing  the
country’s strategic objectives, but an essential  part  of  foreign  policy,
which sought cooperation with all members of  the  international  community.
According to the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action.  South  –  South  Cooperation
should observe the principles of respect for  sovereignty,  non-interference
in the internal affairs of  other  states,  equality  amongst  developmental
partners and respect for  independence,  cultural  diversity,  identity  and
local content.  This was  especially  important  in  respect  of  Triangular
Cooperation where the development  partners  were  sometimes  not  of  equal
political and economic status.  These principles would then come  into  play
to ensure that while developmental objectives were met it was  not  with  an
element of coercion that could violate sovereignty.  The Accra  Agenda  also
impressed the importance of meeting responsibilities within a  developmental
partnership.  The Accra Agenda remained  a  crucial  element  and  guide  to
Triangular Cooperation in particular where developmental  partners  straddle
the North / South divide.

In his input Prof Msimang stated that although  South  Africa  endorsed  the
draft resolution it had  identified  a  few  gaps  which  were  of  concern,
namely, human rights issues, the rule of law with  particular  reference  to
intellectual property rights and finally issues of global governance.

With regard to the human rights issues, South Africa  firmly  believed  that
promotion and protection of human rights such as human dignity  and  respect
was  critical  to  socio-economic  development.   It  was  argued  that  the
promotion of universal respect for human rights  should  be  a  precondition
for development.  In terms of the rule of law it emphasised  a  similar  and
related  concept,  namely,  protection  and  respect  for  property  rights.
Technology service providers  would  be  uncomfortable  in  dealing  with  a
country where the rule of law did not  exist  because  of  the  danger  that
protection of their intellectual property rights  would  not  be  guaranteed
and that the receiving country would benefit unfairly from  their  products.
Finally, it was stated  that  the  resolution  failed  to  mention  specific
issues of global governance which might restrict and stifle advances in  the
development of South-South and  Triangular  relationships.   To  illustrate,
Professor Msimang referred to non tariff barriers  including  standards  and
subsidies  which  serve  to  limit  access  to  markets.   He  proposed  the
elimination of those trade barriers which hamper South-South and  Triangular
cooperation.

At the conclusion of the debate a drafting team was established to  look  at
possible amendments to the resolution.  On completion of  the  work  of  the
drafting committee, the resolution, as amended, was adopted by  acclamation.


The current membership of the  bureau  was  reconfirmed.   Mr  E  Quenum  of
Benin, who had submitted his candidature  himself,  asked  that  his  strong
objection to the manner in which elections had been conducted by the  Africa
Geopolitical Group be noted.  Ms Mncube requested an opportunity to set  the
record straight and informed the meeting that during the discussions in  the
Africa Geopolitical Group, Mr Quenum  had  withdrawn  his  candidature.   In
accordance  with  the  rules  pertaining   to   standing   committees   only
candidatures received from geopolitical groups could be  accepted.  Ms  Lucy
Changwe’s (Zambia) candidature as  titular  representative  for  the  Africa
Geopolitical Group was therefore approved by the standing committee.

9. Third Standing on Democracy and Human Rights

The Third Standing Committee met  on  Sunday,  28  March  and  continued  on
Wednesday, 31 March.  Ms Kubayi and Mr Ramatlakane represented South  Africa
at the meeting.  The committee considered the report and  draft  resolutions
on “Youth Participation in the Democratic Process”  as  presented  by  Ms  M
Lugaric (Croatia).  This was followed by a debate.

In her remarks Ms Lugaric noted that she had been  the  sole  rapporteur  on
this topic and that this had led to, in her opinion,  certain  omissions  in
the report and draft resolution.  She stated that  as  the  only  rapporteur
she had not had the advantage of  an  alternative  perspective  which  would
have been present  had  the  appointed  co-rapporteur  participated  in  the
process.

Ms Kubayi in her input commended the  recommendation  that  each  delegation
should have at least one representative of the youth.  She  said  that  such
an  arrangement  would  compel  countries   which   did   not   have   young
parliamentarians  to  start  ensuring  that  young  people  were   part   of
legislatures.  She further stated that the  participation  of  youth  should
not be limited to politics, but extended to economic development  issues  as
well.  Young people should take center stage in assisting countries to  find
solutions to the problems being faced across the world, for example,  global
warming or the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.

South Africa had seen an increasing interest and participation of  youth  in
politics and the current political term had seen an increase in the  elected
number of parliamentarians from the youth. The South African Parliament  had
passed legislation to establish a National Youth  Development  Agency.  This
agency was funded and supported by government and driven  by  young  people.
The agency was responsible for the mainstreaming of youth issues across  all
spheres of government. Among other things the  agency  ensured  support  for
young people in education and skilling to ensure their participation in  the
economy of the country.

There was a need to ensure that the members of the IPU monitor  and  support
the establishment of youth structures and that topics  that  affected  youth
globally were part of IPU discussions, for example, drug and  alcohol  abuse
by young people and young people in conflict with the law.  Furthermore,  it
was said that it was the youth  who  should  take  centre  stage  in  policy
formulation  around  the  protection  and   promotion   of   human   rights.
Parliaments should pass legislation which would be beneficial  to  promoting
the rights of the  youth  and  lastly,  youth  ambassadors,  nationally  and
internationally, should look at issues related to the youth.

At the conclusion of the debate a drafting team was established to  look  at
possible amendments to the  resolution.   Ms  Kubayi  chaired  the  drafting
committee on  the  resolution  before  the  Third  Standing  Committee.   On
completion of the  work  of  the  drafting  committee,  the  resolution,  as
amended, was adopted by acclamation.

The current membership of the bureau  was  reconfirmed.   Mr  O  Kyei-Mesha-
Bonsu (Ghana) was elected as titular vice-president for the Africa Group.

The subject item  proposed  by  the  bureau  for  the  next  report  of  the
committee was “Providing a sound legislative framework  for  the  prevention
of electoral violence and ensuring the smooth  transition  of  power.”   The
proposal was voted upon as the United Arab Emirates proposed an  alternative
item  namely  “Achieving  global  cooperation  for  the  implementation   of
international treaties  and  commitments  of  humanitarian  treaties”.   The
proposal of the bureau went through with a majority of the votes.

The delegation from Iran proposed that Ms Kubayi be  the  co-rapporteur  for
the subject.  Zimbabwe also proposed a candidate, but withdrew in  favor  of
Ms Kubayi’s candidature.  The final decision  on  the  rapporteurs  for  the
items before the standing committees would be put before the Assembly  after
it had been ascertained that an appropriate geopolitical and gender  balance
had been achieved.

10.  Panel  discussion  on  The  Role  of  Parliaments  in  fulfilling   the
   Convention on the Rights of the Child

A panel discussion on “The role of Parliament in fulfilling  the  Convention
of the Rights of the Child” was  held  on  Tuesday,  30  March.   Ms  Shope-
Sithole and Ms M Wenger attended the meeting.  The panelists  were  Ms  Mart
Santos Pais, Special Representative of the United Nations  Secretary-General
on violence against children, Professor Vitit  Muntarbhorn,  former  Special
Rapporteur  of  the  United  Nations  Secretary-  General  on  the  sale  of
children, child prostitution and pornography, Dr  Syada  Greiss,  Member  of
Parliament for Egypt and Ms Nanu Adhikari, Youth Representative from  Nepal.
 The moderator for the panel was Dr. Pusadee Tamthai, Member of  Parliament,
Thailand.
The panel discussion marked the twentieth anniversary of the  Convention  on
the Rights of the Child (CRC).  The convention was  adopted  by  the  United
Nations in 1989 and came into force in 1990.  The convention  was  the  most
comprehensive legal instrument for the  protection  of  the  rights  of  the
child and was ratified more quickly and widely than any other  human  rights
instrument.  The panel discussed the convention’s impact  on  the  lives  of
children  in  the  20  years  since  its  adoption  and  the  critical  role
parliaments and their members can play through their  law-making,  budgeting
enforcement  and  representative  roles  in  order  to   ensure   the   full
implementation of the convention.

11. Panel discussion on Water: Protecting Our Oceans

A panel discussion on “Water: Protecting Our Oceans” was  held  on  Tuesday,
30 March. The panel examined the state of the world's oceans.  The  question
addressed was “Can parliaments  take  action  to  redress  pollution,  over-
fishing, piracy and degradation of  the  marine  environment”?    Ms  Shope-
Sithole and Ms Wenger attended the meeting.  The  panelists  were  Dr  Wendy
Watson-Wright,   Executive   Secretary,   Inter-governmental   Oceanographic
Commission and Assistant Director-General of UNESCO, Mr  Jerker  Tamelander,
Programme Manager, Oceans  and  Climate  Change,  Global  Marine  Programme,
International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature,  Dr  Cherdsak  Virapat,
Executive  Director,  International  Ocean  Institute  and  Professor  Mario
Ruivo, former  Vice-Chairman,  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,
UNESCO.   The  moderator  for  the  discussion  was  Dr  Perapun   Phalusuk,
Chairperson of the Working Group on Water, National Assembly of Thailand.
The panel discussion highlighted the following areas:

   i. Marine pollution – sewage, oils, man-made debris
  ii. Ecological balance – overfishing and destructive  fishing  practices,
      reduced biodiversity, transfer of alien species.
 iii. Habitat change  –  climate  change,  rising  sea  level  and  coastal
      flooding.
  iv. Maritime security – including non-traditional threats, trafficking in
      weapons, piracy and armed robbery.
   v. Ocean governance – the complex nature of  the  oceans  and  divergent
      sectoral interests demand coherent policies and measures that promote
      partnerships among stakeholders at international and national levels.

12. Open Information session on The role  of  parliamentarians  in  ensuring
   birth-registration for all

An open information session on “The role  of  parliamentarians  in  ensuring
birth-registration for all” was held on  Tuesday,  30  March.   The  session
took place during the session  of  the  Committee  to  Promote  Respect  for
International  Humanitarian  Law.    The   issue   of   birth   registration
specifically as it related to the protection of  asylum  seekers,  refugees,
stateless and internally displaced persons.

13. Interactive event on Making aid work: What every MP should know

The meeting was held on Wednesday, 31 March.  Ms Shope-Sithole,  Ms  Kohler-
Barnard and Ms Wenger attended the meeting.  The moderator for  the  session
was  Mr  Kagisa  Molatlhegi  (Botswana).   The  meeting  took  note  of  the
resolution adopted unanimously  by  the  118th  Assembly  in  Cape  Town  on
“Parliamentary oversight of state policies  on  foreign  aid”.   Since  2005
government  has  made  major  commitments  to  reform  official  development
assistance and make aid work with better  results  on  the  ground.   Within
this context the role of parliaments was also being redefined and there  was
now a renewed emphasis on the responsibilities of parliaments and a move  to
strengthen their capacity in this regard.

The IPU had entered into partnerships  with  leading  actors,  such  as  the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),  to  develop  the  capacity  of
members of parliament to  fulfill  their  roles.   The  interactive  meeting
provided an overview of some of this work.  It also aimed  to  give  members
of parliament an opportunity to  hear  concrete  examples  of  how  aid  had
worked in countries such as Zambia, Vietnam and Tanzania.  The meeting  also
looked at the need for  assessing  information,  connecting  to  people  and
building opportunities and tools for members of parliament to  work  on  aid
effectiveness.

14. Special IPU/International Federation of the Red Cross  (IFRC)  event  on
   Strengthening legal preparedness for international disaster cooperation

The meeting was held on Wednesday, 31 March.   Adv  Madasa  and  Ms  Kohler-
Barnard attended the meeting.  A presentation was made by Mr  David  Fisher,
Coordinator  of  the  International  Disaster  Response,  laws,  Rules   and
Principles Programme of the IFRC.

The meeting noted that recent events in Haiti and  Chile  had  reminded  the
world how devastating natural disasters could be for society.  Many  states,
however, had very few laws that enabled them to facilitate and  oversee  the
external assistance they may some day require.  Parliamentarians had  a  key
role to play in bringing these issues to the fore before  a  crisis  and  in
shaping legislation in this regard.

In 2007 those states aligned  to  the  1949  Geneva  Convention  unanimously
adopted the Guidelines  on  the  domestic  facilitation  and  regulation  of
international  disaster  relief  and  initial  recovery   assistance   (IDRL
Guidelines) at the 30th International Conference of the Red  Cross  and  Red
Crescent.  The meeting looked  at  the  IDRL  Guidelines  and  reviewed  the
progress made in using  the  guidelines  in  various  areas  of  the  world.
Participants also assessed the need to develop  model  legislation  to  help
countries internalise the IDRL Guidelines.

15. Meetings of the Governing Council

The Governing Council met on Sunday 28 March and  continued  on  Thursday  1
April.  Speaker Sisulu,  Adv  Madasa  and  Mr  Rametlakane  were  the  South
African representatives on the Governing Council.

The summary records of the 185th  session  of  the  Governing  Council  were
approved.  The  Secretary-General,  Mr  A  Johnsson,  delivered  the  annual
report on the activities of the IPU for 2009.

Requests for affiliation and reaffiliation

Requests for reaffiliation from the  Parliaments  of  Djibouti  and  Guinea-
Bissau were approved.  The request for affiliation from  the  Parliament  of
the Seychelles and the request for associate  membership  submitted  by  the
Transitional Arab Parliament were also approved.

Report on activities of the Executive Committee

The President of the IPU, Dr T Gurirab, reported  on  his  activities  since
the 185th session of the Governing Council and  on  the  activities  of  the
Executive Committee.  He highlighted the ongoing  work  in  preparation  for
the 3rd World Conference of Speakers of Parliament.  He also  indicated  the
efforts of the  IPU  to  ensure  that  the  people  of  Haiti  received  the
necessary international assistance after  the  earthquake  that  struck  the
country.  In addition, he expressed solidarity  with  the  people  of  Chile
after the earthquake that  struck  their  country.    Lastly,  he  expressed
dismay at recent developments in Niger.

Reports on recent IPU specialised conferences and meetings

The  meeting  considered  reports  of  recent  specialised  conferences  and
meetings,  including,  those  of  the  World  e-Parliament  conference,  the
Parliamentary meeting on the  occasion  of  United  Nations  Climate  Change
Conference held in Copenhagen and the Joint IPU-UN Parliamentary Hearing  at
the United Nations.

given.  The request for parliaments to hold activities which would mark  the
International Day of Democracy, celebrated annually  on  15  September,  was
highlighted.

Activities of committees and other bodies

The  Governing  Council  examined  the  reports  of  the  Meeting  of  Women
Parliamentarians, the Committee on the  Human  Rights  of  Parliamentarians,
the Committee on Middle  East  Questions,  the  Group  of  Facilitators  for
Cyprus, Committee to Promote Respect  for  International  Humanitarian  Law,
the Gender Partnership Group and the Advisory Group on HIV/Aids.

The Council also received a report on the second meeting of the  Preparatory
Committee  dealing  with  preparations  for  the  3rd  World  Conference  of
Speakers of Parliament.

16. 122nd Plenary Assembly

The inaugural ceremony of the  122nd  Assembly  was  held  on  Saturday,  27
March.  The Assembly was opened  in  the  presence  of  Her  Royal  Highness
Princess Maha Chakira Sirindhorn.

The Assembly met on Sunday, 28 March, Wednesday, 31 March  and  Thursday,  1
April.  Speaker Sisulu, Adv Madasa  and  Mr  Rametlakane  represented  South
Africa in the Assembly.

Mr Chai Chidchob, President  of  the  National  Assembly  of  Thailand,  was
elected as President of the 122nd Assembly by acclamation.

Introductory statements were made by Dr. Supachai  Panitchpakdi,  Secretary-
General of UNCTAD and  Mr  Michel  Sidibé,  Executive  Director  of  UNAIDS.
During the address a statement was delivered by Mr  Sidibé  on  restrictions
on entry, stay and residence that  52  countries  and  territories  enforced
based  only  on  positive  HIV  status.    He  commended  the   removal   of
restrictions on people living with HIV in the  majority  of  countries,  but
stated that 46 Countries have  criminal  laws  against  HIV  while  86  have
punitive laws. He emphasized the need for  HIV  to  be  de-criminalised  and
barriers removed.  Society should transform to accommodate people  with  HIV
and remove punitive laws.

General Debate on the political, economic and social situation in the  world
with  the  overall  theme  of  “Parliament  at  the   heart   of   political
reconciliation and good governance”

The Assembly proceeded to a general debate on the  political,  economic  and
social situation in the world with the overall theme of “Parliament  at  the
heart of political reconciliation and good governance”.

In his  address  Speaker  Sisulu  noted  that  parliament,  as  the  primary
institution responsible for the protection of human and civil rights, had  a
vital role to play in fostering national  reconciliation.   Recognition  and
respect for diversity while ensuring equal social  and  political  inclusion
in society  was  of  utmost  importance.   The  South  African  Constitution
provided the political and legal structure  that  guaranteed  and  protected
all human rights.  This was coupled with an understanding that adherence  to
human rights, respect for the rule of law and democracy were interwoven  and
reinforced one another.

Parliament as the national forum for consideration of public  issues  should
bear the responsibility of providing a platform for addressing concerns  and
issues of the public.   A strong civil society which functioned  in  support
of the democratic order could uphold democracy in  diverse  societies.   The
development of a democratic culture where the  rights  of  all  people  were
protected, discrimination eliminated and citizens actively  exercised  their
civil rights should be the medium through which the formation of a  national
identity  which  upheld  democratic  principles   and   human   rights   was
established.

He further emphasized that in addition to diversity along  racial,  cultural
and religious lines our societies today also continue to face challenges  in
terms of the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,  growing  poverty,  unemployment,  climate
change and gender equality.  In regard to gender equality in  particular  it
was noted that although the  South  African  Parliament  has  close  to  45%
representation of women, it  is  nevertheless  essential,  in  addressing  a
number of these issues, that  this  be  further  increased.   Socio-economic
factors, if not addressed, exacerbate tensions which in  turn  can  diminish
the  gains  made  in  achieving  social  cohesion,   good   governance   and
reconciliation.

He concluded by saying that ensuring  good  governance,  accountability  and
the fostering of  a  civic  identity,  especially  within  a  post  conflict
society such as South Africa’s, was an ideal for  which  the  South  African
parliament strove.

Special Session on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty Organisation

A special presentation on the nuclear security issue  was  received  by  the
Assembly.   Mr  Harry  Jenkins,  Speaker  of   the   Australian   House   of
Representatives, Mr Antonio Rodrigues, Ambassador  of  the  Phillipinnes  to
Thailand  and  Mr  Tibor  Tóth,  Executive  Secretary  of  the   Preparatory
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  Organisation  were
the invited speakers.  In his  presentation  Mr  Tóth  emphasised  that  the
Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban  Treaty  was  one  of  the  most   effective
measures that the international community could take to promote world  peace
and security.  Although the treaty was not the answer to  all  questions  it
was a necessary pillar of  a  comprehensive  nuclear  non-proliferation  and
disarmament  regime  that  was  needed  to  address   current   and   future
challenges.

Presentation  by  Secretary-General  of  Association  of  South  East  Asian
Nations (ASEAN)
The Assembly then proceeded to an address by Dr  Surin  Pitsuwan,  Secretary
General of ASEAN.  ASEAN started as a loose association of  five  countries,
but  by  2009  approximately  38  external   organizations   had   appointed
ambassadors to ASEAN.   ASEAN  pursued  economic  prosperity,  but  it  also
pursued the priorities of development and consolidation  of  democracy,  the
protection of human rights and the foundation  of  equitable  and  inclusive
societies.  ASEAN’s charter, drafted in 2007, and ratified  by  each  member
state was founded  on  three  pillars,  namely,  political  development  and
security, economic prosperity and identity.  It was ASEAN’s goal  to  become
a single market characterised by  open  regionalism  as  a  path  to  mutual
prosperity.

Follow-up session on Maternal Health and Child Survival

A “Follow-up session on Maternal Health and Child Survival” was  held.  Part
of the discussion focused on initiatives taken by members of  parliament  to
follow up on commitments  made  at  the  118th  Assembly  in  Cape  Town  on
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) related to  maternal  health  (MDG5)  and
child survival (MDG4). Special  attention  was  given  to  the  question  of
securing sufficient financing to achieve MDGs 4 and 5.

The event focused on what parliamentarians could do to promote  and  achieve
Millennium Development Goals 4 and  5:  reduction  of  child  mortality  and
improvement  of  maternal  health.   Dr  Flavia  Bustreo,  Director  of  the
Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child  Health  (PMNCH)  delivered  the
keynote address.   This  was  followed  by  presentations  on  the  national
experiences of Australia, Zambia and Thailand.

Emergency Item

The Assembly considered the following  requests  for  the  inclusion  of  an
emergency item in the agenda of the Assembly:

i.  The  role  of  parliaments  in  strengthening  the  solidarity  of   the
   international community towards the people of Haiti and Chile in the wake
   of devastating major  disasters,  and  urgent  actions  required  in  all
   disaster-prone countries to improve disaster-risk assessment,  prevention
   and mitigation (submitted  by  Cuba,  France,  Thailand,  Uganda,  United
   Kingdom and Uruguay).
ii.  Israeli  violations  of  the  religious  and  cultural  rights  of  the
   Palestinian people, in particular in and around Jerusalem,  rejection  of
   Israel’s announcement to include the  Haram  al-Ibrahimi  and  Bilal  Ibn
   Rabah Mosques, in addition to the walls of the old city of Jerusalem,  in
   its list of national heritage sites, and the need to reverse all  Israeli
   settlement activities,  particularly  in  East  Jerusalem  (submitted  by
   Palestine on behalf of the Arab Group and the Islamic Republic of Iran).

A roll call vote was conducted.  The proposal  submitted  by  Cuba,  France,
Thailand,  Uganda,  United  Kingdom  and  Uruguay  was  accepted  with   the
requisite two thirds majority.

Reports of Standing Committees and votes on draft resolutions

Ms K Ferrier (Netherlands) presented the resolution on  the  emergency  item
“The  role  of  parliaments  in  strengthening   the   solidarity   of   the

THE  ROLE  OF  PARLIAMENTS  IN   STRENGTHENING   THE   SOLIDARITY   OF   THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TOWARDS THE PEOPLE OF HAITI AND CHILE  IN  THE  WAKE
OF DEVASTATING MAJOR DISASTERS, AND URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED IN ALL DISASTER-
PRONE  COUNTRIES  TO  IMPROVE  DISASTER-RISK  ASSESSMENT,   PREVENTION   AND
MITIGATION
Resolution adopted unanimously by the 122nd IPU Assembly
(Bangkok, 1 April 2010)

The 122nd Inter-Parliamentary Assembly,
Acknowledging the growing evidence that both disasters  and  climate  change
hit poor  nations  and  communities  the  hardest,  and  that  disaster-risk
reduction for immediate  climate  change  adaptation  is  a  strategic  step
towards sustainable development,
Considering that in recent months  a  devastating  earthquake  hit  Port-au-
Prince, the capital of Haiti, and that  another  struck  off  the  coast  of
Chile, causing considerable damage to both countries,

Further  considering  that  more  than  200,000  lives  were  lost  in   the
earthquake in  Haiti,  which  caused  damage  and  losses  amounting  to  an
estimated US$ 7.8 billion (US$ 4.3 billion in physical damage  and  US$  3.5
billion in economic losses), or the equivalent of more than 120 per cent  of
Haiti’s gross domestic product (GDP) in  2009,and  that  the  earthquake  in
Chile caused damage and losses estimated at between US$ 15 and  30  billion,
or the equivalent of 15 per cent of Chile's GDP,
Considering that Haiti, the poorest nation in  the  western  hemisphere,  is
also facing severe problems  of  food  security  as  a  consequence  of  the
disaster,

Acknowledging that the growing frequency, intensity and impact of  disasters
pose a significant threat to people's lives  and  livelihoods,  and  to  the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),

Mindful of the  different  ways  such  disasters  can  affect  each  country
depending  on  its  vulnerabilities,  but   convinced   that   international
humanitarian action must reach all  those  who  have  been  affected,  while
taking account of local initiatives to provide relief,

Recognizing that the poor account for the majority of all people  killed  in
disasters, and that it is the combination of  hazards  such  as  floods  and
tropical storms, with an exposed, vulnerable and ill-prepared population  or
community, that causes disasters,
Stressing that the international community and governments urgently need  to
establish frameworks and measures to help  poor  countries  and  communities
adapt  to  climate  change  while  continuing  to  engage  in   debate   and
negotiation on climate change mitigation,

Recalling that the resolution on natural disasters  adopted  unanimously  by
the  112th IPU  Assembly  (Manila,  2005)  proposed  that  nations   further
strengthen   their   cooperation   in   disaster-prevention   efforts,   and
recognizing that  the  Hyogo  Framework  for  Action  2005-2015,  which  was
endorsed by 168 governments at the World Conference  on  Disaster  Reduction
in 2005,  lays  the  groundwork  for  the  implementation  of  disaster-risk
reduction and specifically identifies the need to  promote  the  integration
of risk reduction into  existing  climate  variability  and  future  climate
change strategies,
   1. Commends the efforts made by the national  authorities  of  Haiti  and
      Chile  to  cope  with  the  disasters,  welcomes  the  outpouring   of
      solidarity towards their  peoples  in  the  wake  of  the  devastating
      disaster, and requests governments to contribute  further  to  it  and
      promote continued mobilization of civil society  for  the  benefit  of
      those countries, taking account of the needs expressed by the  Chilean
      and Haitian authorities and, in  the  case  of  Haiti,  of  the  added
      complication  of  the  almost  total  destruction  of  the   country’s
      infrastructure;
   2. Reaffirms  the  need  for  the  disaster  assistance  currently  being
      received by the Haitian Government to be followed up with aid  for  as
      long as is necessary for the long-term reconstruction of  the  country
      and establishment of a self-sufficient State that is able  to  provide
      its people with better living conditions;
   3. Calls upon governments to take both urgent and structural measures  to
      make disaster-risk assessment  an  integral  part  of  post-earthquake
      recovery and reconstruction planning and  for  programmes  to  protect
      people from future disasters;
   4. Urges governments to assess all their critical public facilities, such
      as schools and hospitals, with a view  to  making  them  resilient  to
      earthquakes, floods and storms, and to make disaster-risk reduction  a
      part of poverty reduction and of all planning and programmes aimed  at
      achieving the MDGs and the ensuing long-term welfare of the people;
   5. Also urges governments to pay close attention  to  the  protection  of
      women and children in post-disaster situations, which can  leave  them
      particularly vulnerable to abuse, including trafficking;
   6. Also urges  governments  to  further  coordinate  their  international
      relief, reconstruction and recovery activities, among  themselves  and
      with humanitarian bodies, and  to  take  concrete  action  to  enhance
      people's understanding of  and  capacity  to  address  the  impact  of
      climate change and disaster-risk reduction through  public  awareness,
      education and training;
   7. Also urges all parliaments to foster the  strong  political  will  and
      allocate the budget funds needed to develop a national legal framework
      designed to ensure synergy between disaster-risk reduction and climate
      change adaptation, and between  disaster-risk  reduction  and  poverty
      reduction and socio-economic development, so as to  protect  the  best
      interests  of  those  vulnerable  to  geological  and  climate-related
      disasters.
                                                                  Annexure 2

COOPERATION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST  ORGANIZED
CRIME,  IN  PARTICULAR   DRUG   TRAFFICKING,   ILLEGAL   ARMS   TRAFFICKING,
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM
Resolution adopted by consensus* by the 122nd IPU Assembly
(Bangkok, 1 April 2010)

The 122nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,
Cognizant of  the  fact  that  while  globalization  fosters  many  positive
advancements, interdependence between States and the opening of borders,  it
also has a negative effect, that  of  facilitating  transnational  organized
crime,  in  particular   drug   trafficking,   illegal   arms   trafficking,
trafficking in persons, cross-border terrorism  and  money  laundering,  and
that  this  requires  the  implementation  of  relevant  international   and
domestic legal instruments,
Recalling that 2010 marks the tenth  anniversary  of  the  adoption  of  the
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and  of  its
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,  Especially
Women and Children,
Recalling United Nations General Assembly resolution 63/194  of  18 December
2008 (Improving the coordination of efforts against trafficking in  persons)
and Human Rights Council resolution 11/3 of 17  June  2009  (Trafficking  in
persons, especially women and children),
Also recalling the resolution of the 118th IPU Assembly (Cape  Town,  2008),
on The role of parliaments in striking a balance between national  security,
human security and individual  freedoms,  and  in  averting  the  threat  to
democracy,
Recalling the resolutions on combating terrorism adopted by the IPU  at  its
108th Conference (Santiago de Chile, 2003) and  its  111th  (Geneva,  2004),
115th (Geneva, 2006) and 116th (Bali, 2007) Assemblies,
Aware that drug trafficking is  one  of  the  principal  illicit  activities
worldwide, that it constitutes a serious threat  to  the  global  community,
and that, when compounded by drug abuse, it  is  not  only  harmful  to  the
stability and integrity of the world, but also adversely affects the  health
of human beings and the security of families,  communities  and  society  at
large, and hinders development plans and the achievement of  the  Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) in different countries,
Convinced  that  any  effort  to  effectively  combat  the  trafficking   of
agriculturally produced drugs must incorporate a reduction in the amount  of
land  cultivated  for  that  purpose,  and  that  this  goal   implies   the
implementation of incentive programmes for alternative crop cultivation,
Aware that trafficking in persons is a modern form of slavery  and  a  human
rights violation affecting men, women and children worldwide,  that  certain
practices,  negative  attitudes  and  maltreatment  of  trafficked   victims
persist and that the  well-being  of  these  vulnerable  groups  is  further
threatened by the global financial and economic downturn and  new  forms  of
transnational organized crime,
Recognizing that migrant smuggling is often facilitated by  organized  crime
networks,  generating  huge  profits  for  the  smugglers   while   exposing
irregular migrants to serious personal risks and making them  vulnerable  to
trafficking in persons,
Recognizing the nexus between drug trafficking, corruption and  other  forms
of organized crime, including trafficking in persons, trafficking  in  arms,
cybercrime, cross-border terrorism, money laundering and  the  financing  of
terrorism,
Considering that illegal  arms  trafficking  contributes  to  conflict,  the
displacement of persons, crime and  terrorism,  thereby  undermining  global
peace, safety and security,
Recalling that in its resolution  64/48  of  2  December  2009,  the  United
Nations General Assembly decided to convene an international  conference  on
the arms trade treaty in 2012 to elaborate a legally binding  instrument  on
the highest possible common international  standards  for  the  transfer  of
conventional arms,
Mindful  that  the  phenomenon  of  cross-border  terrorism   continues   to
represent a substantial threat to peace  and  security  in  the  world,  and
continues to endanger political institutions,  economic  stability  and  the
welfare of nations,
Recognizing  the  significant  challenges  faced  by  law  enforcement   and
judicial authorities in responding  to  the  ever  changing  means  used  by
transnational criminal organizations, including the increasing  use  of  the
Internet, global positioning system (GPS) techniques and other  geographical
information systems, to avoid detection and prosecution,
Appreciating the positive roles of the  IPU,  governments,  non-governmental
organizations  and  international  organizations  in   joint   parliamentary
activities  to  combat  transnational  organized  crime,  such  as  drafting
stringent legislative measures to combat  the  financing  of  terrorism  and
cross-border terrorism, and  implementing  the  parliamentary  measures  set
forth in the joint IPU-United Nations Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC)
publication,   Combating   Trafficking   in   Persons:   A   Handbook    for
Parliamentarians,

      cooperation to  combat  drug  trafficking.  within  the  framework  of
      international cooperation, with  international  legal  instruments  on
      drugs, and enhance the technical capability  of  law  enforcement  and
      judicial authorities;
   2. Reaffirms the  strong  determination  of  IPU  Member  Parliaments  to
      strengthen laws against corruption and transnational  organized  crime
      and calls upon States that have not yet done so to consider  ratifying
      or acceding to the United Nations Convention  against  Corruption  and
      the United Nations Convention against  Transnational  Organized  Crime
      and the Protocols thereto  as  a  matter  of  priority  and  to  fully
      implement their provisions;
   3. Also reaffirms its unwavering commitment to ensure that all aspects of
      laws on drugs and organized crime are  in  full  conformity  with  the
      purposes  and  principles  of  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations,
      international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
   4. Also reaffirms its  unwavering  commitment  to  intensify  efforts  to
      counter the illicit cultivation, production, manufacture, sale, abuse,
      transit,  trafficking  and  distribution   of   narcotic   drugs   and
      psychotropic  substances,   especially   heroin,   cocaine   and   its
      derivatives,  amphetamine-type  stimulants  (ATS),  the  diversion  of
      precursor  chemicals,   misuse   of   pharmaceutical   medicines   and

   7. Calls on countries where agriculturally produced drugs  are  made  and
      consumed to cooperate with  a  view  to  developing  and  implementing
      assistance programmes for the farmers concerned in order to  encourage
      them to turn to alternative crop cultivation  in  economically  viable
      conditions;
   8. Encourages parliaments to mainstream gender equality concerns  in  all
      legislation  and  oversight  practices  (including  the   formulation,

      trafficking and other forms of exploitation  and  include  prevention,
      protection and assistance measures;
  17.  Calls  on  IPU  Member  Parliaments  to  heighten  public  awareness,
      including through enhanced cooperation with civil society, to  promote
      cooperation in the fight against trafficking in persons, to tackle the
      root causes  of  the  problem  such  as  poverty,  gender  inequality,
      oppression, lack of human rights protection, and  lack  of  social  or
      economic opportunities, and to  enhance  awareness  by  the  competent
      authorities of the need to preserve the  human  rights  of  trafficked
      victims and their families, taking into account the special  needs  of
      women and children;
  18. Calls on parliaments to encourage governments  to  tighten  entry  and

      terrorism and of the individual right to privacy;
  23. Calls on IPU Member Parliaments to take into  account,  in  exercising
      their legislative and oversight functions,  the  fact  that  terrorism
      cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality  or
      ethnic group, and hence profiling based on any of these factors should
      not be used by national and transnational agencies in their efforts to
      combat terrorism;
  24. Invites IPU Member Parliaments to strengthen  their  respective  legal
      systems in  accordance  with  the  International  Convention  for  the

      the fight against organized crime, while, at the same time,  affirming
      that information shared in the course  of  these  cooperative  efforts
      should be used only for  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  originally
      provided and in the light of each country’s specificities;
  33. Invites  IPU  Member  Parliaments  from  donor  countries  to  promote
      development cooperation programmes aimed at upgrading criminal justice
      systems in countries vulnerable to organized crime;
  34. Also recommends that the fight against transnational  organized  crime
      be strengthened and intensified so  as  to  foster  lasting  solutions
      through the promotion of  human  rights  and  equitable  socioeconomic
      conditions;
  35. Invites parliamentarians to make use of  the  technical  services  and
      expertise provided by UNODC  in  specialized  workshops  and  training
      courses, and to call on the United Nations General Assembly  in  cases
      related to crime prevention, international drug control and the  fight
      against terrorism.

THE  ROLE  OF  PARLIAMENTS  IN   DEVELOPING   SOUTH-SOUTH   AND   TRIANGULAR
COOPERATION WITH A  VIEW  TO  ACCELERATING  ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  MILLENNIUM
DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Resolution adopted by consensus* by the 122nd IPU Assembly
(Bangkok, 1 April 2010)

The 122nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,
Deeply concerned about the adverse impact of the international economic  and
financial crisis on the most vulnerable nations and sectors  of  the  global
community and on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  (MDGs)
in 2015,
Bearing in mind that the current  financial  and  economic  crisis  has  its
origins in developed countries, and that  a  broad  international  dialogue,
conducted under United Nations auspices with  the  active  participation  of
all countries, is required to lead the world on the  path  of  economic  and
social recovery,
Concerned that, according to the forecasts  of  the  International  Monetary
Fund,  the  World  Bank  and  regional  development  banks,  foreign  direct
investment  in  and  remittances  to  developing  countries,  especially  in
Africa, will have declined dramatically in 2009-2010,
Underscoring  the  importance  of  increased  financing   for   development,
including the need to meet the long-standing  target  of  0.7  per  cent  of
gross national product (GNP) for official development  assistance  (ODA)  to
developing  countries,  of  wider  and  deeper  debt  relief  to  developing
countries,  and  of  ongoing  efforts  aimed  at   identifying   additional,
innovative sources of financing for South-South and triangular cooperation,
Noting  that,  although  ODA  from  OECD-DAC  countries  (Organisation   for
Economic  Development  and  Co-operation-Development  Assistance  Committee)
rose by 10 per cent in real terms in 2008 (after an 8.5 per cent decline  in
2007), it probably declined again in 2009, owing to the economic crisis,
Recalling that MDG 8 (Develop a global partnership  for  development)  calls
for an open, non-discriminatory trading and financial system  that  includes
a commitment to good governance, development  and  poverty  reduction,  both
nationally and internationally,
Noting that, according to the UN Secretary-General, important  progress  has
been made towards all eight MDGs, but the world community is  not  on  track
to fulfill its commitments, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
Recalling  UN  General  Assembly  resolution  58/220  of  23  December  2003
(Economic and technical cooperation  between  developing  countries),  which
proclaims 19 December United Nations Day for South-South Cooperation,
Taking note of the Ministerial  Declaration  adopted  by  the  Ministers  of
Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their Twenty-seventh  Annual  Meeting,
held in New York on 25 September 2003, in which they once again  underscored
the importance and increased relevance of South-South cooperation,
Noting the G20 Summit held on 2 April 2009 in London and its willingness  to
boost the global economy, in particular by  disbursing  US$  50  billion  to
developing countries to counteract the economic and social  effects  of  the
crisis and thereby strengthen human development in those countries,
Recalling the relevant IPU resolutions, in particular those adopted  at  the
92nd Inter-Parliamentary  Conference (Copenhagen, 1994) on International co-
operation and national action to support  social  and  economic  development
and efforts to  combat  poverty,  the  104th Inter-Parliamentary  Conference
(Jakarta, 2000) on Financing for development and a new paradigm of  economic
and social development  designed  to  eradicate  poverty,  the  107th Inter-
Parliamentary Conference (Marrakech, 2002) on The  role  of  parliaments  in
developing  public  policy  in  an  era   of   globalisation,   multilateral
institutions and international trade  agreements,  the  112th  IPU  Assembly
(Manila, 2005)  on  The  role  of  parliaments  in  establishing  innovative
international financing and trading mechanisms to  address  the  problem  of
debt and achieve the Millennium Development Goals,  the  115th IPU  Assembly
(Geneva, 2006) on The role of parliaments in overseeing the  achievement  of
the Millennium Development Goals, in particular with regard to  the  problem
of debt and  the  eradication  of  poverty  and  corruption,  the  118th IPU
Assembly (Cape Town, 2008) on Parliamentary oversight of State  policies  on
foreign aid and the 120th IPU Assembly (Addis Ababa, 2009) on  The  role  of
parliaments  in  mitigating  the  social  and  political   impact   of   the
international economic and financial crisis on the most  vulnerable  sectors
of the global community, especially in Africa,
Deeply concerned that climate change  poses  risks  that  may  unravel  many
advances in reducing poverty, compounding the negative consequences  of  the
economic crisis,
Welcoming the outcome  document  of  the  Eleventh  session  of  the  United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD XI), which  salutes  the
important role of parliaments in international development cooperation,
Recalling the reports of the UN  Secretary-General  entitled  The  state  of
South-South cooperation (23 August 2007 and 24 August 2009)and Promotion  of
South-South cooperation  for  development:  a  thirty-year  perspective  (27
October 2009),
Considering that the outcome  document  of  the  High-Level  United  Nations
Conference  on  South-South-Cooperation,  held  in   Nairobi   from   1   to
3 December 2009, fails to mention the positive  role  that  parliaments  can
and should  play  to  develop  South-South  cooperation  and  make  it  more
efficient,
Underscoring  that  in  a  globalized  world,  South-South  and   triangular
cooperation are more important than ever to achieve sustainable  development
in developing countries, given that economic  development,  social  progress
and environmental protection are  interdependent  and  mutually  reinforcing
goals,
Recalling that the South has a number of  success  stories,  best  practices
and lessons learned in addressing  major  development  challenges,  such  as
microfinance, which have brought about a  profound  societal  transformation
in many countries, such as Bangladesh,
Aware that South-South cooperation has a  long  history  (the  UNDP  Special
Unit for South-South Cooperation was established in the late 1970s)  and  an
essential role to play in developing countries,
Convinced that organizations within the UN system, due  to  their  universal
membership,  neutrality  and  political  independence,  represent  essential
vehicles to catalyse, support and strengthen South-South cooperation,
Recalling that financing for development, as  set  forth  in  the  Monterrey
Consensus, is about tapping all available resources,  not  only  development
assistance and debt relief, but  also  financing  from  domestic  resources,
fair trade, foreign  investment  and  remittances,  all  of  which  are  all
complementary,
Noting the growing volume of  ODA  flows  from  southern  contributors,  and
observing a lack  of  accessible  and  comprehensive  information  on  these
flows,
Considering that there  is  a  need  for  standards,  rules  and  regulatory
frameworks that are able to enhance South-South cooperation, as well as  for
methodologies for gathering information on South-South flows  of  assistance
and other forms of cooperation,
Noting that the private sector, civil society  actors  and  individuals  are
assuming a new and dynamic role in South-South cooperation,
Underscoring that achieving the  internationally  agreed  development  goals
will not be  possible  without  progress  on  gender  equality  and  women's
empowerment,
Emphasizing that women are active and  successful  in  building  South-South
non-governmental networks for improving their status  and  addressing  major
economic, social, environmental and political concerns,
Noting  that  the  agenda   for   South-South   cooperation   has   expanded
significantly to include not only economic and  technical  cooperation,  but
also good governance, health and disease control, environmental  issues  and
transnational security threats,
Also noting that capacity-building programmes in  the  framework  of  South-
South cooperation have made a significant contribution  to  the  achievement
of the MDGs,
Strongly concerned that some donor countries  tend  to  make  light  of  the
weakness of democratic governance  in  beneficiary  countries  in  order  to
acquire their natural resources,
Noting  that  OECD  donor  countries  have  partnered   with   middle-income
developing  countries  to  provide  development  assistance  to  the   least
developed countries,
Considering   that   the   rationale   underlying   triangular   development
cooperation  is  that  southern  countries,  which  are   still   themselves
developing, are better placed and have the relevant  experience  to  respond
to the needs and problems of other developing countries,
Underscoring that triangular development cooperation programmes can be  more
cost effective,
Considering that regional integration is  an  essential  process  which  can
overcome,  by  common  accord,  political,  physical,  economic  and  social
barriers  that  divide  countries   from   their   neighbours   and   foster
collaboration leading to economic growth, expansion of  regional  trade  and
investment, management  of  shared  resources,  regional  public  goods  and
climate change, and the prevention of disasters,
Stressing in this respect that regional and subregional  organizations  play
a prominent role in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding  and
are important partners of the  United  Nations  in  promoting  international
peace and security,
Also stressing that  South-South  cooperation  and  integration  are  highly
complementary to North-South cooperation, along  with  regional  integration
among developing countries,
Considering that regional  initiatives  such  as  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the New  Asian-African  Strategic  Partnership
(NAASP) and the Pacific Plan may further enhance regional  cooperation  with
a view to meeting  development,  democracy,  good  governance  and  security
challenges,
Aware that no single model of regional integration can be imposed since  all
integration strategies have  to  be  adapted  to  particular  interests  and
circumstances, but that  general  features  can  nonetheless  be  identified
which impede or foster integration processes,
   1. Calls on Northern and Southern parliaments and governments to  support
      and develop South-South and triangular  cooperation  as  an  important
      tool to achieve the MDGs;
   2. Invites Southern and Northern parliaments  and  governments  to  align
      their South-South cooperation agenda with the MDGs;
   3. Urges Southern parliaments and governments to see to it that the funds
      allocated to MDG-related programmes and sectors are  effectively  used
      for these programmes;
   4. Invites Southern parliaments and governments to implement the  results
      of the successive South summits;
   5. Also invites Southern parliaments and governments to take  legislative
      or other initiatives in support  of  South-South  cooperation  efforts
      that foster achievement of the MDGs;
   6. Recommends that donor parliaments  and  governments,  in  addition  to
      traditional bilateral and multilateral aid flows,  contribute  to  the
      United Nations Fund for South-South Cooperation to  ensure  sufficient
      funding for South-South projects and initiatives;
   7. Urges parliaments to ask their governments to ensure  that  future  UN
      documents on South-South cooperation make due mention of the important
      role  that  parliaments  have  to  play   in   fostering   South-South
      cooperation and making it more efficient;
   8. Calls on the United Nations, working with other  global  institutions,
      to establish an effective mechanism to monitor, discuss  and  evaluate
      the progress and delivery of the commitments made by the international
      community in support of South-South  and  triangular  cooperation  for
      development, while ensuring they are oriented  towards  achieving  the
      MDGs;
   9. Invites the UN and its specialized agencies, such as UNDP and  UNCTAD,
      to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of South-South cooperation
      by better coordinating  and  streamlining  the  various  institutions,
      initiatives and guidelines dealing with it, especially within  the  UN
      system;
  10.  Invites  Northern  parliaments  and  governments  to  ensure  that  a
      substantial part of development assistance serves  to  promote  South-
      South and triangular cooperation;
  11. Recommends that Northern  parliaments  require  their  governments  to
      allocate a substantial part of their  ODA  to  triangular  cooperation
      mechanisms which, besides being more cost effective, allow  successful
      Southern  donor  countries  to  share  their  experiences   and   best
      practices;
  12. Urges Southern donor  parliaments  and  governments  to  develop  good
      practices concerning South-South  ODA  and  cooperation,  taking  into
      consideration,  among   others,   the   Paris   Declaration   on   Aid
      Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action;
  13. Invites Southern donor governments to renounce tied aid in  favour  of
      other forms of support that fully take into account the needs  of  the
      recipient countries and are in line with  their  national  development
      strategies;
  14. Also invites donor and beneficiary country parliaments and governments
      to put in place consistent and transparent accounting of  both  North-
      South and South-South ODA flows, and of other  forms  of  cooperation,
      including in-kind  contributions  and  shared  natural  and  knowledge
      resources;
  15. Recommends that Northern and Southern parliaments  increase  oversight
      of their South-South and triangular cooperation activities;
  16. Requests Southern parliaments  to  strengthen  mechanisms  to  oversee
      government implementation of  development  plans  and  programmes  and
      regional and subregional agreements that  focus  specifically  on  the
      MDGs;
  17. Invites Southern parliaments and governments  to  analyse  how  South-
      South approaches can be applied to development issues and how policies
      and  projects  that  have  succeeded  in  reducing  poverty  in   some
      developing countries  could  be  replicated  elsewhere  to  accelerate
      achievement of the MDGs;
  18. Also invites Southern parliaments and governments to conclude the  São
      Paulo round of negotiations of the Global System of Trade  Preferences
      among Developing Countries (GSTP), which has the potential to generate
      significant additional trade flows;
  19. Calls on Northern and Southern countries that are  in  a  position  to
      comply to give duty-free and quota-free market access to  all  exports
      from the least developed countries, including the 3 per cent of tariff
      lines that are currently covered by the tariff  line  exclusion  (with
      the exception of arms);
  20. Invites Southern parliaments and governments to improve the  platforms
      for  exchanging  views  among  developing  countries  on   South-South
      cooperation, flows  of  trade  and  direct  investments  in  order  to
      coordinate their actions in these areas;
  21. Encourages Northern parliaments and governments to make Aid for  Trade
      available for enhancing South-South cooperation;
  22. Invites Northern parliaments to encourage their  governments  to  urge
      multilateral institutions, such as the Bretton Woods institutions  and
      regional development banks, to develop and foster  the  implementation
      of programmes that promote trade and investment between  countries  of
      the South;
  23. Encourages Southern parliaments and governments  to  actively  promote
      South-South investment and technology transfers by ensuring  a  secure
      and stable investment environment, thereby reducing transactions costs
      and enhancing legal security;
  24. Invites parliaments to actively support  South-South  non-governmental
      networks created by women for improving their  status  and  addressing
      major economic, social, environmental and political concerns;
  25. Calls on both Northern and  Southern  parliaments  to  step  up  their
      support for the parliamentary structures of regional organizations  in
      order to consolidate the regional integration and cooperation required
      to achieve the MDGs;
  26. Invites parliaments and governments to recapitalize Southern  regional
      development banks in order  to  help  establish  or  develop  regional
      development funds;
  27. Also invites Southern parliaments and governments  to  develop  South-
      South regional cooperation in order to manage regional  public  goods,
      including water resources,  ecological  assets  such  as  cross-border
      forest basins or natural reserves and cross-border  energy  resources,
      and control disease more efficiently,
  28. Encourages Southern regional and national parliaments  to  hold  their
      governments to account for their efforts to achieve the  MDGs  through
      South-South cooperation mechanisms and  requests  that  the  oversight
      capacity of these parliaments be strengthened in this respect;
  29. Also encourages regional and subregional parliaments  to  promote  and
      immediately initiate an exchange of information and best practices  on
      South-South and triangular cooperation strategies and initiatives, and
      also invites governments to facilitate such exchanges  in  cooperation
      with national parliaments and the UN system;
  30. Urges Northern donor parliaments  to  ensure  that  their  governments
      honour  ODA  commitments,  despite  the  economic  crisis,  given  the
      importance of predictable aid flows for the realization of South-South
      and triangular cooperation;
  31. Urges parliaments to oversee implementation of the present  resolution
      and government action to implement the recommendations of  the  United

YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
Resolution adopted by consensus* by the 122nd IPU Assembly
(Bangkok, 1 April 2010)

The 122nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,
Emphasizing the need to prevent and counter  all  forms  of  discrimination,
including discrimination based on age, in accordance with the  principle  of
non-discrimination enshrined in the Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights
(1948),
Noting the UN World Youth Reports 2003, 2005 and 2007,
Also noting  UN  General  Assembly  resolutions  60/2  of  6  December  2005
(Policies and programmes  involving  youth),  62/126  of  18  December  2007
(Policies and programmes involving youth: youth  in  the  global  economy  -
promoting youth  participation  in  social  and  economic  development)  and
64/134 of 18 December 2009 (Proclamation of 2010 as the  International  Year
of Youth: Dialogue and Mutual Understanding),
Recognizing that children and young people are capable of forming their  own
views and should be assured the right to express those views freely  in  all
matters affecting them, the views being given due weight in accordance  with
their age and maturity, as set forth in Article 12 of the Convention on  the
Rights of the Child (1989),
Also recognizing that implementation of the UN  World  Programme  of  Action
for Youth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  requires  the
full  and  effective   participation   of   young   people   and   youth-led
organizations,
Declaring that achieving meaningful democracy requires the full  and  active
participation  of  young  people  and  youth  organizations  in   democratic
processes at the local, national, regional and international levels,
Stressing the importance  of  enhancing  young  people’s  awareness  of  and
commitment to human rights and democracy,  the  promotion  of  intercultural
dialogue and understanding in a spirit that is respectful of diversity,  and
the struggle against all forms of discrimination and all  actions  aimed  at
undermining democracy; and considering  the  importance  of  young  people’s
contribution to social  cohesion,  especially  their  activities  to  combat
exclusion and prevent the ills affecting them in particular,
Bearing in mind that youth participation promotes active citizenship,  which
should be considered as an opportunity for enhancing democracy  and  placing
new issues on the political agenda,
Recognizing the positive impact  that  youth  participation  in  the  local,
regional and global economy and in social and economic development can  have
on the eradication of poverty  and  hunger,  and  on  socially  unacceptable
and/or deviant behavior,
Also recognizing that while youth today are better placed than  ever  before
to participate in and benefit from global  development,  many  young  people
remain marginalized, disconnected or excluded from  the  opportunities  that
globalization offers,
Underscoring that the involvement of young people in public  decision-making
processes offers important opportunities  for  civic  engagement,  education
and learning about government,  thus  strengthening  young  people’s  social
responsibility and developing their  communication  capacities,  negotiating
skills and ability to resolve conflicts through peaceful means and  critical
thinking,
Aiming to maximize young people’s contribution to the building  of  society,
especially in all areas which concern them, to encourage new forms of  youth
participation  and  organization,  and  to  train  young  people  to  assume
responsibilities,
Reiterating the critical  role  of  both  formal  education  and  non-formal
learning in the empowerment of young people for democratic citizenship,  and
recognizing the importance of informal learning,
Highlighting the importance of creating the conditions for genuine  dialogue
and partnership between young people and local and national authorities,
Recognizing youth parliaments, national and local youth councils,  or  their
equivalent bodies as  effective  channels  of  cooperation  and  information
exchange between young  people,  parliaments,  national  governments,  local
councils and other decision-making bodies,
Mindful of the importance of solidarity and dialogue between generations,
Deeply concerned by young people’s dwindling interest  in  formal  political
activity, including voting and party  membership,  and  disenchantment  with
politicians and political parties, which is a real threat to the  future  of
participatory democracy,
Recognizing  that  young  people   care   deeply   about   their   political
communities,  and  in  many  cases  are  active  participants  in   informal
political activities, such as online activism, boycotts/buycotts and  third-
sector initiatives,
Taking into consideration the needs and aspirations of internally  displaced
young people and disabled young people,
   1. Calls on all States to take appropriate steps, in accordance with  the
      UN World Programme of  Action  for  Youth,  to  develop  holistic  and
      integrated  national  youth  policies  in  consultation   with   youth
      organizations;
   2. Invites parliaments  to  set  up,  if  they  have  not  yet  done  so,
      specialized  bodies  entrusted  with  mainstreaming  youth  issues  in
      parliament’s work;
   3. Urges parliaments to  monitor  the  fulfillment  of  their  respective
      government's obligations under the Convention on  the  Rights  of  the
      Child to ensure respect for children's right to be heard  and  express
      their views freely without any form of discrimination;
   4. Requests parliaments  to  create  the  necessary  platform  for  youth
      participation in the democratic process by providing a basic level  of
      education that is equal for everyone, with the same opportunities  for
      boys and girls;
   5. Invites States, parliaments, parliamentarians, political parties,  the
      IPU and youth  organizations  to  encourage,  promote  and  make  more
      visible in all fields the initiative,  enterprise  and  creativity  of
      young people;
   6.  Calls  on  the  IPU,   parliaments,   States   and   non-governmental
      organizations to scale up investments in youth and encourage youth-led
      contributions to parliamentary democracy through  strong  partnerships
      and financial support, and by keeping youth participation high on  the
      political agenda;
   7. Also calls on the IPU,  parliaments,  youth  organizations  and  other
      relevant  stakeholders  to  strengthen  efforts  aimed  at   achieving
      appropriate representation and participation  of  youth  in  decision-
      making bodies, bearing in mind that girls, boys, young women and young
      men are all entitled to the same rights;
   8. Invites States and parliaments, as part of efforts  to  promote  youth

      other relevant UN meetings;
   9. Invites the IPU, parliaments and  States  to  identify  the  lines  of
      action for youth participation on which they intend to concentrate, to
      define concrete measures and/or action plans for their implementation,
      to promote these plans with  regional  and  local  authorities,  youth
      organizations and young people, and to cooperate closely with regional
      and  local  authorities  in  order  to  ensure  the  fullest  possible
      implementation;
  10. Calls on parliaments to ensure that young people with disabilities and
      those who are socially and economically underprivileged  are  afforded
      equal opportunities to participate fully in society;
  11. Encourages the IPU and parliaments to develop tools to  promote  youth
      knowledge of and participation in the democratic  process,  including,
      but  not  limited  to,  guidelines  for  participatory  mechanisms  or
      interactive policy-making forums;
  12. Calls on parliaments to promote youth awareness of  and  participation
      in the political process by using modern information and communication
      technologies (ICTs) to reach out to young people and  increase  access
      to information on the democratic process;
  13. Calls on parliaments  to  develop  practical  measures  (such  as  the
      possible introduction of quotas for  young  people)  to  increase  the

      bodies,  while  respecting  the  values  of  human  dignity,  freedom,
      democracy and equality;

      greater participation by youth in parliaments;
  15. Urges States, parliaments, parliamentarians,  political  parties,  the
      IPU and youth organizations to promote greater participation by  girls
      and young women by taking measures aimed at promoting role models  and
      facilitating better reconciliation of work and family life;

  21. Invites  States  to  promote  student  participation,  initiative  and

      especially political participation;
  25. Encourages States to introduce gender-sensitive  compulsory  education
      for young men and young women in order to nurture their  awareness  of

      use ICTs appropriately, while also promoting the involvement of  young
      people in public debates and the development of policy  through  ICTs,

      youth information strategies which, in a youth-friendly  way,  address

      young people in issues that affect them through consultation processes
      when drafting laws and during parliamentary hearings, to  ensure  that

      allocation, and parliament’s efforts to hold government to account;

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Joint Oversight Report of the Portfolio Committees on Tourism and
   Home Affairs to Cape Town International Airport on the state of readiness
   for 2010 FIFA World Cup, dated 1 June 2010

The Portfolio Committees on Tourism and Home Affairs, having undertaken  the
second phase of  the  joint  oversight  visit  to  Cape  Town  International
Airport, on 2 February 2010, reports as follows:

1. Introduction and welcome

Mr Ricardo  Abrams,  Director:  Department  of  Home  Affairs  welcomed  the
committees and provided an overview of the programme for that  day.  It  was
suggested and agreed that the  committees  undertake  a  walk-about  at  the
airport before the presentations. Because the delegation was  huge,  it  was
split into two groups. Group one was led by the Chairperson of Home  Affairs
(Hon Martins), and Group two was led by  the  Chairperson  of  Tourism  (Hon
Gumede).

2. Objectives

The purpose of the visit was to check the state of  readiness  of  the  Cape
Town International Airport in  terms  of  processing  visitors  expected  to
arrive in South Africa between 11 June and 11 July 2010 for the  FIFA  World
Cup. The committees, to undertake oversight, to:
     • Ensure that tourism challenges are addressed.
     • Check on the immigration infrastructure and state of preparedness of
       the Department of Home Affairs.
     • Focus on the challenges faced  by  tourism  and  the  way  in  which
       services to tourism can be improved  at  the  customs  and  passport
       control centre at the Cape Town International Airport.

3. Composition of the delegation

The delegation comprised the following Members of Parliament (MPs):

4. Walk-about
During the walk-about, one of the  immediate  challenges  observed  was  the
limited signage for travellers. The  central  departure  centre  caters  for
both the domestic and international departures. The layout  at  the  central
departure centre is such that all the retail shops and South African  Police
(SAPS) are on the 3rd Floor. The  security  check  points  are  centralised.
There is a centralised emergency centre which is coordinated by  police  and
the airlines. Decisions taken are shared with other airports throughout  the
country.

The partition between the domestic and international departures is  movable.
Depending on the volume  of  travellers,  the  partition  can  be  moved  to
accommodate the volume of travellers. The processing time  is  approximately
30 minutes. The building  was  commissioned  on  7  November  2009  and  can
process 3,500 travellers per hour. The evacuation time is  20  minutes.  The
airport had conducted a dry run.

The departure counters at the immigration centre have been repositioned.

5. Background on Cape Town International Airport

Cape Town International Airport is the  2nd  biggest  and  busiest  with  an
average of 5 000 in/out  bound  passengers  per  day.  Traffic  through  the
airport reflects over 60 000 aircraft ferrying over 6.7  million  passengers
in 2005. By 2015, 14 million passengers are expected to  pass  through  Cape
Town International Airport.

The airport was named Africa’s leading airport in  the  2008  World  Airport
Awards, with OR Tambo International second, and Durban International  third.


5.1 International Departures Terminal

A R120 million international departure terminal, opened in 2003, is  capable
of processing up to 1 300 passengers in peak hours, or a million  passengers
a year – three times the capacity of the old terminal. It has a  total  area
of 21 000 square metres, including 2 360 metres of retail space.

5.2 International Arrival Terminal

A new international arrivals terminal, opened in 2001, has the  capacity  to
process 950 arriving passengers per hour.  It  is  well  lit  and  spacious,
providing convenient, efficient service to international passengers.

5.3 Central Terminal Building Expansion

The  construction  commenced  in  August  2006.  The  new  central  terminal
building expansion was due to be complete and open  in  November  2009.  The
new multi-storey parkade is located near  the  international  terminal.  The
massive road network upgrade is expected to be completed in March  2010.  On
completion, the total terminal will cover 110, 000 square metres and with  a
total project value at R1, 5 billion.

6. Presentation by the Department of Home Affairs

The new organisational structure of  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  was
approved  in  2008.  There  were  56  immigrations   officers,   two   chief
immigration officers and two assistant directors  were  recruited  in  2008.
The approved posts are 142 and only 75 have been filled.  The  vacancy  rate
is high  because  some  officials  have  resigned  or  were  promoted.   Two
immigration officers were dismissed for  fraud,  with  regards  to  amending
sick  leave  periods  and  unauthorized  leave.  There  are   presently   no
corruption cases at the airport with  regards  to  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs.

The passenger flow figures  during  2009  is  505  704  arrivals  for  South
Africans, 500 800 departures for South Africans and  217  292  arrivals  for
foreigners  and  214  551  departures   for   foreigners.   There   are   14
international  departure  workstations   and   18   international   arrivals
workstations.

The airport has a dedicated State Protocol Lounge for the  duration  of  the
2010 FIFA World Cup event. There is also  a  Commercially  Important  Person
(CIP) lounge for the clearance  of  the  teams.  Counters  16-18  have  been
dedicated to the FIFA accredited members.

The  implementation  of  the  Advanced  Passenger  Processing  (APP)  system
started on 31 of August and 9 airlines have started using  it.  APP  enables
the Department of Home Affairs  (DHA)  to  process  travellers  before  they
board flights to South Africa, identify inadmissible travellers  and  advise
airlines on appropriate intervention. In cooperation with the airlines,  DHA
will reduce administrative overheads associated with the imposing  of  fines
on airlines.

Current challenges:

    • Movement Control System (MCS) Transit Pax functionality.
    • Fraudulent documents.
    • There is no Inspectorate presence at the airport.

7. Presentation by Airport Company of South Africa (ACSA)
The construction of the New Central Terminal Building  commenced  in  August
2006. The project is valued at R1, 5 billion. In the  domestic  wing,  there
are 120 check-in desks and 10 CUSS machines. There are also 6  new  arrivals
carousels and 11 security  screening  points,  in  addition  to  8  new  air
bridges and bussing gates.

Departures would take  place  on  the  upper  level  from  Central  Terminal
Building and arrivals will take place  on  the  ground  level.  There  is  a
domestic air bridge for the first time.

7.1 Anticipated Challenges

    • Limited information available.
    • Continuous peak operations on match days.
    • General aviation volumes unknown.
    • Insufficient parking for aircrafts.
    • Land/air interface management.

7.2 Special 2010 Initiatives

    • Additional temporary aircraft parking stand will be created.
    • Additional temporary bus holding facilities will be created.
    • Temporary staff facilities.
    • Volunteer programmes with the City of Cape Town.

8. Presentation by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA)

The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) indicated in their presentation  that
they do not have information  on  possible  disruptions  linked  to  foreign
terror. All people assisting in the 2010 FIFA World  Cup  have  been  vetted
and only two have been denied.

Challenges that NIA would anticipate included the following:

    • Corruption and documents integrity.
    • Security in all areas required constant focus.
    • Insufficient airside and cargo space.
    • Possible targeting of customs and immigration officials by syndicates.
    • Labour issues.
    • Loitering and passengers targeting by criminals.

9. Presentation by South African Police Service (SAPS)

The submission of the South African Police  Service  indicates  the  service
working towards the creation of a safe and secure environment through:

    •  Implementing  uncompromising  security  measures  and  limiting   the
      probability of critical incidents occurring, and if they do,
    • Limiting the impact of such incidents through contingency planning  by
      a multi-agency integrated approach by all relevant role players.

9.1 Command and Control

The input indicates that the Venue Operational Centre (VOC)  will  be  fully
operational on a 24-hour basis at Cape Town International Airport  and  will
be the centre of command at the  airport.  The  activity  will  address  the
execution of the arrival and departures of spectators,  VIPs,  VVIPs,  teams
and travellers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

9.2 Members of the SAPS will be deployed at the following areas

The South African Police Service will be deployed in areas such as:

     • Land side bus for team/members of protocol transport.
     • Immigration Area: International Arrivals and Departures.
     • Customs Area: International Arrivals; Aircraft: baggage.
     • Aircraft: Passengers; Routes to and from the airport.
     • Cargo: International Departures Control.
     • Passport Control Centre.
     • South African Police Service (SAPS) Camera/Observation Rooms.

The plan is to ensure the safety and sterility  of  the  zones,  with  other
role players.

10. Presentation by Department of Agriculture

A new dog unit has been operating at the airport since  December  2008.  The
dog unit currently uses two sniffer  dogs  and  during  the  World  Cup,  an
additional two sniffer dogs are expected to assist. The dog  unit  officials
are mainly used doing primary inspections with the help of sniffer  dogs  at
the baggage carousel.
The Department has 14 staff and is in need of 17 staff for the World Cup.

Challenges:

The following challenges were noted:

     • Communication breakdown between passengers and stakeholders.
     • Safety.
     • Office space.

11. Committees’ Observations

    • The improvement of operational efficiencies at key ports of  entry  is
      critical for the hosting of a successful  2010  FIFA  World  Cup.  The
      intended adherence to the target of 1.5 to 2 minutes  processing  time
      per traveller is not as yet realised.
    • Proposals for amendments to the current operational practices approved
      in March 2008.  This included a new  shift  roster  system  and  other
      structural adjustments to operations.  These must be speeded up as the
      improvements would impact on air, sea, and  land  ports  of  entry  in
      preparation for 2010.
    • The Law Enforcement Strategy needs to be  synergised  and  provides  a
      foundation for the implementation. The committees  observed  that  the
      design  in  the  immigration  centre  makes  it  difficult,   if   not
      impossible, for immigration officers to  profile  passengers  as  they
      come in.
    •  Staff  shortages  and  the  inability  to  fill  posts  due  to   the
      restructuring process: The inability to appoint  officials  in  acting
      posts  hampers  service  delivery.  The  Department  of  Home  Affairs
      admitted that the recruitment process is slow and  impacts  negatively
      on service delivery.
    • It has also been noted that the tourism  signage  was  virtually  non-
      existent in the transit area for transit  passengers.  This  would  be
      important to build the travel trades knowledge of South  Africa  as  a
      leisure destination.
    • The committees also observed that there was no information desk at the
      international arrivals to assist tourists. For some of  the  tourists,
      this could be their first visit to South  Africa.  Effective  guidance
      was necessary to highlight the country as a leisure  destination  with
      an array of activities.  The  first  impression  the  country  created
      should last longer.
    •  The  committees  noted  that  the  non-existent  of  Southern  Africa
      Development Community (SADC) counter at the international arrivals  is
      a concern. While it is argued that marketing efforts should  focus  on
      the African markets,  the  importance  of  domestic  markets  must  be
      regarded as an anchor to the sustainable tourism development  strategy
      for South Africa.
    • The committees were concerned that the State Protocol Lounge  may  not
      be able to accommodate high volumes of VIPs.
    •  Committees  observed  the  non-availability  of  billboards  at   the
      international arrival and departure to  leverage  brand  awareness  of
      South Africa.

12. Recommendations

The committees recommend that:

    • The Department of Home Affairs fills posts that are vacant.
    •  The  Department  of  Tourism  should  be  included  in   the   Border
      Coordinating Committee (BCOCC).
    • All stakeholders should be included when construction takes  place  at
      the airport.

13. Conclusion

It was confirmed that Cape Town International Airport  would  be  ready  for
2010 FIFA World Cup. However, the Integrated Bus Transit (IBT) would not  be
fully operational and it is the responsibility of the City of Cape  Town  to
ensure the readiness of the IBT.

2. Report of the Portfolio Committee on Health on an oversight visit to
 Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital on 21 may 2010, dated 20
 July 2010

      The Portfolio Committee on Health having undertaken an oversight visit
      to Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital on 21 May 2010
      reports as follows:

1. INTRODUCTION

The Portfolio Committee on Health has an oversight role over the  Department
of Health.  The  vision  of  the  committee  is  to  ensure  an  accessible,
affordable, equitable, quality, effective and efficient  health  system  for
all the people of South Africa.  It can no longer be business as usual  when
the people of South Africa do not have access to an effective and  efficient
health system.
2. OBJECTIVES OF THE VISIT

There had been  an  infection  outbreak  at  Charlotte  Maxeke  Johannesburg
Academic Hospital which led to the deaths of 6 babies by 18  May  2010.  The
committee wanted to assess the situation and see whether there was a  threat
of the infection spreading to other hospitals and provinces.  The  committee
also wanted to evaluate the strategies the hospital was  using  in  handling
the infection so that it does not spread further.

   3. DELEGATION

Dr MB Goqwana, Chairperson of the Committee (ANC), Ms E More (DA) and  Ms  V
Majalamba (Committee Secretary).
   4. BACKGROUND

Dr Daynia Balldt who  was  in  charge  of  the  neonatal  ward  briefed  the
committee about the events that led to  the  death  of  the  6  neonates  at
Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. She informed the  committee
that the first baby had diarrhoea on Friday, 14 May 2010 but  his  condition
then improved. Thirteen babies were sick on Saturday, 15  May  2010  and  by
Sunday the number had  increased  to  seventeen.  The  5  neonates  died  on
Monday, 17 May 2010 and the sixth one died in the  evening  of  Tuesday,  18
May 2010.

Dr Balldt stated that the babies were admitted  to  3  different  wards  but
were sick at the same time. They were then admitted to 1 ward. She told  the
committee that the hospital had never had an outbreak like that  before  and
further indicated that the hospital was once rated a world  class  hospital.
She stated that she was very concerned over the bad reports  by  the  media.
She indicated that staff has to be acknowledged for the good  job  they  did
during the outbreak instead of blaming them. She also  admitted  that  there
were challenges like overcrowding in the ward and staff shortages  and  that
most of the staff did not want to work at the neonatal ward because  of  the
heavy workload.

She mentioned that there were forty five neonates  in  the  ward  while  the
capacity of the ward was thirty five. She told the committee that there  was
no way they could have avoided overcrowding  or  they  would  have  been  in
breach of the Constitution of South Africa which states that  everybody  has
the right to access  to  health  care  services  and  because  most  of  the
neonates were born at the hospital there was no way they could  have  chased
them away after birth. She also told the  committee  that  they  were  faced
with financial constraints but that they were doing  their  best  with  what
they had.

Dr Balldt further informed the Committee that they had  initially  suspected
that the outbreak and deaths were due to pre-Nan Feeds. The majority of  the
babies were premature varying from  low  to  very  low  birth  weights.  The
hospital then called the National Health Laboratory Services to  conduct  an
investigation on what might have  been  the  cause  of  the  deaths  of  the
babies.

   5. INVESTIGATIONS BY THE NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICES (NHLS)

Dr Balldt stated that on Sunday, 16 May 2010 Professor AG  Duse  who  worked
for the National Health Laboratory Services  and  the  Wits  University  was
called to assist with an outbreak of diarrhoea  occurring  predominantly  in
premature neonates in  the  neonatal  wards  numbers  177  and  184  at  the
Charlotte  Maxeke  Johannesburg  Academy  Hospital.  There  were   seventeen
neonates who were affected at that stage. Dr Balldt informed  the  committee
that  pre-term  and  particularly  very  low  birth  weight   neonates   are
vulnerable to infections and complications,  due  to  the  fact  that  their
immune system was immature.
Sixteen faecal  samples  were  submitted  for  virology  investigations  and
fifteen  of  these  tested  positive  for  Norovirus.  She  indicated   that
Noroviruses have been documented as causes of neonatal  diarrhoea  that  can
become  complicated  to  more  serious  and   potentially   life-threatening
conditions such as extensive inflammation and damage and death of  cells  in
the  gastrointestinal  tract  (necrotising  enterocolitis).   In   premature
neonates, severe inflammation of the  gastrointestinal  tract  can  lead  to
both  resident  and  hospital-acquired  gut  bacteria  migrating  into   the
bloodstream causing severe sepsis and even death of the infant.

Dr Balldt stated that line-listing was done with all affected  neonates.  An
audit with on-site infection prevention and control, training and  education
was carried out in  wards  177  and  184.   Nineteen  empty,  used  milk-fed
bottles with evidence of residual  milk  were  collected  and  sent  to  the
National  Health  Laboratory  Services  Infection  Prevention  and   Control
Laboratory for culture. She further stated  that  twelve  of  these  bottles
grew klebsiella pneumonia but  they  were  still  awaiting  the  antibiogram
which would be available by Thursday, 20 May 2010. A further 6 grew a  gram-
negative  bacillus  morphologically  resembling  klebsiella  but  they  were
awaiting final confirmatory  identification  and  antibiogram  results.  One
bottle grew a gram-negative bacillus to be further identified.

Four reconstituted milk-fed bottles were collected  and  sent  to  the  NHLS
Infection Prevention and  Control  Laboratory  for  culture.  One  of  these
bottles grew a gram-negative bacillus morphologically resembling  klebsiella
but they were  also  awaiting  the  final  confirmatory  identification  and
antibiogram results which would be available by Thursday, 20 May 2010.

Thirteen rectal swabs and 4 stool samples were  collected  in  duplicate  (a
total of  4  specimens)  from  symptomatic  neonates  for  bacteriology  and
virology investigations. Of the seventeen  sent  for  microbiology,  fifteen
grew a gram-negative vacillus morphologically resembling klebsiella but  the
hospital was  still  awaiting  final  confirmatory  identification.  Of  the
sixteen received by the National Institute for Communicable  Disease  (NICD)
for virology, fifteen tested positive for the norovirus.

Faecal samples collected from the seventeen  neonates  that  were  sent  for
bacteriological investigation yielded a growth in fifteen of  the  seventeen
samples of a bacterium called klebsiella pneumonia, 6 of which  were  highly
resistant to  antibiotics  and  called  ESBL  positive  strains.  Dr  Balldt
further mentioned that it is important to  note  that  both  drug  sensitive
strains of klebsiella pneumonia were present in the blood of at least  4  of
the 8 neonates from whom blood cultures were collected  suggesting  possible
migration (translocation) of gut organisms into  the  bloodstream.  Eighteen
used milk bottles were processed and in all of  these  klebsiella  pneumonia
was found, thirteen strains of which were highly drug-resistant.

Two patients discharged from the neonatal wards on Friday, 14 May 2010  were
readmitted with diarrhoea to ward 285 where blood cultures were taken on  18
and 19 May 2010. One blood culture grew a drug-sensitive klebsiella and  the
other a bacterium  that  needed  further  identification.  Furthermore,  two
blood cultures from 2 new babies were collected on 18 May  2010  and  tested
positive for bacteria growth (microbes needed to be identified further).

   6. FINDINGS BY THE NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICES (NHLS)

    • The norovirus may have been  introduced  from  the  community  and  it
      infected one or more neonates. It spread to all other  babies  due  to
      lack of infection prevention and control practices.
    • Gastrointestinal damage caused by the  norovirus  might  have  led  to
      migration  of  gut  organisms  like  klebsiella  pneumonia  and  other
      bacteria into the bloodstream and caused severe sepsis  requiring  the
      administration of antibiotics into the bloodstream.
    • Bacteria that were present in the gut can  furthermore  be  spread  by
      contaminated hands due to inadequate handwashing after diaper  changes
      and in the course of healthcare delivery to other neonates and  result
      in healthcare associated infections.
    • The bacterially contaminated used milk bottles could have also led  to
      the  introduction  of  dangerous  bacteria  into  the   very   fragile
      gastrointestinal  tract  of  the  pre-term  neonates  with   norovirus
      diarrhoea and could have  caused  complications  such  as  necrotising
      enterocolitis.

Investigations conducted suggested that more than one  (probably  all  four)
of the above contributed to the outbreak.

The hospital believed that it was most likely that the virus was  introduced
into the neonatal ward  by  caregivers  (mothers),  siblings  or  healthcare
personnel.

   7. INTERVENTIONS BY THE HOSPITAL

    • Education and training on proper infection control measures  was  done
      immediately for all ranks of  staff  in  ward  177  and  in  the  milk
      kitchen.
    • Continuous and unannounced inspections were being carried out.
    • All the babies  from  the  neonatal  ward  were  moved  to  the  newly
      renovated  ICU,  with  single  cubicles  while  the  ward  was   being
      disinfected and made safe for patient care again.
    •  The  milk  kitchen  was  thoroughly  cleaned  and   disinfected   and
      renovations would be carried out before the end of that week.
    • Professor Duse from the National  Health  Laboratory  Services  (NHLS)
      will continue to monitor laboratory results.
    • Visits by parents were monitored and protective clothing were provided
      for them before they were allowed to see their babies.
    • All staff members working in the neonatal  unit  were  being  supplied
      with disposable surgical gowns and caps.
    • Counselling was arranged for the bereaved mothers.

        8. WALK ABOUT AT THE HOSPITAL

              a) PREM-UNIT (HIGH CARE UNIT)

The committee visited the prem-unit, where 6 neonates died.  There  were  no
neonates at the ward because all were removed to  the  newly  renovated  ICU
after the outbreak. The committee observed that the infrastructure was  very
old. The CEO, Dr Barney Selebano informed the committee that  the  ward  was
going to be renovated, cleaned and de-germed.

              b) NEW  ICU

The committee  was  informed  that  Carte  Blanche  donated  money  for  the
renovation of the unit. The purpose of the  renovation  was  to  extend  the
intensive care unit so that young and older children were  not  admitted  to
the same ward. The unit was where all the neonates were  admitted  from  the
prem-unit. The committee observed that the  unit  was  very  clean  and  had
disposable gowns and gloves that were used by the staff and people  visiting
the unit. The committee further noted  that  all  children  were  in  single
cubicles.

              c) LABOUR WARD
The committee was shown where the babies were delivered. There  was  a  four
bedded unit at the labour ward that was called  the  transitional  unit  for
neonates. Babies were screened at the unit  and  if  found  sick  they  were
referred to the ICU, otherwise they were  referred  to  the  prem-unit.  The
committee was informed that there were two nurses per shift.

              d) MILK ROOM

The committee observed that the milk  room  was  in  a  bad  condition.  The
infrastructure was very old and bottle brushes were used that were very  old
and rusty.

   9. FINDINGS BY THE COMMITTEE

The committee concluded its visit and noted  that  the  hospital  was  short
staffed. Another key finding was that the hospital was  under  funded  hence
they were still operating on a very old infrastructure.

  10. RECOMMENDATIONS

The Committee recommended that:


   a) Communities and children should  be  immunised  and  fully  vaccinated
      especially towards winter season.
   b) Community based education  and  preventative  measures  be  scaled  up
      especially on the basics like cleanliness and washing of hands.
   c) Parents visiting neonates should be monitored at all times.
   d) Counselling be arranged for staff members that  were  working  at  the
      neonatal ward when the incident happened.
   e) Radical action be taken by the health sector to strengthen the quality
      of child care.
   f) Milk rooms be moved to the neonatal ward or closer  so  as  to  enable
      health professions staff to be involved.
   g) The issue of staff shortages and inadequate funding of  the  hospitals
      be dealt with as a matter of urgency by  the  National  Department  of
      Health.
   h) The Department needs to strengthen and promote Primary Health Care.
   i) Tertiary institutions be run and managed by the National Department of
      Health as one of the strategies to manage the referral system.

3. Report of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
 on oversight to the Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal Provinces, dated 1 June
 2010

     • Assess the implementation and  impact  of  government-funded  farmer
       support  programmes  that  are  undertaken  by  the  Department   of
       Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  such  as  the  Comprehensive
       Agricultural  Support  Programme  (CASP)  and   Micro   Agricultural
       Financial Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA).
     • Facilitate cooperative governance  and  intergovernmental  relations
       between the National  and  Provincial  Departments  of  Agriculture,
       Forestry and Fisheries, as well as Local Governments.

2.  DELEGATION

The oversight delegation consisted of:  Hon. M  Johnson  (ANC)  –  Committee
Chairperson, Hon. Ms NM Twala (ANC)  –  Committee  Whip,  Hon.  Mr  S  Abram
(ANC), Hon. Ms MC Mabuza (ANC), Hon. Ms  RE  Nyalungu  (ANC),  Hon.  Mr  PJC

officials from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and  relevant  Local
Government officials.

In Kwazulu-Natal, the Committee was joined on oversight by  Members  of  the
Kwazulu-Natal   Legislature’s    Standing    Committee    on    Agriculture,
Environmental Affairs and Rural Development, officials from  the  provincial
MEC’s  office,  the  Local  Government  officials  and  officials   of   the
Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural
Development.
In both provinces, the Committee was also accompanied by  the  officials  of
the national Department of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries  (DAFF)  who
were  represented  by  Ms  V  Titi,  the  Deputy   Director-General   (DDG):
Agriculture Support Services; Mr R Sebifelo, Parliamentary  Liaison  Officer
and two officials from the national DAFF’s Communication Directorate.

3.  DAY ONE:  1 FEBRUARY 2010

EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE

1. Meeting with Hamburg Coastal Community, Peddie

Hamburg is a coastal communal area of Ngqushwa Local Municipality  (Peddie),
which is under Amathole District Municipality.  The Committee met  with  the
community chaired by the Speaker of  the  Ngqushwa  Local  Municipality,  Mr
Xotyeni.  The community ekes out a living from  the  coast,  mostly  through
subsistence fishing of oysters and  various  other  fish.   Previously,  the
community also derived some income from the sale of abalone (also  known  as
perlemoen). However,  their  abalone  fishing  permits  which  allowed  each
person to catch 3 abalones a day, have since 2004 expired,  and  were  never
renewed.  The community had since then  consulted  the  Marine  and  Coastal
Management Division (MCM) of the then Department  of  Environmental  Affairs
and Tourism (DEAT) to get their  permits  renewed.  Nothing  came  of  those
attempts – instead the DEAT promised to  send  marine  scientists  to  check
abalone stocks along the Hamburg coast line but to date, the  community  has
not received feedback on such a study or a reason why  their  permits  could
not be  renewed.   The  community  reported  that  they  witness  commercial
fishing boats poaching abalone on a daily basis,  particularly  after  hours
when environmental inspectors are not around.  However, when the members  of
the community try to make a living from the coast through  abalone  fishing,
they get arrested and given hefty fines which they cannot afford to pay.

Resolutions of the Portfolio Committee

     •  With  the  recent  proclamation  that  was  signed  by  the  Acting
       President, the Honourable Mr Kgalema  Motlanthe,  which  transferred
       most of the MCM to the DAFF, the challenges faced by  the  community
       should be looked at together with similar cases in the country.  For
       example, Hermanus in the Western Cape, where the DAFF is working  on
       an abalone recovery plan.
     • The Committee should also look at how the number of abalone that the
       community can catch can be increased (total allowable catch) as  the
       three-a-day permits which they previously had,  was  not  cumulative
       and therefore, not reliable as a source of income.
     •  The  Committee  should  engage  the   provincial   Departments   of
       Agriculture and Rural Development and Local Government in looking at
       livelihood alternatives in the absence of abalone  fishing  permits.
       Formal correspondence should be drafted to the  relevant  department
       to engage further on the matter.  The Committee, to also liaise with
       the relevant portfolio committees  in  parliament,  to  address  the
       issue.

2. Site visit to Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd, Kidds Beach

Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd, is one of the entities of the DAFF  situated  in  the
Kidds  Beach  area  near  East  London  on  state   owned   land   measuring
approximately 4 000 hectares.  The entity is  currently  under  a  Board  of
Directors as Board members resigned in January 2009.  In the  absence  of  a
Board, the then Minister of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,  Ms  Xingwana,
appointed Mr Andile Hawes, the DDG: Production and Resources Management,  to
be the ‘caretaker’ of the entity until a new Board is appointed.   Mr  Hawes
was not part of the DAFF delegation during  the  Committee’s  visit.   Ncera
Farms (Pty) Ltd, is a public company listed under Schedule 3 B in  terms  of
the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999).   The  DAFF  is
the sole shareholder.  The complexity of the  situation  at  Ncera  saw  the
Committee delegation having two separate meetings:  the first  one  being  a
briefing by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd.,  Mr
A Stylianou and emerging farmers that were settled by the former  Department
of Land Affairs on state farmers that form part of  the  Ncera  Farms  (Pty)
Ltd.

   1. Meeting with Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd. CEO and settled farmers

The CEO, who resides at the Ncera  Service  Centre  where  the  meeting  was
held, reported that  the  Centre  is  assisting  emerging  farmers  and  the
surrounding rural communities  through  various  services  in  the  form  of
advice, extension services, training, technical assistance  with  equipment,
etc.  The farms that comprise Ncera Farms were previously commercial  farms,
which were later inhabited by 50-60 families  of  farm  workers.   The  farm
workers and other community members on these farms felt  entitled  to  these
farms, and were of the opinion that they will be  settled  on  some  of  the
farms after they were handed over to the former Ministry of Agriculture  and
Land Affairs.

However, in 2005, advertisements were placed in the local newspapers by  the
Department of Land Affairs (DLA) in Pretoria, advertising  for  applications
from farmers who wish to lease the farms with  the  intention  to  purchase.
The entire process was handled by the Pretoria office of the DLA and of  the
700 applications they received, 40  applicants  were  shortlisted.   Of  the
shortlisted, ten successful applicants received responses  between  May  and
June 2007 and were then settled on the farms  with  Permissions  to  Occupy.
Permission to Occupy (PTOs) are  valid  for  12  months.   One  of  the  ten
applicants is a member of the Ncera community and also an  official  of  the
Department of  Rural  Development  and  Land  Reform.   While  he  initially
identified himself as one of the ten farmers, on correction from one of  the
farmers, he admitted that he soon vacated the farm after realising  that  no
official documents were forthcoming from the DLA.

That left nine  farmers  who  now  call  themselves  the  Ncera  Progressive
Farmers Cooperative.  When the farmers first  settled  on  the  farms,  they
were promised 3-year leases by the end of the PTOs  with  the  intention  to
purchase at the end of the  lease.   This  according  to  the  DDG,  is  the
Department’s policy on the disposal of state land.  The process was  delayed
and their PTOs have since  expired  without  them  having  acquired  leases.
Whilst settled  on  the  farms,  the  farmers  invested  infrastructure  and
production capital on the farms, using their own funds, as  loans  were  not
granted to persons without legal entitlement  to  the  land.   These  monies
were invested with the understanding  that  they  will  receive  rent-to-buy
leases at a later stage.   To  date,  the  farmers  have  not  received  any
official documentation from the former or current  Ministry  of  Agriculture
and Land Affairs or Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  –  neither  renewed
PTOs nor leases that give them some form of entitlement to the farms.

Challenges

     • Despite the expiry of the PTOs, the farmers remained  on  the  farms
       and continued to farm with the little they had, and it  was  alleged
       by the CEO that some of them had sold their homes to take occupation
       of the farms.
     • Residents from the surrounding communities and previous farm workers
       were not happy with the resettling of strangers on farms  that  they
       believed they were entitled to.  They claimed that  the  process  of
       allocation of farms was illegitimate and they  subsequently  invaded
       the farms.
     • The police could  not  assist  the  settled  farmers  regarding  the
       invasions as they had no official documents that proved their rights
       to occupy the farms.

Response by Ms V Titi, Deputy-Director:  DAFF (DDG)

     • The DAFF is currently in the process  of  issuing  the  farmers  new
       PTOs, which will later be converted to leases.
     • Alleged that she had read from minutes of a meeting that she did not
       attend, that one of the state farms, Rocklands  Farm,  was  reserved
       for the settlement of the  50-60  families  that  formed  the  Ncera
       community.

Concerns of the Portfolio Committee

     • The viability of the farms in terms  of  productivity,  which  would
       enable the farmers to eventually purchase the farms.
     • The PTOs, which are valid for twelve months,  do  not  provide  much
       assistance to farmers as they cannot secure loans from banks.
     • The legitimacy of the process of allocating the  farms  if  after  3
       years, they still have no official documents.
     • The extent to which these farmers were capacitated by the Department
       of Agriculture in order  for  them  to  be  able  to  graduate  from
       emerging farmers to commercial farmers.
     • Given the extent of the problems at Ncera, it looked as if the  DAFF
       only made some effort to resolve  the  issue  on  hearing  that  the
       Committee was visiting the place.  For example, if the PTOs  were  a
       simple matter as the DDG claimed, why did it take 3  years  for  the
       Department to issue those to the farmers?
Resolutions of the Portfolio Committee

     • The DDG to get the DAFF or  their  counterpart,  the  Department  of
       Rural Development and  Land  Reform  to  investigate  the  community
       member  who  is  also  an  official  of  the  Department  of   Rural
       Development and Land Reform, who was attending the meeting, when  he
       should have been at work.  His involvement as a government  official
       in the interests of the Department that he works for was seen  as  a
       conflict of interest.
     • DAFF to finalise the issuing of PTOs to the  settled  farmers  as  a
       matter of urgency.

   2. Meeting with Ncera Community including the CEO and Settled Farmers

The briefing meeting with the farmers and the CEO was followed by  the  all-
inclusive meeting with the local  community,  including  the  aforementioned
parties.  There were imminent tensions and  obvious  divisions  between  the
local community, the  CEO,  Mr  Stylianou  and  the  settled  farmers.   The
meeting was characterised by tension-filled heated discussions and  lots  of
finger pointing by the community to the CEO of the  Ncera  Farms  (Pty)  Ltd
and the DDG and her Department.

The community reckoned that problems at Ncera have been going  on  for  more
than 10 years but were aggravated in 2007, by  the  settlement  of  farmers,
all from outside the area except one, in the  neighbouring  farms  that  the
community used for their livestock.  The settled farmers do not  even  allow
the local community to graze their  livestock  or  use  drinking  points  on
these  farms.   The  Department  of  Land  Affairs  had  not  informed   the
surrounding communities, which had  previously  had  free  access  to  these
farms, about its plans.  The community felt that people who  were  born  and
bred in the area and those who were previously farm workers on  these  farms
while they were still operating commercially, should have been  given  first
preference on these farms.  They felt that the whole process was flawed  and
corrupt.

The community  voiced  their  frustration  at  having  government  officials
coming to them to make promises and then disappear  without  ever  resolving
the problem.  Many people who have been  at  Ncera  in  the  last  10  years
included parliamentary committees, the  former  MEC  of  the  EC  provincial
Department of Agriculture, who is now the Minister of Rural Development  and
Land Reform, Mr Nkwinti, who whilst MEC in the province, told them that  the
matter was for the National  Department  and  the  former  Minister  of  the
Department of Agriculture and Land  Affairs,  Ms  Xingwana.   The  community
said they had asked the then Minister, Ms Xingwana, for a forensic audit  to
be done on the Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd to ascertain how much  money  was,  and
is being spent by government on the farm while the local  community  is  not
benefitting.  They noted that they are yet to see the audit if it  was  ever
done and have no confidence in Mr Hawes who  is  the  ‘caretaker’  of  Ncera
(Pty) Ltd.

While the CEO and the DDG maintained that the Service Centre is  used  as  a
training and resource centre for the local and surrounding communities,  the
community contended that they had no access to it.   The  community  claimed
that the only people who are benefitting from the Centre are  the  CEO,  his
family and those that he likes.  The community felt that with  the  2  to  3
million rands Parliamentary Grant that Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd  receives,  the
Service Centre should be open to  all  instead  of  a  select  few  who  are
nominated by the current management of Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd.   Furthermore,
the community laid serious charges of corruption against the  CEO  of  Ncera
Farms (Pty) Ltd., Mr Stylianou, and all those involved in the setting up  of
the Centre, including some government officials who  were  involved  in  the
settling of the farmers on the Ncera state farms.

In previous interactions with the national  Department  of  Agriculture,  it
was resolved that a steering committee that would  include  members  of  the
community would be established to investigate  some  of  these  issues.   In
addition, that a forensic audit would be  commissioned  to  investigate  the
settling of the farmers.  Though these  resolutions  were  made,  there  has
been no further follow up by the Department on these issues and they  hardly
see Mr  Hawes,  the  Departmental  ‘caretaker’  of  Ncera  (Pty)  Ltd.   The
community felt slighted that their issues were not  taken  seriously.   They
also voiced their disappointment at the DDG  regarding  an  issue  of  being
resettled on Rocklands Farm, which she admitted is in the minutes  that  the
community claimed to know nothing about as they never  had  a  meeting  with
Departmental officials.  They requested the DDG  to  send  them  a  copy  of
those minutes from which she got the issue of their settlement at  Rocklands
Farm.

The community also reported on what they called a fraudulent eviction  order
that was served to one of the families that has always lived on one  of  the
settled farms.  They claimed the eviction  order  was  written  on  a  Ncera
Farms (Pty) Ltd. letterhead but had  a  Magistrate  Court  stamp.   The  DDG
clarified that one of the clauses of the PTO states  that  an  occupier  (s)
cannot interfere with people that they have found  on  state  property.   In
the light of all the allegations, the community insisted that  Mr  Stylianou
should be removed from Ncera (Pty) Ltd. and be transferred elsewhere  whilst
a forensic audit that they have been requesting for the  past  5  years,  is
undertaken.

Resolutions of the Portfolio Committee

     • Recognises the need for a forensic audit at Ncera Farms (Pty) Ltd.
     • The DAFF should submit a full report to the  Committee  on  all  the
       issues that were raised in both meetings and the  progress  on  what
       the Department has done and is currently doing.
     • It the forensic audit was previously conducted, the DAFF must submit
       the report to the Portfolio Committee and the  community,  including
       follow up with the community on findings.
     • The Portfolio Committee to contact the community on its follow up on
       the issues by Tuesday, 9 February 2010.

3. Presentation by the  Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural
   Development, Bisho

In a late afternoon meeting at the offices of the Provincial  Department  of
Agriculture in Bisho, the General Manager of  the  Eastern  Cape  Provincial
Department, Mr S Masebeni, submitted apologies for the MEC  for  Agriculture
and the Head of Department, who were both  attending  a  provincial  Cabinet
meeting.

The Senior Manager:  Projects, Mr Felix Hobson of the Provincial  Department
gave a presentation  on  the  progress  of  the  Comprehensive  Agricultural
Support Programme (CASP),  while  Mr  Delport  of  the  Eastern  Cape  Rural
Finance Corporation made a presentation on the Micro Agricultural  Financial
Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA).

   1. Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP)

The Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) presentation was  on
provincial progress from April 2009 to the end of January  2010.   The  CASP
makes funding provision to targeted beneficiaries of the land  and  agrarian
reform programmes.  These funds are conditional grants that are  managed  by
the provincial Department to  provide  post-settlement  support  to  farmers
with  infrastructure,  production  inputs,  training  and  mentorship.   The
policy focus of the CASP in the Eastern Cape is food  production;  livestock
development;  resuscitation  of  irrigation  schemes;   the   provision   of
agricultural infrastructure and training and capacity building.

The province has thus far only  used  55%  of  the  R120  million  that  was
allocated for CASP in 2009/10, with only two months left  into  the  end  of
the financial year.  One of the officials assured Committee Members that  by
the end of March, the Department would have used up the remaining  45%  even
if it means them buying equipment (most probably fencing)  and  keeping  it.
It was apparent that despite the need for CASP funding in the Eastern  Cape,
the provincial Department is still struggling to  effectively  utilise  CASP
funds,  beyond  infrastructure  provision,  for  example,  fencing,  poultry
structures, dipping tanks, etc. and to some extent,  training  of  extension
officers.  The province maintained that they needed a capital investment  in
agricultural infrastructure of R350 million of which it  has  only  received
R190  million,  which  leaves  a  deficit  of  R160  million.   On  numerous
infrastructure projects they have planned, for most of them  less  then  50%
of the  targeted  outputs,  were  achieved  by  the  third  quarter  of  the
financial  year.   With  the  serious  skills  shortages  in  its  Extension
Services, the province has trained a total of 132 Department  officials,  95
on technical skills and 38 on general skills through its Extension  Recovery
Plan.   For  farmer  training  and  capacity  building,  a  total   of   412
beneficiaries were given accredited training on various farming programmes.

Challenges

     • Socio-economic problems within communities.
     • Increasing input process for construction and production during  the
       period between budget  planning  and  the  time  that  projects  get
       implemented.
     • Insufficient capacity in agricultural engineering.
     • Lack of financial and  project  management  capacity  of  developing
       contractors.
In addressing some of the challenges, the provincial Department  intends  to
focus on proper planning of projects with the hope that  this  will  improve
project implementation.  Furthermore,  the  Department  intends  to  monitor
district project implementation more  closely  to  identify  bottlenecks  in
time.

Concerns of the Portfolio Committee

     • That the Department is planning and even admitted to fiscal  dumping
       by using the remaining 45% in the CASP budget within two  months  on
       equipment.  This was a serious concern considering that most of that
       equipment eventually gets stolen or vandalised.
     • The national  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries
       invested a significant amount of funds into the  Extension  Recovery
       Plan.  However, given the size of the Province and the need  for  an
       effective and  efficient  extension  service  for,  subsistence  and
       emerging farmers, the Province has made little use of the  available
       funds for improving the skills of its personnel.

   2. Micro Agricultural Financial Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA)

The Eastern Cape is one of the  provinces  in  which  MAFISA  was  initially
piloted in 2005 before it was rolled out nationally.  The  MAFISA  programme
in the Eastern Cape is  administered  by  the  Eastern  Cape  Rural  Finance
Corporation (commonly known as  Uvimba),  whose  objective  is  to  promote,
support and  facilitate  rural  development  in  the  province  through  the
mobilisation  and  provision  of  financial  resources,  and  promoting  and
encouraging  private  sector  investment  in  the  Province.    Uvimba   was
established in 1999 through the amalgamation of  the  Agricultural  Bank  of
Transkei and the Ciskei Agricultural Bank as the two former  homelands  were
incorporated into the Eastern Cape Province.  Uvimba  has  branches  in  all
six District Municipalities to ensure easier access of the  credit  facility
to farming communities.

The provincial presentation  was  based  on  the  MAFISA  pilot  phase  from
December 2005 to December 2007 and the current financial year.   During  the
2-year pilot phase, the provincial MAFISA programme has  granted  728  loans
to the tune of R47.6 million.  The majority of the loans  were  for  ostrich
farming, broiler production, cotton  farming  and  production  inputs.   The
bulk of the loans in monetary terms were for  ostrich  and  cotton  farming.
From June 2009 to January 2010,  128  loans  were  granted  through  MAFISA,
amounting to R4.9 million.  The majority of these loans are  for  production
inputs and to some extent, broiler and livestock production.   In  the  past
year, from January to December 2009,  R7  million  was  disbursed  and  R6.1
million was paid back to Uvimba.

Challenges

     • Competition with  grant  providers  such  as  local  municipalities,
       Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (AsgiSA) –
       Eastern Cape, NGOs such as LIMA to acquire production outputs.
     • Competition with the Department  of  Agriculture’s  grant  programme
       such as Siyakhula/Siyazondla.
     • The availability of social grants affects the number of small  scale
       farmers who apply for loans.
     • Since MAFISA is a government intervention scheme; some farmers still
       refuse to repay their loans, seeing it as grant money.
     • The in-house credit life scheme that limits the age of an  applicant
       to be no older than 65 years.  At  the  time  of  application,  this
       disqualified many small scale farmers who are  still  interested  in
       obtaining loans to address the issue of food security.
     • Inadequate means to mitigate risks related to natural  hazards  such
       as drought, floods, hailstorm, fires, etc.
     • Lack of understanding by beneficiaries  of  land  reform  programme.
       For example, they do not understand that the MAFISA loan application
       process is not necessarily linked to these programmes.
     • Reduction in Reserve Bank interest rates affects the competitiveness
       of MAFISA interest rates.
     • High default rate.

The provincial credit facility recommends the integration of their  services
with grant providers (like CASP) to mitigate risk and improve outreach,  and
for government to lower the threshold for collateral security to R10 000.

4.  DAY TWO: 2 FEBRUARY 2010

 1. Site visit to the National Emergent  Red  Meat  Producers  Organisation
    (NERPO), Queenstown

The Committee visited a NERPO  affiliated  Wildevrede  Farm  in  Queenstown.
The Managing Director  (MD)  of  NERPO,  Mr  Aggrey  Mahanjana,  hosted  the
Committee and provided a briefing on the farm and the  activities  that  are
carried out on the farm.  Wildevrede Farm was  acquired  by  NERPO  in  June
2009 on a three year lease from the  Department  of  Rural  Development  and
Land  Reform  through  the  Proactive  Land  Acquisition   Strategy   (PLAS)
programme.  It is used as a  training  facility  for  youths  interested  in
agriculture through NERPO’s Development and Land  Reform  (DRDLR)  who  paid
R6.8 million for the farm. NERPO leases it from the Department for R220  000
at 10% escalation per annum.  The farm is 1 500 hectares in extent,  and  65
hectares of this, is arable land.

The youth training programme lasts for  one  year  with  participants  being
exposed to every  aspect  of  farming,  including  budgeting  and  financial
planning.  The agricultural  activities  on  the  farm  are  diversified  to
provide participants  with  greater  exposure  to  the  different  kinds  of
farming.   Operations  on  the  farm  include:  extensive  beef  production,
Boergoats, free range indigenous chickens,  agronomic  crops  and  vegetable
production.  The farm is currently run and managed by 23  resident  students
who are part of the Training Programme.  It is the intention of  NERPO  that
once its three year lease  expires;  the  farm  can  be  handed  over  to  5
nominated programme participants who have  excelled  during  the  course  of
their training.  It is hoped that with assistance  from  the  DRDLR,  the  5
young farmers can eventually buy the farm.

Mr Mahanjana mentioned that  they  have  tried  as  NERPO,  to  involve  the
provincial extension officers in student training,  but  realised  that  the
extension officers themselves need more training  as  they  could  not  even
perform basic technical activities like soil analysis.  He also  alluded  to
their frustration  as  NERPO  with  the  government’s  failing  land  reform
programme.   He believes that no acquired farm can be a  success  without  a
potential farmer’s own reserves of capital, as most farms do  not  make  any
income within the first three years of inception.  He believes that that  is
why most land reform projects fail  because  government  places  onto  farms
large numbers of people with no financial backing and technical skills.   To
this effect, Mr Mahanjana showed the Committee a neighbouring farm  that  is
a classic example of failed land reform projects.

The farm, which was once one of the top maize producers in the  country  was
bought by the then Department of Land Affairs and they placed in it a  group
of people from different communal  villages  throughout  the  Eastern  Cape.
The people had no commercial farming experience  and  did  not  receive  any
assistance from the Department.  Ever since the  farm  was  bought  by  Land
Affairs and transferred to the people, it did not operate  as  a  commercial
farm but a  resettlement  communal  village.   After  some  in-fighting  and
struggling, some of the villagers left the farm and went back to where  they
came from.  The few that are left  on  the  run-down  farm,  which  has  now
become like any other degraded communal  village,  are  struggling  to  make
ends meet.

Resolution of the Portfolio Committee

     • That  government  should  assist  the  five  identified  youth  with
       technical and financial assistance once they take over the  farm  at
       the end of the 3-year NERPO lease.
     • That the DAFF,  through  the  provincial  Department,  provides  the
       Committee with a list and details  of  failed  land  reform  farming
       projects in the province that are in similar situations to the  farm
       that is neighbouring the NERPO’s Wildevrede Farm in Queenstown.  The
       Committee needs to undertake follow-up studies after  receiving  the
       relevant  data  from  the   respective   national   and   provincial
       Departments.
     • The responsibility for the challenges faced  on  these  farms  falls
       within the ambit of the work of the Department of Rural  Development
       and Land Affairs.  It is  therefore  important  that  the  Portfolio
       Committee liaises with the Portfolio Committee on Rural  Development
       and Land Affairs so that the Department of Rural Development reports
       to both committees.

 2. Site Visits to Qamata Irrigation Scheme, Cofimvaba

The Qamata Irrigation Scheme is one of the four  schemes  that  falls  under
Intsika  Yethu  Local  Municipality.   The  irrigation  schemes   were   the
initiative of the former Transkei  government,  and  all  currently  require
rehabilitation.   The  Scheme  was  designed  for  individual  farmers,  not
communities or  cooperatives,  which  are  currently  being  promoted.   The
Qamata Irrigation Scheme, it is claimed,  started  falling  apart  with  the
exit of the then Transkei Agricultural Corporation  (TRACOR),  the  Transkei
government parastatal  whose  main  objective  was  to  give  financial  and
technical services to small scale independent farmers.   At  Qamata,  TRACOR
was responsible for the day to day running and management of the  Irrigation
Scheme on behalf of the 1 500 farmers that were members of  the  scheme,  in
exchange for a number of bags from their  produce.   The  farmers,  some  of
whom are still members of the Scheme, do not have ownership  entitlement  to
the land as  it  was  allotments  given  to  them  by  the  former  Transkei
government.

The Scheme, which covers a land area of  approximately  4  000  hectares  is
being revived through joint partnerships between the  Provincial  Department
of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  and  the   Intsika   Yethu   Local
Municipality.  In addition, other partners and stakeholders involved in  the
Scheme are:  The National Development  Agency  (NDA);  ASGISA-Eastern  Cape;
Provincial  Department  of   Social   Development;   Chris   Hani   District
Municipality and the  former  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry.
Currently, 1 000 hectares of the scheme is  under  lucerne  production,  500
hectares under  maize  production  of  which  350  hectares  of  independent
farming takes place.

Challenges

     • Inadequate infrastructure  –  the  existing  infrastructure  at  the
       scheme is said to be old and  dilapidated,  thus  leading  to  water
       wastage.
     • Inadequate funding – farmers who have access to water do not  plough
       their lands due to financial constraints.
     • Lack of maintenance.
     • Vandalism of the facilities and existing infrastructure.
     • Poor access to national roads limits market access.

The provincial  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  which
received  funding  from  National  Treasury  for   the   revitalisation   of
irrigation schemes is doing a  survey  of  all  irrigation  schemes  in  the
Province and only Ncora Irrigation Scheme has been completed.

Forming part of the run down infrastructure are houses that  used  to  house
extension officers in the former homeland of Transkei. The houses  are  said
to belong to the Department of Public Works, and the  provincial  Department
of Agriculture and  Rural  Development  is  negotiating  with  Public  Works
regarding their renovation.  The intention is for the houses to  accommodate
extension staff that will be rendering technical assistance  to  the  Scheme
through  the  government-supported  Rehabilitation  of  Irrigation   Schemes
Programme.

To address the  issue  of  inadequate  funding,  an  agreement  was  reached
between the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development,  the
Chris  Hani  District  Municipality  (under  which   Intsika   Yethu   Local
Municipality falls) and the Scheme Committee  of  the  4  schemes  that  are
under Intsika Yethu Local Municipality.  They resolved that funds  allocated
to various irrigation schemes for each financial year would be  consolidated
to one irrigation  scheme  within  a  financial  year.   This  ensures  that
although some schemes have to wait a few years for  revitalisation,  a  more
significant  and   substantial   contribution   is   made.    Through   this
arrangement, Shiloh Irrigation Scheme received R25 million  in  the  2009/10
financial year. In the current financial year, the  allocation  will  go  to
Ncora  Irrigation  Scheme  while  Qamata  Irrigation  Scheme  will  get  its
allocation in the 2011/2012 financial year.   The  Committee  commended  the
good  intergovernmental  relations  between  the  provincial  Department  of
Agriculture   and   Rural   Development   and   the   Local   and   District
Municipalities, which will ensure that projects are well  aligned  with  the
latter’s Integrated Development Plans (IDPs).

5.  DAY THREE:  3 FEBRUARY 2010

KWAZULU-NATAL PROVINCE

 1. Meeting with the Kwazulu-Natal Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,
    Environmental Affairs and Rural Development, Ulundi

The Committee was joined by the Kwazulu-Natal (KZN)  Legislature’s  Standing
Committee on  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural  Development,
Local Government, senior  officials  of  the  office  of  the  MEC  and  the
provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural
development and members of various  cooperatives  from  the  District.   The
provincial Manager for CASP, Mr Z Duze, presented  to  the  Committee.   The
province did  not  have  a  presentation  on  Micro  Agricultural  Financial
Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA) programme.

   1. Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP)

In Kwazulu-Natal, the focus of CASP has been on land  reform  beneficiaries,
with identification and prioritisation of beneficiaries being  done  at  the
district level.  By the end of January 2010, CASP expenditure in KZN was  at
65% with projections to be at 98% by the end  of  March  (end  of  financial
year).  The KZN provincial CASP, although it has failed  to  adequately  and
timeously spent  its  allocation,  had  varied  projects  on  the  different
pillars  of  CASP.    Despite   the   majority   of   projects   being   for
infrastructure, given the focus on  post-settlement  support,  CASP  in  KZN
also  provided  a  sizeable  amount  of  funds  to  production  inputs   for
sugarcane,  livestock,  poultry,  grain  and  vegetables  under  irrigation;
mentorship and training (840  farmers  trained  and  22  mentors  placed  in
farms); as well as technical and advisory services.  Through  the  Extension
Recovery Plan, 482 extension personnel underwent training, the  majority  of
whom did training in Information and Communication Technology  (ICT).   CASP
in KZN also makes a  financial  contribution  to  food  security,  which  is
implemented by another Directorate within the provincial Department.

Challenges

     • Lack of capacity at district level.
     • The lengthy procurement process.
     • Inflated prices by service providers.
     • Design of some projects which resulted in beneficiary conflicts.
     • The majority of commercial land reform projects  being  too  complex
       for beneficiaries to operate.

To mitigate some of the CASP challenges, in July 2009,  a  Cabinet  Lekgotla
approved the  establishment  of  an  entity,  the  Agribusiness  Development
Agency (ADA), which will serve as an implementing arm of CASP on  behalf  of
the provincial Department of Agriculture, Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural
Development.  The ADA comprises  MECs  for  the  provincial  Departments  of
Agriculture, Environmental Affairs and Rural Development  (CASP  funding  on
projects), Treasury (financial oversight), Economic Development and  Tourism
(capital requirements of the  ADA)  and  Local  Government  and  Traditional
Affairs (linkages with municipal IDPs).  The ADA is  hoped  to  shorten  the
procurement process; provide linkages with the commercial sector to  address
sustainability; better coordination for efficient resource use and  capacity
building for  farmers  and  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  Environmental
Affairs and Rural Development.  For the  2010/11  financial  year,  projects
have been identified, consultative process in progress, and  the  commercial
sector will play a role in implementing the projects.

Concerns of the Portfolio Committee

     • That with 35% of its budget still remaining two months into the  end
       of  the  financial  year,  the  Committee  is  concerned  that   the
       Department will engage in fiscal dumping in order to ensure that its
       budget is spent.
     • The extent to which the plans of the Department are  linked  to  the
       IDPs of the local municipalities, particularly  those  within  which
       funded projects are based.
     • In respect of technical and extension services, the extent to  which
       there  is  consultation  and  cooperation  between  the   provincial
       Department and organised agriculture (for example, AgriSA  in  terms
       of their various commodity training chambers).
     • The National  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries
       invested a significant amount of funds into the  Extension  Recovery
       Plan – the impacts of which do not seem to be reflected  within  the
       Province.
     • That a new official to the provincial Department,  not  the  HOD  or
       CASP Manager, decided to  respond  to  Committee  questions  on  the
       presentations.  Most of  the  responses  on  service  delivery  were
       vague.

   2. Presentation by Invundo Agricultural Tertiary Cooperative Ltd.

Imvundo is a private company that seeks to provide an all-inclusive  service
to up and  coming  cooperatives  in  both  crop  and  livestock  production.
Without  an  indication  of  what  the  organisation   has   achieved,   the
presentation was largely based on a proposal on  how  the  organisation  can
solve the challenges of  cooperatives,  and  why  government  should  invest
money in them to implement precision farming  technology  for  cooperatives.
Imvundo does not offer  technical  training  but  will  identify  a  service
provider to provide the training for the Cooperatives.  One of  the  service
providers  with  whom  they  are  partnering  is  another  private  company,
Agritech, which  provides  Precision  Farming  Training,  and  its  proposed
interventions  were  highly  technical  and  very  irrelevant,  for  example
precision farming, to ordinary farmers,  some  of  whom  have  no  education
background.

 2. Site Visit to Mcebusendlini Primary Cooperative, Ulundi

This cooperative, which is located on a  28-hectare  site,  was  started  in
1992, as a community-based organisation with financial and other  assistance
from the South African Breweries (SAB) and the University of  Kwazulu-Natal.
 The cooperative started with 25 members and it currently has 12  (8  youths
and 4 adults).  Infrastructure was funded by SAB and  fencing  was  provided
by the Provincial Department of Agriculture.  Primary production  is  mainly
vegetables, cash crops and chicken production.  The cooperative’s market  is
the local community and supermarkets like SPAR, Boxer and Pick ‘n Pay.

During the Committee’s visit, the newly tended garden looked as  if  it  was
done the previous day or that morning, for the  benefit  of  the  Committee.
Most of the yard was unkempt with ready  to  harvest  cabbages  and  lettuce
that were almost buried in weeds and some spoiling from  rain.   Except  for
the office building, most  of  the  infrastructure  was  run  down  (poultry
structures) while some looked as if they  were  never  used.   There  was  a
borehole  that  was  non-functional  as   the   provincial   Department   of
Agriculture, Environmental Affairs and Rural  Development  did  not  provide
required pipelines.

Challenges

     • Dilapidated infrastructure due to a lack of maintenance.
     • Lack of financial and technical support.
     • Lack of access to markets.

 3. Site Visit to Omakhelwane Cooperative, Ulundi

The cooperative was  initiated  in  1989  on  17  hectares  of  land.   When
cooperative members (all women) started out, the area  was  highly  infested
with thorn trees (Acacia karoo) and there was  no  water  or  infrastructure
present in the area.  The members physically cleared the area to  start  the
project and are  currently  farming,  primarily  maize  and  chickens.   The
cooperative farm looked very  impressive  with  beautiful  maize  fields  at
various  stages  of  growth  and  harvest,  as  well  as  expansive  poultry
structures.  The cooperative has won  various  awards  including  being  the
overall winner of the provincial Female Farmer  of  the  Year  Award  and  a
runner-up in the national Female Farmer of  the  Year  award.   One  of  the
members of the cooperative is Mrs Ellen kaNkosi Shandu, the former  Minister
of Education in KZN and a former Member of Parliament.

 4. Site Visit to Phezukomkhono Cooperative, Empangeni

Prior to the arrival at the site, the Parliamentary and Legislative  Members
were given a report that had a  current  date  and  read  like  the  project
exists. One gets to  the  last  page  to  learn  that  the  Cooperative  had
collapsed.  The report was also not well put  together  and  seemed  like  a
last minute cut and paste job from reports of the past three to four  years.
 The Members wanted to know what has been happening  in  the  interim.   The
Chief Operations Officer (COO) of the provincial Department, Mr  C  Boldogh,
apologised on behalf of the Department for the misleading  report  which  he
was not aware of, as  in  his  office,  he  had  a  recent  detailed  report
including some previous  audit  reports.   He  promised  to  avail  all  the
documents to Members.

Phezukomkhono Cooperative, which has since collapsed, was located on  a  257
hectare farm.  The farm, which formerly produced sugarcane, was  repossessed
by the Land Bank and was bought by the Department of  Land  Affairs  for  88
(all women, except 2) members of the Phezukomkhono Cooperative  through  the
Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS).  It  used  to  be  a  model  for
mixed  farming,  producing  various  vegetables,   including   paprika   and
mushrooms, poultry, and fish farming (aquaculture).  To date, there  is  not
even a structure or fencing on the  farm  but  ruins  of  what  used  to  be
aquaculture and broiler structures.

Different government departments and public enterprises invested  financial,
infrastructural and technical support to the Cooperative.    These  included
the Departments of Agriculture  and  Environmental  Affairs,  Land  Affairs;
Economic  Development;  Local  Government  and  Trade  and  Industry;  Small
Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA) and  Eskom.   It  estimated  that  more
than R40 million was invested in the now  collapsed  Cooperative,  including
the farm’s  purchase  price  of  approximately  R700  000.   The  provincial
Department of  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural  Development
acknowledged that no activity has taken place on the farm  since  2005,  and
the land is still  ‘owned’  by  the  Cooperative  members.   The  provincial
Department reported that it is still busy with one of the many  audits  that
have been done on the Cooperative since 2006, and reported to be  struggling
to get hold of Cooperative members and required  information  from  some  of
the stakeholders and investors.

Concerns of the Portfolio Committee

     • That the  Department  that  is  responsible  for  the  provision  of
       services  and  support  to  the  Cooperative  does  not   know   the
       whereabouts of Cooperative members.   Although  the  farm  has  been
       abandoned, the initial members of the Cooperative are  still  liable
       for the mortgage and all levies and payments  on  the  land  and  it
       should not be difficult to trace their whereabouts.
     • That it took so long for the Provincial Department  of  Agriculture,
       Environmental Affairs and Rural Development to pick  up  that  there
       were problems within the cooperative.
     • Given the extent to which the  cooperative  was  supported  and  the
       financial resources that went into it, particularly  in  respect  of
       infrastructure, it is a concern that no audit on funds allocated  to
       the project, exists.

Resolutions of the Portfolio Committee

     •  The  Department  should  make  available  to  the   Committee   all
       documentation about Phezukomkhono Cooperative, including details  of
       all  stakeholders,  partners  and  government  officials  who   were
       responsible for the Cooperative.
     • The Department needs to finalise the audit  of  the  Cooperative  as
       soon as possible, and come up with a recovery plan  to  rectify  the
       situation.  The government  cannot  afford  to  waste  resources  on
       failing projects while they should be promoting food security.

The  Committee  advised  the  Department  that  they  should   desist   from
allocating one project to large cooperatives  and  groupings  of  people  as
under such circumstances, conflict is inevitable.

 5. Site Visit to Sikhululelike Agricultural Cooperative, Empangeni

The  Sikhululelike  Agricultural   Cooperative   is   an   emerging   farmer
cooperative affiliated to the National African Farmers  Union  (NAFU).   The
Cooperative has 5 hectares that it  has  acquired  from  the  local  Mzimela
Tribal Council.  The Cooperative has no project in place,  but  its  members
plan to farm with vegetables and poultry to supply their local  Pick  n  Pay
and a large  supplier  to  hospitals  and  prisons.   However,  for  project
implementation, the Cooperative currently faces serious funding  constraints
for infrastructure, including fencing and poultry structures and  equipment,
starter chicks,  land  preparation  and  production  inputs.   So  far,  the
Cooperative has not been able to  receive  assistance  from  the  provincial
Department of Agriculture, Environmental Affairs and Rural Development.

 6. Joint meeting with the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Environmental
    Affairs and Rural Development of the KZN Legislature and  officials  of
    the provincial Department of  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and
    Rural Development, Durban

In an evening meeting  at  the  Protea  Hotel  Edward,  hosted  by  the  KZN
provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural
Development, the two Committees undertook a review of  the  day’s  oversight
visits.  The provincial Department’s COO, Mr Boldogh informed the  Committee
that he has one of the reports on Phezukomkono that he  will  hand  over  to
the Members, while the Department will collate the rest of the reports.

The key issue that the Committees agreed  on  was  the  poor  state  of  the
extension services. It is apparent from the projects visited that  there  is
a lack of farmer and cooperative support  form  the  provincial  Department.
It was mentioned that approximately 55 farms  that  were  supported  by  the
Land Bank have collapsed in the country.  The KZN provincial  Department  of
Agriculture, Environmental  Affairs  and  Rural  Development  has  to  date,
received 32 farms (mostly sugarcane) that form part of  the  collapsed  land
reform farms in the province.  The provincial Standing  Committee  estimated
that approximately R300 million in KZN  alone  has  been  wasted  on  failed
cooperatives and land reform projects, and the Standing Committee  has  been
struggling to obtain reports on these projects as they are  administered  by
different government departments and entities.

The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and  the  KZN
Legislature’s Standing Committee on Agriculture, Environmental  Affairs  and
Rural Development crafted the following resolutions:

     • The KZN provincial Department of Agriculture, Environmental  Affairs
       and Rural Development needs to undertake an investigation into  what
       took place at the  Phezukomkhono  Cooperative  Farm  and  produce  a
       comprehensive audit report to both Committees.
     •  All  available  reports,  documents  and  files  on   Phezukomkhono
       Cooperative  should  be  sent  to   the   Portfolio   Committee   on
       Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.
     • Both  Committees  require  a  report  that  details  the  provincial
       Department’s future plans on reviving the Phezukomkhono Cooperative.
     • Furthermore, the provincial Department  needs  to  provide  the  two
       Committees with a detailed report of other projects and cooperatives
       that have or are about to collapse in the Province.   These  reports
       should include details as to whether these projects are state  owned
       or privately owned, their location, details of members, stakeholders
       or service providers, current status, etc.
     • The national  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries
       should provide the  Portfolio  Committee  with  a  similar  detailed
       status report on all projects (countrywide) that have collapsed  and
       those in the state of near collapse.
     • The DDG from the national Department of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and
       Fisheries,  Ms  Titi,  needs  to  follow  up  with  the   provincial
       Department on all the resolutions that pertain to the province.

6.  Conclusion and Recommendations

The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries  noted  with
concern the role of extension services, which  negatively  impacted  service
delivery in both the Eastern Cape and  Kwazulu-Natal.   The  poor  state  of
government-funded  projects  and  collapsing  cooperatives  attest  to   the
failure of the provincial Departments that are responsible  for  Agriculture
and Rural Development to deliver on their mandate.  With  the  exception  of
Qamata  Irrigation  Scheme  in  Cofimvaba,  there  was  a  serious  lack  of
cooperative governance, as mandated by Chapter 3 of  the  Constitution,  and
project  integration  in  both  provinces.   This  has  led  to  wastage  of
financial  resources  without  any  positive  results  on  the  ground.  The
Portfolio Committee also noted with concern the apparent lack of  monitoring
and evaluation of projects by the provincial Departments, and of  provincial
spending and delivery progress by the national  Department  of  Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries, which dispenses the funding.  Ncera Farms (Pty)  Ltd
in the Eastern Cape  and  Phezukomkhono  Cooperative  in  Kwazulu-Natal  are
classic  cases  of  poor  or  lack  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  the
Department.

In light of the issues stated above and those that  have  been  observed  by
the Committee in the two provinces, the Portfolio Committee on  Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries made the following recommendations:

     • The Department  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  and  the
       Department of Rural  Development  and  Land  Reform  should  jointly
       present  to  Parliament  (Portfolio  Committee  overseeing  the  two
       Departments) their  respective  roles  in  assisting  resource  poor
       farmers and land reform beneficiaries; promoting  rural  development
       and agrarian reform; ensuring the country’s food security;  as  well
       as the role of the extension service in fulfilling this mandate.
     • The Portfolio Committee could ask the Office of the  Auditor-General
       to undertake a study on the Ncera Farms (Pty)  Ltd  in  the  Eastern
       Cape and Phezukomkhono Cooperative in Kwazulu-Natal.

Report to be considered.
