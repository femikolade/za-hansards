                 DELEGATION FROM NATIONAL COUNCIL OF NAMIBIA

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, just before we proceed, I have
been informed that we have a delegation of Members of Parliament from the
National Council of Namibia. They are visiting the Parliament of South
Africa on a study tour. Their leader is hon Jhonny Haikela Hakaye, whom I
know very well. Hon Jhonny Haikela Hakaye and I are members of the Pan-
African Parliament. I will ask them to stand so that we can see them.
[Applause.] Thank you very much.

If the staff can assist, perhaps they should sit somewhere there. They are
going to have great difficulty seeing what is happening from where they
are. Could you please get my guests to sit here? You must always remember
that, please.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council -

     1) notes the shocking and barbaric incident at Pelonomi Hospital, the
        largest hospital in the central region in Mangaung, Free State
        province, where a 35-year-old female specialist doctor was
        assaulted and raped on Saturday whilst doing her rounds in the
        neonatal section of the hospital;


     2) further notes that three men hit the female doctor in the face with
        a brick and raped her in the hospital and she has had to undergo
        surgery for facial and head injuries;

     3) recognises that doctors and staff have long complained about the
        poor and nonexistent security at the hospitals and the result of
        the assault and rape is that doctors and personnel are now
        frightened to work at night; and

     4) acknowledges that drastic steps need to be taken to improve the
        security situation at hospitals.

I so move. Thank you.

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council debates the rights that foreign nationals enjoy, and the
   legal protection that is afforded to them under the Immigration Act,
   which Home Affairs and others are obliged to implicitly carry out.

I so move.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council debates the R2,5 billion spent by the SA Social Security
   Agency, Sassa, on contractors just for the distribution of grants that
   could be used to relieve poverty, and the R10 billion not properly
   accounted for by Sassa in the annual report.


I so move.

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council debates the recommendation of researchers that the use
   of HIV/Aids hometesting kits by individuals who prefer to use them rather
   than their having to visit the nearest clinic available to them be
   seriously considered as an option.

I so move, Chairperson.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting of the Council:

   That the Council debates the rate of unemployment and what it means to
   all South Africans.

I so move.

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council —


     1) notes that in its efforts to enrich and reward its officials
        disguised as consultants through the looting of state resources in
        the municipalities that it controls, the Democratic Alliance spends
        millions of rand on consultants that are proving useless or do less
        than half of the work they are hired to do;


     2) further notes that in the City of Cape Town, the former chief
        consultant who was fired for misprojection and miscalculation of
        the costs of the Bus Rapid Transit System, costing the city
        billions of rands, was later given a handshake of R3 million, and
        has since been replaced with another consultant, paid far more than
        the municipal manager; and


     3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
        this repulsive looting of state resources, especially at a time
        when the city builds open toilets and neglects the provision of
        basic necessities to the communities in the townships.


I so move.

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


   That the Council —


     1) notes that President Jacob Zuma made the biggest reshuffle of an
        executive since 1994;
     2) further notes that reconfiguration of the executive is part of the
        ANC government’s effort to strengthen the functioning of government
        and advance the ANC’s commitment to move faster in changing the
        lives of our people in South Africa;


     3) takes this opportunity to congratulate the new Ministers in their
        new deployment; and


     4) conveys its good wishes to the outgoing Ministers who have served
        the ANC and the people of South Africa with the utmost dedication
        and commitment.


I so move.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting of the Council:

   That the Council —


     1) notes that poverty in Africa is directly influenced by the economic
        choices made by the leaders, but unfortunately these leaders have
        clearly chosen economic growth and development for their own
        pockets;

        2) requests –
          a) that the ruling party faces the realities of poverty in this
             country;


          b) takes full responsibility for poverty after their 16 years of
             reign;

          c) develops an effective economic policy and implements it
             immediately to create the five million jobs for all the people
             that the President has promised; and

          d) immediately provides deadlines for action to be taken against
             corrupt officials and public representatives who, through
             their greed, make all our people poorer.

I so move.

        Women’s Championship hosted by South Africa, featuring eight of the
        best African women’s soccer teams, started on Sunday, 31 October
        2010;

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


     1) notes that two weeks ago the Moqhaka municipality reported
        1 000 cases of diarrhoea and at least 350 people were treated in
        hospital because they drank either untreatable or untreated water;

     2) also notes that it was also reported that 500 children were sent
        home after 100 pupils who allegedly drank contaminated water became
        sick, and the town is now relying on local farmers in Kroonstad for
        its water supply;

     3) further notes that Kroonstad will also be without electricity
        because it has an unsettled Eskom bill running into millions;


     4) acknowledges that a clear trend is emerging because what is
        happening in the Free State is happening in other parts of the
        country as well; and


     5) recognises that the system of municipal services is breaking down
        and that the situation in Gauteng, the Free State, Mpumalanga and
        elsewhere is dire.

I so move. [Interjections.]

   That the Council —


     1) notes the renaming of Moroeroe Primary School in Soweto after
        Teboho "Tsietsi" Macdonald Mashinini, a student activist who played
        a pivotal role in the organisation of the 16 June 1976 protest
        against Afrikaans as a compulsory medium of instruction in schools;
        and


     2) takes this opportunity to congratulate the school management and

                   ROBBERY AT PENSION PAYPOINT IN NDWEDWE

                             (Draft Resolution)
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs N W Magadla): Chairperson, I move without
notice:


   That the Council —

                   SAFETY CONCERNS ABOUT USE OF TARA KLAMP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, I move without notice:


   That the Council —


     1) notes with concern that the Tara Klamp that is extensively used by
        the KwaZulu-Natal provincial department of health to circumcise
        thousands of men has been shown in trials conducted in Orange Farm
        to be unsafe and caused a wide range of complications;


     2) further notes that despite the disastrous results of the Orange
        Farm trials, the KwaZulu-Natal department of health continues to
        use the Tara Klamp, thus putting thousands of men’s health at risk;
        and


     3) therefore calls on the KwaZulu-Natal department of health to
        immediately cease the use of the Tara Klamp as a tool for
        circumcision and to only use the forceps-guided method until full
        clinical tests have been successfully done on alternative methods
        of circumcision to prove their safety and efficacy.

I so move.

     TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS FACED BY STUDENTS WRITING FINAL EXAMINATION

Ms M W MAKGATE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

        examination because their school is not registered with Umalusi;

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON REVISED FISCAL
                                  FRAMEWORK

Mr C J DE BEER: Chairperson, this is an historic occasion for this House
today. The House will be dealing with a report of the Select Committee on
Finance on the Revised Fiscal Framework, as tabled by the hon Minister of
Finance last week on 28 October 2010. It is a first for the NCOP.

What is very important is that we must look at and evaluate where we come
from, that is since 22 April 2009, when the people of South Africa made a
decision and gave a mandate to a specific political party, the ANC - to
which I belong and am proud of - to govern South Africa [Applause.] What
does the ANC say in the manifesto on which the people of South Africa took
a decision on 22 April 2009?

The main thrust of fiscal policy, which is countercyclical and expansionary
in approach, is designed to best address main policy goals. The policy
goals include the creation of decent work; sustainable livelihoods;
education; health; rural development; food security and land reform;
enhancing safety and security and the human settlement philosophy, and
programmes as well as local government that address the needs of the
people. This is the policy as defined in that manifesto on page 21. It is
in light of this that the Minister of Finance tabled the Revised Fiscal
Framework to take South Africa forward.

Coming back to the report of the committee, the Select Committee on Finance
conducted its work in terms of section 12(5) of the Money Bills Amendment
Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009, which reads that if the Minister
has tabled a Revised Fiscal Framework, it must be referred to a Joint
Sitting of the Committees on Finance in the NCOP and the National Assembly
for consideration.

The committees received the briefing from the Minister of Finance and the
Department of Treasury on 28 October 2010 and deliberated on the Revised
Fiscal Framework on 29 October 2010. The two timeframes, Parliament’s
programme and the timeframes in the Act, do not gel very well. Parliament
will have to review the parliamentary programme from January to December in
such a way that committees do the work that has to be done as the money
Bills Act requires.

South Africa did not escape the effect of a global economic downturn. Our
fiscal policy stance of the previous years assisted us to get through the
economic crisis better than countries in Europe like Spain, Greece and
Italy. Even America is still battling. A countercyclical fiscal policy
stance is crucial to both long-term growth and sustainability in public
finances. Real gross domestic product, GDP, growth accelerated to a rate
of 3,9% in the first half of this financial year. Expansion in fiscal and
monetary policies and lower inflation supported this growth.

The unemployment rate is high; it’s at 25,3%. The question is: How do we
utilise the present growth rate and projected growth rate of 3,5% in 2011
and 4,4% in 2013 to create jobs for our people? That is the challenge. We
can learn from a country like Brazil that has created 2 million jobs since
2006. China, India and Brazil are developing economies that are leading the
economic growth in the world at this stage.

It will require a change of mind-set from each of us in this country,
together with government’s target of a 7% growth rate over 10 years to
create 5,5 million jobs. We will have to work harder and smarter, and
stringent control over government’s spending will be required. An economic
climate has to be created for ordinary citizens to save more money.

The committee observed that the consolidated government deficit is
projected to decrease from 6,3% of GDP in the 2010-11 financial year
to 3,2% of the GDP in 2013-14 financial year. It further noted that the
projected reduction in government deficit was driven, amongst other things,
by the strong uptake in the revenue and the stabilisation in noninterest
spending.

National Treasury indicated that growth in expenditure will need to
moderate as debt service costs increase over the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework, MTEF, period. National Treasury undertook to continue pursuing a
countercyclical fiscal policy that will aim to grow revenue while gradually
reducing noninterest stimulus spending. However, while meeting growth
expectations, it is important to keep the fiscal trajectory on a
sustainable path.
The committee noted that revenue, as a percentage of the GDP, will increase
at a rate of 0,2% per year over the next three years. Over the same period,
expenditure is expected to decline at a rate of 0,4%, 0,5% and 0,5%
respectively. As revenue increases and expenditure decreases, the budget
deficit is projected to decrease gradually to 0% in the 2018-19 financial
year.

Over the MTEF period, government departments are requested to reprioritise
programmes in order to be efficient and effective. In view of the 2010
audit outcomes by the Auditor-General on various government departments,
this calls for more stringent control measures on expenditure and prudent
financial management. The committee recognises that the revenue-sharing
formula of the Southern African Customs Union, Sacu, is currently under
review and that Sacu’s council will meet in December 2010 to resolve this
matter. The committee accepts that this revision should be done carefully,
without jeopardising the economic stability in member countries. The
committee noted that, over the long term, higher economic growth will
support debt reduction and enable government to rebuild the fiscal space.

The committee noted that the 2010 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,
MTBPS, estimated that the debt amount will be approximately 40% of the GDP
in the 2015-16 financial year. If the economy experiences another recession
and the level of debt is higher than projected in the 2015-16 financial
years, the committee foresees major challenges. While the MTBPS indicated
that the exact level of debt will largely depend on the pace of economic
growth, the committee is of the view that there is still an element of
economic uncertainty. However, the committee fully endorses the fact that
the economy is currently in a solid position.

In conclusion, the committee would like to commend National Treasury for
the fact that South Africa came first in the world in a budget transparency
survey conducted by the International Budget Partnership. We are number one
in the world. This achievement resulted from years of commitment to the
reform of the budget system towards greater transparency and potential for
accountability and participation.

Based on its deliberations, the committee recommended that National
Treasury should take appropriate steps aimed at reducing the level of debt
at a faster rate in order to further create an economic cushion in the
event of another economic recession in the near future. National Treasury
should provide a detailed report to the committee on how government intends
to guarantee fiscal stability, including a contingency plan in the case of
a double-dip recession. This report should be submitted to Parliament
within 45 days after its adoption by the House, and National Treasury
should provide a detailed report to the committee on the impact of a zero-
rating value-added tax on books on the fiscal framework. Finally, National
Treasury should resolve issues pertaining to Sacu’s revenue-sharing formula
as a matter of urgency.

Chairperson, we put this report to the House for adoption. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

IN FAVOUR:  Eastern  Cape,  Free  State,  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Limpopo,

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

                         TRANSPORT LAWS REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson and hon members, the Department of Transport
commissioned the SA Law Commission to undertake the task of revising the
South African Statute Book with a view to identifying and providing
recommendations for the repeal or amendment of legislation that is
inconsistent, redundant or obsolete in terms of the equality clause in the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

The SA Law Commission, in partnership with the Department of Transport,
conducted research about transport legislation and established that there
are 2 800 Acts on the Statute Book. Of these, 218 were identified as Acts
administered by the Department of Transport. The results of the research
indicated that there were some statutes administered by the Department of
Transport that needed to be repealed completely, while others needed to be
repealed partially. The repeal processes affected a total of 51 Acts. At
the same time, certain provisions of 14 Acts were to be repealed. The
committee had to consider the fact that certain Acts and provisions were at
odds with the Constitution and their purpose was no longer relevant to the
new democratic order.

These amending Bills must be viewed in the context of the government policy
that seeks to ensure integrated services. One of the main ways to achieve
this is ensuring that we do not have legislation that will hinder these
processes and ultimately slow down the processes of transformation. As far
back as 1995, discussions took place to ensure that the future transport
system in the new democratic dispensation had as its emphasis a sound
publicly owned transport system that functioned well and provided quality
services to our people.

We should note that the progress over the past 15 years has led to
substantial improvement in the transport system, which has ensured greater
safety, efficiency and affordable transportation. This momentum constituted
a conscious and dedicated effort to ensure not only better service
delivery, but, equally, ways to address the creation of decent jobs within
the sector. This amending Bill is in accordance with these broad
principles.

In addressing the objectives of the Bill, it seeks to repeal a number of
redundant or obsolete laws. The Bill contains two Schedules. Schedule 1
lists Acts that may be repealed in their entirety. These Acts were enacted
for a specific purpose, which has been achieved, and, currently, they need
to be repealed. Schedule 2 seeks to repeal certain provisions of the laws
listed therein that, as a consequence of Schedule 1, have become obsolete.

The Department of Transport presented the Bill to the committee and placed
in context what informed the crafting of the Bill. The committee noted that
Schedule 1 listed Acts that needed to be repealed in their entirety, whilst
Schedule 2 listed laws where only certain provisions needed to be repealed.
The Select Committee on Public Services, having considered the Transport
Laws Repeal Bill, unanimously adopted the Bill without amendments. Members
expressed their satisfaction and unanimously approved the motion and report
supporting the Bill.

In conclusion, the Bill has progressed in line with the drive towards
ensuring better administration of the transport system and strategic goals
of the department as outlined in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework. In
this regard, this Bill seeks to lay the basis for new legislation and
transport policy processes to ensure safe, reliable and efficient public
transport. It should build a process of infrastructure momentum and create
decent jobs and a caring economy.

Having considered the Transport Laws Repeal Bill, which was referred to it
by the National Assembly, the Select Committee on Public Services supports
the Bill without amendments. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

  CONSIDERATIN OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND
  TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS – DRAFT DISASTER MANAGEMENT VOLUNTEER REGULATIONS AND
            EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM ON OBJECTS OF THE REGULATIONS

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND
 TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS – DRAFT REGULATIONS ON PARTICIPATION OF MUNICIPAL STAFF
   MEMBERS AS CANDIDATES FOR NATIONAL, PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chair, the Draft Disaster Management Volunteer Regulations
and Explanatory Memorandum on the Object of the Regulations are regulations
that exist in terms of section 59 of the Disaster Management Act, Act 57 of
2002, which deals with the establishment of a unit of volunteers to
participate in disaster management in a municipal area.

The regulations empower the Minister for Co-operative Governance and
Traditional Affairs in case of a disaster, whether man-made or natural. The
allowance is to bring in volunteers to an area hit by a disaster. The
observation of the committee is that it is satisfied, and the inputs were
consolidated. Therefore, the committee makes a recommendation to the House
to approve that the regulations and memorandum be made effective.

The Draft Regulations on the Participation of Municipal Staff Members as
Candidates for National, Provincial and Municipal Elections are in terms of
section 71(a) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, Act 32 of
2000, as amended in 2008. This provision of the Act empowers the Minister
to prescribe limits and conditions in the form of regulations for all
municipal staff members who, during the election period, stand to be
elected to public office.
In terms of these proposed regulations, a municipal staff member will be
deemed to have resigned from his or her employment from the date of
occupation, on a full-time basis, of the designated public office, either
in the national Parliament, provincial legislature or municipal council.
The observation of the committee is that the regulations make the election
impartial. Therefore the committee agrees and recommends the regulations to
this House for approval, because they are important. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report on Draft Disaster Management Volunteer
Regulations and Explanatory Memorandum on Objects of the Regulations be
adopted.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I shall now put the question in respect
of the Third Order. The question is that the report be adopted.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall allow the provinces the opportunity to
make their declaration of vote if they so wish. Is there any province that
wishes to do so?

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Yes, Mr Bloem.
Mr D V BLOEM: Is there no time for declarations?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: But I just said so.

Mr D V BLOEM: It’s a short one, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Do you want to make a declaration?

Mr D V BLOEM: Yes, please, sir.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Continue. [Interjections.]

Mr D V BLOEM: The question is why did the ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, order, Mr Bloem! Yes, hon Chief Whip.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, on a point of order: Can we check
whether hon Bloem is going to make that declaration on behalf of the Free
State and whether he has a mandate from the Free State province to do so?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Oh, yes. By the way, thank you for that
correction.

Mr D V BLOEM: The Free State gave me the permission, Chair.
[Interjections.] It’s a question ... I’ll change it to a question then.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Let me just check with the head of the
delegation. Does Mr Bloem have a mandate for that? [Interjections.] You do
not have a mandate. Unfortunately, it is a provincial issue, a section 65
matter.

Mr D V BLOEM: It was just a small question, Chair.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We now proceed to the voting. When I call the
name of the province, the delegation head will vote by pressing button four
for those who vote in favour, button two for those who vote against, and
button three for those who abstain.

Have all provinces voted? If you have made a mistake, you have a chance to
correct your voting. The voting is closed. I will call on the staff to give
me the results. All nine provinces voted in favour. I therefore declare the
report adopted in terms of section 65 of the Constitution.

IN FAVOUR:  Eastern  Cape,  Free  State,  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Report on Draft Disaster Management Volunteer  Regulations  and  Explanatory
Memorandum on Objects of the Regulations accordingly adopted  in  accordance

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Finance on the 2010 Revised Fiscal
    Framework, dated 29 October 2010

    The Select Committee on Finance, having considered the 2010 Revised
    Fiscal Framework, reports as follows:

1.    Introduction

Section 12(3) of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters
Act, Act No. 9 of 2009 (the Money Bills Act) requires that the Minister of
Finance tables a revised fiscal framework with the national adjustments
budget if the adjustments budget effects changes to the fiscal framework.

Section 12(5) of the Money Bills Act further requires that the revised
fiscal framework be referred to a joint sitting of the Select Committee on
Finance and the Standing Committee on Finance for consideration and
reporting.

The 2010 revised fiscal framework was tabled in the National Assembly of
Parliament by the Minister of Finance, Mr Pravin Gordan, on 27 October 2010
and the National Assembly referred it to the National Council of Provinces
(NCOP). In the NCOP, the 2010 revised fiscal framework was referred to the
Select Committee on Finance for consideration and reporting. The Select
Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Finance, in a joint
sitting, were briefed by the Minister of Finance and senior officials from
National Treasury on the 2010 revised fiscal framework on the 28 October
2010.

2.    Committee’s Observations

The Select Committee on Finance (the Committee) noted that the consolidated
government deficit is projected to decrease from 6.3 per cent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in the 2010/11 financial year to 3.2 per cent of GDP
in the 2013/14 financial year. The projected reduction in government
deficit was driven, amongst other things, by the strong uptake in revenue
and the stabilization in non-interest spending. National Treasury indicated
that growth in expenditure will need to moderate as debt service costs
increase over the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). National
Treasury undertook to continue to pursue a counter-cyclical fiscal policy
that will aim to grow revenues while gradually reducing non-interest
stimulus spending. It is however important to keep the fiscal trajectory on
a sustainable path while meeting growth expectations.

The Committee noted that revenue, as a percentage of GDP, is increasing at
a rate of 0.2 per cent per year over the next three years (that is 28.7,
28.9 and 29.1 per cent in the 2011/12, 2012/13 and 2013/14 financial years,
respectively). On the same period, expenditure is declining at a rate of
0.4, 0.5 and 0.5 per cent, respectively. As revenue increases and
expenditure decreases, the budget deficit is projected to decrease,
gradually, to zero per cent in the 2018/19 financial year.

Over the MTEF period, government departments are requested to reprioritise
programmes in order to be efficient and effective. In view of the 2010
audit outcomes by the Auditor General on various government departments,
this calls for more stringent control measures on expenditure and prudent
financial management.

The Committee recognizes that the Southern Africa Customs Union’s (SACU)
revenue sharing formula is currently under review and that the SACU’s
Council will meet in December 2010 to resolve this matter. The Committee
accepts that this revision should be done carefully and without
jeopardizing the economic stability in member counties like Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS). The Committee advises that the
revenue sharing formula should be favourable towards the South African
fiscal burden in order to support South Africa’s ability to boost revenue
collection, and consequently increase revenue as a percentage of GDP.

The Committee noted that, over the long term, higher economic growth will
support debt reduction, enabling government to rebuild the fiscal space.

The Committee noted that the 2010 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement
(MTBPS) estimated that the debt amount will be approximately 40 per cent of
GDP in the 2015/16 financial year. If the economy experiences another
recession and the level of debt is as projected in the 2015/16 financial
year, the Committee foresees major challenges. While the MTBPS indicated
that the exact level of debt will largely depend on the pace of economic
growth, the Committee is of the view that there is still an element of
economic uncertainty. The Committee however fully endorses the fact that
the economy is currently in a solid position.

3.    Conclusion
The Committee would like to commend National Treasury that South Africa
scored first in the world in the survey of budget transparency of the
International Budget Partnership. This achievement results from years of
commitment to the reform of the budget system towards greater transparency
and greater potential for accountability and participation.

4.    Recommendations

Having considered the revised fiscal framework and revenue proposals, the
Select Committee on Finance recommends the following:

4.1   That National Treasury should take appropriate steps aimed at
     reducing the level of debt at a faster rate in order to further create
     “an economic cushion” in the event of another economic recession in the
     near term.

4.2   That National Treasury should provide a detailed report to the
     Committee on how Government intends to guarantee fiscal stability
     including a contingency plan in case of a “double dip” recession. This
     report should be submitted to Parliament within 45 days after the
     adoption of this report by the House.

4.3   That National Treasury should provide a detailed report to the
     Committee on the impact of a zero rating value added tax (VAT) on books
     on the fiscal framework. This report should be submitted to Parliament
     within 45 days after the adoption of this report by the House.

4.4   That National Treasury should resolve issues pertaining to the SACU’s
     revenue sharing formula as a matter of urgency.
4.5   That the House accepts the Revised Fiscal Framework.
