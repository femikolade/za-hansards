                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the Council, I shall move:

   That the Council -

   (1)      notes that 19 October 2010 marked the 33rd anniversary of Press
         Freedom Day in South Africa, a day when the apartheid regime took a
         decision to suppress any dissenting voice by muzzling and
         suppressing the freedom of the media to prevent reporting on the
         political suppression and abuse of the majority of the people of
         South Africa;
      2) further notes that the ANC remained at the forefront of the fight
         for press freedom, as a central feature of the fight for liberation
         of the people of South Africa against the shackles of apartheid,
         political suppression and socioeconomic marginalisation;

      3) acknowledges that almost 16 years since the demise of apartheid in
         South Africa the ANC-led government has led a quest to create an
         environment free of oppression, persecution and repressive
         legislation where the freedom of the press and other essential
         elements, such as freedom of expression and freedom of speech form
         the cornerstone of our constitutional democracy, are guaranteed and
         are protected by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa;


      4) further acknowledges the ANC’s call and commitment to engaging the
         media and other media formations such as the Press ... [Time
         expired.]


The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon member, unfortunately, your time
has expired. Your motion will be printed on the Order Paper in full.

Mr M C MAINE: Chairperson, on behalf of the ANC, I hereby give notice that
on the next sitting day of the Council I shall move:


   That the Council -
      1) notes that embattled Cope sank into deeper waters yesterday when
         its president announced the suspension of his deputy president
         Mbhazima Shilowa, party national organiser Mluleki George and the
         parliamentary administrator Lolo Mashiane;


      2) further notes that in the Western Cape Cope structures are calling
         for the provincial executive committee under the leadership of
         Mbulelo Ncedana, which is aligned to the now suspended Cope deputy
         president, to be disbanded; and


      3) takes this opportunity to make a clarion call to all those who left
         the ANC to come back home where they belong.

[Applause.][Laughter.]

Mr D B FELDMAN: Chairperson, I give notice on behalf of Cope that on the
next sitting day of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council debates the failure of the ANC executive to understand
  the constitutional imperative and inviolability of the separation of
  powers as demonstrated by the Minister of State Security, in this
  instance, trying to push the ad hoc committee to approve the Protection
  of Information Bill, even though it clearly appears to the ad hoc
  committee to be unconstitutional.

[Applause.]
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next
sitting day of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council -


      1) notes with utter disdain reports that the South Gauteng leader of
         the DA, Dot Corrigan, receives two salaries from two different
         municipalities in the province, one as a councillor in the City of
         Johannesburg, and the other as an official and senior municipal
         director in the DA-run Midvaal municipality;


      2) further notes that when asked about the two salaries in light of
         vast unemployment, Corrigan dismissed the queries as professional
         jealousy; and

      3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible terms
         the blatant looting of public funds and the silence of the DA,
         which has taken the moral high ground on issues of good governance,
         but clearly shows its bias and inability to deal with this self-
         enrichment and looting of public funds.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I give notice on behalf of Cope ...
[Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: Which one?
Mr K A SINCLAIR: The real one. [Laughter.]

Mr K A SINCLAIR: ... that on the next sitting day of the Council I shall
move:

   That the Council debates the failure of the SABC-ANC board ...

[Laughter.] Sorry!

   ... the SABC board and its chairman to fulfil its fiduciary and statutory
   responsibilities and obligations, leading to the SABC floating as a
   rudderless ship unable, amongst other things, to broadcast a football
   match between the South African national side and Mali, and failing in
   many other regards on account of poor governance, possible political
   interference and absent leadership.

Mr S S MAZOSIWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting
of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council -

      1) notes reports that the flagging Cope is broke and battling to raise
         funds for its upcoming national elective conference, scheduled to
         be held in the Free State in two weeks’ time;


      2) further notes that –

            a) infighting over leadership positions between interim
               president Mosiuoa Lekota and deputy president Mbhazima
               Shilowa, as well as the abuse of party-allocated funding
               through political allegiance, have alienated potential
               funders and divided the membership of Cope into groups of
               those against or for Lekota and Shilowa; and


            b) five months after the aborted Centurion conference, where
               delegates representing the warring factions caused damage
               worth an undisclosed amount of money, Cope is yet to settle
               the more than R2 million bill for the St George’s Hotel; and

      3) takes this opportunity to call on those who left or were misled
         into leaving the ANC by disgruntled individuals and power mongers
         who could not accept the internal democratic processes of the ANC,
         to come back and rejoin the nation’s quest to advance the lives of
         the people of South Africa in and by the ANC-led government.

Mr Z MLENZANA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that on
the next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council debates the shocking announcement by the Hawks to
  unilaterally call off the investigation into the arms deal ...
   The arms deal! -

   ... in the face of a specific request by Parliament to continue the
   probe, and especially as the French, German and English authorities have
   now been uncovering important information that would have been useful in
   the probe.

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chairperson, I hereby wish to give notice on behalf of
the “real” Cope ... [Laughter.] ... that on the next sitting day I shall
move:

   That the Council debates the advisability and propriety of using part of
  the Police budget to fund purchases of luxury vehicles for numerous
  senior officers, while at the same time allowing them the use of police
  vehicles as well.

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, on behalf of the DA I hereby wish to give notice
that on the next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council -

      1) wishes all the learners writing their matric examinations the best
         of luck; and


      2) acknowledges that the matriculants of today will be the leaders of
         the nation in the future. Good luck!

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Chairperson, I hereby wish to give notice on behalf of
Cope that on the next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council debates the extent to which the Minister of Housing has
  made concrete and visible his statement during his budget debate that
  “housing is not just about building houses” but that “It is about
  transforming our residential areas and building communities with closer
  access to work and social amenities, including sports and recreation
  facilities”.

                NONDISTRIBUTION OF 85 TRACTORS IN MPUMALANGA


                            (Draft Resolution)

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —

      1) notes with utter dismay and serious contempt reports that the
         Mpumalanga department of agriculture has failed to distribute 85
         tractors worth an estimated R34 million;

      2) further notes that the tractors donated by President Jacob Zuma
         were part of a R500 million government Masibuyele eMasimini
         programme which seeks to provide black farmers with hi-tech farming
         equipment;

      3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
         such a degree of irresponsible and reckless usage of public funds
         and undermining of the President’s commitment to fight rural
         poverty, food insecurity and unemployment; and

      4) calls on the Mpumalanga Premier and the responsible MEC to ensure
         that this incident is investigated and that those responsible are
         made to take full responsibility.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      FATAL COLLISION IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M P JACOBS: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —

      1) notes that a head-on crash on Saturday, 23 October, killed
         19 people and injured seven when a bakkie hit a minibus taxi in
         eastern KwaZulu-Natal;


      2) further notes that the driver of the bakkie allegedly failed to
         negotiate a bend and collided head-on with the minibus taxi;

      3) acknowledges that road crashes, exacerbated by irresponsible
         driving and unroadworthy vehicles, continue to rob our nation and
         many families of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children;


      4) takes this opportunity to convey its profound condolences to the
         families of those who lost their lives and wishes a speedy recovery
         to those injured; and

      5) declares its support for the festive season safe driving programmes
         and initiatives by declaring, “Stay alert, stay alive!”

      6)
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             CRIME IN MOTHERWELL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T M H MOFOKENG: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —

      1) notes that the South African Police Service indicates that 80% of
         crimes committed in South Africa’s third most populous township,
         Motherwell in Port Elizabeth, are alcohol related;

      2) further notes that Motherwell, which is located approximately 20 km
         from Port Elizabeth, 3 km from Coega and 20 km from Uitenhage, has
         106 licensed taverns and hundreds of illegal shebeens, which has
         resulted in more cases of violent crime, robbery, drunk driving,
         and disorderly arrests; and


      3) takes this opportunity to call on the local police station and
         provincial commissioner, as well as the Metro Police, to reclaim
         the area from criminal elements who display an utter disregard for
         the rule of law and the constitutional rights of community members.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    UNFULFILLED PROMISE OF JULIUS MALEMA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —

      1) notes that the ANC Youth League has failed to deliver wheelchairs
         to the Ikhwezi Lokusa School for children with disabilities;


      2) also notes that more than a year after promising these currently
         disadvantaged children that they would receive wheelchairs, no
         wheelchairs have been delivered;


      3) further notes that the leader of the ANC Youth League, Julius
         Malema, until recently received protection from the state that cost
         millions of rand and was paid for by taxpayers;


      4) condemns the unfulfilled promise of wheelchairs made to
         disadvantaged children, a promise that seems to have been made more
         for political gain than for the benefit of these desperate
         children; and

      5) therefore calls upon the ANC Youth League to immediately make good
         on its promise to supply wheelchairs to the poor children at the
         Ikhwezi Lokusa School and to cease to make idle promises simply for
         political gain which are hurtful to the very people they purport to
         assist.

There being an objection, the motion without notice became a notice of
motion.

                  FAILURE OF KZN DA LEADER TO WALK THE TALK

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —

      1) notes that the people of KwaZulu-Natal should be clear that the DA
         does not walk the talk, this after their KwaZulu-Natal leader was
         exposed as someone who is not honest, even with his wife and two
         daughters;


      2) further notes that John Steenhuisen must not be redeployed to the
         national Parliament but must step down to show remorse for his
         infidelity with another DA official; and

      3) notes the silence of the media on issues that touch the DA.

There being an objection, the motion without notice became a notice of
motion.

         criminals are brought to book to face the full might of the law.

         months after 10 children died when the taxi they were in collided

                                   NETWORK

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, members of the NCOP, distinguished
guests, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. I must start by expressing my
sincere sympathy and condolences to the family and relatives of the 19
people who were killed last Saturday in a head-on collision between a
minibus taxi and a bakkie at Franklin near Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal and to
the family of the 15-year-old Mpho Nyembe from Alexandra in Johannesburg,
who was killed in a senseless schoolboy prank on Friday, 22 October. We
wish all those injured a speedy recovery.

A few weeks ago we stopped 750 vehicles at a roadblock on the main road
entering East London in the Eastern Cape. Out of those 750, in 438 vehicles
some of the drivers were found to be drunk! I was there and it was between
09:00 and 11:00 in the morning! The drivers of 438 vehicles were found to
be drunk, not wearing seatbelts, or driving stolen or unlicensed vehicles,
or taxis without the relevant permits. If this is the picture in just one
province and one municipality, we have a serious problem indeed. It is why
we are experiencing so many accidents and deaths on our roads.

The roadblocks we are manning are meant to make our roads safer. To date,
since 1 October 2010, more than 914 000 vehicles have been stopped through
the new National Rolling Enforcement Plan, NREP. By the end of this week we
will have exceeded our target of one million cars per month, and we are not
going to stop. We are going to intensify the new NREP by stopping one
million cars per month until South Africans start to behave.

Our agency, the Road Traffic Management Corporation, RTMC, has a multimedia
project which we are rolling out in some schools in South Africa. It is a
multimedia project which we intend expanding. We intend having more road
safety lessons in it, targeting Grade 11 and 12 learners in preparation for
their learner driving licence. We have already signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Department of Basic Education in regard to this
matter. We have already started the process of resuscitating the Junior
Traffic Training Centres, as well as allowing children to have practical
exposure to road safety.

As indicated above, road safety lessons will be taught under Life Skills in
all our schools. We are in the process of developing learning materials and
working with some private sector industries in putting together different
types of modules. This will assist our efforts to reduce road traffic
crashes.

In our Budget Vote this year we articulated the importance of the
implementation of effective and sustainable road and rail infrastructure
networks and services. So, with our students, we want to have a situation
in which, when they get their matric certificates, there is a matric
certificate in the one hand and a driving licence in the other. The days
should be gone when we classify ourselves as a fast-developing country, yet
we have 25-year-olds who can’t ride a bicycle, can’t ride a horse, can’t
swim, and can’t drive a car. What sort of a developed country is that?

While the role of transport in our economy is well documented, our people
are also aware of the importance of transport from their everyday
experiences. They go to work, to school, to hospitals and to visit friends
and relatives. The presence or absence of an efficient public transport
system can be a matter of life and death to a terminally ill person in the
rural parts of our country. Transport affects all spheres of our
development and human endeavours.

As government, we must show we care about the huge impact that transport
has on the lives of our people, as well as on our economic growth and
development. Our ability to spearhead growth and development will therefore
be partly measured by our success in providing or our failure to provide a
transport system consistent with the demands of our economy.

For this reason, I want to make a brief reference to the National Household
Travel Survey 2003. According to the survey, 38 million citizens live in
households with no access to a car; 14 million learners walk to school;
13,7 million citizens use public transport at least once a week; and
7 million workers and learners use public transport.

Furthermore, there are 10 million vehicles in South Africa, but only
7 million licensed drivers. If we have 7 million licensed drivers, the
logical question we must ask is: Who drives the other 3 million vehicles?
It is quite clear, however, that despite the growth in motor vehicle use,
public transport and walking are still the predominant lifeline forms of
mobility for the vast majority of South Africans.

Hon members, it is against this backdrop that in March 2007 Cabinet
approved the Public Transport Strategy and Action Plan 2007-20. This was in
order to create a lasting legacy of public transportation in South Africa.

The strategy consists of upgraded model fleet facilities, stops and
stations; extended hours of operation to between 16 and 24 hours; peak
frequencies of 5 to 10 minutes; off-peak frequencies of 10 to 30 minutes;
and an hourly night service. Its targets are that 85% of all residents in
urban areas will be within one kilometre of the rapid public transport
network by 2020; that there will be safe and secure operation monitoring by
intelligent transport system control centres; that there will be electronic
fare integration and single ticketing when making transfers; that there
will be an integrated feeder service, including walking, cycling and taxi
networks; and that there will be a car-competitive public transport option
which enables strict peak period car use management.

These plans, ladies and gentlemen, require efficient planning, skilled
manpower, and funding mechanisms. This approach comprises the Metrorail
Rail Priority Corridors and the Gauteng Rapid Rail Link, as well as bus
rapid transit corridors. It also includes the recapitalisation and
regulation of taxi services. The three spheres of government are already
working closely together to ensure the speedy implementation of this plan.

The bus rapid transit, BRT, buses are already operating in the City of
Johannesburg and in Cape Town. The department has advanced with BRT plans
in metropolitan cities and related provinces, and BRT plans are advanced in
the Mangaung, Polokwane, Rustenburg, Mbombela and Buffalo City
municipalities.

In line with our public transport strategy and plan, we also have to
interrogate the machinery of our road-based public transport in order to
develop a national passenger road plan. The plan is now servicing our
framework for the integration of the road-based public transport system.
Most importantly, it serves as a guide in transforming the subsidised
commuter bus regime into an integrated road-based public transport system.

Chairperson, apartheid’s spatial distance must become a thing of the past
in a democratic South Africa. In this regard, our public transport strategy
also stresses greater emphasis on the improvement of passenger rail
services, which are both short- and long-distance services. Our plan is
centred on reducing the kilometre distance to time or travelling distance.
The journey from Johannesburg to Durban should not be measured in terms of
kilometres any more. It takes one hour by air, six hours by car and 12
hours by train to travel from Johannesburg to Durban. It takes 2 hours by
air, almost 13 hours by car and almost 20 hours by train from Johannesburg
to Cape Town. Yet if one uses the EuroStar, it takes about 2 hours from
London to Paris or Brussels. The distance of over 2000 km from Beijing to
Shanghai, which is scheduled for completion in 2012, will take about three
hours by high-speed train.

There was a time when it was said with some pride that there was no hurry
in Africa. There was a time when we lived in splendid isolation from the
rest of the world. If we persist with the prevailing notion that there is
no hurry in Africa, then the world is going to pass us by. If doing
business and moving people and goods in South Africa takes forever, the
world is going to pass us by. Throughout the world today people and goods
move with speed. The slow strive to become faster, and the faster strive to
be faster still, yet our long-distance rail in South Africa has stood
still.

Our National Transport Master Plan 2005-50 should therefore move from being
a plan to an operation. Our emphasis on passenger rail services is premised
on the fact that this is a prime mass mover of our people, particularly
workers who commute daily between areas of work and their residences. It
makes sense therefore that an efficient rail system would massively assist
in the resolution of our public transport problems.

Cabinet has also approved the National Passenger Rail Plan, which is our
initiative to secure the future of commuter rail by applying the priority
corridor strategy to the rail network throughout the country. The intention
is to extend rail services to areas previously not covered and to improve
the efficiency of the existing passenger rail lines. Here we have funding
challenges for refurbishment of rolling stock and purchasing of new
coaches. Committed funding of R16 billion to improve our passenger rail
system in the next three years could ease the situation but additional
funds are required.

In the past four years, as a department we have had a series of challenges
with regard to rail security. Scenes of vandalism, cable theft and
vandalism of property have featured prominently at our rail platforms.
Special attention has been given to improving security measures within the
railway environment. This strategy includes a co-operative agreement with
the South African Police Service to invest in security-related
infrastructure. To date, the construction of police stations at the Cape
Town, Durban, Retreat, Bellville and Philippi stations has been completed.

With the reintroduction of the railway police, we have seen a significant
drop in crime on our trains, as well as at our train stations. Crime has
been cut down by more than 38% to date.

The move to rail does not mean we must abandon our road network. We are
merely seeking to implement the appropriate balance of people and goods on
both road and rail. In this regard, the Road Infrastructure Strategic
Framework for South Africa identified six critical areas for intervention
if our roads are to serve as catalysts for required development.

There is one Minister of Transport, and there are nine provincial MECs, and
the municipal mayors, who each have responsibility for sections of the
750 000 km of our country’s road network. Yet an ordinary South African
does not care whether a road in a rural area is owned and maintained by the
local authority or by the national authority. All they want is for the road
to be usable, whether it is raining or not. We have the capacity in the
developed authorities, coupled with limited or no capacity at the
developing authority level.
The other area which is as critical is the development and maintenance of
information and decisions in support systems. Information about the state
of a road is very important in determining what maintenance work is
required and when this should be done. To give a quick illustration, we
know that about 80% of our road network is now older than the 20-year
design life. This is based on information from 64% of the roads, primarily
national, provincial and in some cities. Only 4% of municipal road
information was obtainable in this exercise.

The biggest challenge with our roads is that by the time a problem is
visible on the surface it means we are somewhat late with remedial action.
On the other hand, when the road is deteriorating without showing the
stress on the surface, we often do not see the need to make the necessary
interventions. For this reason, we have now agreed as Cabinet and Treasury
that there will be dedicated funding for road maintenance right across the
board from national and provincial to local levels.

In a context such as ours, where there are competing demands on the fiscus,
this competition leads to inadequate allocations and delays, which
ultimately means we intervene when it is too expensive to do so. This is
often prompted by the outcry about potholes, as we have recently witnessed.
I encourage all participants to learn from these lessons.

Most industries in South Africa face globalisation and transformation
challenges but the South African transport and logistics industry faces its
own peculiarities that impact on the country as a whole. This industry
comprises tens of thousands of individual truck and bakkie owners, as well
as some of South Africa’s largest conglomerates. These all experience
reliability and cost-efficiency challenges. They are faced with assets that
struggle across inadequate road, rail and port infrastructure. Rail and
port services are integral to all freight transport and logistics
companies, whether bulk or parcel.

The road versus rail debate has raged since the early 1990s. The spiral,
however, started long before that, when maintenance budgets were cut and
investment decisions deferred. The downward spiral started when customers
started moving off rail. Fewer customers meant less revenue on some routes.
This, in turn, made it difficult to justify continued investment in and
maintenance of infrastructure. Poor infrastructure resulted in poor service
and drove even more customers away. The cycle continues.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is only through huge investment in skills,
infrastructure and our knowledge base that our transport system can drive
our economy upwards.
Lastly, to our matric learners, we hope that as they sit for their
examinations the road will rise to meet them. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Thank you very much, hon Minister. May
I just bring to the attention of the House the fact that the Minister has
disinvested in his response time.

Mr M P JACOBS: Chairperson, hon Chief Whip and hon Minister of Transport –
all protocol observed – our theme today is: “Building a reliable and safe
public transport network”. This theme should be adopted as our Bible in the
Department of Transport, and should be religiously adhered to, because it
is our guide. The theme explains the gist of what we should be doing, which
needs the co-operation of all road users.

Reliability means that our transport should be consistent in executing its
job, meaning consistently and without failure ferrying passengers on time
from point A to point B. Our trains and buses should be timekeepers for the
ordinary man on the street. Our passengers should have confidence in the
services, knowing quite well that they will arrive on time wherever they
are being ferried.

Safety means passengers board our buses and trains knowing that their lives
are safe. Drivers at all levels should obey the rules of the road and take
the interests of their passengers to heart. They must be sensitive,
respectful and courteous in their operations. Passengers can take a nap in
our modes of transport knowing that they will arrive at work or at home
safe. This is the kind of transport system we envisage in our country, but
also, the success of our transport system depends on the good
infrastructure that we should have.

This debate comes at a time when research is showing that the carnage on
our roads is increasing. The most recent carnage occurred at Kokstad over
the weekend. Our roads have become death traps. The lives of our people
have become cheap. Road hogs have lost respect for the sanctity of life. It
is now the norm for a human being to become a statistic of road accidents.
Those passengers were family members en route to their workplace, but their
lives were cut short by irresponsible road users. We cannot go on like
this. We need to do something drastic. We need to give those transgressors
little place to hide. One life lost is one life too many.

A recent survey shows that most of the road accidents were caused by
drivers with alcohol in their bloodstream. Six out of ten drivers who die
in accidents have a high level of alcohol in their blood. An investigation
into substance abuse has indicated that 50% of truck drivers and 30% of
taxi drivers had been drinking or smoking marijuana when the accidents
occurred. Our people are dying, but we are paralysed and simply ball
watching.

During this Transport Month we must encourage all drivers to obey the rules
and laws of the road in order to reduce road accidents. We need to
encourage taxi drivers and their associations to act responsibly to save
the lives of their clients. They need to inculcate confidence in their
industry. We cannot create lawlessness in this country by condoning the
actions of irresponsible drivers. We need to be decisive, strict and on the
offensive with regard to the road hogs and transgressors.

We also have to look at ourselves. Some of our traffic officers are corrupt
and demand bribes for issuing driving licences and not issuing fines for
traffic offences. It has become difficult for an ordinary person to make
reservations for learner’s licence and driving licence tests because those
officers demand exorbitant amounts for the jobs they are supposed to be
doing for free. We need to encourage whistle-blowers and have the
assistance of the Hawks, if we do not want to have a corrupt country.

Hhayi-ke Ngqongqoshe wethu, mawusebenze umthetho, futhi mababoshwe. [Very
well, our Minister, let the law take its course, and they must be
arrested.]

We are prepared to amend laws to give stiff penalties. Let us make road
offences treasonable offences.

We applaud the national and Gauteng governments for having introduced the
Gautrain, which has become a reliable rail network system. We urge the
government to extend this facility to Soweto, Mamelodi, Sebokeng, Matlosana
and KwaThema. That is where the majority of our people are. This facility
should also be extended to places like Khayelitsha, KwaMashu, Mangaung and
KwaZakhele because these are the places where our people need it most. Let
us not forget that those are the people who put us into power.

We also applaud the Rea Vaya bus system which was introduced during the
Fifa World Cup. We urge that the challenges which bedevilled this industry
should be addressed as a matter of urgency, because it should be a
reputable transport system. This facility must also be extended to other
provinces. We also cannot allow the MyCiTi bus transport system in Cape
Town to be a white elephant, because these buses are ferrying “ghosts” to
and from the airport — they run almost empty. Let us redirect that service
to where it is needed. I thank you. [Applause]

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON: (Mr R J Tau): Hon members, would you please not
consult your speakers’ lists, because the one that I have here will not
necessarily be the same as the one that you have.

Mr R V CARLISLE: (Western Cape): Thank you, Chair, and also thank you to
the Whippery for allowing me to move my position; otherwise I would be in
some trouble in the Other Place.
It’s an important privilege to be allowed to address you on this subject
and also to be here with my hon national Minister. I do want to go to the
heart of these kinds of problems. This is Transport Month. Hon Jacobs was
speaking, and I am going to be just a little naughty with something he
said. He said, “If you travel on the train, you can take a nap.” I want to
tell you it is impossible to take a nap if you catch a train from
Khayelitsha to Cape Town or from Mabopane to Pretoria, because you are
standing up, you are squeezed, you are late and you are travelling in
circumstances that are an offence to your human dignity.

That is really where I want to focus the discussion, because this is an
issue that transcends party-political divides. It’s got nothing to do with
party-political divides. It’s about hard decisions that we as a nation have
to make.

Let me say this. When we think of public transport, we should think first
of those people who have no alternative but public transport. There are
many other people that we think of in addition to these, in regard to
public transport. How can we get Mr Smith out of his car and into the train
or the bus? Yes, that’s important! But what is really important are the
people who live in the southeast of Cape Town, who have no alternative but
the train or the taxi or the bus. They must be our first responsibility and
our public transport system must first be a people’s public transport
system. That has to be the key priority.
That is the argument, and I want to use this opportunity, which is a very
special one for me, to speak to all nine provinces. I really want to try to
convince you that our first responsibility – and it’s not an easy
responsibility, as I will spell out in a moment – must be a people’s public
transport service. It doesn’t have to be very fancy, but it has to have
those things that are important.

Tomorrow I will be travelling in to work from Kuyasa, and I do this
frequently. I talk to the people on the train, when you can get near them.
You know, those trains are so overcrowded. The hon Minister has made
reference to this. In fact, he said in this very place some months ago:

   Unless we invest heavily in those trains, in Metrorail, there will be no
   train service in any city in South Africa in the next 10 years.


We must take heed of those words, and I’m going to come to them.

When you ask people, they say, first of all, the two things that they need
most from trains are safety and predictability. That is, not just safety on
the trains or on the buses, but safety getting to the transport interchange
and going from their destination to their work, and then going back home
again afterwards. So, it is not just safety on public transport, but also
getting to it. Secondly, transport should be predictable, so that we should
not have a situation as we have in Cape Town, as we have in Tshwane, and as
we have elsewhere, where the vast majority of people coming to work by
public transport are late each day and it’s not their fault. So, it must be
predictable, it must be on time and it must be safe.

We need also to remember that because we have upside-down cities created by
apartheid, where the poor and those most in need of transport most often
live furthest from the city centre or from the places of work, we have a
particular problem in this regard. This is really where I seek to gain
support for a hard decision from the National Council of Provinces.

The hon Minister has spoken, as have many others, about the success of the
Gautrain, and the intention to replicate the Gautrain, perhaps from
Johannesburg to Durban, or whatever the case may be.

The hon Minister has spoken about his deep concerns about the roads and the
necessity to create a road fund on which we can draw. The hon Minister has
also spoken of his deep concerns about Metrorail. At the same time
periphery roads are being built, particularly in Gauteng, at a cost of over
R65 billion. These roads will be tolled but at the end of the day someone
has to pay for them.

Then there is long-distance rail. We would like to see a lot of money going
into that. Also, the bus rapid transit, BRT, system, this one here — which
has not been without its difficulties — will cost us R5 billion by the time
it is finished.

The hard decision that we have to face as a nation is that while all of
this is happening tax revenues are dropping like that, and social network
requirements are rising. The simple fact of the matter is that we cannot
afford all those good things. We can only afford some of those good things.
The hard decision we have to make as a nation is: Which good things can we
afford, and which can we not afford at this time? Maybe sometime in the
future, when we have a growth rate of 15%, like China, or 8%, like India,
we can afford them then, but there are some things we cannot afford now.

What I am terrified of is that we will invest in luxuries and neglect the
people’s public transport. Taking this opportunity of speaking, as I say,
across the nation, which is one I have very seldom, I want to ask you this,
also looking at your own constituencies, wherever they may be. What
decision do we, as the decision-makers of South Africa, have to come to?
What is the order in which we put these things? I want to suggest to you
that there are two things that come above all others.

I want to suggest this to you by way of a true story from the Tyhume
Valley. In the Tyhume Valley there were once three great educational
institutions, where many of the great struggle leaders were educated, and
where there was prosperous farming. Now there is only one left. A friend of
mine, who is anxious to get farming going again in the Tyhume Valley, and
who is looking at the possibility of fragrances, in speaking to the local
people there said, “We can do this. We can find funds for this.” And they
said to him, “You can find as much funding as you like, but in the Tyhume
Valley a bakkie won’t last longer than six months, and you cannot farm
without a bakkie.”

I tell you this little story because, unless we can keep our roads usable,
what is true of the Tyhume Valley and of Alice is true of the whole
country. We must be able to maintain our roads. We need the money to
maintain our roads, and the will to maintain our roads must be very high.

The second thing is that we have to reinvest in Metrorail. In my province,
you cannot operate the people’s public transport without Metrorail. You can
build BRTs till they come out of your ears, but you cannot operate this
city of 3,5 million people without Metrorail. The same, to a great extent,
is true in Johannesburg and Tshwane.

We have to rebuild Metrorail. Its coaches are so old that they are worse
than the “amaphela” [sedan cars that operate as taxis in the townships].
Believe me, they are worse than the “amaphela”. There has been no
significant investment in Metrorail for nearly 40 years.

So, in closing, Mr Chairman, my appeal to the provinces is this. Let us
look hard at how the nation spends its money. Let us ensure, before it
spends it on anything else in the transport field, that it spends it first
on the people’s public transport and on the people’s roads. [Applause.]

Mr T M KAUNDA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,
KwaZulu-Natal, KZN, would like to extend a special word of gratitude to the
national Department of Transport led by hon Mr Sibusiso Ndebele for
deciding to launch the national Transport Month on 27 September 2010 in our
province.

The Minister and his provincial counterpart, KZN MEC for Transport, hon
Willies Mchunu, led a tour of the Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu, INK,
programme’s underground railway station to mark the launch of Transport
Month at Bridge City in KwaMashu. The Minister has rightly emphasised the
importance of rail as a key part of our transport plans into the future. We
are in agreement that rail remains a pillar of our strategy towards safer
roads and the reduction of crashes on our roads. The Minister has also
announced that a railway-public transport link is on the cards. This
project will link Durban and Johannesburg as one of the busiest corridors
in South Africa. This will indeed improve the quality of our public
transport.

We are also in agreement that rail is a key part of our strategy to reduce
transport-related emissions into the environment, as well as to reduce our
country’s carbon footprint. Rail is a key part of preparing our country for
this inevitable reduction and an end to fossil fuels, for which the world
is also preparing.

During the national launch of Transport Month we as a province pledged
ourselves to support all the programmes brought to us by the national
Department of Transport. We also appreciated the fact that the Minister
officiated at the opening of Transport Month three days before the start of
the actual Transport Month, which gave us an opportunity to subsequently
have our own provincial launch in Durban on 30 September 2010. We have
since had a strong focus on all areas pertaining to transportation, namely
the user, the operator and the infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on
road safety.

The province of KwaZulu-Natal has experienced an increase in the number of
fatalities on our roads during the past few months up until this past
weekend, which saw 19 people dying in one incident. With the festive season
around the corner, some drastic measures have had to be taken. To this end,
we have developed a framework which has provided an opportunity to show
renewed direction on ways to achieve increased road safety outcomes and
advocate a shared responsibility for road safety among all stakeholders,
including government, business and society at large.

We realised that changing the road use culture might take time, and some
changes are not possible without the active co-operation of multiple
sectors. Hence, we have committed ourselves to creating a safe road
environment by reducing road fatalities by 5% a year between 2010 and 2015.
We have planned interventions in accordance with the five E’s, that is
Education, Enforcement, Engineering, Encouragement and Evaluation.

Each of the three spheres of government has responsibilities in respect of
the five E’s on their own road networks in KZN. Each one also has functions
that impact on the road networks of other spheres of government. Because of
this, close co-operation is required between all spheres of government to
achieve the goals set for the reduction of accidents through improved
engineering that is informed by effective consultation between the province
and local governments. The sharing of road development planning and
engineering expertise can only be meaningful if there is proper
consultation and collaboration.

The KZN department of transport will develop and implement programmes for
improving the driving skills of new and existing drivers. Role models are
emerging among truck and taxi drivers, thanks to the national driver
contests which are spearheaded by the national Department of Transport and
the Road Traffic Management Corporation, RTMC, as well as the provinces. We
are scheduled to introduce a pilot project which will be run at selected
testing stations, whereby persons who have just obtained their driving
licences will be subjected to a mandatory road safety session focusing on
basic road safety rules.

In support of the 1 Million Vehicle campaign initiated by the national
Department of Transport, KwaZulu-Natal has a target of 170 000 vehicles and
drivers to be stopped. Between 1 and 21 October the province’s statistics
were as follows: the number of vehicles stopped was 110 155; the number of
drivers tested for alcohol was 88 698; the number of drivers without
driving licences was 1 364; the statistic for inconsiderate driving was 27;
the number of vehicles without a licence was 790; there were 15 307 written
charges; there were 20 drunk drivers; the number of vehicles that were
suspended was 504; and there were 9 speed arrests.

Other than the road safety campaigns, during the month of October the KZN
department of transport engaged in numerous activities in various
communities in the province. These activities confirm the commitment by our
government to see future economic growth through efficiency in the
transport sector.

We have always assured our people — even before the 2010 Fifa World Cup —
that whilst our focus was more on 2010 and beyond and despite being
adversely affected by the recession, we would not cut costs to the
detriment of the people of our province. We have continued to provide
transport infrastructure, particularly to our rural communities, against
all odds. Some roads and bridges that have been completed are being handed
over to the communities during this Transport Month. From 1 October to date
we have officially handed over five road infrastructure projects to the
value of R314 million.

We are happy that, in line with our policy, the construction costs of these
projects always remain an economic benefit to the local communities, where
contractors source all materials from the area and employ all available
artisans, as well as labour, from the nearby communities, using labour-
intensive methods in the interests of job creation. On completion, local
roads are maintained by our Zibambele road maintenance programme, which is
an exemplary part of the national Expanded Public Works Programme, as it is
renowned for creating work opportunities for the poorest of the poor, that
is households where there is no food to put on the table, and no money for
school fees – ikati lilele eziko [poverty-stricken].

Allow me to conclude by thanking you for this opportunity to share with you
our province’s challenges and achievements. The KwaZulu-Natal department of
transport, with its minimal funding – we must note, Chairperson, that we
require more funds to deal with the backlog that is there still – is
committed to creating a safe and reliable transport system throughout the
province. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, comrades and
friends, today’s debate comes at an opportune time, when we are approaching
the much dreaded period associated with carnage on our roads. It is
regrettable that the festive season, which should be a time of joy, family
reunion and much needed end of the year relaxation, should turn into a
period of sadness for the majority of the people in our country as a result
of road accidents.

The ANC government has supported the use of safe modes of transport and the
use of safe railways for our people. For example, the formation of the
Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, Prasa, was the culmination of the
programme set up before 1994. In Gauteng, 600 000 people a day use the
railways as a means of transport to commute to work. In Cape Town also,
people use rail to commute to work.

The challenge of late trains impacts negatively on the commuters because
late trains cause them to arrive at work late, where some employers
understand the reasons for their coming late, but mostly employers do not
understand, which results in people being dismissed from work.

The people badly affected by a lack of railway networks are the people
commuting between the far Eastern Cape and East London, where they are
wholly dependent on buses and taxis. The people commuting between North
West and Gauteng, and parts of Mpumalanga and Gauteng, also use buses and
taxis. These are examples that indicate a dire need for rail transport.

Our commitment as the ANC to making rail transport a mode of choice for
freight and passengers is due to the high number of road accidents between
Polokwane and Gauteng, and Mpumalanga and Gauteng, especially during peak
holiday periods like the Easter Weekend and other festive seasons, which
has triggered a lot of discussion documents within the ANC. Now is the time
for action to adopt rail as the mode of transport in order to stop the road
carnage between the above-mentioned areas. There are other initiatives,
like the rail superhighway between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, which is a
strategic move that should be implemented as a matter of urgency.

It is also regrettable that the taxis and buses which are responsible for
transporting the majority of our population are competing with cars as
culprits in causing road accidents. The only way we can reduce the high
fatality rate of accidents is by making rail transport the number one
choice for our people. As we are building a reliable and safe road
infrastructure, as one of the main contributors to building a modern
economy and achieving economic growth, we should equally be emphasising
road safety.

The damage of railway infrastructure due to cable theft costs the country
R9 billion a year. In Gauteng, it is said, there is a businessman who makes
R2 million a week from railway overhead cable theft. The demand for copper
makes it lucrative for criminals to steal copper cables. The infrastructure
damage results in trains being delayed and cancelled, especially in
Gauteng. The cable theft challenge needs legislation to make it much harder
for criminals to steal, because currently they don’t take it as a serious
crime to steal cables. Trains will not be punctual until the cable theft
problem is resolved.

The magnitude of and the human cost associated with road accidents on a
yearly basis are detrimental to the achievement of our developmental goals.
If we believe that the development of road infrastructure is part of the
strategies in regard to job creation, poverty eradication and ending
economic marginalisation, we have to recognise the centrality of safety as
one of its critical elements.

Let us not fail our people. Let us continue to implement the railway
solution as the mode of transport of choice for our people. In saying this,
I would like to congratulate the Gauteng government on the success of the
Gautrain in reaching the 1 million mark in regard to passengers. The lesson
learnt from the Gautrain is that our people are hungry for a reliable, fast
and predictable mode of railway transport.

We must use the opportunity of Transport Month to focus the attention of
our people on the importance of safety on the roads and also on safety at
railway crossings. The latter are challenges, because people living next to
the railway lines cross at any time. They use them as streets! This results
in neglect of the rules for crossing railway lines. On the Transnet railway
network about 150 people die on the railway lines due to this neglect, and
sometimes due to deliberate action to commit suicide. The government should
assist companies like Transnet by putting in police and employing local
communities, who will look after the railway infrastructure.

We support the Minister’s view that road safety is not what you do to a
community. The task of ensuring safety on the roads is also not just that
of taxis, government and business. The duty to ensure safety on our roads
is everybody’s business.

We recognise the work done by the Ministry of Transport and government as a
whole in implementing programmes to address road safety, such as the
restructuring of the Road Accident Fund and transforming mode-based vehicle
recapitalisation into integrated mass rapid public transport networks.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr H B GROENEWALD: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members of the NCOP,
South Africa’s economy relies on the fast, safe movement of goods and
people.

The absence of an integrated transport policy and the lack of co-ordination
amongst the different transport authorities have brought about a crisis in
the South African transport sector. These factors, coupled with
insufficient state funding for the maintenance of infrastructure, have
resulted in a deterioration of the transport infrastructure, to the extent
that it now jeopardises both the safety of the public and South Africa’s
economic growth prospects.

The backlogs in maintenance are as follows: there is R120 billion in the
road system; R90 billion in railways; and R22 billion in the minibus-taxi
fleets. As far as road safety is concerned, there are more than 10 000
fatal accidents per year, which cost the country more than R40 billion
every year. More than 12 000 South Africans are killed each year on our
roads. There is also a shortage of 10 000 traffic officers.

With regard to affordability of public transport, about 2,8 million urban
dwellers, which is 13% of the urban population, cannot afford public
transport. Therefore, they are forced to walk or cycle to where they need
to be.

In addition, the absence of law and order in the South African transport
system is contributing significantly to the reshaping of cities and the
decline of central business districts.

The role of the state in the development and management of the transport
system must as far as possible be limited to policy formulation, strategic
planning, regulation – including of the environment — and management of
allocation of subsidies for uneconomical social services, such as mass
transportation on buses, trains and taxis.

The extent to which people are able to use the opportunities available to
them depends on how easily they are able to move around their cities and
the country. When they cannot move around freely and easily, their life
chances are reduced and South Africa as a whole suffers from these lost
opportunities.

South Africa has a well-developed road network, but it is deteriorating,
particularly in the rural areas. Our rail network is also extensive, but
poor management of this sector means there are fewer and fewer trains.
Taxis are cheap, but they are not safe and are uncontrolled. Thus
individuals’ life chances and national goals are both constrained. The
department must work to address these constraints and create a seamless,
well-managed and affordable transport network.

South Africa’s road network infrastructure is deteriorating because of
inadequate funding and rising costs of construction and maintenance. The
state has increasingly relied on private concessions in dealing with this
backlog, thus pricing road usage beyond what many can afford.

The department must establish a dedicated road maintenance fund, sourced
primarily from the fuel levy, which will enable South Africa to eliminate
the R12 billion maintenance backlog over four years. It must also ensure
that all toll road concessions are considered, and that a percentage of
their profits must go towards community development or a pool for
subsidising rural transport. Overloading by heavy-duty vehicles is
destroying our roads. There must be mobile weighbridges and measures to
catch and severely punish offenders.

South Africa’s unacceptably high accident rate costs the economy dearly. A
culture of safe driving must be entrenched through education, zero
tolerance of dangerous driving, and higher driver testing and enforcement
standards.

The department must in the first place recruit, train and accredit at least
2 000 traffic officers at all levels of government, to international norms
and standards; introduce a massive safety drive levelled at motorists and
scholars; and reintroduce compulsory basic balance of third party
insurance.

Our cities and towns are increasingly congested, as a direct result of the
lack of efficient and safe public transport. Taxis, which transport 60% of
commuters in the country, are seen to be unsafe, and passengers often
become the victims of rivalry and internal feuding. Buses, on the other
hand, exist only in the larger cities and are often unreliable and in short
supply. Railway services experience delays, crime, and safety problems.

The department must investigate the introduction and expansion of the bus
rapid transit system, monorail, commuter light rail, and speed trains
wherever feasible and sustainable.

I would have liked to debate airports and ports as well, but unfortunately
time will not allow me to in this sitting.

In conclusion, South Africans — individuals and businesses — have had to
suffer irritations, inconvenience and the costs of a wholly inadequate
transport system for far too long. They deserve better.

The DA wants to see investments and processes put in place to deliver a
transport system that is safe ... [Time expired.]

Mr D B FELDMAN: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen, on building a reliable and safe public transport network, let me
say that roadsafety.co.za this morning carried the following headlines:
“Man hit by train in Kempton Park”; “Truck side-swiped on the highway”;
“Minibus taxi overturns on the N2 highway”; “Motor vehicle collision on
Viking Way”; “One dies after a bakkie overturned on the N1”; and “N2 pile-
up leaves one man injured”.

Chairperson, these headlines reflect the harsh reality of life on our
roads. Our problems lie with the apartheid era spatial planning. Most of
our people live away from cities, either in townships that are far away or
in suburbs on the outskirts of the cities.

Our cities do not have continuous pedestrian plazas. We have not made
biking mainstream. Trams have long been gone from our cities. We certainly
need a reliable, safe and affordable transport network. That a start has
been made is very welcome.

Cope is asking: Where do we go from here? In the next 20 years, 65% of the
people will be living in a city. Our transport planning must begin with the
remodelling of our cities. If the majority of people can travel the
distance by walking or cycling, the transport network will be easier to
construct and cheaper to operate. If the majority of people, however, have
to be ferried into the city and ferried away each evening, the logistics
will be daunting.

In Cape Town, the MyCiTi project is expected to lose millions because there
are no incentives for people to take buses, or no disincentives for people
using cars to work.

Mr Minister, when was it decided that the poor of this country – I refer to
the rural poor – did not matter any more? Ministers want to promote
multimillion and sometimes billion dollar projects for high-speed rail and
train services but somehow they are not able to find money to fix potholes!
These are the potholes that minibus taxis are faced with, as thousands of
South Africans commute from the townships to their workplaces, day in and
day out.

At this juncture, Cope finds it necessary to ask government about what is
happening with regard to the bicycle project. Has this project been
abandoned? Is there any pilot project in any city to gauge the viability
and desirability of using bicycles on a large scale? In Europe the use of
bicycles remains as popular as ever. Will the bicycle be part of the means
of public transport in South Africa?

A change of mind-set is absolutely essential for public transport to take
off. Modal integration will not be possible as long as those with vested
interests do their utmost to stall the process. Public transport contracts
need to be improved and revisited. Universal access to services needs to be
researched to a greater extent. The marketing of services needs more
attention. Lastly, a sustainable source of funding needs to be available. I
thank you.

Cllr C JOHNSON (Salga): Chairperson of the NCOP, hon Minister, hon members
of the NCOP, and hon special guests, indeed, I would like to share with you
the legacy that I found in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly in Durban, which the
Minister had left behind when I visited KZN last week.

There were no traffic jams during peak hours and there were the initiatives
that the Minister took in putting food on the table for rural people. These
were some of the initiatives that he took under the Expanded Public Works
Programme, EPWP.

I also found the promotion of public transport, instead of the use of
private cars by the city of eThekwini under their public transport
campaign, The Smart Way To Go; non-motorised transport promotion with the
issuing of bicycles; road safety campaigns at public transport facilities;
the launch of the Dial-a-Ride accessible transport for the disabled; a
career expo on transport; and the issuing of free Durban People Mover
passes per day.

I would like to thank all the municipalities in the country where, under
the auspices of the South African Local Government Association, Salga, we
promoted this as part of their budgets annually.

But what we find in South Africa at the moment is that sometimes in the
remoteness of the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Limpopo, as well as
Mpumalanga, unplanned settlements are intertwined with highways, and
highways are cutting through unplanned settlements – they bisect them. Sir,
4x4s in our cities are never dirtied, but there are rusted bicycles, and
also decades-old vehicles on our roads that need to provide the service. We
in Salga have told ourselves that we are encouraging municipalities to do
something about it.

The transport fraternity defines public transport as the provision of
passenger transport services to the public for a fee. It includes buses,
minibus taxis and rail for distances that are less than 200 km. I would
like to appeal to the media not to call just any minibus which is in an
accident a minibus taxi — please, do your research. It excludes air
transport, metered taxis, tourist or charter services, and intercity long-
distance buses and taxis.

For any public transport to be effective, it needs to service every
resident within a kilometre of their place of residence. It also needs to
operate for at least 12 to 15 hours a day. It must be affordable and
regular. The current public transport system does not take care of the
people who most need it; and it forces those who can afford it to use
private vehicles.

The poor public transport system undermines people’s basic human rights,
because the majority of South Africans do not have access to reliable,
affordable, pleasant and clean transport that runs on time, particularly in
the rural areas. For them, it is difficult to access public services such
as health services, schools, police stations, welfare services, and other
life opportunities such as employment and business opportunities.

Statistics from the Department of Transport’s National Household Survey of
2003 indicated that more than 75% had no access to a train station and
nearly 40% did not have access to a bus service. Most of these people did
not have a car and were virtually stranded.

Chairperson, another factor is that of crime and safety. Numerous people
raised the issue of exposure to high levels of crime in their local areas
and were worried about their own and their children’s personal safety
whilst both waiting for and using public transport. Safety concerns were
raised about the largely unregulated minibus taxis that most people are
forced to rely on, in the absence of regulated public transport services.
Vehicles were identified as unsafe, both because of their poor physical
condition and also because of driver behaviour. This is an opportunity
where we can have a joint programme between municipalities and the other
spheres to address this challenge.

Government is trying to address the lack of a proper transport network
through legislation and the establishment of integrated public transport
networks. However, the focus seems to be on infrastructure development, not
the operation of public transport. Operation of public transport involves
routes, schedules, times of operation, marketing, and communication with
the public.

The relatively low-density spatial design patterns of South African
settlements, combined with the general attitude of the public towards the
use of public transport, means that the flagship public transport
intervention, the bus rapid transit, BRT, system, will for some time be
running at a low capacity, which means the cost per passenger will remain
high. The services should therefore not be expected to be financially self-
sustaining in the short to medium term. Municipalities should also not be
expected to be the only government institutions that carry the burden of
subsidising such services.

What we need is for the National Land Transport Act to be operationalised.
As a country, we continue to invest in infrastructure that is aimed at
supporting private vehicle use, for example, the expansion of the road
network to accommodate more vehicles. Government needs to commit in word
and practice to a policy direction where the key focus is on public
transport. Funding should be focused on supporting this policy direction.

Any new transport initiative – whether community-based or mainstream
services such as the BRT system – should not be monitored only in regard to
passenger counts and the additional vehicle kilometres, but also in regard
to social welfare criteria, such as those laid out in the principles for
Batho Pele and the South African Millennium Development Goals.

Lastly, we should support community-level services that are urgently needed
to supplement the main radial bus rapid transit route and new rail
corridors that are being put in place. These should be routed to provide
people in low-income communities with the maximum ready access to work,
schools, colleges, medical centres, crèches, shopping centres and places of
worship. In order to achieve this, the capacity of the state at local and
regional levels to regulate the taxi industry and integrate it into a
multimodal system of public transport needs to be improved.

There also appears to be a case for offering fare subsidies to low-income
groups who are currently spending a disproportionately large amount of
their low income on transport costs – and we know that the apartheid racial
divide on spatial settlements is the cause of this. This should form part
of a wider package of subsidies that welfare recipients receive from
government. I thank you. [Applause.]

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Thank you very much, Cllr Johnson. I
would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your consistency in
the activities of the NCOP.

UMntwana M M M ZULU: Sihlalo waleNdlu ohloniphekile, Ngqongqoshe
Manzankosi, abahlonishwa abangamalungu aleNdlu, izwe lakithi iNingizimu

Phela inkululeko ayisho khona ukuvota kuphela kodwa isho nakho ukuhamba
ngokukhululeka emigwaqweni yezwe lakithi. Ngiyabonga. (Translation of
isiZulu speech follows.)

[Prince M M M ZULU: Hon Chairperson of this House, hon Minister Manzankosi,
hon members of this House, we need to be proud of our country South Africa
because it is the country in Africa that has the most organised transport
system.

There are one or two issues one can mention about this. As a village boy
who was a herd boy, you must ensure that the people with whom you are
working, who are your eyes and ears in all the nine provinces, know exactly
that they must fix the potholes in the roads. It concerns me, hon Minister,
that we pay toll fees on the road that connects Gauteng and the North West
province and yet it is full of the potholes that I was talking about. It
concerns me a lot.

In Mpumalanga, there is a place called Carolina and on your way in that
direction — King Mswati’s land, around the Chief’s place – you find that
there are also potholes in those roads. We need co-operation in respect of
all these things as one does not have eyes to see everywhere in the
country.

Coming closer to home, I would like to say to this House that in criminal
wars, the taxi warlords have done a great job, which resulted in the
reduction of the killing of people just because they are jealous of each
other or because people are greedy for the communities’ money. That is why
people are so scared of using public transport, namely because they
associate it with death! I also commend your department for employing so
many traffic officers who will also monitor the speed at which we travel.
These are things that we need to ensure are done in this country.

And when coming back, as someone who was a cattle herd boy and was engaged
in stick fighting, I need to look at these local municipalities, hon
Manzankosi, since you and I know that in areas like Ntambanana, KwaNongoma,
Mahlabathini, oNdini and Nkandla, caterpillars are not used to build roads
that connect these areas with the highways. I therefore request that when
your department is preparing a budget in the new financial year, you should
look at how you can increase their budgets so that they can be empowered to
fulfil our people’s dream of freedom. By the way, freedom does not mean
voting only, it also means travelling safely on our country’s roads. Thank
you.]

Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson, Minister Ndebele, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen, as we approach its end, it is fitting to wrap up the activities
of the Transport Month campaign with a debate in this House. This debate
comes at a critical time, when we are engaged in a process of introspection
and trying to chart a way forward to speed up the transformation of our
economy. A reliable and safe road infrastructure is one of the main
ingredients for building a modern economy and achieving economic growth.

In a developing country like ours it is imperative that the development of
road infrastructure is linked to strategies for job creation, poverty
eradication and ending the economic marginalisation of the majority of our
population. The development and maintenance of road infrastructure is more
amenable to labour intensity than most other economic activities.
Therefore, it is a crucial element of our economic programme of creating
more jobs, decent work and sustainable livelihoods.

A focus on reliability and safety in road infrastructure is particularly
important as we approach the festive season — a period in our national
calendar when we experience a massive increase in road transport accidents,
leading to injuries and deaths on our roads. Therefore, we must use this
opportunity to call on all members of our communities throughout the
country to take responsibility for safety on the roads and help stop the
carnage at this time of the year. We must all obey the law and “arrive
alive” at our destinations.

As members of the ANC, we welcome this opportune debate in the NCOP and
wish to register our support for the Transport Month campaign led by the
Ministry. We recognise the work that is being done by the department and
the government as a whole in implementing the National Land Transport
Strategic Framework and the Public Transport Strategy.

Since 1994 the government has placed a priority on infrastructure
development through policy changes, increases in funding and programme
implementation. These were aimed at addressing the terrible legacy of
apartheid spatial planning based on race. Apartheid and road infrastructure
development ensured that black people were confined to geographic spaces
that were inaccessible by road and where the infrastructure was limited to
ensuring a supply of cheap labour to industries and white designated areas.

Apartheid spatial planning created what was often referred to as two
economies in one country. This is particularly evident and more pronounced
when one looks at infrastructure development such as road transport. In the
majority of provinces which incorporated the former apartheid-created
homelands, such as North West, Limpopo and Free State, the road
infrastructure condition became dire. Across all provinces the condition of
road infrastructure continued to deteriorate as a result of the legacy of
underdevelopment, poor planning, massive backlogs, inadequate investment
and poor maintenance levels. It is this legacy that the nation has had to
deal with since the dawn of democracy in 1994.

The Transport Month campaign gives us an opportunity to take stock of
improvement in our road infrastructure as a result of the numerous
interventions undertaken so far and the challenges that still remain.

There are a few matters that need to be mentioned – those that
detrimentally affect service to our people. These relate to the perceived
unco-ordinated manner in which rail transport matters are handled. I will
start with the state of the rail network and rail transport. Serious
economic consequences have resulted from the country’s stagnating, poorly
resourced and desperately inefficient rail system. In the last 15 years its
share of the freight market has plunged to just 10%.

Neglect of the rail network, inefficiency and unreliability have impacted
greatly on the way businesses view rail transport and resulted in the
dependence they have built up on road transporters to move their cargo.
However, our roads were not constructed to carry anything like 32 million
tons of freight a year. The consistent repair they need is testimony to the
destruction wreaked by the overloaded mammoth trucks and tankers.

Nationally, only half of the nation’s 20 000 km of railway lines is fully
utilised. On some 35% of the nation’s lines there is very low or no
activity. The railways have failed to make the investment in rolling stock
and infrastructure demanded by the growing economy. The Spoornet rail
monopoly must now dig deep into its pockets to get rail to the stage where
it can out-compete the road transport system, which today has a 90%
stranglehold on the country’s land cargoes. Aging locomotives and wagons
must be replaced. The average age of locomotives is 22 years and that of
the wagon fleet is 32 years.

Important railway centres like De Aar and Noupoort in the Northern Cape
have become virtual ghost towns due to the scaling down of rail activity,
leading to unemployment and the concomitant poverty of the local
population. The question remains to be answered: Why has the rail
infrastructure been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that a
virtually new system has to be built up from scratch?

Kukhona ekumele ngikudlulise masinyane. Kwi-Cope,kwembulwa kuyembeswa
selidumela emasumpeni, kodwa-ke likhona ikhambi elingayisiza. Kufanele
sibahlabele isibhuklabhukla esimhlophe sikalamthuthu sibuye sibaphalazise
ngentelezi ebizwa ngokuthi iBuyel’ekhaya, sibaphunge ngeDel’amambuka emva
kwalokho-ke sibashunqisela nge-Freedom Charter bese benikezwa inkululeko
yomgwaqo omkhulu okuthiwa uMshini wami.

I-DA, ngizwe kuthiwa uMnumzane Carlisle uthi ngeke umuntu alale
esitimeleni, kuyiqiniso Mnumzane Jacobs, ungalala esitimeleni. Kungenxa
yokuthi ngeshwa nje angikholwa ukuthi uNgqongqoshe wake wasigibela noma
yisiphi nje isitimela esiya elokishini, ngalokho-ke ngithi kubo i-DA
ingochwepheshe bokwakha umgwaqo omkhulu oya kwaLasha. Lokho kubonakale
ngobunyoninco bokwakha izindlu zangasese esidlangalaleni endaweni ebizwa
ngokuthi kuseMakhaza, eKhayelitsha. Babuye futhi bakha izindlu zangasese
ezimbili emphakathini olinganiselwa ezinkulungwaneni eziyisihlanu endaweni
ebizwa ngokuthi kuseQolweni, e-Plettenberg Bay, eNtshonalanga Kapa.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[There is something that I must quickly say. Cope is at death’s door.
However, there is a remedy that can help them. We must slaughter them a fat
white battery chicken and perform a cleansing ritual with an emetic called
Go Back Home, and swat them with Del’amambuka after reminding them of the
Freedom Charter and granting them the freedom of the ruling party.

With regard to the DA - I heard that Mr Carlisle said a person cannot sleep
on the train, but the fact is you can sleep on the train. Unfortunately I
don’t believe that the Minister has ever travelled by train to the
townships; therefore I say to the DA they are the experts on contributing
to the deaths. That is seen through their expertise of building toilets in
an open veld at Makhaza in Khayelitsha. They again built two toilets in a
community of approximately 5 000 people in a place called Qolweni, in
Plettenberg Bay, in the Western Cape.]

ANC policy positions are a guide to government. The struggle for national
democratic order in our country can be achieved through an integration of
communities by doing away with racial apartheid spatial policies which were
expressed in road infrastructure development. For the ANC, development and
maintenance of road infrastructure are not only important for economic
development, but are also a necessary basic need.

This was aptly described in the ANC foundational governance policy document
of 1994, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. It is stated there
that the future transport policy had to, inter alia, promote co-ordinated,
safe, affordable public transport as a social service; take into account
the transport needs of disabled people; ensure comprehensive land-
use/transport planning; promote road safety; and review subsidies, both
operating and capital.

Bese ngiyabuya futhi ngithi Mhlonishwa,  siyakucela,  lapho  engisuka  khona
eMpumalanga  kunogwaqo  omkhulu  okuthiwa  i-Moloto  Road.  Abantu   bangale
eMpumalanga bacela ukuthi kufakwe ulayini wesitimela ozohlanganisa  i-Pitoli
kanye neKwaMhlanga  ngoba  iyaziwa  ngezingozi  i-KwaMhlanga  Road;  minyaka
yonke siyazi ukuthi izibalo zithi  bangaki  abantu  abafayo  kuloya  mgwaqo.
Sekukaningi sikucela lokhu kodwa  impendulo  singayitholi.  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Where I come from in Mpumalanga, there is a main road called Moloto Road.
The people of Mpumalanga request, through you, hon Minister, that a railway
line should be built which will connect Pretoria and KwaMhlanga because the
KwaMhlanga Road is well known for accidents. We know the yearly statistics
of the people who die on that road. We have requested this several times
but we have not received any response.]

In addressing the legacy of road infrastructure underdevelopment, the RDP
further states that:

   ... critical “bottlenecks” in the road infrastructure should be improved
   so that the full capacity of the existing road network can be realised.
   However the provision of primary road infrastructure must be directed
   towards and take cognisance of public transport needs.

  The planning of transport for metropolitan and major urban areas must be
  in accordance with an urban/metropolitan growth management plan. A
  hierarchy of modes should guide the financing of infrastructure
  improvements and payment of operating subsidies for public transport.
  Travel modes should not compete. In rural areas, provincial governments
  and district councils must present public transport plans, including for
  extensive road building and improvement.

The principles enshrined in the RDP have found their expression in
subsequent policies and programmes, in particular the National Land
Transport Strategic Framework, and the 2007 Cabinet-approved Public
Transport Strategy, which is currently being implemented by government.

Eish, isikhathi sami! [Eish, my time!]

In terms of the National Land Transport Strategic Framework, public
transport services, facilities and infrastructure should be designed,
provided and developed to promote intermodalism ... [Interjections.]

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon member, thank you. You should be
aware that your time is up.

Mr M P SIBANDE: Okokugcina nje, ngiyabonga kakhulu, Sihlalo. [Kwaphela
isikhathi.] [Lastly, thank you very much, Chairperson. [Time expired.]]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson and hon members, thank you very much
for the very constructive contributions that have been made. We really want
to express our appreciation for that.

I would like to deal with a few issues. On Friday, 22 October, I think it
was, we had a meeting with my counterpart, the Minister of Public
Enterprises, Ms Barbara Hogan, from the Department of Public Enterprises,
together with our two entities – the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa,
Prasa, led by its CEO, Lucky Montana, and Transnet, led by its CEO, Chris
Wells.

We had a constructive meeting in which we, as political principals, wanted
to bring peace where there had been ructions and disagreements. The meeting
ended very well with a full commitment from both Transnet and Prasa to work
as the Ministers are doing – in co-operation and in a manner that makes the
passengers and the public number one, to be serviced, and not taking into
consideration whatever differences there might be. Indeed, we found that
those differences were not deep-seated. I am happy to say that that matter
was resolved.

Secondly, we are really happy in Transport. Last year we were discussing
the issue of the taxi violence. We asked: What about the taxi violence?
What has happened is a measure of the success of all of us who raised our
voices, saying that this was not acceptable. It is not acceptable in the
Western Cape, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal or anywhere. All of us
raised our voices.

As we speak, the main concern and pre-occupation of the taxi industry is
now more investment, more development of themselves as businesses, and more
service to our people. I think quite a lot of progress has been registered
in that area. The unanimity of the voices, whether provincial, local,
national or across all parties, has been very helpful in ensuring that we
put pressure on that industry. Indeed, the focus is now on their developing
themselves as proper businesses, and that they can do by giving proper and
admirable service to our people. There has been progress in that regard.
There is stability now.

Thirdly, as far as the issue of road infrastructure is concerned, the
voices that were raised here have been responded to, particularly with
regard to the budget. I am sure the Minister of Finance will be raising the
question of the dedicated road maintenance fund tomorrow. There can never
be enough money, but we need to make sure that nationally we have funds
dedicated to maintenance. Provinces and municipalities have dedicated funds
for road maintenance.

This is a measure of ourselves and where we stand in the scale of
development. You judge the development of a country by four things — does
it have clean water, roads, electricity and proper communication? It
doesn’t matter which part of the world you are in; you should have those
four basic things. It should be taken for granted that they will be there.

We in Transport are saying that all of us, from municipalities, local
governments and provinces to the national arena, should make sure that we
give ourselves a very tough test. That test is: Is there a school that
cannot be reached by road? Is there a clinic that cannot be reached by
road, whether it is raining or not? Is there a sports facility or social
development facility that cannot be reached by road? It is for us to make
sure that it is not just roads in general — we can talk about 16 000 km of
blacktop national roads, and that is fine, but it doesn’t answer the
question of the person who must have a road in order to go to the clinic or
to school or just to entertain himself.

We have called for the creation of road safety councils as community-based
structures. We need to have them in all provinces and wards. This is so
that when an accident happens, or even before it does, the councils will
have ensured that youngsters have been educated on how to cross the roads
and so forth. They should ensure that there is no drinking and driving, and
that there are no shebeens that just let everybody drink.

If four people are drinking, one of them should be the dedicated driver to
take them home. It should just be accepted, the norm, just like when you
accept that you can’t simply go into a supermarket and steal a packet of
biscuits and put it in your pocket. Similarly, nobody should boast that
they drive their cars at 180 km or 200 km per hour, and think that that is
socially acceptable. It should just be seen as criminal behaviour, not a
social expression of some sort.

So, on the question of road safety councils, this is one of the instruments
that society as a whole must have in their hands. It is these that will
also access the Road Accident Fund. When we visit a family, as we visited
the Nyembe family in Alexandra, we should be able to say what we as the
progressive democratic government of South Africa can do in regard to a
funeral. We know that every South African who is on the road is insured
through the Road Accident Fund. We have up to R10 000 to assist with any
funeral of a road accident victim if they don’t have any other assistance.
We are able to do that immediately. Then the Road Accident Fund people are
there to take the details and move on with it.

In the last financial year we spent R11 billion on the Road Accident Fund,
and approximately R5,5 billion of that money was spent on lawyers, which we
would like to ensure doesn’t continue to happen. That is just not on. The
money should be going to the victims.

The issue of Shova Kalula is still very much there. Sir, 26 100 bikes are
to be distributed, and 13 500 had been distributed by March of this year.
The 15 000 milestone will be reached by the end of this financial year. So,
Shova Kalula is still going on. It has also created micro businesses in six
provinces for repairing those bikes. That programme is going very well.

Chairperson and members, thank you very much for the very constructive
debate that we have had. It has been a very fitting closure to Transport
Month. Those 1 million cars are going to be checked every month, wayawaya
[always]. I thank you. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                       DEEDS REGISTRIES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, thank you for giving me the opportunity to
read the statement regarding the Deeds Registries Amendment Bill today,
Tuesday, 26 October 2010, in the NCOP.

Chairperson of the NCOP, Chief Whip, Minister of Rural Development and Land
Reform in absentia, MECs — of whom I do not see any here — and hon members
of this distinguished House, this afternoon I have been given the
opportunity to share with the House some of the deliberations of the Select
Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs on the Deeds Registries
Amendment Bill, which was introduced to Parliament by the Minister of Rural
Development and Land Reform in August this year.

For your information, hon members, the Deeds Registries Amendment Bill is
the legislation that amends the Deeds Registries Act, Act 47 of 1937, which
is responsible for the registration of deeds. In South Africa the law does
not explicitly guarantee title to land. The system of deeds registration is
based on a juristic foundation and longstanding practices and procedures.
It is this system which has the effect of guaranteeing titles.

The main purpose for amending the Bill was to substitute certain obsolete
expressions and to enhance the application of the Act to conform to the
current uniform practices of the deeds registries. The process that the
Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs followed for processing
this section 75 Bill was the same as that followed with the Sectional
Titles Amendment Bill, as they were done concurrently. In general the
amendments were merely procedural to conform to current legal practices.

In order to fulfil the mandate of the NCOP to facilitate public
participation during the legislative process, the committee advertised the
Bill for public comment and received two submissions, from the South
African Property Owners Association and the Banking Council of South
Africa. All the submissions were responded to by the department, and the
committee was satisfied with the discussions held around the submissions.

The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, having considered
the Deeds Registries Amendment Bill, referred to it and classified by the
Joint Tagging Mechanism, JTM, as a section 75 Bill, supports the Bill with
proposed amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with
section 75 of the Constitution.

                       SECTIONAL TITLES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mrs A N D QIKANI: House Chairperson, Chief Whip, hon members, good
afternoon. This afternoon I will share with the House some of the
deliberations of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs on
the Sectional Titles Amendment Bill, which was introduced to Parliament by
the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform.

The Sectional Titles Act, Act 95 of 1986, is the legislation that governs
building development where multiple owners hold a type of property
ownership known as sectional title units. These areas usually relate to
town houses or flats, and include areas that are commonly shared by a group
of owners and are known as common property, such as lifts, driveways and
parking areas.

The main purpose in amending the Bill was to amend certain definitions;
redefine the boundaries between certain sections and common property;
regulate substitution of bonds registered in respect of different pieces of
land shown on the sectional plan; provide for the issuing of certificates
of real rights of extension and certificates of real rights of exclusive
use areas; provide for the issuing of a certificate of a registered
sectional title in respect of a fraction of an undivided share in a
section; further provide for the vesting of rights of exclusive use areas
where an owner ceases to be a member of a body corporate; and, finally,
provide for the cancellation of an exclusive use of area right.

Therefore, the legislative process that the Select Committee on Land and
Environmental Affairs followed for this section 75 Bill firstly entailed
getting a briefing by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.
From this it was noted that the main amendment proposed in the Act sought
to clarify ambiguity and set out prescribed processes that were unclear in
the current Act.

In order to fulfil the mandate of the NCOP in facilitating public
participation during the legislative process, the committee advertised the
Bill for public comment and received two submissions. The committee
thereafter received a follow-up briefing from the department to obtain
their responses to the issue raised in the submissions and further held
deliberations on the Bill.

Therefore, the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, having
considered the Sectional Titles Amendment Bill referred to it and
classified by the Joint Target Mechanism, JTM, as a section 75 Bill,
supports the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): I shall now put the question. The
question is that the Bill, subject to the proposed amendments, be agreed
to.

In accordance with Rule 63, I shall first allow political parties to make a
declaration of vote if they so wish. Is there any political party that
wishes to make a declaration of vote? There is none.

We shall now proceed to vote on the question. Before I call for votes,
please press button number one to confirm your presence. There should be
lights flashing. Are your lights flashing? If not, the service officers
will assist you. Those in favour please press button number four, those
against press button number two and those who are abstaining press button
number three. Voting is now open. Are there any members who wish to be
assisted with manual voting? Please indicate by a show of hands. Have all
members voted?

If any member has mistakenly voted in a way that he or she did not wish to,
he or she has an opportunity to correct that, whether electronically or
manually. In the absence of anyone needing assistance, I request the tally.

Thank you very much, hon members. There were no abstentions and no
objections. Therefore the majority of the House voted in favour of the
Bill.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I just want — for the record — to enquire
what the exact count of people was who voted in favour of the Bill.

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): It was 40.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: 40?

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Yes.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: But, with due respect, Mr Chairperson, it seems to me that
there are more than 40, and you indicated that nobody abstained.

The ACTING CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): According to our records, we don’t
have any abstentions. The records that we have here show no abstentions.
[Interjections.] Exactly. Let us not ... [Interjections.] The majority of
members voted in favour. I therefore declare the Bill, subject to the
proposed amendments, agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.
[Applause.]

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with
section 75 of the Constitution.

 consideration of Report of select committee on co-operative governance and
             traditional affairs – CONSIDERATION OF termination
              of interventions in Xhariep district municipality
                       and mohokare local municipality

 Consideration of report of select committee on co-operative governance and
      traditional affairs – intervention in Mafikeng local municipality

 Consideration of REPORT OF select committee on co-operative governance and
   traditional affairs – performance report of Eastern Cape municipalities

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, hon members of the House, lest we forget,
after next month, which is November, we will be celebrating 10 years of the
existence of the transformation of municipalities in this country on 5
December.

This is the report dealing with termination of the interventions in Xhariep
District Municipality and Mohokare Local Municipality. The committee agrees
with the report, which emphasises ongoing management capacity-building in
these two municipalities, precisely because political administrative
stability is showing signs of improvement.

Regarding the Mafikeng Local Municipality, the committee recommends that
the House approve the intervention and that the Hawks pursue all cases of
financial irregularities, fraud and allegations of corruption.

The council vehicles that are alleged to be in the Gauteng province should
be tracked down and investigated, and the culprits pursued by law. Improper
appointments of 20 contract workers must be corrected and disciplinary
procedures must be followed. Corrective measures should be taken against
the community services director who refused to serve the community. The
administrator should fast-track the appointment of a municipal manager, and
facilitate the transfer of skills. The House should receive quarterly
reports from the provincial executive.

With regard to the Eastern Cape report – this is the report in regard to
section 46 of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act — the committee
agrees and knows the progress that is emerging in that province, and the
House should approve the report but emphasise that there should be ongoing
support on service delivery, infrastructure development, and political and
administrative instability. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That Report on Consideration of Termination of Interventions
in Xhariep District Municipality and Mohokare Local Municipality be
adopted.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Report on Consideration of Termination of Interventions in Xhariep District
Municipality and Mohokare Local Municipality accordingly adopted in
accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Question put: That Report on Intervention in Mafikeng Local Municipality be
adopted.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.
Report on Intervention in Mafikeng Local Municipality accordingly adopted
in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Question put: That Report on Performance Report of Eastern Cape
Municipalities be adopted.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

4. FINDINGS


The committee made the following observations:


4.1   GENERAL

    • In the absence of a costing framework of the DVA, service delivery was
      severely impeded, hence resulting in the poor  implementation  of  the
      Act.
    • Gender-based violence disproportionately affects women  and  children.
      Notwithstanding this, the committee acknowledges  that  based  on  the
      submissions received, persons with disabilities,  women  and  children
      living on farms, in rural areas  and  impoverished  environments  were
      considerably less likely to  have  access  to  effective  help.  As  a
      result, they may have to endure violent and abusive relationships  for
      longer and thus experience more serious long-term,  consequences  than
      those with better access to help and resources.
    • Patriarchal attitudes and differential  power  dynamics  were  at  the
      heart of domestic violence.
    • Many victims of domestic violence were unaware that their rights  were
      violated and even when they knew, struggled to access the  appropriate
      support services.
Lack of co-ordination

    • It was noted in several submissions that there was an over-emphasis on
      criminal justice measures to deal with domestic violence and an under-
      development of violence prevention measures.
    • There was no overarching framework and implementation strategy to deal
      with domestic violence holistically.
    •  It  was  noted  that  collaboration  and  communication  between  the
      different departments involved in providing  services  to  victims  of
      domestic violence was severely lacking, which resulted in the  absence
      of a holistic vision of service intervention.

Resourcing

    • A number of submissions  highlighted  the  inadequate  nature  of  the
      resources available  to  combat  the  scourge  of  domestic  violence.
      Current departmental budgets were not gender responsive, nor did  they
      take  into  consideration  the  needs  of  youth  and   persons   with
      disabilities. This brings into question how women, children, youth and
      persons with disabilities were prioritised in departmental spending.

Lack of reliable data

    • It was highlighted that there was a lack  of  credible  administrative
      data and  related  indicators  to  effectively  monitor  and  evaluate
      whether government’s existing programmes were addressing the needs  of
      victims and perpetrators of domestic violence.
    • In addition to a lack of data,  available  statistics  to  effectively
      monitor and evaluate domestic violence trends were  not  disaggregated
      or reported on timeously.
    • Existing information systems between various departments  on  domestic
      violence was not compatible.
    • There was no integrated information system to track trends in domestic
      violence and determine  whether  the  targets  set  for  reducing  its
      incidence and rendering the required programmes in a  holistic  manner
      was achieved. It was also not clear what the targets were for reducing
      the incidents of domestic violence in the country.

Faith-based sector

    • The faith-based  sector  was  identified  as  a  key  role  player  in
      providing support and assistance to victims of  domestic  violence  as
      religious leaders were often contacted initially for advice.  However,
      presenters at  the  public  hearings  were  concerned  that  religious
      leaders did not always provide the help victims sought and, at  times,
      subjected the victim to secondary abuse.

4.2   PEACE AND SECURITY CLUSTER

Department of Police

Numerous reports of non-compliance by members of the police with  provisions
of the Domestic Violence Act were made by presenters. These included:
Non-compliance
    • It was noted that there  appeared  to  be  a  disincentive  by  police
      officers to record incidents of domestic violence, abuse or  rape,  as
      this would negatively affect their target of reducing  contact  crimes
      between 7 - 10% annually. Hence, incidents of rape were often reported
      as a common assault or turned  away,  with  the  same  practice  being
      adopted in abuse cases.
    • Firearms were not always confiscated  after  being  used  to  threaten
      victims and the license of the alleged perpetrator suspended.
    • The safety of persons who had obtained protection  orders  were  being
      compromised  by  some  police  officials’  unwillingness   to   arrest
      perpetrators who violated the protection order.
    • The behaviour of police officials dealing  with  victims  of  domestic
      violence were reported as being demeaning and  discriminatory.  Police
      officials discouraged women from taking action. Police  officers  also
      often did not inform victims about accessing  a  protection  order  or
      laying a criminal charge. Submissions by individuals working on  farms
      indicated that particularly  in  the  case  of  farm  workers,  police
      responded by saying that they were 'drunk'  farm  women  and  did  not
      attend to their cases. Numerous incidents  were  reported  citing  the
      appalling attitude of police officials who often  subject  victims  to
      secondary abuse.
    • Numerous concerns arose regarding protection orders as it  relates  to
      ensuring the safety  of  persons  requesting  protection  orders,  the
      reluctance and often refusal of police officers to serve the order, or
      to arrest the perpetrator who has violated the protection order.
    • It was also highlighted that risk assessment needs to be  prioritised,
      so as to make  victim  safety  a  priority.  This  becomes  especially
      important when victims are told to return the next day,  resulting  in
      cases where women did not return to file charges.

Lack of resources
    • The lack of resources was noted as an impediment that  compromised  on
      the ability of the police to act in accordance with the provisions  of
      the Act. There have, for example, been instances where the police have
      claimed that they had no vehicles available and situations  where  the
      areas  from  which  victims  call  were  not  in  their  jurisdiction,
      particularly in rural areas. Hence the service was not rendered.

Servicing of protection orders
    • Protection orders often did not serve the purpose  they  are  intended
      for in that they were not adequately enforced and the victim continued
      to suffer abuse despite the serving of the protection order.
    • The cost implications for serving a protection order were not  applied
      uniformly across the country.
    • Some police officers were reluctant to serve protection orders and  in
      some instances even refused to do so. The undue  delay  in  serving  a
      protection order on an assailant placed the victim in grave danger.


Training
    • There was insufficient training of SAPS officials to deal with victims
      of domestic violence. In addition, once-off training was inadequate to
      ensure officials  were  equipped  to  deal  with  matters  related  to
      domestic violence.
    • Some training of police officials has taken place. However, given  the
      reports of negative attitudes by some police officials,  there  was  a
      need to review existing training  modules  and  monitor  and  evaluate
      their application. The monitoring and evaluation of whether  officials
      require training,  at  what  level,  as  well  as  if  officials  were
      implementing what they know required serious attention.
    • It was also highlighted that  there  was  a  need  to  debrief  police
      officials who consistently deal with issues of  domestic  violence  to
      enable them to cope with their exposure to trauma and remain sensitive
      to the issue.

Specialised units
    • Presenters at the public hearings  welcomed  the  re-establishment  of
      specialised units such as the Family Violence  Child  Protection  Unit
      and Sexual Offences Units (FCS). More clarity was sought  as  to  when
      and how these units would be introduced, including  the  provision  of
      adequate resources to these structures. The mandate of these units  in
      relation to domestic violence had been very limited in the past so  it
      was also necessary to clarify  their  mandate  around  such  cases  in
      future.

Victim Empowerment Programme
    • Many police stations lack facilities for private consultation  due  to
      the absence of trauma rooms or Thuthuzela Centres. As a  result,  such
      victims often had to provide statements in environments that were  not
      conducive to confidentiality or safety.
    • In some instances, lay counsellors assigned to trauma rooms  were  ill
      equipped to deal with the counselling needs  of  victims  of  domestic
      violence.  The  training  of  these  volunteer  counsellors  was   not
      monitored  and/or  evaluated.  There   was   also   often   inadequate
      supervision of volunteers, as well as a high turnover of volunteers at
      police stations and trauma rooms.
    •  It  also  appeared  that  there  was  a  lack  of   interdepartmental
      collaboration  between  all  role  players  responsible   for   victim
      empowerment.
    • Batho Pele principles were not  being  applied  and  the  attitude  of
      officials often deterred victims from laying a  charge  or  seeking  a
      protection order.

Record-keeping
    • Domestic violence should be recognised as  a  reportable  category  of
      crime. It was noted that there appeared to be a disincentive by police
      officers to record incidents of domestic violence, abuse and  rape  as
      this would negatively affect their overall performance rating.
    • In addition, it was also highlighted that domestic violence  registers
      were not being maintained in the manner required.

Community Police Forums
    • Community Police Forums did not appear to  be  dealing  with  domestic
      violence. These forums were seen as often being politicised and  their
      effectiveness varied across the country.


Department of Justice and Constitutional Development

Accessibility
    • For persons with disabilities, access to the criminal  justice  system
      remains a problem. An example cited was that localised  sign  language
      was  not  being  used  within   courts,   making   communication   and
      interpretation difficult.
    • Courts and police officials needed to become more available  in  terms
      of their operating  hours.  Court  services  in  particular  were  not
      available after hours in many areas resulting in  limited  access,  as
      well as loss of  wages  for  farm  women,  shift  workers  and  casual
      employees who have to take time off work to access court.
    • Victims of domestic violence were subjected to secondary victimisation
      within the judicial process.
    • Many court officials were ill-equipped to deal with matters related to
      domestic violence.
    • Availability of magistrates after hours was problematic.
Secondary victimisation
    • Victims of domestic violence were subject to  secondary  victimisation
      by court officials and undue delay in court processes.
    • In many instances, victims were not granted  a  protection  order  but
      requested to return with sufficient evidence or a notice to show cause
      for a protection order to be granted. This  often  resulted  in  women
      having to return home  to  the  perpetrator  without  any  protection.
      Victims, who have already suffered trauma, were therefore additionally
      victimised  by  the  institution  whose  protection  they  sought.  In
      addition, the court may also allow the alleged perpetrator to  provide
      a notice to show cause for  why  a  protection  order  should  not  be
      issued.
    • It was noted that there was a lack of privacy in  court  when  dealing
      with domestic violence cases. Although  sensitive,  these  proceedings
      were often open to the public.


Specialisation
    • There was a lack of a child-centred approach  in  matters  related  to
      court processes and children as  victims  of  domestic  violence  e.g.
      postponement of cases and long waiting periods, as well  as  attitudes
      of court officials which impact negatively on the child.


Co-ordination
    • Domestic violence was often inter-related with divorce and maintenance
      matters. Thus, many cases were a combination  of  criminal  and  civil
      matters. However,  according  to  the  submissions,  many  victims  of
      domestic violence report having to engage with the judicial system  at
      multiple  points  which  was  costly,   confusing   and   inefficient.
      Individual cases were not dealt with holistically,  which  leaves  the
      victim to seek services from multiple points, rather than  having  all
      matters dealt with in one place.

4.3   SOCIAL SERVICES CLUSTER

Department of Social Development

Psycho-social support
    • The current provision of psycho-social services to victims of domestic
      violence by government was inadequate. Most victims  received  support
      from non-governmental organisations  that  were  battling  to  survive
      financially and still render a service.
    • Government psycho-social interventions were rendered from a purely bio-
      medical perspective as opposed to a developmental and  community-based
      approach that included  psycho-social  rehabilitation.  Where  medical
      intervention was provided, it was often provided initially with little
      or no follow-through  for  the  victim  after  a  J88  form  had  been
      completed.
    • Overall, there was insufficient attention to ensuring  the  safety  of
      children, as well as addressing their specific needs which arose  from
      either witnessing domestic  violence  or  being  victims  of  domestic
      violence.
    • It was also highlighted that  services  were  not  reaching  children.
      Government social workers did  not  always  visit  children  in  their
      homes, and as such, children had to go to their offices which  impeded
      access.
    • In many instances, psycho-social services were  only  offered  to  the
      domestic violence victim, thus ignoring the possible  needs  of  other
      family members such as children, grandparents etc  who  had  witnessed
      the violence.
    • The extent and range of psycho-social services  offered  was  limited,
      for example, there were few support groups  for  victims  of  domestic
      violence.

Shelters
    • It was highlighted that there was a severe shortage  of  shelters  for
      women, particularly in rural areas. It was not evident if any measures
      were in place to address the shortage.
    • In addition, the limited access to emergency shelters for  victims  of
      domestic violence required urgent attention.


Poor co-ordination
    • There was a lack of synergy between the  different  programmes  within
      the Department of Social Development. As such, a  victim  of  domestic
      violence was often not assessed for social security benefits.

Social security
    • It was noted that  in  many  instances,  persons  with  severe  mental
      illness struggle to access  disability  grants,  and  that  the  South
      African Social Security Agency must  ensure  measures  to  make  these
      services accessible.

Victim Empowerment Programme
    • The Victim Empowerment Programme had failed many victims  of  domestic
      violence, largely due to the inadequate  allocation  of  resources  to
      implement the programme, as well as the Minimum Standards for  Service
      Delivery in Victim Empowerment.
    • The lack of guidelines for  the  Victim  Empowerment  Programme  (VEP)
      severely impedes service delivery.

Lack of human resources
    • The high case load of social workers had a direct bearing on whether a
      victim will indeed access a service. There appeared  to  be  an  over-
      reliance on social workers and a lack of a multi-disciplinary team  to
      address domestic violence.  Apart from  social  workers,  it  was  not
      clear what other cadres of professionals, if  any,  were  employed  as
      part of a multi-disciplinary team to deal with  domestic  violence  in
      terms of rendering psycho-social interventions.

Department of Health

    • Forensic specialists were a scarce resource, which directly impacts on
      the ability to provide medico-legal services to  victims  of  domestic
      violence.
    • It was highlighted that there appeared to be little or no follow-up of
      victims of domestic violence  after  they  initially  visit  a  health
      facility.
    • Health care professionals had been  reported  to  subject  victims  of
      domestic violence to secondary victimisation and were often  not  held
      accountable for this.
    • Many health  care  professionals  did  not  know  about  the  Domestic
      Violence Act.
    • There was a need for holistic care provisions to victims  of  domestic
      violence, particularly in relation to psycho-social trauma.


Department of Human Settlements

    • It was  noted  that  the  marital  status  of  the  domestic  violence
      victim/survivor should not hinder access to government services,  such
      as housing. It was reported that in many instances, women who had  RDP
      houses were not eligible for  additional  or  new  houses  as  records
      indicated that they had already received  housing,  despite  the  fact
      that the  perpetrator  was  occupying  the  house  or  that  they  had
      separated or divorced.
    • There was therefore an urgent need to respond to secondary housing for
      victims of domestic violence.
    • In addition to the need for more shelters, there was  also  no  policy
      that made provision for women who exit shelters to access housing.

4.4   GOVERNANCE CLUSTER

Department of Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities

    • At  present,  there  was  no  overarching  National  Strategic  Policy
      Framework to combat domestic violence, resulting in a lack of  synergy
      between departments. The new department which is responsible  for  the
      needs of socially vulnerable groups is well placed to take  leadership
      in the development of a National Strategic Policy Framework.
    • In addition,  the  department  must  outline  specific  programmes  to
      address high levels of violence against women,  children  and  persons
      with disabilities, and to ensure that these programmes are  adequately
      costed and resourced.
    • The department must work collaboratively  with  other  departments  to
      ensure implementation of the  Domestic  Violence  Act.  It  must  also
      ensure the inclusion of organisations addressing domestic violence  in
      the planning of the National Strategic Policy Framework.

National Planning Commission & Monitoring and Evaluation

    • As  the  primary  bodies  responsible  for  planning,  monitoring  and
      evaluation, it was imperative that these two bodies  are  included  in
      the development of a National Strategic Policy Framework for  domestic
      violence
    • Monitoring and evaluation was important  for  oversight  in  terms  of
      implementation of the DVA, as well as  holding  service  providers  to
      account for the effective implementation of the DVA.
Commission for Gender Equality

    • The role of the Commission of Gender Equality must be strengthened and
      closely monitored as an organ of the state and a key  role  player  of
      the gender machinery established to address gender discrimination.


5. RECOMMENDATIONS


The committee made the following recommendations:


5.1   Legislative amendments

It was recommended that  certain  sections  of  the  Domestic  Violence  Act
should be amended to effect changes that best speak to the needs of  victims
of domestic violence.

Amendments to the Domestic Violence Act (DVA)

The discretionary  powers  of  police  officials  in  effecting  arrests  on
perpetrators of domestic violence is highly problematic and  highlights  the
gaps that exist in the combating of crimes of domestic violence. In  certain
circumstances, police officials  were  not  obligated  to  arrest  suspected
perpetrators of domestic  violence  where  suspicion  existed  of  continued
abuse of a spouse or intimate partner.  It was  therefore  recommended  that
the DVA should be amended in order to remove  the  discretionary  powers  of
police officials in matters relating to domestic violence.   In  particular,
it was recommended that section 3 of the DVA should be amended by  replacing
the phrase “may arrest” with the phrase “must arrest”  in  order  to  ensure
that victims of domestic violence were protected  against  retaliation  from
or by the abuser.

One of the critical areas in terms of legislative amendments deals with  the
issue of imminent harm as described in  section  8(4)(b)  of  the  DVA.  The
section speaks to a  situation  where  the  police  officer,  on  reasonable
grounds, suspects that the complainant may suffer imminent harm as a  result
of an alleged breach of the  protection  order,  that  police  officer  must
arrest the respondent. The notion of imminent harm  is  not  clearly  enough
dealt with in the DVA.  It  therefore  raises  questions  around  whether  a
police officer should arrest a respondent for having verbally abused his  or
her partner.  In this regard, it was  recommended  that  clarity  should  be
given to what exactly was meant by ‘imminent harm’ by either  a  legislative
amendment or through the establishment of guidelines through  the  inclusion
of further regulations.

The criminalisation of domestic violence was a proposal that emerged at  the
public hearings and requires vigorous debate to  determine  the  feasibility
of such an amendment to the Act.

The lack of a provision within the DVA in  terms  of  the  co-ordination  of
services between various role players severely impedes service delivery.  As
such an amendment should be considered in this regard.

Domestic Partnerships Legislation

In terms of domestic partnerships, the DVA is under-utilised  by  women  who
cohabit with their partners. It is critical to ensure  that  legislation  is
enacted that recognises domestic partnerships and in so doing,  grants  them
legitimacy  and  entitlements.  Currently,  women  who   cohabit,   on   the
dissolution of their relationship, are entitled to nothing  but  that  which
they brought to the relationship.  They have no legal claim to  property  or
any other assets to whose purchase they  have  contributed.  This  group  of
abused  women  thus   lose   substantially   and   materially   when   their
relationships end.

Costing of DVA

It would be imperative that the proposed new  provisions  of  the  Act  were
costed along with the existing sections to ensure  that  adequate  resources
were allocated  for  its  implementation.  Clear  time  frames  need  to  be
established as to by when the costing will be completed.

General Recommendations

With  the  exercise  of  parliamentary  authority  and  oversight  over  the
executive,  the  review   of   the   implementation   of   legislation   was
constitutionally mandated.  However, where an Act contains  regulations  for
the implementation of the legislation, the powers of  the  legislature  were
considerably hampered as those  regulatory  powers  were  conferred  on  the
Minister in  whose  department  that  legislation  falls.  However,  it  was
critical  to  note  that  parliament  still  conducts  oversight  over   the
performance of the Minister and as such  can  hold  the  Minister  concerned
accountable. It was therefore necessary that where  legislation  deals  with
domestic violence, that the development of regulations to  such  legislation
does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  executive  authority
alone, but was also subject to legislative scrutiny.

Firearm Control

In terms of the Firearms Control Act, No 60  of  2000,  it  was  recommended
that a review of the training received by police officials on  the  DVA  and
Firearms Control Act (FCA) should be  conducted.  In  this  regard,  it  was
further recommended that such a  review  highlight  the  need  for  improved
training with disciplinary consequences for police officers not knowing  of,
or complying with, the National Instruction on Domestic Violence.

In terms  of  the  seizure  of  firearms  and  other  weapons  used  in  the
perpetration of acts of domestic violence,  it  was  essential  that  police
question witnesses at the scene of a domestic violence incident, search  for
a firearm and remove it, regardless of the state of the  alleged  abuser  or
alleged threats with a firearm.

The safety of victims of domestic violence during  the  period  between  the
granting of an interim  protection  order,  and  the  approval  of  a  final
protection order in terms of the firearms control legislation had also  been
brought into question.  It  remained  critical  that  guidelines  should  be
drafted in order to  strengthen  the  protections  afforded  to  victims  of
domestic violence by the interim order.  These  proposed  guidelines  should
focus on the protection of the victim and in particular seek to:

    • Introduce more rigorous questions relating to the presence of  weapons
      in the communal home, whether these firearms are the property  and  or
      registered to the victim or the perpetrator.
    • The transferring of the onus for the request to remove  firearms  from
      the communal home from the applicant to the presiding officer.
    • Providing for clarity, making it clearer  that  the  firearm  must  be
      removed  immediately  and  not  only  on  the  return  date  when  the
      protection order is made final.

The Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD)

In terms of oversight over the conduct of the South African  Police  Service
(SAPS), the Independent Complaints Directorate  was  tasked  with  reviewing
allegations of abuse of police power,  particularly  where  it  pertains  to
situations of domestic violence.  However, it has  been  reported  that  the
South African Police Service Act, No. 68 of 1995, did  not  afford  the  ICD
sufficient powers to compel the South African Police Service to comply  with
recommendations that have been made  by  the  ICD.   This  was  particularly
problematic as  it  did  not  provide  victims  of  domestic  violence  with
sufficient recourse in instances of police misconduct.  It  was  recommended
that the South African Police Service Act should  be  amended  in  order  to
widen  the  scope  of  the  powers  and  compel  the  SAPS  to  comply  with
recommendations made by the watchdog.

Furthermore, the ICD was currently in advanced discussions around  assigning
their responsibilities in terms of the DVA  to  the  SAPS  Secretariat.   In
this regard, it  would  be  critical  for  both  the  portfolio  and  select
committees to be actively involved in this process in order to  ensure  that
weakness in the ICD are not duplicated in the SAPS  Secretariat.   Moreover,
the committees would need to ascertain what resources the  SAPS  Secretariat
have available to ensure effective oversight over the DVA.

Development of a Performance Monitoring Framework for Courts

As has already been noted, record-keeping at South  African  courts  remains
poor.  This  was  further  complicated  insofar  as  domestic  violence  was
concerned. Particular problems around the implementation and  interpretation
of provisions of the DVA were experienced.  It was therefore necessary  that
a performance monitoring framework was implemented  to  assess  the  courts’
effective implementation of the Act.  This would enable the authorities  to:


    • Assess the quality and completeness of recordkeeping by the courts.
    •  The  standardisation  of  processes  and  procedures  across   courts
      including  courts’  working  hours  and   their   interpretation   and
      application of the DVA’s provisions.
    • Making it mandatory that all domestic violence applications  be  dealt
      with in private  offices  where  applicants’  confidentiality  may  be
      maintained.


The committee should therefore request the  Quality  Assurance  Division  of
the  Magistrates  Commission  to  outline  their  current   procedures   for
monitoring court performance in relation to the DVA.  It  is  critical  that
such a report to Parliament contain  specifics  about  the  availability  of
magistrates after hours to issue interim protection orders  where  they  are
urgently  required.  However,  the  executive  authority   responsible   for
monitoring the  conduct  of  magistrates,  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, should present recommendations to the  committee
on how monitoring could be strengthened and its  findings  made  enforceable
by courts.

Service of the Protection Orders

One of the major  concerns  in  terms  of  the  DVA  was  the  servicing  of
protection orders on respondents.  The  public  hearings  demonstrated  that
that process presented a real obstacle to women’s access to the  protections
police officials in the service of  protection  orders  was  problematic  as
police officials were unwilling to serve these documents in favour  of  more
pressing police matters.  In that regard,  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development should rework Regulation 15  of  the  regulations
to the DVA, entitled ‘Service of documents’, in order to ensure  that  court
officials increase their use of the sheriffs and substantially reduce  their
use of police officials to serve orders.  It was  further  recommended  that
the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  present  these
proposed amendments to Parliament.

The  costs  involved  in  the  serving  of  protection  orders,  in  certain
circumstances, severely hampers the ability of victims of domestic  violence
to obtain protection orders. This was more so the case in rural areas  where
victims can ill afford the costs  involved  in  the  serving  of  protection
orders on the respondent. The financial threshold for assistance applied  in
rural areas with respect to sheriff’s services  should  therefore  be  lower
than those applied in urban areas. The present  regulatory  framework  gives
court officials too much discretion in the application of  Regulation  15(4)
of the regulations to the DVA.   Regulation 15(4) states that:

“The complainant or respondent who requires  a  document  to  be  served  in
terms of the Act or these regulations, shall be responsible  for  the  costs
of  such  service  provided  that  the  clerk  of  the  court   may,   after
consideration of such proof as he or she may require, direct that the  State
must be responsible for the costs of any service in  terms  of  the  Act  or
these regulations if  he  or  she  is  satisfied  that  the  complainant  or
respondent as the case may be, or both the complainant  and  respondent,  do
not have the means to pay for  such  costs  at  the  time  when  service  is
required.”

The regulations must therefore also make explicit reference to  the  courts’
need to take payment of the  sheriff’s  fees  into  account  when  compiling
their annual budgets.

One particular concern around the issuing and service of  protection  orders
relates  to  the  accessibility  of  protection  orders  to   persons   with
disabilities,  especially  persons  with   visual   impairments.    It   was
recommended, that in cases where the need arises, protection  orders  should
be accessible e.g. Braille.

Ensuring the Availability of Shelter and Counselling Services

The  availability  of  shelters  and  counselling  services  to  victims  of
domestic violence was  raised  as  a  serious  concern  by  those  who  made
submissions to the Portfolio and Select Committee on Women, Youth,  Children
and  People  with  Disabilities.  It  was  noted  that  the  DVA  placed  no
corresponding obligations on health or  social  service  providers  to  make
such services available. This gap weakens referral systems  and  contributes
to fragmented responses to domestic violence by various  service  providers.
In terms of section 19(c) of the DVA, the Minister may make  regulations  on
“any other matter s/he deems necessary or  expedient  to  be  prescribed  in
order to achieve the objects of this Act.”   It  was  therefore  recommended
that  certain  regulations  governing  the  availability  of   shelter   and
counselling services might be necessary.

In this regard, the Department of Social  Development  should  be  consulted
around the guidelines for shelters  and  services  to  victims  of  domestic
violence. The documents must clearly articulate:

    • How counseling services and shelters will be funded.
    • The training norms and standards, as well as competencies required  by
      those working in this field.
    • The management and recruitment of volunteers.
    • The nature of interventions required to address domestic violence.

Moreover, these documents should note and address the  relationship  between
child abuse and intimate partner violence and describe how  both  children’s
agencies, as well as those dealing with abused  women,  could  address  this
link.

The Department of Health has health care professionals suitably  trained  to
render counseling services, general emergency and medical care as well as  a
range of psycho-social services for victims of domestic  violence.  The  DVA
does not overtly state the need for health care services should be  rendered
to victims  of  domestic  violence  nor  specify  the  direct  role  of  the
Department of Health hereto. Hence, a legislative amendment to this end  was
proposed with specifications followed up in the regulations.

Once  finalised,  these  guidelines  (in  relation  to  counseling,  shelter
provision, health care) should be submitted to Parliament  and  gazetted  as
regulations in terms of section 19(1)(c). This was a  particularly  critical
issue and needed to be ensured that it was appropriately resourced.

5.2   OVERSIGHT

General

    • Strategies should be developed to deal with marginalised  groups  most
      vulnerable to domestic violence that do not  benefit  from  the  Act’s
      protection such as children, persons  with  disabilities,  pensioners,
      foreign nationals etc.
    • The National Youth  Development  Agency,  the  Commission  for  Gender
      Equality and the South African Human Rights Commission  should  report
      annually to Parliament on progress with respect to addressing domestic
      violence as per their given mandates.
    • A mechanism should be devised within Parliament  to  ensure  that  the
      implementation of the DVA was overseen  by  all  committees  concerned
      namely the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth,  Children  and  People
      with Disabilities, the Select Committee on Women, Children and  People
      with Disabilities, the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security, the
      Portfolio Committee on Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  the
      Portfolio Committee on  Health,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Social
      Development, the Portfolio  Committee  on  Human  Settlement  and  the
      Select Committee on Social Services.
    • All relevant departments  must  report  to  the  respective  portfolio
      committees on an annual basis in terms of progress with respect to the
      DVA, as per the template in Appendix A. A  scorecard  related  to  the
      implementation of  the  DVA  should  be  devised  for  monitoring  and
      evaluation purposes.
    • The Portfolio Committee on Women,  Youth,  Children  and  People  with
      Disabilities must hold the Inter-departmental committee to account and
      include  the  National  Treasury  to  reinforce  the   importance   of
      adequately funding programmes that address domestic violence.
    • It  was  imperative  that  Parliament  insists  on  reports  from  the
      Department of Police on its compliance with the DVA and  the  Firearms
      Control Act as it relates to domestic violence.
    • Parliament must request reports on the implementation of  measures  to
      ensure that all firearms are returned when staff go off  duty  because
      of the escalating domestic  violence  incidents  resulting  in  family
      murders committed by officers (e.g.  police,  South  African  National
      Defence Force soldiers and private security  guards)  with  access  to
      legal firearms.
    • Parliament should oversee  that  the  various  government  departments
      should raise awareness  around  the  existence  of  the  Act  and  its
      importance to be disseminated to all sectors of society  in  order  to
      effectively use and implement the DVA.
    • In order for Members of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Women,  Youth,
      Children and People with Disabilities  and  the  Select  Committee  on
      Women, Children and People  with  Disabilities  to  conduct  effective
      oversight with respect to  the  implementation  of  the  DVA,  members
      require training on the implications of the DVA.
    • The lack of  an  overarching  policy  framework  to  address  domestic
      violence severely impedes the effectiveness of  services  rendered  to
      victims of domestic violence. As such, establishing  a  framework  for
      the  DVA  will  ensure  service  norms  and  standards,  training  and
      monitoring  requirements,  reporting  channels   and   the   role   of
      volunteers.  The  Ministry  for  Women,  Children  and  Persons   with
      Disabilities will be best suited to lead such a process for developing
      an overarching policy framework.


Policing
    • Norms and standards regarding training for police must be developed as
      a matter of priority. This training framework should  be  included  in
      the South African Police Services National Instructions.
    • The Department of Police  must  amend  its  National  Instructions  to
      provide clear guidelines around when police officers should or  should
      not arrest perpetrators of abuse.
    • A five year plan for the effective policing of domestic violence  must
      be developed. This plan  needs  to  set  clear  goals,  timelines  and
      targets for the effective implementation of the DVA. The role  of  the
      SAPS Evaluation Service in monitoring whether these targets are  being
      met or not should be clearly stated.
    • The referral of victims of domestic violence to health  care  services
      and counselling by police officers must be closely  monitored  as  the
      public hearings revealed that this was not being implemented.
    • It was imperative that domestic violence registers were maintained and
      monitored  at  all  police  stations.  To  this  end,  the   officials
      responsible for monitoring and maintaining the registers must be  held
      to account.
    •  A  mechanism  should  be  developed  to  deal  with  withdrawals,  or
      situations where women do not wish  to  lay  charges  but  nonetheless
      still require help and protection.
    • It was  imperative  that  sufficient  resources  such  as  specialised
      personnel, forensic specialists, forensic laboratories etc. should  be
      allocated for evidence collection.

JUDICIARY
Develop a costed policy and/or legislation around  the  Family  Courts  (and
other specialised courts)
    • The status and future  of  the  Family  Courts  was  unclear.  It  was
      recommended that a clear policy should be issued in  this  regard  and
      that the blueprint should be elevated to the  status  of  regulations.
      Clear timeframes and goals for  the  proliferation  of  family  courts
      should be developed.
    •  Engagement  with  the  Department  of  Justice   and   Constitutional
      Development with respect to strengthening  revisions  for  specialised
      courts.

Develop norms and standards around training for court personnel
    • It is imperative that training standards  and  norms  around  the  DVA
      should be  clearly  established  by  the  Department  of  Justice  and
      Constitutional Development. These should include stipulating the basic
      level of knowledge that magistrates,  prosecutors  and  clerks  should
      demonstrate before being permitted to  deal  with  domestic  violence.
      This training framework should also indicate the basic content of  the
      training, as well as the minimum  competence  required  of  those  who
      provide the training.  Training  should  be  ongoing,  with  follow-up
      courses building on previous training.
    •  In  the  case  of  the  Department  of  Justice  and   Constitutional
      Development, this training framework should be included in the revised
      regulations.
    • The department should assess the efficacy of  training  regularly  and
      adapt the training programme where necessary.

Accessibility
    • It was imperative that  a  detailed  plan  should  be  developed  that
      outlines how courts would be made accessible over the next five years,
      with specific  reference  to  the  needs  of  children,  persons  with
      disabilities and victims of domestic violence and sexual offences.  In
      addition, the issue of after hour access to courts was another crucial
      issue requiring attention.

Sheriff’s Office
    • A means test must be developed that assesses on an equitable basis the
      cost incurred for having a protection order served  by  the  Sheriff’s
      office.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Victim Empowerment Programme (VEP)
    •  The  VEP  programme  required  review  in  terms  of  provisions  and
      resourcing as the public hearings revealed that the programme did  not
      serve the needs of victims it is intended for.
    •  Neither  the  Victims’  Charter  nor  the  Minimum  Standards  define
      secondary victimisation. This  was  problematic  as  many  victims  of
      domestic  violence  were  subjected  to  secondary  victimisation   by
      government officials. It was imperative that this  was  done  so  that
      government departments had an understanding of secondary victimisation
      and in so doing,  were  in  a  position  to  prevent  re-victimisation
      through appropriate institutional responses.
    •  Re-assess  funding  criteria  for  VEP  grants   to   civil   society
      organisations. Grants should be made available to shelters given  that
      they provide a critical service to victims of domestic violence.
    • Victim Empowerment Legislation: There  was  a  need  to  expedite  the
      promulgation of appropriate legislation which was developed  in  close
      consultation with civil society.
    • Greater public awareness was  required  in  terms  of  the  rights  of
      victims of domestic violence and the Domestic Violence Act itself.  To
      this end, government must allocate sufficient resources  to  undertake
      such an awareness campaign.
    • Greater synergy was required between the VEP,  the  Victims’  Charter,
      the Minimum Standards for Service Delivery and the Uniform Protocol on
      Victim Management to ensure services were better co-ordinated. This in
      turn will avoid the duplication of services and the more efficient use
      of resources.
    • The management of lay counsellors at Thuthuzela centres has  not  been
      working  effectively  across  the  country  on  account  of  the  poor
      supervision,   lack   of   accountability   and   often   ill-equipped
      counsellors. A proposal for  the  establishment  of  Victim  Advocates
      should be considered, whereby the role is merely to assist the  victim
      throughout the administrative process within justice and police sector
      to health and social development. Hence, the  counselling  of  victims
      should  be  left  to  appropriately  trained  professionals  that  are
      equipped to deal with domestic violence.

HEALTH SERVICES

Psycho-social support
    • A review of existing services and programmes must be done to determine
      where services are absent or need to be up-scaled.
    • An audit  of  government  personnel  rendering  psycho-social  support
      should be undertaken to determine where the skills shortages were  and
      a plan  should  be  devised  to  address  the  shortfall.  Identify  a
      recruitment strategy to increase the cadre of skilled  personnel  e.g.
      bursaries for psychologists, occupational therapists etc.
    • A review of existing programmes was required that was focused  on  the
      rehabilitation of perpetrators to determine whether  these  programmes
      were effective and could be demonstrated to bring about change in  the
      abusers’ behaviour. Where such programmes could be  identified,  their
      replication may be considered. To this end, such  programmes  must  be
      equipped with suitably-trained personnel and adequately resourced.
    • It was proposed that Thuthuzela Care Centres and the services  offered
      should be made available for victims of domestic violence and not only
      be limited to rape survivors.

Effective information systems
    •  An  effective  systemised  screening  within  and  across  government
      departments  such  as  Health,  Education  and  Police,  for  domestic
      violence against children and women was lacking. For example, a victim
      of domestic violence can present  numerous  times  at  a  health  care
      facility but this information maybe absent at the Department of Police
      if a case has not been opened. A framework for screening was  required
      and a mechanism  for  locating  pertinent  information  regarding  the
      victim. This could be achieved by establishing databases at  hospitals
      and schools in order to  identify  victims  of  violence.  This  could
      monitor trends and incidences of violence as it relates to  particular
      demographics. Databases can also be used to identify and refer victims
      to the necessary and appropriate psychosocial services based on  their
      specific cases.

Policy and strategy development
    • The Department of Health should develop a comprehensive health  sector
      policy to deal with domestic violence.  Such  a  policy  must  clearly
      outline the roles and responsibilities of  health  care  workers,  the
      training required  by  health  workers  to  implement  the  policy,  a
      monitoring and evaluation strategy as well as a budget to  effectively
      implement such a policy. It would be imperative that a policy of  this
      nature  should  be  developed  in  consultation  with  civil   society
      organisations rendering services to victims of  domestic  violence  to
      ensure  effective  networking  and  referral  between   role   players
      concerned. It is Parliament’s role  to  oversee  that  the  policy  is
      developed and implemented.
    • It was recommended that the Department  of  Health  should  develop  a
      strategy to work with  the  Department  of  Police  in  ensuring  that
      victims of domestic violence are taken to a medico-legal  facility  to
      have the incident reported officially. This, in  turn,  would  require
      that health personnel should be adequately trained  and  competent  in
      documenting the nature and extent of the injury and be able to testify
      in a court of law.
    • In the context of the HIV and AIDS pandemic, the Department of  Health
      should  develop  a  plan   stipulating   how   the   existing   public
      communications campaigns will address domestic violence in the current
      messaging. A targeted strategy was required  to  deal  with  women  in
      abusive relationships who had limited choices in terms of applying the
      Department’s current prevention strategies (abstain, be faithful,  use
      a condom).

Human Settlement

    • The Department of Human Settlement was recommended to develop a policy
      that addresses  the  secondary  housing  needs  of  domestic  violence
      victims.

6. CONCLUSION

The committees had also agreed to the following:

    • All individual cases from the public hearings must be followed up  and
      that government departments would have to account in this regard in an
      official response in writing and through a briefing to the committee.
    • The names of individuals that presented at the  public  hearings  will
      not be published in the committee’s report and that anonymity would be
      adhered to.
    • The report will be used as a tool to  monitor  government  departments
      again in terms of implementation  of  the  DVA.  The  committees  will
      request  the   relevant   government   departments   responsible   for
      implementing the DVA to provide a written  report  (annually)  to  the
      committee on progress  with  regards  to  programmes  implemented  and
      services rendered in this regard as well as funding allocated hereto.
    • A copy of the strategic report and the committee’s report will be sent
      to all those participants and respective government departments.
    • Joint oversight with respective portfolio  committees  to  assess  the
      implementation of the DVA.

The committees agreed that the report should be published  in  the  ATC  and
debated in the National Assembly House in 2010.

Report to be considered.
