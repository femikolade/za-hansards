                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


    That the Council —

       1) notes with amazement the refusal of the Minister of Defence and
          Military Veterans to provide full information about flights
          undertaken by President Zuma, Deputy President Motlanthe and
          herself;

       2) further notes that such refusals on the part of the Minister
          constitute a breach of trust and a violation of the obligation for
          Parliament to conduct oversight of the executive;

       3) notes, in addition, that this refusal would seem to be a
          deliberate attempt to cover up huge costs incurred to fly VIPs
          overseas and around South Africa; and

       4) therefore calls upon the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans
          to immediately provide a full and detailed report on the costs,
          service providers, and destinations of flights undertaken for all
          members of the Cabinet over the past six months.

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


    That the Council —

       1) notes the unacceptable manner in which the ANC supporters and MECs
          in the Northern Province are positioning themselves with regard to
          the detention of MEC John Block;

       2) further notes the urgent necessity to stamp out the belief that
          there is one law for the elite in government and another law for
          the rest of us;

       3) acknowledges the undesirable meting out of one form of treatment
          for Mr Block and another for other detainees considering that the
          law must not only have equal application, but must be seen by all
          to have equal application; and

       4) recognises the continuing manifestation that South Africa in 2010
          is a regnant democracy, where one party has been in power for too
          long, and where, as a result people in government have come to
          believe that they are above the law.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting of the Council:


    That the Council —

       1) notes that the livestock farmers in the Baviaans and Couga
          mountains as well as the Elands River and Groendal areas, have
          planned a meeting with the Department of Environmental Affairs for
          Friday 5 November 2010 where no less than 12 agricultural
          associations met to discuss the leopard problem in livestock and
          game farming in these areas;
       2) further notes that the Department of Environmental Affairs, who
          initiated and confirmed their attendance at the above meeting,
          recalled all their officials from attending;

       3) acknowledges that the leopards conserved and protected by the
          farmers at present which currently roam the area outside the
          Baviaans amount to at least 70, whereas the farmers had to
          eliminate only 28 in the last two years;

       4) acknowledges that the stock and game losses due to the leopard
          predation amount to about R1,4 million over the last two years;

       5) requests the Department of Environmental Affairs to immediately
          face their responsibility and reschedule the meeting with the
          farmers to discuss and resolve the way forward to not only protect
          the viability of farming operations but to also prevent the job
          losses with it;

       6) requests the government that, since 35% of the land, estimated at
          about 250 000 ha, where these cats roam belongs to the state -

           a) they fence and protect their properties according to the game
              fencing regulations as is expected of any other individual
              who farms with the big cat species; and
          b) they see there is sufficient food for the leopards in the
             Baviaanskloof state land.

Mr S S MAZOSIWE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


    That the Council —

       1) notes with utter contempt the horrendous accident involving the
          family of a Tshwane metro police officer, Mr Chris Fourie, his
          wife Jenny Fourie, and their three children who were badly injured
          when their car was hit at high speed by another car suspected to
          have raced through a red robot while taking part in drag racing,
          which is a common and notorious occurrence every Sunday in many
          parts of our cities and public roads;

       2) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
          such disregard for the safety of our communities by heartless and
          irresponsible mavericks; and

       3) calls on all metro police and traffic departments across South
          Africa to wage a war against drag racers who continuously hold our
          communities at ransom and subject them to the deadliest dangers of
          their selfish and reckless antics that are nothing but a show of
          disrespect for our laws and the constitutionally enshrined rights
          of our communities.

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


    That the Council —

       1) notes that 20 farms have been abandoned and a further 144 farms
          were found to be unproductive in the Free State province alone
          under the land reform programme;

       2) further notes that the Department of Rural Development and Land
          Affairs should therefore concentrate their resources on these
          unproductive and abandoned farms to ensure the future
          sustainability of emerging farmers; and

       3) acknowledges that experienced extension officers with sufficient
          resources and better mentoring by existing successful farmers,
          together with recapitalisation from the department, are required
          to ensure future food security, rather than the quest for new
          productive commercial agricultural land which is then added to the
          irresponsible failed state farming enterprises.

Mnr M J R DE VILLIERS: Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting van die Raad sal
ek voorstel:


   Dat die Raad kennis neem —


   (1)      dat die dwase besluit wat geneem is om die veelbesproke en
        omstrede multimiljoen-rand wapentransaksie te staak, die
        ANC—regering soos ’n spook kom jag;


   (2)      dat die Staande Komitee op Openbare Rekeninge Adv Menzi
        Simelane, Hoof van die Nasionale Vervolgingsgesag, en Luitenant-
        Generaal, Anwar Dramat, hoof van die Valke, ontbied het om te
        verduidelik hoekom die ondersoek na die wapenskandaal gestaak is;


   (3)      dat die ANC—regering verder onder druk kom deurdat die
        Accountancy and Acturial Discipline Board, AADB, nou KPMG in
        Brittanje ondersoek; en


   (4)      dat die DA hierdie stappe verwelkom, omdat ons glo dat die
        waarheid aan die kiesers van Suid-Afrika en die wêreld verskuldig
        is.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting of the Council:
   That the Council –


     1) notes the foolish decision to end the investigation into the widely
        discussed and controversial multimillion-rand arms deal is coming
        back to haunt the ANC;


     2) further notes that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,
        Scopa, has summoned Adv Menzi Simelane, head of the National
        Prosecuting Authority, and Lieutenant-General Anwar Dramat, head of
        the Hawks, to explain why the investigation into the arms deal has
        been halted;


     3) acknowledges that the ANC-led government has been placed under
        further pressure now that the Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline
        Board is investigating KPMG in Britain; and


     4) welcomes these steps because we believe that the voters of South
        Africa and the world are owed the truth.]


The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at
the next sitting of the Council:

   That the Council –


     1) notes the damning forensic audit by auditors KPMG which showed how
        the Congress of the People wasted millions in public funds in its
        parliamentary allowance, including over R2 million on its aborted
        elective party conference in Centurion;


     2) further notes that KPMG found that among the financial abuses were
        the following -


          a) people not employed by Cope parliamentary caucus were being
             paid from parliamentary allowances, including three provincial
             youth secretaries, who were paid an amount of R213 000 in 18
             months without valid employment contracts and an additional
             R28 000 was spent on their travelling costs;


          b) a payment of R155 000 to their Johannesburg-based financial
             manager Pat Gamede whose employment contract was based on a
             verbal agreement with Shilowa;


          c) an amount of R212 000 to cover legal fees incurred when the
             hon Mr D Bloem and the hon Mr L Tolo took Parliament to court
             to stop and/or contest their evictions from houses they were
             occupying at the Pelican Park parliamentary village;


          d) an amount of R330 000 in petty cash withdrawals which took
             place from June 2009 to May 2010 and no receipts were provided
             for R110000 of the money;


          e) stationery purchases of R739 000 over a year without a signed
             contract with the supplier; and



    (3)     takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
        such gross abuse of public funds and calls on Parliament to lay
        criminal charges against all those involved in this utter abuse of
        public funds.


Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

    That the Council –


      1) notes the failure of government to treat the owners of Aurora
         Mines, because of their political connections, in the normal way
         subject to the laws of the land;


      2) further notes the further shameful failure of government to ensure
         that long-suffering miners and workers who were owed remuneration
         were paid out according to the prevailing laws of our country; and
      3) acknowledges the further failure of government in allowing working
         and commercially viable mines, farms and other enterprises to
         collapse in the hands of new owners from the previously
         disadvantaged sectors.

Mr J M BEKKER: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council debates what the upgrading of an informal settlement
   means to people as part of a better life for all.

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council –

      1) notes the failure of government in ensuring that our schools are
         safe, that a code of conduct is enforced and that educators serve
         as exemplary role models; and

   (2)      further notes the failure of government to institute
        disciplinary procedures to deal promptly with educators who abuse
        pupils, engage in sexual activities with them, come to school late
        or do not come to school at all and those who come to school
        intoxicated.


Mr O DE BEER: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:

   That the Council –


     1) notes the signal failure of the Minister of State Security in not
        publicly and strongly distancing himself from his wife who is in
        court on serious charges of widescale drug trafficking;


     2) further notes the further failure of the Minister in not standing
        aside for the duration of the legal proceedings against his wife;
        and


     3) acknowledges the failure of government in not making a
        pronouncement on the matter considering its implication for
        intelligence and security in our country.

                        DANGERS OF INFORMAL GAMBLING

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M C DIKGALE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —


     1) notes that the National Responsible Gambling Programme has released
        results of a survey showing that people are more at risk from
        informal gambling with dice, cards and fahfee, than from betting on
        horses or playing a slot machine at a casino;


     2) further notes that the survey shows that 19% of the country’s
        gamblers gamble at informal venues, 12% in casinos and 68% play the
        lottery, and that in the common gambling areas such as White City
        Jabavu and Javela Park in Johannesburg, people are betting their
        houses, cars and even wives or partners to fuel their gambling
        addictions;


      3) takes this opportunity to call on structures such as the SA
         Council on Responsible Gambling, the National Responsible Gambling
         Programme, and the National Gambling Board to create more
         programmes to raise awareness about the dangers of informal
         gambling; and


      4) calls on the SA Police and the Metro police to wage a war against
         this repulsive modernised slavery which is a gross violation of
         the rights of the women and children used for betting.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        TRAGIC DEATH OF HOOSEN MOOSA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council —


     1) notes the tragic death of 19-year-old Hoosen Moosa who collapsed and
        died whilst participating in rugby training at Uvongo in KwaZulu-
        Natal on Saturday, 6 November 2010;


     2) further notes that Hoosen was a keen rugby player who had been
        selected to play for the Ugu team that is to participate in the
        Kwanaloga Games in Richards Bay later this year; and


     3) extends its condolences to Hoosen’s family and hopes that they may
        find peace in the midst of this tragedy.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            GANG RAPE IN SCHOOLS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B P MABE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


   That the Council —


     1) notes with utter dismay and contempt that a schoolgirl was gang-
        raped at her school in Johannesburg by a group of boys who filmed
        the assault last week Thursday, 4 November 2010;


     2) further notes that preliminary investigations suggested that two
        girls were given a date-rape drug on Thursday by a fellow learner
        and one of the girls was subsequently gang-raped by a group of boys
        while being filmed on their cellphones on the school grounds and
        during school hours;


     3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
        such inhumane and utterly repulsive behaviour from the learners and
        the failure of teachers and pupils to respond to the alleged gang-
        rape for almost five days under a frivolous excuse of not wanting to
        traumatise the school during the exams; and


     4) calls on the Minister of Basic Education to institute an inquiry
        into the incident and the conduct of the immediate school community
        for its failure to protect the learner.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member from Gauteng, did you have your
hand up? I have just forgotten your name; they have not updated the list.
[Interjections.] Hon Abrahams. Can you take your seat.

           MAHATMA GANDHI AND ARRIVAL OF INDIAN COMMUNITY IN 1860

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs B L ABRAHAMS: Thank you, hon Chairperson. My name is Bev Abrahams from
Gauteng, the beautiful province. [Laughter.] I move without notice:

   That the Council —


     1) notes that the Indian community arrived in South Africa on 16
        November 1860, 150 years ago;


     2) further notes that they were employed on the Natal Estate sugar
        farms as labourers;


     3) acknowledges that Mahatma Gandhi was one of the first Indians that
        travelled on a “whites only” train and was forcefully removed by
        the apartheid government; and


     4) realises that we should never let that be allowed again in South
        Africa.
Long live the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi!

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           CALL ON MEMBERS OF CRISIS-RIDDEN COPE TO RETURN TO ANC

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M P JACOBS: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –


     1) notes that the political circus in the Congress of the People
        continues to make headlines as whips of the party took a decision
        to have their Deputy President Mbhazima Shilowa suspended from
        Parliament for submitting unauthorised and fabricated financial
        statements;


     2) further notes that Mbhazima Shilowa was suspended as the party’s
        chief whip and accounting officer in a bitter political fight that
        has seen their party divided into those who support him and those
        who support his arch rival for the presidency of the party; and


     3) takes this opportunity to call on all those who left the ANC to
        join Cope to come back to where they belong and rejoin our national
        quest to rebuild South Africa and dismantle the legacy of apartheid
        development in our communities.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, order! Is there any objection to that
motion? [Interjections.] [Laughter.] In the light of the objection, the
motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become
a notice of motion.

        word om die Suid-Afrikaanse publiek te beveilig; en

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

        September and their friend Mannetjie John, was sentenced to three
        life terms in the Beaufort West circuit court yesterday, 8 November
        2010; and


     2) takes this opportunity to welcome the sentence and hopes that it
        will send a very strong message to farmers who have no regard for
        the constitutional rights of farm dwellers and their families.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   APPEAL TO BE VIGILANT OF SERIAL RAPIST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, I move without notice:

        Johannesburg area and more recently in Pretoria;

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I move the motion as printed in my
name on the Order Paper as follows:

   That the Council, in terms of Rule 21(2) and, in the interest of

                  SOUTH AFRICAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL

                BIRTHS AND DEATHS REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL

            LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

Mrs R N RASMENI: Chairperson and hon members, the founding provisions of
the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa state that national
legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of
citizenship. Up to now the acquisition, loss, deprivation and resumption of
South African citizenship was regulated by the South African Citizenship
Act, Act 88 of 1995 and the regulations issued in terms thereof.
New and changing circumstances made it necessary for the South African
Citizenship Amendment Bill, Bill 17 of 2010, to be considered. In terms of
the Bill, any person shall be a South African citizen by birth if he or she
is born in or outside the Republic and one of his or her parents is or was,
at the time of his or her birth, a South African citizen. No person shall
be a South African citizen by birth if, at the time of his or her birth,
one of his or her parents had not been admitted into the Republic for
permanent residence and his or her other parent was not a South African
citizen. Any person born in the Republic of parents who have been admitted
into the Republic for permanent residence and who is not a citizen
qualifies to be a citizen by birth if he or she has lived in the Republic
from the date of birth up to attaining the age of maturity and his or her
birth is registered in the Republic according to the Births and Deaths
Registration Act, Act 51 of 1992. A child adopted by a South African
citizen acquires citizenship by descent and, most importantly, a
naturalised citizen may not apply for retention of citizenship if he or she
wishes to engage in a war that the government of the Republic of South
Africa does not support.

In 2006, the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain
Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act, Act 27 of 2006, was passed as
a way of prohibiting mercenary activity and to regulate the enlistment of
South African citizens of permanent residence in other armed forces. The
fact that there is no provision for the loss of citizenship by a
naturalised citizen for engaging in a war that the Republic does not
support has become a matter of concern. The amendment of section 6 of the
South African Citizenship Act, Act 88 of 1995, now provides that a
naturalised citizen may not apply for retention of citizenship if he or she
wishes to engage in a war that the government of the Republic does not
support under the flag of another country.

The main objective of the Births and Deaths Registration Amendment Bill,
Bill 18 of 2010, is to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act, Act 51
of 1992, with regard to the following: provisions relating to the
registrations of births, designation of funeral undertakers, recording of
adoptions, and provisions relating to secrecy of records obtained under the
Act. It addresses the following: It provides for parents, persons having
charge of a child or persons requested by parents or persons having charge
of a child to give notice of birth. This allows agents to actively
participate in births registration, resulting in inability to conduct
verification processes. In some cases, this leads to false registration.

It categorises late registration of birth into three categories with
different criteria. It permits the amendment of birth registration and
particulars of a child born out of wedlock after the first registration. It
allows for abandoned children who are part of child-headed families to get
assistance to register birth, and it provides for the designation of
funeral undertakers to act as agents for death registration activities,
ensuring the mechanism of handling death registration forms and minimising
corruption in the process.

In the main, the Bill provides for a requirement that only parents or, if
parents are deceased, a legal guardian or next of kin can give notice of
birth; categorisation of late registration of birth and providing for
stringent requirements and regulations; the requirement of prescribed
conclusive proof of paternity in cases where fathers are amended to second
father; the registration of orphaned children in order to ensure that child-
headed families get assistance to register their births; and the
designation of funeral undertakers on compliance with prescribed
requirements.

With the Local Government: Municipal Electoral Amendment Bill, Bill 27B of
2010, we seek to deepen democracy in that the clauses we seek to amend will
benefit the masses of our people in enabling them to access and enjoy their
right to vote in their choice of local government in a manner that is
easier and more efficient. South Africa’s system of local government is one
of the youngest and most democratic in the world. The first democratic
local government elections held on 5 December 2000 enabled South Africans
to vote for public representatives and parties within a transformed local
government.

We have, through this amending Bill, the opportunity to enhance the
participation of our people at the centre of development and not merely as
beneficiaries but as drivers of transformation. This amending Bill provides
the opportunity to strengthen the system of electing public
representatives, drawing on the lessons derived from our collective
experience of the need for a more effective and accountable manner in which
we elect our public representatives to local government. We must take the
forthcoming local government election as an opportunity and important
challenge to ensure that this sphere of government performs optimally with
regard to all our socioeconomic programmes directed at the further
improvement of the quality of life of all our people.

We have to work to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our system
of local government. Accordingly, we have to prepare the incoming
councillors to understand their tasks to enable them to properly discharge
their legislative and executive responsibilities.

This Bill is in line with the idea of ensuring that each of the district
and metropolitan municipalities has the necessary managerial, professional
and technical staff to enable them to implement the required developmental
programmes. The Select Committee on Social Services agrees to the three
mentioned Bills with minor amendments. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
South African Citizenship Amendment Bill, subject to proposed amendments,
agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Birth and Deaths Registration Amendment Bill, subject to a proposed
amendment, agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Local Government: Municipal Electoral Amendment Bill agreed to in
accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                      BLACK AUTHORITIES ACT REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, Chief Whip and the Minister of Rural
Development and Land Reform, good afternoon. This afternoon, I would like
to share with the House some of the deliberations that the Select Committee
on Land and Environmental Affairs had on the Black Authorities Act Repeal
Bill, B9 of 2010, that was introduced by the Minister of Rural Development
and Land Reform to Parliament.

The Black Authorities Act is the legislation which established statutory
tribal, regional and territorial authorities to generally administer the
affairs of black people, abolished the Black Representative Council
established by section 20 of the Representation of Blacks Act, Act 12 of
1936 and amended the Black Affairs Act, Act 23 of 1920 and the
Representation of Blacks Act, Act 12 of 1936.

This Act was a legislative cornerstone of apartheid by which black people
were controlled and is reminiscent of the past division and discrimination.
The provisions of the Act are both obsolete and repugnant to the values and
human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

Therefore, the legislative process that the Select Committee on Land and
Environmental Affairs followed for this section 76 Bill firstly entailed
being briefed by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.
Following the process for the section 76 Bill, the provinces were alerted,
and the permanent delegates briefed their respective provincial
counterparts on the Bill. Public hearings were then held within the
provinces and, after that, a mandate ― negotiating meeting where eight
provinces supported the Bill. The final mandate meeting was held on 2
November 2010, with all nine provinces supporting the Bill without
amendment.

Therefore, Minister and members of the House, the Select Committee on Land
and Environmental Affairs, having considered the Black Authorities Act
Repeal Bill, Bill 9 of 2010, and it being classified by the Joint Tagging
Mechanism, JTM, as a section 76 Bill, recommends adoption of the Bill
without amendment.

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Bill accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 14:50.
