                               (Announcement)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon members, before we proceed, I would
like to take this opportunity to inform the House that we have been joined

have already been sworn in. Could those members please stand so that the
House can see them. [Applause.] Thank you, hon members.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D A WORTH: Hon House Chairperson, on behalf of the DA I hereby give
notice that at the next sitting of the Council I shall move:

    That the Council –


     1) notes that video conferencing facilities between Parliament and the
        provincial legislatures launched a year ago with great fanfare are
        still not being utilised;


     2) further notes that whilst this system was fully funded by the
        European Union Donor Funding Support Programme, it has now become a
        parliamentary embarrassment since it is not in operation; and


     3) requests Parliament to inform it as to –


         a) what the problems are;


         b) whether the system will eventually be utilised;


         c) when will it be operational, if it is going to be utilised; and


         d) if the system will be scrapped, at what cost.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: House Chairperson, on a point of order: Do we have a
quorum, and what is the quorum?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): What is the quorum for? Do we have a
quorum for motions?

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: No, Chair. Do we have a quorum in this House today or
not, and what is the quorum? And it’s not a malicious or vindictive
question; it’s merely a question of clarity.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Okay, we have the Chief Whip of the
Council. Chief Whip, can you respond to that?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: House Chairperson, yes, we do. She must do
her own calculations in so far as what the number is. She can calculate
that, but, as far as we know, we have checked that. That is why we agreed
that you must come in because we have a quorum. I don’t remember anywhere
in the Rules where it says you need a quorum for motions. However, the
House will pass legislation because there is a quorum.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Thank you, hon Chief Whip, that’s why I
wanted to establish whether we needed a quorum for motions.

Mr H B GROENEWALD: House Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move on behalf of the DA:

    That the Council –


     1) notes that the North West province was officially labelled as South
        Africa’s most corrupt province by the Minister for Co-operative
        Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Sicelo Shiceka;


     2) further notes that the North West premier continues to showcase her
        “anticorruption” stance by feeding snippets to the media of a
        status report about the ongoing forensic and other investigations
        into municipalities but fails to table any report about fraud and
        corruption in the North West provincial legislature; and


     3) acknowledges that the premier, Maureen Modiselle, was not prepared
        to expose criminal individuals in almost all cases involving ANC
        deployed cadres.

Mr R A LEES: House Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting of
the Council I shall move on behalf of the DA:
    That the Council –


      1) notes with deep concern and abhorrence the ANC-proposed Media
         Appeals Tribunal and the Protection of Information Bill, which
         constitutes a direct attack on South Africa’s fledgling democracy;
         and


      2) rejects both the proposed Media Appeals Tribunal and the
         Protection of Information Bill and calls upon the ANC to withdraw
         these apartheid-type proposals and to reassure all South Africans
         that it will not again make any further threats to the hard-fought-
         for democracy.


Mr K A SINCLAIR: Hon House Chairperson, I hereby give notice ...
[Interjections.]

Chair, hon Gunda is struggling with his identity, and now he wants to
victimise me. [Laughter.]

... that at the next sitting of the Council I shall move on behalf of Cope:

   That the Council debates the imminent threat of load-shedding that South
   Africa is once again confronted with and the effect that this will have
   on society as well as our economy, all because of poor planning and
   management by those who, in spite of their failures, get extraordinary
   remuneration and unwarranted performance bonuses.

Mr M W MAKHUBELA: Chair, I hereby give notice on behalf of Cope that on the
next sitting day of the Council I shall move:


   That the Council debates the lack of equitable measures by the parole
   board, as was evident in its granting of parole to Mark Scott-Crossley,
   whilst permitting fellow accomplice Mr Mathebula to languish in prison.


Mr O DE BEER: Deputy Chair, I give notice on behalf of Cope that on the
next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

   That the Council debates the recent incident of Mpumalanga's MEC for
   human settlements, Mr Madala Masuku, and two of his bodyguards being shot
   at while travelling and subsequently being robbed by three people
   masquerading as policemen, driving a car with a flashing blue light,
   which is cause for the utmost concern and determined police
   counteraction.


Mr R A LEES: Hon Chairperson, I give notice on behalf of the DA that on the
next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

    That the Council –
     1) notes the intention of global mining giant Xstrata to build its own
        power station in Limpopo, which is a clear indication of Xstrata’s
        commitment to doing business in South Africa; and


     2) therefore congratulates Xstrata for this bold move, a move that has
        been forced upon it by the threat of Eskom power shortages, a power
        crisis which has resulted from Eskom’s poor planning together with
        short-sightedness on the part of the ANC government when it was
        warned of power shortages by the DA as long ago as the early 2000s.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: Deputy Chairperson, I hereby give notice on behalf of
the DA that on the next sitting day of the Council I shall move:

    That the Council –


     1) notes that –


          a) European Union donor funding of €850 million was made
             available in previous financial years since 2005 for economic
             development and similar programmes, of which tourism
             development and upgrading programmes formed part;


          b) these funds have been managed by Treasury through a project
             called Thina Sinakho, with an office in each of the nine
             provinces;


          c) all parliamentary questions, further queries and contact
             directly with the officials responsible in Treasury for the
             Thina Sinakho fund or those managing donor funding have not
             delivered any results;


      2) requests that –


          a) the annual report for the Thina Sinakho fund for the Eastern
             Cape province be submitted to this House;


          b) the Eastern Cape provincial treasury provides a quarterly
             report on the spending pattern of the Thina Sinakho fund to
             this House; and


          c) any other province that also has a similar programme or fund
             must submit the same as above.


                        ANC WINS OCTOBER BY-ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:
    That the Council –


       1) notes and welcomes the outcome of the by-elections that were held
          across four provinces on 6 October 2010, where the ANC won 17  of
          the 18 contested wards;


       2) further notes that the ANC made  inroads  in  the  Western  Cape,
          where the first test of the DA-ID pact  crumbled,  showing  clear
          signs of cracking when the ANC took over two wards in Oudtshoorn,
          which formerly belonged to the Independent Democrats, ID; and


       3) takes this opportunity to congratulate the people of South Africa
          for demonstrating their loyalty and trust  in  the  ANC  and  its
          public office bearers.

There being an objection, the motion  without  notice  became  a  notice  of
motion.


                   CELEBRATION OF AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs N W Magadla): Chairperson, I move without
notice:

    That the Council —


    (1)     notes that today, 21 October, marks African Human Rights Day and
         the celebration of the 24th year after the African Charter on
         Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Charter) entered into force;


    (2)     further notes that the African Charter created the first
         regional human rights framework for Africa and, through the
         African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, is able to hold
         governments accountable for their human rights obligations;


    (3)     acknowledges that although Africa has made a lot of progress in
         the promotion and protection of human rights over the past 24
         years, including the respect for democratic principles, human
         rights, the rule of law and principles of good governance,
         millions of people in Africa are still denied ..

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon member, there is one thing I forgot
to do. If I may just disturb you for a second, I would like to welcome
members back after the constituency period and recess. In doing so, may I
just quickly establish whether the motion, as presented by the hon Mokgobi,
has been agreed to?

An HON MEMBER: No!
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): In the light of the objection, the
motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become
a notice of motion. Therefore, in confirming that welcome, you may proceed,
hon Magadla.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs N W Magadla): Chairperson, I move without
notice:

    That the Council —


    (3)     acknowledges that although Africa has made a lot of progress in
        the promotion and protection of human rights over the past 24
        years, including the respect for democratic principles, human
        rights, the rule of law and principles of good governance, millions
        of people in Africa are still denied their basic human rights and
        are subjected to the harshest political and socioeconomic
        conditions in the world;


    (4)     further acknowledges that despite significant progress that
        African states have made in putting into practice the principles of
        the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, millions of
        people across the African continent are still faced with the
        highest proportions of poverty, poor health, hunger,
        underdevelopment and socioeconomic marginalisation, and that women
        and children remain the largest victims of civil wars, illiteracy
        and violence; and
    (5)     takes this opportunity to make a renewed call to all African
        states, leaders and civil society to do everything within their
        powers to promote and protect the political and socioeconomic
        rights of their citizens and take decisive action to prevent civil
        and political conflict on our continent.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: Chairperson, I passed my motion on to a colleague, so
my colleague will proceed with the motion. I am sorry for the confusion.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): All right.

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, I did not indicate. I apologise. I might have
raised my hand to scratch my nose or something, but I haven’t got a motion.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): You see, hon members, what I am trying
to do is share the little time that we have as much as possible. That is
why, as you raise your hands, I note them and then call you accordingly. I
don’t want to find a situation where other members feel marginalised in the
process of motions. So, please don’t scratch your head or your nose to a
point where I would think that you have raised your hand.
  RE-ELECTION OF SOUTH AFRICA AS NONPERMANENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS
                              SECURITY COUNCIL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M C MAINE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

    That the Council —


      1) notes with profound jubilation and great sense of pride the re-
         election of South Africa as a non-permanent member of the United
         Nations Security Council, UNSC, for the period 2011-2012;


      2) acknowledges that the re-election of South Africa to the United
         Nations’ most powerful seat signals a global vote of confidence in
         the role the country continues to play in international diplomacy,
         particularly in championing the African Renaissance in such areas
         as peacekeeping, security, human rights and economic development
         in the African continent; and

      3) takes this opportunity to congratulate all the South Africans,
         particularly our ambassadors and the Department of International
         Relations and Co-operation, for their dedication and great sense
         of commitment to diligently serve our nation and ensure that we
         continue to move decisively from our divided past to stand tall on
         the shoulders of the world.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      DUMPING OF BABIES IN WESTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

    That the Council —

      1) notes a recent survey by Child Welfare Cape Town, which showed
         that approximately 500 babies have been dumped by their mothers
         around Cape Town in the Western Cape and that most of them
         survived the ordeal and are currently in care homes;


      2) further notes that in the latest of many incidents ―

           a) a newborn baby boy was pulled alive from a manhole near
              Killarney Gardens by a truck driver who had earlier seen a
              woman cradling an infant at the drain;


           b) a 17-year-old mother was charged with murder and perjury in
              connection with the murder of her six-week-old baby whom she
              earlier claimed was kidnapped from the Khayelitsha Day
              Hospital, and


           c) a Khayelitsha woman discovered a dumped baby in a drain in
              the Green Point informal settlement in Khayelitsha;

      3) acknowledges that although in most cases it has been found that
         babies are dumped for various reasons, including teen pregnancies,
         drugs and alcohol abuse, rape, and other socioeconomic factors,
         the dumping of a baby is a gross and repulsive violation of their
         rights and a criminal offence; and


      4) takes this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible terms
         this inhumane and hideous criminality and calls on communities to
         create social networks that will embrace the principles of ubuntu
         and humanity by caring for each other and encouraging those who
         need assistance to seek help from the avenues made available by
         the government and civil society.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              NEW MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Hon Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

     That the Council —

        1) notes the two new hon members in the NCOP, hon T Beyleveldt and
           hon B Abrahams;

        2) further notes that hon Beyleveldt is from the Western Cape and is
           also the Whip for the Western Cape in the NCOP, while hon
           Abrahams represents Gauteng in the NCOP;

        3) acknowledges that these two members are also representing the
           Democratic Alliance in the NCOP; and

        4) takes this opportunity to wish them well and fruitful
           deliberations in the NCOP.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  RACISM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M P JACOBS: Chairperson, on behalf of the ANC, I hereby move without
notice:

    That the Council —


      1) notes with utter disdain reports of the explicit prevalence of
         racism in the University of Stellenbosch and allegations of racial
         profiling of black students by the local police station;


      2) takes this opportunity to —


           a) condemn in the strongest possible terms such blatant attacks
              and violation of our constitutional principles and ideals;
              and


           b) reject with contempt any misguided insinuation from the
              police that seems to suggest that black students must carry
              their student cards all the time when the university policy
              clearly stipulates that students are not required to carry
              student cards when on campus; and


       3) calls on the Minister of Higher Education and Training, the hon Mr
          B Nzimande and the Minister of Police, the hon Mr N Mthethwa, to
          ensure that this issue receives expedient attention.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        ANC NATIONAL GENERAL COUNCIL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

    That the Council ―


      1) notes  that  the  African  National  Congress  held  a  successful
         national general council, NGC,  over  five  days  from  20  to  24
         September  2010  at  the  Inkosi  Albert   Luthuli   International
         Convention Centre in Durban;


      2) further notes that the NGC, which was attended by 2 840 delegates,
         observers, dignitaries, members of the diplomatic corps,  and  the
         media, came out united and highly resolute in the quest to  retain
         the historical character and carry the national  duty  to  advance
         the lives of the people of South Africa, and


      3) takes this opportunity  to  congratulate  all  the  delegates  and
         officials who showed a strong sense of commitment, dedication  and
         loyalty to this life-time organisation by making sure that the NGC
         remains a resounding success.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): In light of the objection the motion
may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become a

Mrs R N RASMENI: Hon Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:

    That the Council —

      1) notes the inhumane and cruel burning of a 16-year-old in Heinz
         Park near Philippi in Cape Town just over three weeks ago in a
         horrible incident which has been described as gang related;

        2) further notes that the 16-year-old girl was dragged into a house
           and severely beaten by several men and women who burnt her with a
           flammable liquid, which resulted in her sustaining serious burns
           to her face, breasts and hands;

        3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
           this senseless, inhumane and brutal act and congratulate the girl

                        ROAD ACCIDENTS AND FATALITIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr S S MAZOSIWE: Chair, I move without notice:

    That the Council —


       1) notes that 75 commuters, including schoolchildren, were injured
          when one Golden Arrow bus crashed into the back of another in
          Cape Town on Wednesday, 20 October 2010;

          injured in a head-on taxi collision about 35 km outside
          Laingsburg in the Western Cape;


       3) acknowledges that the national statistics show horrific carnage
          on our national and provincials roads, with private cars

          between the ages of 20 and 39 years; and


       4) takes this opportunity to call on all South African road users to

    SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: WORKING TOGETHER TO INTENSIFY THE WAR ON POVERTY,
                  HUNGER AND SOCIOECONOMIC MARGINALISATION


                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Hon House Chair, hon colleagues and
guests in the gallery, it is indeed an honour and privilege for me to
address this august House on such a critical, topical theme: “Working
together to intensify the war on poverty, hunger and socioeconomic
marginalisation”.

Similar to all other years since the existence of this democratic
government, in 2007 at the 52nd national conference of the ANC, the ruling
party resolved that the central and most pressing challenges that we face
in our country are unemployment, poverty and inequality. In this regard, we
reiterate our determination to halve unemployment and poverty from the
levels where they were back in 2004 and very substantially reduce social
and economic inequality as well.

Helping our people to escape poverty is one of the key priorities of the
ANC government. It is something that we are passionate about, and we should
ensure that we achieve it. Similar to other countries, our government also
faces the challenge of limited resources. We are determined that,
irrespective of a lack of adequate resources, we will not act in a way that
will leave anybody behind, not even some of the most poor and vulnerable
people in our society.

This government has also taken a firm stance against poverty and social
exclusion. This is well reflected in our government’s legislative and
nonlegislative work, including several major policy resolutions which we
have adopted in the past few years of our existence. I sincerely believe
that our people voted for this government because they wanted us to adhere
most closely to the principles of the Freedom Charter and our beautiful
Constitution.

To translate this political obligation into concrete actions and results,
our government has undertaken a number of key actions to date. One such
policy that our government has successfully implemented over the past 16
years is the increased provision of social transfers. The gradual expansion
of the social assistance programme has helped us suppress the increase in
income inequality, particularly for people living in rural areas.

Numerous studies have confirmed that our social assistance programme is
well targeted and contributes considerably to poverty reduction. Without
social security grants as a source of income, many households within the
distribution curve would have experienced abject poverty.

This government is also undertaking a process of comprehensive social
security and retirement reforms in order to ensure that we include all
people who otherwise would have very little, if any, income support for
themselves and their dependants.

I would like to ask hon members to really study the comprehensive social
security submission, because it has several pillars – four or so. It is not
just a social assistance programme.

As government, it is our responsibility to ensure that South Africans from
all walks of life have the resources necessary to live a better and a
decent life. Given the impact of social grants on the poor, it goes without
saying that no meaningful and sustained economic growth can be achieved in
the absence of social protection.

I need to point out that providing adequate social protection is not just
about giving handouts, as some of our hon members in here, in the other
House and throughout society always and repeatedly suggest. The provision
of social protection is one of the four pillars of the International Labour
Organisation’s definition of decent work. Social protection is as important
as an industrial policy, a skills policy, investment incentives, trade and
fiscal policies in our government’s continued efforts to promote decent
jobs.

Our social protection framework includes the provision of shelter to those
denied decent human settlements for many decades in this country. The three
million houses that we built for poor people in South Africa shielded them
from the threat of homelessness and destitution that other poor and middle
classes across the world experience, particularly now recently in the wake
of the recent global economic and financial crisis.

At the same time, as this government, we transferred over R86 billion to
eligible households, enabling them to participate in the economy and meet
some of their basic needs in one of the worst economic crises the modern
world has experienced. People then had money to travel to cities and
sometimes even do a little bit of business here and there, in order to
sustain their livelihoods.

Recently, President Lula da Silva of Brazil, one of the world’s emerging
economic powerhouses, as we know it to be, stated that the social transfers
that the Brazilian government gave to its poorest citizens allowed them to
continue to stimulate demand in a very difficult economic climate and, in
the process, helped to stabilise the economy. Like all of us, Brazil has
close to a quarter of its population on some form of social assistance
programme and, like them, we see this as an investment in people and the
economy for the long-term good of our society.

Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, our nation was built on the foundations of a
deep and abiding commitment to the values of social solidarity, the
principle of equity, the principle of social justice and the rule of law.
If there is any yardstick by which our country should be defined and
measured, then it is that of being a caring, democratic and inclusive
society. Therefore, we have an obligation to history and mankind to show
that democracy can and does work. As elected representatives of our people,
we must show that democracy can deliver development and also empower the
marginalised.

At no time, no matter what the situation was or is, must we allow people to
doubt the ability of our democratic institutions to improve the lives of
our people. Approaches to tackling poverty are highly subjective and often
form part of deeply embedded ideological frameworks. We know that.

In a recent publication, the Centre for Development and Enterprise, CDE,
suggested that the South African government should not spend resources on a
redistributive policy that seeks to address inequalities. They suggested
that we should develop policies that would allow an unfettered market to
maximise economic growth and thereby create jobs.

This kind of thinking – which is known as the trickle-down effect – goes
against most of the recent research and literature that indicates that, if
countries do not deal with inequalities, their abilities to increase
economic growth and create a better society are severely limited.

In a recent publication entitled The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better
for Everyone, Wilkinson and Pickett postulate that countries with high
levels of inequality tend to have higher levels of social unrest, poor
educational outcomes despite high levels of investment, and a range of
other social ills which threaten the social fabric.

Their assertion is based on extensive studies in the developed countries.
Indeed, cumulative research suggests that high levels of social and
economic inequalities reverberate through societies on many levels,
correlating with, if not causing, more social disruptions. Therefore, it is
not surprising that these social ills are amplified in a country such as
ours with its high levels of social and economic inequalities due to
development and economic frameworks such as those espoused by the CDE
report.

The conclusions of Wilkinson and Pickett are that equality matters for all
in our society, and that all of us benefit with increased levels of
equality. We know that is not true. We need to ensure that there is
sustainable development in our country. Sustainable development does not
necessarily mean that everyone else will benefit, as Wilkinson and Pickett
and that report said.

The excluded and the vulnerable have as much stake in the development of an
equal and sustainable economic system as the rich and the better-off. We
are supposed to have all these people, including those whom we sometimes
think are vulnerable and tend to think that those policies will help. This
is the essence of partnership and solidarity. We need both to deal with
economic growth and reduce inequality. We cannot afford to pursue one at
the expense of the other. We need to work together on this. We need
partnerships between business, civil society and government for this to be
a very successful project.

It is in this spirit that I welcome the recent declaration on poverty and
inequality made by a South African civil society organisation that we know
and which included the community-based organisation Proudly Manenberg, the
South African Council of Churches and academics.

Their declaration, which is known as the Birchwood Declaration on
Inequality and Poverty in South Africa, noted that inequality has a range
of psychosocial consequences that complicate South Africa’s ability to
build social cohesion and deal with the structural nature of the country’s
poverty. They further noted that growing levels of inequality within and
amongst nations has been one of the primary drivers of the current global
crisis.

Most of the organisations that signed this declaration work with
communities at grass-roots level. I think we should listen to their
analyses and engage with their proposed solutions which, among others,
include the strengthening and implementation of redistribution instruments
and programmes that bridge the inequality divide, including social security
and the community works programme. This government should also work
together with these institutions if we are to be successful in our
endeavour to eradicate poverty. We will definitely do so.

The opportunity is now at hand for each of us in this House to join
together and ensure that our actions are guided by the vision of a better
and greater South Africa. Helen Keller wrote:

    Until the great mass of the people shall be filled with the sense of
    responsibility for each other’s welfare, social justice can never be
    attained.

Unless we address the problems of poverty, hunger and the socioeconomic
marginalisation of the poor now – and I say now – none of the great goals
that our government has set – peace, stability, human rights for all, the
preservation of the environment – are achievable in a world where one half
of our people finds themselves shut out of the opportunities and benefits
of the global society. We have seen it happening in other countries and it
shouldn’t happen here.

Therefore, it is our conviction that everyone, regardless of their social
status, should be able to live his or her life with dignity. As Jeffrey
Sachs correctly pointed out in his book, The End of Poverty: Economic
Possibilities for Our Time, we are the first generation that can end
poverty in our lifetime. History has repeatedly taught us that social and
economic development are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary.

José Antonio Ocampo once stated that:

    Ignoring inequality in the pursuit of development is perilous. Focusing
    exclusively on economic growth and income generation as a development
    strategy is ineffective as it leads to the accumulation of wealth by a
    few and deepens the poverty of the many.

It is for this reason that the ANC has persistently pursued social
programmes that give the poor the opportunity to lift themselves out of
poverty.

Former President Nelson Mandela also  cautioned  that  massive  poverty  and
obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our times,  and  that  they
have  to  rank  alongside  slavery  and  apartheid  as  social  evils.  With
Mandela’s spirit as our guide and inspiration, our government is helping  to
forge a  partnership  geared  towards  eradicating  poverty  completely  and
replacing it with equity and social inclusion. We  have  set  our  goals  to
provide sustainable livelihoods and to advance the wellbeing  of  all  South
Africans. That is why the ANC, together with its social partners,  has  made
the fight against poverty its central and overriding priority.
As I conclude, I would like to say that we have committed the full force  of
all our energies to the gravest human challenge of  our  time  ―  an  effort
that will also galvanise  the  energies  and  the  various  efforts  of  our
society around a great and just cause. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs R N RASMENI: Hon Chairperson and hon members, the ANC, in keeping with
its general commitment to an egalitarian society, rejects the dictum that
the poor will always be with us. It believes that poverty is created by
society and can, therefore, be eliminated by society. People are the
fundamental resource of the country since they have the capacity to develop
personally and are central to the development of the economy, and the
nation as a whole.

Eradicating poverty includes ensuring that the basic rights to shelter,
food, health, employment, education and all those aspects that promote the
physical, social and emotional wellbeing of all in our society are met.
Eradicating poverty means providing a social safety net for those who are
unable to care for themselves: the disabled, women, children, youth,
families in need of care, the aged and those in chronic emotional distress.

In eradicating poverty, the ANC pursues this programme within the context
of economic and social reconstruction, as well as the building of a
national democratic society. The encouragement of economic growth and the
development of economic policies that ensure equitable redistribution
through social services that are not only seen as forms of consumption, but
also as a means of social investment, are critical.

The developmental state plays a major role in meeting the legitimate and
realistic expectations of all, especially the poor, the disadvantaged and
the other vulnerable persons, in the light of the need to eradicate
poverty. As we move away from a welfare state towards a developmental state
trajectory that addresses the root causes of social problems as part of an
integrated strategy of development on the one hand and ensuring a safety
net on the other hand, we believe in the importance of the family, as it is
understood within social and cultural norms, and promote the reconstruction
of family life.

Our strategic approach in eradicating poverty and enhancing service
delivery hinges on seven critical principles. These are equity,
accessibility, democracy, community participation, accountability, equality
and social services as a right. All those who require services should feel
free to apply for such services without fear or favour.

The ANC, in government, has made unprecedented progress over the past five
years, and also since Polokwane, to address the legacies of apartheid which
reproduce patterns of development and underdevelopment in our society.
This notwithstanding, South Africa is faced with severe social problems
stemming from systemic developmental deficiencies. In large part,
development is hampered by the interaction of complex factors which will
take time to resolve. This includes rapid and ongoing urbanisation – the
intensifying movement of people from rural to urban areas, which has
fundamentally transformed the organisation of society and reconfigured the
economy.

The relative decline in the primary economic sector coupled with reduced
labour intensity has resulted in an employment bias unfavourable to a
generally unskilled workforce. Pre-existing levels of abject poverty and
the levels of deprivation have severe intergenerational impacts on affected
individuals and families, with long-term social and economic consequences.
In large part, this poverty stems from systemic factors limiting the
natural expansion of formal employment. Both the causes and the
consequences of poverty are challenges which need to be met.

The provision of public goods and services, as well as related
interventions, form the cornerstone of responses to the nation’s unbalanced
development, with education, health, social security, basic services,
social cohesion, youth and women development as key interventions.

Government’s resilience in its efforts to develop social safety nets like
improved health care, access to education, etc, continues to protect the
most vulnerable South Africans from the adverse effects of the economic
downturn since late 2008 and throughout 2009. The effective implementation
of Polokwane resolutions also required appropriate allocation of
responsibilities to relevant departments or Ministries, some of which have
only come into existence in the current administration.

Overall, the ANC has focused on overseeing effective implementation of
government’s mandate which underscores the need to create a democratic,
nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous society under the theme, “Now is the
time together to do more, better”.

The ANC’s programme for social transformation must therefore ensure that it
builds a better life by providing land and houses; comprehensive health and
social security; basic services which include water and sanitation; human
resource and capacity-building; clean and safe environments; food security;
an improvement in the nation’s health profile, including dealing with
communicable and noncommunicable disease causes; mortality; and sport and
recreation.

At our recently held national general council in September 2010, we
recommended, amongst many other matters, the following: improving the
alignment between plans and promises of all spheres of government and the
abilities of local governments to fund and implement such plans and
promises; ensuring that funding allocations from national and provincial
governments address social infrastructure backlogs; undertaking a
comprehensive assessment of the extent to which people fall through the
cracks of public and private service delivery as a result of the
application of income thresholds and ceilings that are aimed at targeting
service provision, but are exclusionary and create poverty gaps.

For us, as southern Africans, the fight against poverty and unemployment;
bridging the gap between the rich and the poor; and generally the need to
improve the living conditions of our people, remain uppermost on our list
of priorities. Our people want action on jobs, growth and poverty. We must
build a new common purpose so that we can use all our talents, skills and
resources to tackle our economic and social challenges. Ndiyabulela. [Thank
you.] [Applause.]

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Hon Chairperson, Minister, members and guests in this
august House today, to understand the topic of this debate, one must take
cognisance of the very important issues of poverty, hunger and education,
as well as the socioeconomic position and health of the population.
Poverty, hunger and unemployment are worrying matters for us, as South
Africans.

For the purpose of analysis, poverty is defined as an income below R4 560
per person per year. That is R308 per month. Taken from The South African
Child Gauge 2008, 3,3 million children ― that is 18% - living in households
were reported as hungry. According to 2008 statistics, the provinces
reporting the highest rates of child hunger are the North West, with 18% in
2007 and 25% in 2008; and KwaZulu-Natal, with 15% in 2007 and 25% in 2008.
The province with the highest unemployment rate is the Eastern Cape. By
race categorisation, 20% of the children reported as hungry are African,
followed by coloured children at 10%, white children at 2%, and Asian
children at 1%.

According to the EU-funded Municipal Outreach Project, poverty is mostly
found to be very severe amongst children, at 65,5%, with adults at 45,2%.
The total number of poor children is 11,8 million. A breakdown of the child
population reported as hungry is as follows: aged 0 to 4 years, 66%; aged 5
to 14 years, 65,7%; and aged 15 to 17 years, 63,8%. Although the child
support grant is provided to children up to the age of 18, it is surprising
that poverty rates are higher amongst children. It is most likely that the
child support grant does not move the child above the poverty line. In
short, it brings alleviation, but it is not the ultimate solution unless it
is raised.

This situation is neither affordable nor sustainable for the South African
government. On 17 February 2010, Minister Pravin Gordhan said that
R89 million will be spent on social grants in 2010-11, in the face of
increasing unemployment and the impact of the previous year’s recession. He
also said that nearly 14 million South Africans benefit from the social
assistance programme. Notwithstanding these grants, government is also
supporting municipalities in other ways, for example through the municipal
infrastructure grant, MIG, the provincial infrastructure grant, PIG, and
also funds to support the indigent to pay their municipal taxes.

This cycle of payment and support by state revenue is unaffordable, bearing
in mind that not even a quarter of our population are tax-paying employees.
Poverty is a dangerous threat to the wellness of any population and its
future.

Armoede het ’n negatiewe aanslag en impak op die sielkundige karakter van
mense. Armoede breek die menswees en welstand van mense se gesondheid en
hul waardesisteem af. Werkloosheid is dus ’n baie groot bedreiging vir ons
land. As ons na werkloosheid kyk, is die Oos-Kaap en Mpumalanga die
provinsies met die hoogste werkloosheidsyfer, naamlik 29,8% en 29,3%.

As ons ook kyk na die verskillende toelaes wat ons mense ontvang, word
hierdie mense ook baie meer verarm deur middel van die sosio-ekonomiese
probleme wat ons in ons gemeenskap het. Dit sluit hierdie geldskieters in
wat ons mense se geld vat en hulle nog verder verarm. Die regering doen wel
baie om armoede in die verskillende gemeenskappe te verlig, maar binne die
gemeenskap self doen die gemeenskappe niks om hulself uit hierdie
armoedesituasie te lig nie. Derhalwe sal ons ernstige, manhaftige stappe
moet neem om hierdie geldskieters en ander dwelm- en smokkelbedrywighede
vas te vat om sodoende ons gemeenskappe te help om uit hierdie greep van
armoede los te kom. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Poverty has a negative bearing and impact on the psychological character
of people. Poverty breaks down people’s humanity and the wellbeing of their
health and value systems. Unemployment is therefore a big threat to our
country. When we consider unemployment, the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga are
the provinces with the highest unemployment rates, at 29,8% and 29,3%
respectively.

When we look at the various grants our people receive, these people also
become more impoverished due to the socioeconomic problems that exist
within our communities. These include money lenders who take our people’s
money and cause further impoverishment. The government does indeed do a lot
to alleviate poverty in the various communities, but within the community
itself members of the community are not doing anything themselves to rise
above this impoverished situation. For this reason we need to take serious
and brave steps to clamp down on these money lenders and other drug and
smuggling activities in order to help our communities free themselves from
the grip of poverty.]

Chairperson, to meet the Millennium Development Goals, we as South Africans
must work together to find solutions to poverty and unemployment. We must
put more emphasis on an open opportunity society for all in all spheres of
our country, and open up the economy for different role-players to let the
economy grow more to create jobs and employment. Then we can lessen the
impact of grants on the government, and people can then take more
responsibility for their own lives and state of wellness.

We must reduce people’s dependency on the state. The only way to do this is
by giving people the chance to learn how to catch a fish, teaching people
how to support themselves, and giving them the opportunity and the
environment to do so.

There is a very interesting situation in South Africa. Foreigners like the
Somalis, the Zimbabweans, the Ugandans, the Sudanese, and others have come
into our country with virtually nothing to show for themselves, and have
started to make a living. They show us that they can do it through the
fellowship they enjoy amongst themselves and by extending a hand and
supporting each other to help create a better life in our country. So, why
can’t we, as South Africans, do this for our people so that we can lift
ourselves out of poverty? I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr J J GUNDA: Hon Chair, hon Minister and hon members of this House, it is
always easier to debate and discuss resolutions that seem so simple on
paper. However, in reality, it is a severe task not only to get under way
but to follow through on. South Africa’s growing poverty rate is alarming
in that it is severely egged on by the unemployment rate.
An extensive range of work over the past decade, whether in the form of
projects and/or programmes, has revealed the important links between
poverty and the environment. Therefore, to ensure that the war on poverty,
hunger and socioeconomic marginalisation will be overcome, it is crucial
that interlinked circumstances and carefully monitored and reflected policy-
making processes, at all levels, are adhered to.

New estimates of poverty show that the proportion of people living in
poverty in South Africa has not changed significantly between 1996 and
2001, up until 2008. A study by the Human Sciences Research Council, HSRC,
shows that the poverty gap has grown from R56 billion in 1996 to
R81 billion, indicating that poor households have sunk deeper into poverty
over this period. The fact that poorer households have not shared in the
proceeds of economic growth is reflected in the rise in inequality between
rich and poor.

Agb Minister, die regulasies van die staat se finansiële instellings moet
hersien word om dit sodoende meer toeganklik te maak vir die nie-
regeringsorganisasies, NRO’s, om hierdie groot uitdaging te kan oorwin. Hoe
kan ons verwag dat histories-benadeelde mense geouditeerde finansiële
verslae van twee jaar moet indien om fondse te kan bekom, terwyl ons nie
die mense tot ons beskikking het nie? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Hon Minister, the regulations of the state’s financial institutions should
be reviewed and in doing so make it more accessible for nongovernmental
organisations, NGOs, to overcome this big challenge. How can we expect
people who have been historically disadvantaged to submit audited financial
reports for two years while we do not have the people at our disposal?]

In a country like South Africa where the standard of living conditions in
informal settlements and townships is a serious cause for concern, it is
crucial that immediate measures be put in place to evaluate this growing
concern. Sadly, the war on poverty, hunger and socioeconomic
marginalisation will be a lost cause if key role-players remain immobile
and state departments do not pull their weight by supporting and following
up on programmes and projects set out to target precisely this topic we are
discussing today. Since local municipalities are at the heartbeat of
service delivery and the development of our people, it is of utmost
importance to build capacity in those very poor municipalities to confront
the gap between the rich and the poor.

Hon Minister and hon members, the ID would like to commend all efforts that
have been and are being made to catapult the South African economy and
reduce the current status of poverty in this country. Let me just state it
one way in Afrikaans.

Ons sal nooit armoede uitwis as ons dit nie persoonlik ernstig opneem nie.
Sodoende kan ons mense ’n beter lewe kry. [We will never eliminate poverty
if we personally do not regard it in a serious light. In doing so, our
people will be able to attain a better life.]

I thank you. Ke a leboga. [Applause.]

Ksz M G BOROTO: Sihlalo, ngilotjhise kumma uNgqongqotjhe u-Edna Molewa,
kumalunga nabavakatjhi abakhona. Sihlalo, phezu kwekulomo yethu namhlanje
yokulwa nendlala nomthlago, ngibawa ukuqalisa ikulumo yami ebantwini
abadala - abezimu abasadla umratha - abezimu abaqalane nomthlago, ababuzi
bona umthlago yini. Labo babantu abasifundisako. Njalo-ke ngikhuluma
ngabantu abadala.

Nangiragela phambili ngithi: (Translation of isiNdebele paragraphs
follows.)

[Ms M G BOROTO: Chairperson, greetings to Minister Edna Molewa, members and
guests present here today. Chairperson, in our debate today, which is about
fighting hunger and poverty, I would like to direct my speech to the elders
– the ancestors who are still alive, who are faced with poverty and who
have a very clear understanding of what poverty is. These are the people
who taught us. By saying this I am referring to older persons.

I would like to continue by saying the following.]
On 1 October 2010, South Africa, with the rest of the world, celebrated the
20th anniversary of the International Day of Older Persons, which was
proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 14 December 1990. It
is a significant anniversary because, during those two decades, the world’s
demographic profile changed more dramatically than at any previous time.

The rapid growth in old persons aged 60 and above in South Africa reflects
the need for the synchronisation of economic and social policies for
inclusive development. They were estimated at 50,5 million in 2007 and that
number is expected to reach 65,5 million globally in 2015, and 2015 would
be the year for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Siyabona bonyana abantu abadala bazabe bangangani ... [We see how many
older persons there will be...]

... and what is expected of us as the government, specifically in South
Africa.

They will exceed 103 million in 2030 and 205 million in 2050. As these
rapidly increasing numbers show, the number of older persons in Africa will
grow at an annual rate of 3,1% between 2007 and 2015, and 3,3% between 2015
and 2050.

It is clear that elderly people represent an ever-growing proportion of the
population, causing new social, demographic and economic situations. More
people live longer lives and they require age-friendly environments, health
care and services of all kinds. Therefore, it is logical that the
phenomenon of poverty in old age is increasingly catching the attention of
the government and policy-makers. This is evident from what we see in the
policies and the legislation proposed by the ruling party in this
government.

Considering the vulnerability of older persons, appropriate measures must
and are being taken to establish a social security scheme to provide
benefits to older persons without discrimination of any kind and ensure
equal rights for men and women. It also follows that the increase in older
components of the population is presenting challenges. We are talking about
challenges with regard to our obligations stemming from our African culture
and tradition of taking care of the elderly and respecting them.

Sazi kuhle bona ngendlela yepilo yethu, akusilula ukuthatha ugogo batjho
uyombeka ezindlini zabantu abalupheleko, lokho kuba yinto embi khulu
ebantwini bekhethu. Manjesi kufanele siqinisekise bonyana abantu laba
nanyana bahlezi emizini yabo ebonisa umtlhago, kube khona okwenziwako
begodu kwenzeke kulorhulumende okhona namhlanje.
(Translation of isiNdebele paragraph follows.)

[We know very well that according to our culture it is not easy to take
your grandmother and place her in an old age home. Such actions are not
acceptable to our people. Therefore, we need to ensure as the present
government that we do something about this situation ― about these people
wherever they are, especially those who are in homes that are engulfed by
poverty.]

The other thing is the increasing demand for health care.

Into enye engizayitjho namhlanje, Ngqongqotjhe, kukobana kwezamaPhilo senza
koke okusemandleni ethu. [Again, what I would like to mention today,
Minister, is that when it comes to health care we are doing all we can.]

We are doing all we can.

Kodwana akhe ukhambe uye emrholweni lapho abogogo barholela khona,
uzakuthola abogogo bahlezi elangeni batjhiswa lilanga banganazo neentulo
kungekho neentende. Ngibawa bona umNyango wethu lo ungenelele ukusiza
abantu abadala ukuze isimo sabo sepilo sikghone ukuba ncono. Sizokuba ncono
nangabe bayatlhogomeleka. Kutjho bona kufanele kube nokusebenzisana
phakathi kwemiNyango yezokuThuthukiswa komPhakathi nowezamaPhilo.
Sitlhogomele abogogo bethu bona basiphilele, basifundise siye phambili.
(Translation of isiNdebele paragraph follows.)

[But go to pension paypoints where grandmothers get their pensions, and you
will find them sitting under the burning sun without chairs and tents. I
would like this department to intervene in order to assist these older
persons so as to make their living conditions better. Their living
conditions will be better if they are well taken care of. This means that
there must be a good working relationship between the Department of Social
Development and the Department of Health. We should take good care of our
grandmothers so that they live longer and teach us going forward.]

The ANC, at its 50th national conference in Mafikeng, directed that
redressing poverty and inequalities had to be its central focus so as to
ensure that government and other sectors of society met the basic needs of
the underprivileged, especially the aged of our country. The conference
supported the development of a comprehensive social security system
including contributory and noncontributory social security measures.

In pursuance of that resolution, the ANC-led government appointed the
Taylor commission to investigate the development of a comprehensive social
security policy and to propose ways in which all existing means to provide
a social wage are strengthened. The Taylor report provided the basis for
the development of such a social security policy and affirmed the need to
strengthen the implementation to expand the reach of existing policies,
while finding new ways to close existing gaps which still leave certain
people vulnerable.
A worrying problem that I must again talk about, as far as caring for older
persons is concerned, is abuse, which comes in many different forms. When
elder abuse is mentioned, the first thought is often of a person showing
signs of physical abuse. However, far more difficult to see are the scars
of psychological and emotional abuse, as the symptoms are more subtle.

Financial abuse manifests itself in a number of ways, the most obvious
being a shortage of money, food or basic necessities. Some elderly persons
are even denied care, and sometimes find themselves homeless.

The other problem that we must look at today is that we have our girls
leaving their children with their mothers. Something must be done about
that. Steps must be taken to ensure that our young people do not abuse the
elderly by always leaving their children with them, going everywhere and
not even caring about what is happening at home.

Iyababulala abogogo bethu, begodu ugogo njengoba umazi angekhe alale
umntwana angakadli uzokuqinisekisa bona umntwana ulala adlile. Lokho
kutjengisa bonyana sibone bona abogogo bahlukunyezwa babantu abatjha

[These things are killing our grandmothers, as you know that a grandmother
will never go to bed without ensuring that the child has eaten. She will
make sure that the child eats food before going to bed. That indicates to
us that there are a number of girls today who abuse their grandmothers by
leaving them with their children. Maybe these young people who are now
working and leave their children to be taken care of by the grandmothers
should somehow pay money to these grandmothers who are left with their
children, so that these grandmothers get the money for taking care of these
children.]

Elder abuse respects ... [Laughter.] Oh, my time is up. Let me just pause
and say that systematic abuse is when an older person’s rights are violated
by any action or lack of appropriate action by the state or any other
statutory body or organisation, like grants being stopped without any
warning, essential medication not being available at state clinics and
hospitals or medical aids discarding older members. We cannot tolerate
that.

In conclusion, Chairperson, older persons are assets of a society and can
contribute significantly to the development process of our nation. [Time
expired.]

Ngitjhilo ekuthomeni ukuthi babotitjhere abangakafundi. [I mentioned
earlier that they are teachers who did not go to school.]

As such, they need to be empowered and their participation ensured. They,
who are the custodians of our history and cultural, moral and social
values, are now normally confined to old age homes, and are no longer
accessible to children and youth who should be learning from them. In
African communities, we say that it takes a village to raise a child.

Ngifuna ukucedelela ngokutjho amagama akhulunywa nguMongameli wethu
nakakhuluma kuSamithi yeZekolo ebe ibanjelwe nge-Johannesburg nakathi:

    The principal educators in our communities are older persons. They
    educate both the parents and their offspring. Help us reinculcate these
    values of honouring our elders.


Ngithokoze, Sihlalo. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiNdebele paragraphs
follows.)

[I would like to conclude by quoting the words that were spoken by our
President when he addressed the religious summit which was held in
Johannesburg. He said:

    The principal educators in our communities are older persons. They
    educate both the parents and their offspring. Help us reinculcate these
    values of honouring our elders.


Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mnr O DE BEER: Voorsitter, die hoop en drome van die armes vir ’n beter
lewe het in ’n groot nagmerrie verander. Na 16 jaar van demokrasie is daar
ontnugtering. Dag na dag word die swaarkry net meer. Die werkloses staan in
al hoe langer toue op soek na werk.

Mense het nie die nodige vaardighede nie. Alhoewel ons in die informasie-
era leef, is miljoene mense nie rekenaargeletterd nie. Die regering bied
geen oplossing vir hierdie mense aan nie. Elke jaar word die uitwissing van
armoede beloof, maar jaar na jaar eindig hierdie belofte met geen
oplossings.

Elke jaar word tydlyne gestel vir dieselfde beloftes. Hierdie jaar het die
Ministers ondernemings geteken met die President. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr O DE BEER: Chairperson, the hopes and dreams of the poor for a better
life have turned into a terrible nightmare. After 16 years of democracy
there is disillusionment. The hardship is increasing day after day. The
unemployed find themselves looking for work in queues that continue to get
longer.

People do not have the necessary skills. Even though we are living in the
information age, millions of people are not computer literate. The
government does not offer a solution for these people. Every year a promise
is made that poverty will be eradicated, but every year this promise ends
without it being resolved.

Every year time frames are set for the same promises. This year the
Ministers have signed agreements with the President.]

Which promise will government honour this year? Which communities is
government going to uplift? Vast amounts of money are being squandered.
Expenditure that is wasteful, fruitless, unauthorised and irregular
continues to take place.

Prof Haroon Bhorat asserts that we are now the most unequal society in the
world. We recently overtook Brazil in this regard. This is bad for growth.
It is a ticking time bomb. Our society is going to be torn apart.

Die regering se belangrikste prioriteit is om armoede te verminder. Op 28
Julie 2008 het voormalige President Mbeki ’n landswye veldtog gestig om
armoede onder die land se armste burgers te verminder. Die veldtog was
gemik op die armste wyke en swakste huishoudings in the land. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The government’s main priority is to reduce poverty. On 28 July 2008,
former President Mbeki launched a countrywide campaign to reduce poverty
amongst the country’s poorest citizens. The campaign was aimed at the
poorest wards and the most impoverished households in the country.]

The long-term goal was for South Africa’s poorest households to receive
assistance and support in a co-ordinated and sustainable way, with a
national war room on poverty leading the campaign from the office of the
Deputy President.

Chair, as we as a nation spend this time debating measures to fight poverty
under the theme “Working together to intensify the war on poverty, hunger
and socioeconomic marginalisation”, there are people out there saying:
“Where did these words come from?”

’n Mens sou gedink het dat alle Suid Afrikaners teen hierdie tyd al water
in hul huise sou hê. Dit het nie gebeur nie. Baie van die mense het nie
eens ’n basiese toilet nie. Informele wonings, die gevaar van huise wat
afbrand en basiese gesondheidsgevare is enorm. “Shack farming” is aan die
orde van die dag.

Hierdie gebrek aan sanitasie het klaar ’n reuse uitwerking op die beswaarde
openbare gesondheidstelsel. Dit veroorsaak ook omgewings-, maatskaplike,
ekonomiese en sielkundige probleme. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[One would have thought that all South Africans would have had running
water in their homes by now. This has not happened. Many people do not even
have a basic toilet. Informal houses, the danger of houses being destroyed
by fires, and basic health risks are enormous. Shack farming is the order
of the day.

This lack of sanitation already has a big impact on the overburdened public
health system. It is also causing environmental, social, economic and
psychological problems.]

Recycling strategies will not make poverty go away. Playing with terms such
as “mandates” and “Polokwane resolution” is going to fool no one. South
Africa is going nowhere very slowly. We are not using our resources to
eradicate poverty. [Interjections.]

Voorsitter, Suid-Afrika het ’n baie hoë koers van werkloosheid, en die
inskrywings vir maatskaplike toelaes styg dramaties. As Cope glo ons dat
maatskaplike bystand nie in fiskale terme volhoubaar is nie, want dit het
geen einde nie.

As ’n land is ons grootste uitdaging om onderwys op te hef. Wêreldwyd is
ons een van die 14 lande uit 139 lande wat reg onder aan die lys is ten
opsigte van primêre onderwys. Die kwaliteit van die voorsiende programme
wat mik op die vroeë kinderontwikkelingsfase tussen nul en nege jaar is
baie swak. Die kwalifikasies vir en opleiding van onderwysers in “early
childhood development” bestaan nie.

Ons voorstel, as Cope, aan die regering, veral aan die Ministers van
onderwys, is om onderrig as ’n nasionale diens ... [Tyd verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, South Africa has a very high unemployment rate, and the
number of applications for social grants is increasing dramatically. As
Cope we believe that social support is not sustainable in fiscal terms
because there is no end to it.

As a country one of our greatest challenges is to raise the level of
education. Regarding primary education, we are one of 14 countries at the
bottom of a list of 139 worldwide. The quality of existing programmes aimed
at the early childhood development phase between zero and nine years of age
is very poor. There are no qualifications or training for teachers with
regard to early childhood development.

We as Cope want to recommend to the government, especially to the Ministers
of education, to regard education as a national service ... [Time
expired.]]

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Members of Parliament,
it is unfortunate that the hon De Beer is really uninformed. He has made
very serious accusations. He has just suggested to the House that
government is wasteful, misusing or abusing a lot of money.

Now, let us quickly try to put the hon De Beer back on track. Let us not
forget that the government task team was actually established on 27 October
2009. It was even much earlier because this is one of the reports that came
from the task team. The task team comprises the Minister of Finance, the
Minister in the Presidency responsible for Performance Monitoring and
Evaluation as well as Administration in the Presidency, and the Minister
for the Public Service and Administration.

Now, the responsibilities of this particular task team are, firstly, to
reduce wastage, inefficiency and fraud within government departments;
secondly, to identify and eliminate corrupt practices within the
departments; thirdly, to review the ministerial handbook ― we know the
ministerial handbook; fourthly, to achieve value for the money that the
government allocates to departments; fifthly, to eliminate leakage and
irregularities in the procurement system, wherever procurement takes place;
and lastly, it is supposed to support the government key priorities. These
are measures which have been put in place to ensure that none of the things
that hon De Beer is talking about are actually taking place within the
departments.

The ANC regards the question of rural women and food security as one of the
key priorities to be addressed so as to ensure that we are able to develop
the rural economy. The Freedom Charter states, in part, that rent and
prices shall be lowered, food plentiful and no one shall go hungry.

In the same vein, the ANC is committed to the principle of equal
opportunity for rural women just like their male counterparts, irrespective
of their geographical locations.

We chose the theme “Working together to intensify the war on poverty,
hunger and socioeconomic marginalisation” because it was an issue around
which we wanted to mobilise and educate people, particularly the poor in
our communities. This theme spans land and agrarian transformation and
social transformation and it specifically falls within the Department of
Social Development.

We celebrate the International Day of Rural Women and World Food Day to
remind all of us that we are living in a world that is characterised by
hunger, poverty, deprivation, crime and corruption.

It is an important month in the Department of Social Development’s
calendar. The Select Committee on Economic Development marks this month in
order to highlight the services that the department offers, and the extent
to which access to these services can be strengthened through our oversight
role, amongst others, in order to push back the frontiers of
underdevelopment and hunger.

In his opening address to the 2010 national general council of the ANC,
President Jacob Zuma called on government to pursue rural development as
the major component of poverty eradication and women’s empowerment.

Regarding international rural women, the ANC considers rural development a
central pillar in our struggle against unemployment, poverty and
inequality. Women living in rural areas face the harshest conditions of
poverty, food insecurity and a lack of access to services on a daily basis.
This is a worldwide phenomenon. There are gender inequalities in many parts
of the world, but the subordinate position of women tends to differ.

Women living in rural areas face the brunt of poverty. Many of them work
long hours for poverty wages or do not work at all. Women form the majority
of residents in rural areas and face the burden of poverty, hunger and
degradation.

This underlines the necessity of effective rural development programmes
that can ensure that investment in infrastructure, services and training
reaches those areas of the country that are adversely affected. The ANC is
committed to a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to agrarian
reform, which builds the potential for rural sustainable livelihoods,
particularly for African women.

Economic development in the rural areas needs to go beyond land and
agrarian reform. It must include affordable financing to promote economic
development; support programmes and training in assisting co-operatives and
small enterprises; public sector ventures; and strategies to develop
appropriate industries including light manufacturing, handicrafts,
services, tourism, etc. This also requires the creation of the necessary
economic infrastructure, including IT services, roads and rail.

Part of our government’s measures to support rural development includes
infrastructure development to produce thriving rural economies and ensure
sustainable development. The expansion of basic infrastructure – which
includes roads, electricity, water connections and public toilet systems in
rural areas – becomes a central priority for the current period.

Linked to food security is the land and agrarian reform programme. The
Freedom Charter states that:

    Restrictions of land ownership on a racial basis shall be ended, and all
    the land redivided amongst those who work it to banish famine and land
    hunger.

The state shall help to assist the process.

The whole of South Africa is watching the court case between the 96-year-
old Mrs Sanna Mahlangu, and Lanseria Commercial Crossing with keen
interest. Mrs Sanna Mahlangu has been staying on a piece of land in
Lanseria, Johannesburg since the 1920s. The so-called owner of the land,
who is white, has evicted all her family members and destroyed their
houses. The owner insists that the land belongs to him and that only Mrs
Sanna Mahlangu may stay on the land.

This takes us back to the dismal failure of the policy of willing-buyer,
willing-seller, which needs to be reviewed. We must work to intensify the
land reform programme so as to ensure that more land is in the hands of the
rural poor women. We must provide the rural poor with technical skills and
financial resources to use the land productively and to create sustainable
livelihoods.

Part of the key task is to ensure that the land reform programme is
integrated at national, provincial and local government levels. What we are
calling for is an integrated approach to development. The Department of
Social Development is keen to maintain this strategic task because it is at
the centre of the socioeconomic needs of rural women.

Linked to the land reform programme should be an expanded agrarian reform
programme for rural women. This programme should focus on the systematic
promotion of agricultural co-operatives throughout the production cycle,
with specific attention given to women. It should also involve active
promotion of agro-processing in the agricultural sector.

In this regard, government must develop support measures to ensure more
access to markets and finance for small women farmers. Indeed, we must
ensure a much stronger link between land and agrarian reform programmes and
water resource allocation, so as to ensure that water resources of best
quality reach all our people, especially the poor. Access to clean water
and electricity by rural women is key to the development of economic
activity and the enhancement of quality of life.

I want to repeat what the Freedom Charter states, namely that:

    Rent and prices shall be lowered, food plentiful and no one shall go
    hungry.

This is augmented by our own Constitution.

In conclusion, we support the programme from the Ministry of Social
Development and we also support some of the programmes which have been
undertaken to ensure that women in the rural areas are able to benefit and
develop their own economic activity. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Hon House Chair, let me start by
expressing appreciation for all the comments made by colleagues in this
very important debate.

What I hear is that there is no disagreement that poverty is indeed a
challenge in South Africa. Unemployment and underdevelopment are similarly
a challenge in South Africa, and we need to deal with those issues.

What I don’t hear us having a common approach on, though, is the “how” part
of it. How to deal with that? I did say earlier in my speech that there is
no one-way approach to this. To those of us who are ideologically inclined
to say that we must just look at the markets – like the hon members from
the DA who are saying we must ensure that we work on equal opportunities
for all – let me say, yes, we are saying equal opportunities for all in the
ruling party and in government.

What we don’t agree with is that we must just say equal opportunities for
all, and that is the end of it. There are people who will need to be
uplifted. Those were colleagues who stood here and who understand where the
ANC comes from, and where we are going. Naturally, and unsurprisingly, they
are from the ANC.

We spoke about a need for us to do something to uplift the rural women, as
hon Montsitsi has just said. Hon Boroto has just demonstrated how important
it is to take care of the elderly, but also to take care of the women in
those rural areas.

So, the sooner we get out of this mode of debating whether equal
opportunities for all as an exclusive policy, is right, and therefore all
others are wrong, the better for us as a nation.

We are definitely out there to root out poverty. We are saying that we have
seen in this country of ours, South Africa, what those who followed the
markets only, and ignored the entire 65% of the population in the rural
areas and never even thought of providing facilities for them, actually led
this country to. We have seen it happening: education denied,
infrastructure denied, everything denied, and then people – especially the
haves – were focusing on the markets. They think that if one focuses on
commercial operations, everything else will fall into place.

No, we don’t agree. Let us really refocus our energies. We will certainly
address all the issues that encompass people in rural areas.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, on a point of order: I did not use the
phrase “equal opportunities”; I used the phrase “open opportunities”.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, I don’t know what the
point of order is. I won’t withdraw my statement. To me it is English, and
it means the same thing. Open opportunities or equal opportunities – that
is what we hear every day as an ideological policy. That is what we say we
are not agreeing with. Whether there is going to be another word next week
that replaces “open” with “equal”, or anything, we are not for that.

Those of us who have not read the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, must
please go and read the document. That revealing document says to all South
Africans that, in this country, South Africa, poverty has been drastically
reduced. What has grown in this country is inequality.

It is for that reason that we say we must deal with these inequalities so
that it is not only the haves who just continue to benefit, but also the
have-nots. This rural development programme of ours is intended to do
exactly that, leaving no stone unturned, focusing on the most vulnerable in
our society, because those are the people that we’ve got to lift up, while
continuing to support those who are in business and who must create jobs.
We are saying that we have a dual focus. It must work. It has already
worked.

The people who have been affected mainly, again in terms of the MDG report
that we have recently tabled at the United Nations council ― proudly tabled
as a South African report; this time no shadow reports from the DA or
whoever ― unanimously agree and say that of the eight MDGs, six of the
goals are about women. If we make an impact on women’s development and
empowerment ― women who happen, by the way, to be in rural areas ― we will
actually achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

Concerning those Millennium Development Goals, the report says that, in so
far as equality in South Africa is concerned, we have actually reached and
surpassed the target, even on education provision. What is lacking is in
the area of quality of education.

Hon Boroto raised an issue about the need for us to do something really
drastic for older persons, in relation to health services in the rural
areas in particular, as well as services at the pay points.

I want to assure this august House that, regarding issues pertaining to
paypoint matters, we are currently dealing with them. We will definitely
come back to the portfolio committee and to this august House about how we
are moving. Already, some steps have been taken towards computerising the
payment system. We live with other people who do not actually want us to
move in that direction. But we are more determined than ever to ensure that
even the black community in South Africa also earn in a dignified manner,
like their white counterparts in this country.

Therefore, regarding the paypoint system, in a few years’ time, these
problems that we see now will be a thing of the past. We will do our best
in that regard.

The abuse of older persons is a problem. We want to appeal to everyone to
join hands and to work together, so that we ensure that we really implement
the law to the fullest, because those abusers are within our communities.

I think, as members of this Council, we must also continue to motivate
other people out there to ensure that they become part and parcel of
ensuring that older persons are not abused. In a short space of time from
now, we will be launching, again rolling out, the charter of values on
older persons. This is one instrument which is going to guide us as to what
to do and what can be done for older persons in the future.

We also want to indicate that we are really attending to issues of fraud.
Hon De Villiers, sometimes I don’t know where you get your information. I
really do not know where the hon member gets his information. Somebody
stood here to define poverty. In South Africa there is no unified and
agreed-upon definition of poverty, yet. We will get there, and yet we
define it.

Brazil has overtaken us, we are aware, and that is why we cite Brazil as
the example that we should follow in order to attack this poverty even in
those areas. Programmes that we have to implement are, for example, Zero
Hunger in communities. If we introduce, or at the time when we introduce
Zero Hunger-for-all in communities, we will all realise how inclusive this
programme is, because it includes the development of entrepreneurs. It is a
lesson that we draw from Brazil. There are many lesson that we can draw,
including that of ensuring that we educate our children, hon De Villiers.

It is not that we are copying everything. We have recorded our own
successes in the field of early childhood development. The ECD deals with
the ages zero to four years, and that is the age that Social Development
deals with. We have made enormous impacts. Children who have not been in
those foundation classes are now enrolled. We want to increase those
numbers. We have a backlog of about just fewer than three million of those
children, and we are definitely going to eradicate that backlog.

If we think that this government is just sitting back and not doing
anything about corruption – by the way, we know that there is always a
corruptor and a corruptee; we deal with both – you should know that, as I
speak, there are people who are being tried in courts. We know that very
well. As government we are not going to shy away from dealing with
corruption. We have not created corruption; we found it there. We are
dealing with it and not suppressing it. We don’t even keep quiet about any
form of corruption.

We are not shouting slogans only. The results are very clear. They are
contained in world reports. There is no sloganeering or anything like that.
We want to communicate with our own people, and as we do that we want them
to hear and to remember the messages. What is important is the output and
the product, and the output is okay. We believe that this is the route to
go. Indeed, with self-help programmes, with all those projects in
communities, with sustainable livelihoods and with the growth of the
economy, we are moving rural development. We will get there.

Five years down the line when we again ascend the podium of the world we
shall be reporting results that are saying, yes, we have made it. We are
very optimistic and confident that we will make it. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr C J DE BEER: Hon Chairperson, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, Bill 28
of 2010, is a money Bill according to section 77 of the Constitution and
contains changes to total tax liabilities as a result of changes to the tax
rates and/or tax bases.

Taxation in the South African economy is crucial to our fiscal sovereignty,
and our ability to fund government through tax revenue. The Bill gives
effect to the tax proposals announced in February 2010 by the hon Minister
of Finance when the Budget was tabled.
Hon De Beer, I want to refer you to the Budget Speech of the Minister as
well as to the review of last year’s Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,
MTBPS. Go and read it, and there you’ll find the answer to the problem that
you addressed this afternoon.

Among the aspects that the Bill addresses are those that contribute to the
economic growth value chain, such as individual and business taxpayers’
saving mechanisms and employment. These will have to be welcomed and
recommended as they will both directly and indirectly contribute to the
achievement of government’s priority goals, in particular the creation of
decent work and sustainable livelihoods.

Tax evasion and avoidance is not only a crime but also a basis for building
a culture of corruption in our society, which we must counteract. It is
also to the credit of our democratic parliamentary processes that a number
of changes have been made to some of these original proposals as a result
of comments and inputs that were received.

The proposed Bill provides for personal income tax relief and closes
various tax loopholes to ensure an equitable tax system. In the main, the
Bill’s proposals seek to do the following: to tighten the rules relating to
employer-provided motor vehicles with the aim of preventing arbitrage; to
promote uniformity and avoid duplication in the implementation of the
retirement and preretirement withdrawal benefits by making the employer-
provided lump sum termination payout part of the tax-preferred calculation;
to narrow the permissible instruments in the implementation of the interest
exemption threshold and review its effectiveness as an incentive intended
to promote savings by middle- and lower-income households; to place certain
Sharice-compliant products on an equal tax footing with conventional
finance products; and to close loopholes relating to financial institutions
that deduct beyond what should be equitably allowed for by the basic tax
principles when implementing laws dealing with interest expense
allocations.

Amendments are also proposed in the Bill with regard to refinements to the
mineral royalty legislation. The South African mineral and petroleum
royalty system imposes an increasing or decreasing rate, depending on the
company’s profitability. This varying rate allows for South Africa, as a
whole, to enjoy relatively higher yields during boom years while providing
partial relief during lean years.

These changes will also help in establishing co-ordination between the
implementation of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act and other
taxation laws. This taxation is important for increasing our tax base.
That’s very important.
Changes that are being introduced will assist in the promotion of
beneficiation and thereby propel us to greater heights in terms of
industrialisation, economic growth and employment creation.

South Africa’s tax treaty network makes South Africa an ideal location for
foreign investors to base the management of their regional operations. The
proposed amendments eliminate tax hurdles so that foreign investors can
utilise South Africa as a launching point and for various regional equity
fund investments.

The Bill gives effect to the tax proposals announced in February 2010 when
the 2010-11 Budget was tabled.

The Select Committee on Finance supports the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill,
Bill 28 of 2010, and calls on the House to support the Bill. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

   VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE PROGRAMME AND TAXATION LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T E CHAANE: Hon Chairperson, hon members, the statement on the Voluntary
Disclosure Programme and Taxation Laws Second Amendment Bill, Bill 29 of
2010, introduces a voluntary disclosure programme and amends administrative
provisions of the Transfer Duty Act, Act 40 of 1949; the Income Tax Act,
Act 58 of 1962; the Customs and Excise Act, Act 91 of 1964; the Value-Added
Tax Act, Act 89 of 1991; the Unemployment Insurance Contributions Act, Act
4 of 2002; and of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty
(Administration) Act, Act 29 of 2008.

The objects of the Bill are to introduce a voluntary disclosure programme;
to amend the Transfer Duty Act; to amend the Income Tax Act of 1962 so as
to amend certain provisions; to amend the Unemployment Insurance Fund
Contribution Act so as to effect a technical correction; to amend the
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act so as to amend certain
provisions; as well as to provide for matters connected therewith.

In considering the Bill, the committee ensured that the Bill proposed
strikes a balance between the interests of the fiscus, ensures a good
system of taxation and takes into consideration the current economic
challenges such as inequality and unemployment. It will also encourage
compliance and, at the same time, broaden the revenue base in the long
term.

Having considered the presentation on the Voluntary Disclosure Programme
and Taxation Laws Second Amendment Bill by the National Treasury and the SA
Revenue Service, the Select Committee on Finance recommends that the NCOP
adopts the Bill without amendment. Chair, I so move.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                     SOUTH AFRICAN POSTBANK LIMITED BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms M P THEMBA: Hon House Chair, hon members, hon guests, comrades and
friends, the Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises welcomed the
introduction of the South African Postbank Limited Bill, Bill 14B of 2009.
The committee gives support to the spirit and intention of what it seeks to
achieve in the realisation of a better life for all South Africans,
especially in the rural areas.

The process of addressing the challenge of the unbanked low-income groups
and people living in the rural areas without access to financial services
started with the adoption of the White Paper on Postal Policy in 1998. The
policy spelt out the need for state intervention and the form in which this
intervention would happen. It identified the Postbank as the most
appropriate financial institution, best placed to cater for the needs of
rural and poor communities in relation to their banking and financial
services.

This Bill seeks to provide for the incorporation of the Postbank division
of the South African Post Office and its transfer to the Postbank company.
It also seeks to deal with matters of governance and functioning of the
Postbank company and with all consequential arrangements that go with this.

As a consequence of socioeconomic inequalities, uneven development between
the rural and urban areas and high levels of poverty, millions of people
are unbanked and therefore have no access to saving, deposit and credit
facilities. According to the National Treasury, only 59% of the country’s
adult population had a basic bank account as of December 2009.

It was envisaged, at that time, that the establishment of a developmental
role for the Postbank would require it to be restructured into a fully
fledged savings bank and that the process should be phased in over a period
of five to seven years.

Currently, the Postbank has been operating as a division of the Post
Office, providing very limited financial services. The Bill takes the
implementation of the government policy further by restructuring the
Postbank and establishing it as the fully fledged Postbank Limited company.
The corporatised entity will assume the current business of the Postbank
division of the South African Post Office, which is deposit taking, money
transfer, and third-party payment.

In conclusion, the select committee has acknowledged and accepted that the
Bill has gone through all the required parliamentary processes, including
public hearings, before it was passed by the National Assembly. We, as the
Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises, have subjected the Bill
to scrutiny. In our deliberations we have taken into account the specific
conditions pertaining to the provinces and their views. The conditions are
that the majority of our population ― who are poor, have low incomes and
are unbanked ― reside mainly in the rural areas. Following these
deliberations, the committee accepted the Bill without any further
amendments for submission to this House. I therefore put the Bill before
the House for adoption. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
