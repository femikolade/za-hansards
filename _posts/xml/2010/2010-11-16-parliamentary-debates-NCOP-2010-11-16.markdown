                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr T B BEYLEVELDT: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -

     1) notes—


           a) that during the opening speeches, frequent references were
              made to the struggle and the Constitution;


           b) that from what we heard during public hearings, requirements
              and functions that are set out in the Constitution regarding
              service delivery are not being met and that is a sign of a
              failing state;


           c) that we hear and read that mayors and councillors are not
              interested in speaking or acting on behalf of communities;

           d) that the time has come that Ministers take their
              responsibilities seriously in terms of section 139 of the
              Constitution to intervene and get rid of dysfunctional mayors
              and councillors as well as numerous incompetent officials;

     2) believes it is unacceptable that councils receive adverse or
        disclaimer audit reports and still try to convince the electorate
        that they act in the best interests of the people; and

     3) recognises the fact that if they cannot manage their financial
        responsibilities, they cannot expect government’s support for
        better service delivery.

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:
   That the Council notes that —


     1) the success and wisdom of the agreement between the DA and the ID
        has been proven beyond any doubt by the results of the by-election
        in Botrivier on Wednesday last week;


     2) this by-election in ward 7 of the Theewaterskloof Local
        Municipality was brought about by the resignation of the sitting ID
        councillor, James Pheiffer, in protest against the joining of his
        former party with the DA;

     3) the so-called protester, having being lured by the ANC to stand in
        his own ward as an ANC candidate, failed miserably by attracting
        only 677 votes against the 1 015 votes of the DA candidate, Pearl
        Stanfliet; and


     4) the victory does not only prove the growing force of the DA-ID
        alliance, but highlights the ANC’s unfaltering obsession with race
        through the importation of Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson and the
        Northern Cape Premier, Hazel Jenkins, to promote the ANC in the
        community.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I’m sorry that I am speaking with my back
towards you. I give notice that I shall move at the next sitting of the
Council:

   That the Council –


       1) debates the failure of government to address the housing needs of
          over 2 million families as estimated by the department, more
          particularly government’s unwillingness ...


[Interjections.]


The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms T C Memela): Chairperson, on a point
of order: The hon member cannot speak with his back towards you. Can he
move to the back?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Let us not criticise the member. He did
apologise to the Chair. But let us try to get another microphone. Mr
Sinclair, is there any microphone that works closer to you there? Oh, there
is a roving microphone. You can start from the beginning.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I’m sorry that I am speaking with my back
towards you. I give notice that I shall move at the next sitting of the
Council:


   That the Council -


    1) debates the failure of government to address the housing needs of
       over 2 million families as estimated by the department, more
       particularly government’s unwillingness to cut loose tenderpreneurs
       such as Wiseman Mpisane and Mike Mokoena;
    2) further debates the shocking lack of transparency and accountability
       in commissioning housing projects, with the result that the poor and
       the marginalised people of our country are given shoddy structures
       unfit for human habitation, which have to be taken down and rebuilt;
       and


    3) recognises the importance of government focusing on the real and
       urgent needs of the people rather than the greed of its friends in
       high places.

Mr G G MOKGORO: Chairperson, on a point of order: This is with regard to
the new name we hear now today, that the motion is read on behalf of the
“real” Cope. I would like to know, Chair, whether you are aware of such a
party?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr A J NYAMBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


   That the Council –


      1) notes that Kaizer Chiefs, “abafana bokuthula noxolo” ...


[Interjections.]
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chair, on a point of order: We are still busy
with notices of motion. Just hold on, hon Nyambi.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Just listen very carefully. I said:
Does any member wish to give notice of a motion? We are dealing with
notices of motion and not motions without notice. Are we clear? Hon
Windvoël?

Mr V V WINDVOËL (Mpumalanga): Chair, I will wait my turn for motions
without notice. We were just misled by the other member who escaped the
notice of the Chair and also moved a motion without notice. Thank you.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the
next sitting of the Council:

   That the Council -


     1) notes that the water treatment plant in Harrismith is already about
        50 years old and there is the danger of not being adequate for the
        supply of services to the community;


     2) further notes that it is of huge concern that although an
        environmental impact assessment, a feasibility study and a cost
        analysis to upgrade the plant to by R80 million had been done, the
        national Department of Water and Environmental Affairs did not
        responded so far;

     3) has believes that it is a shame and a disgrace in the eyes of the
        community of this area and district to have such service delivery
        from the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs; and

     4) calls on the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs to respond
        to the application given to her department very soon with a
        suitable and satisfactory answer on how she will address this
        problem.

I thank you.

Mr M SKWATSHA (Western Cape): Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move
at the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council –


     1) notes with utter dismay and profound sadness the brutal slaying of
        a British tourist, Ms Anni Dewani, after she and her husband, Mr
        Shrien Dewani, were hijacked in Gugulethu in Cape Town on Sunday
        night, 14 November;


     2) further notes that the young couple, who got married about two
        weeks ago, arrived in Cape Town on Friday for their honeymoon;

     3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
        this inhuman and heartless incident by merciless and selfish
        criminals who have no regard for human life; and

     4) calls on all those who might have any information that will bring
        the perpetrators of this brutal crime to face the full might of the
        law to contact the police.

Mnr W F FABER: Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting van die Raad sal ek
voorstel:

   Dat die Raad ―

   (1)      kennis neem dat ―

        (a)      ’n lid van die gemeenskap in die publieke verhoor in die
              Charles Mopeli Stadium die gehoor meegedeel het dat die
              burgemeester van die munisipaliteit werkers ontslaan het en
              nie aanstel indien hulle nie ’n ANC-lidmaatskap kaart besit
              nie;

        (b)      die DA sulke politiese afpersery, intimidasie en
              viktimisering in die sterkste moontlike wyse afkeur en
              betreur; en

           c) die DA ’n beroep doen op die Minister vir Samewerkende
              Regering en Tradisionele Sake en die Minister van Arbeid om
              die aangeleentheid deeglik te ondersoek.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr W F FABER: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the Council I shall
move:

    That the Council —

    (1)     notes that —

         (a)     a member of the community informed the audience during the
               public hearing at the Charles Mopeli Stadium that the mayor
               dismissed municipality workers or does not appoint them if
               they are not in possession of an ANC membership card;

         (b)     the DA condemns and deplores such political blackmail,
               intimidation and victimisation in the strongest possible
               terms; and

         (c)     the DA calls on the  Minister for Co-operative Governance
               and Traditional Affairs and the Minister of Labour to
               thoroughly investigate the matter.]

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council notes that –

     1) the Phuthaditjhaba, Qwaqwa area has the highest unemployment rate
        in the Free State province;

     2) the DA calls on the provincial government and private enterprises to
        create an enabling environment for business and industry in the
        Qwaqwa area to ensure more jobs and employment;

     3) the DA and the DA youth policies should be followed to create an
        open-opportunity society for all the people; and

     4) job seekers and the youth must be subsidised by means of work
        vouchers to encourage business and industry to employ more people,
        especially the youth, whilst they learn a trade.

Mrs E C VAN LINGEN: I give notice that I shall move at the next sitting of
the Council:


   That the Council ―


        1) notes —
           a) that illegal gold refining activities at G-Hostel in
              Matjhabeng municipality have resumed two days after a
              successful SAPS raid;


           b) that large amounts of refining equipment and 1 400 kg of gold
              were confiscated two weeks ago;


           c) that these illegal refining activities are part of a process,
              starting with the zama-zamas in the old mines; and


           d) that gold is finally sold by syndicates avoiding normal legal
              trading processes to the value of at least R10 billion per
              annum;


        2) requests ―


        (a)      that the municipality, which is the owner of G-Hostel,
              should take responsibility for the illegal operations and
              assist the SAPS in its operations;


           b) that the mining houses and their security companies honestly
              and actively assist the SAPS in their effort to clampdown on
              these illegal activities in the mines and above ground; and


     3) congratulates Major-General Lerato Molale on the successes of the
        SAPS operations at G-Hostel and encourages him to root out the
        syndicates at the top of the illegal mining and money-making
        processes in the gold industry.

Thank you.

Mr O DE BEER: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting of the
House I shall move:


   That the Council ―


        1) debates ―


          a) the necessity for national Police Commissioner Bheki Cele to
             transfer four senior commissioners from the Free State to
             Limpopo due to allegations of poor performance and inability
             to fight crime;


          b) the advisability of transferring them, and, by that token,
             merely shifting chairs on the deck of the Titanic;

          c) the failure of the officers from Limpopo’s Vhembe District and
             Capricorn District to turn things around and thereby improve
             policing in the Free State; and

     2) notes that Cope proposes comprehensive and meaningful action by
        government that will lead to real and visible policing in the Free
        State.

     LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR ANC IN BY-ELECTIONS HELD ON 10 NOVEMBER 2010

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr V V WINDVOËL (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―


   (1)      notes that —


        (a) the ANC won 10 out of 11 by-elections, which were held on
            Wednesday, 10 November 2010, throughout the country;


        (b) in terms of Fifa standards, the score is 10-1 against all the
            other parties put together; and


        (c) it is put on record that three wards in Mpumalanga were not
            contested, including by the party of the hon Watson of the DA;


   (2)      further notes that the by-election results are a clear
        indication of the trust that the people of South Africa still have
        in the ANC and their belief that only the ANC is able to address the
        legacy of the long years of apartheid’s separate development and the
        challenges that they are facing; and

   (3)      takes this opportunity to congratulate the elected councillors
        and calls on them to work tirelessly to advance the needs of their
        constituencies.

Shapa ANC, shapa! [Beat them, ANC, beat them!]

I so move.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion?
In light of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion
without notice will now become a notice of motion.

         CONGRATULATIONS TO KAIZER CHIEFS ON VICTORY IN SOWETO DERBY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A J NYAMBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

   (1)      notes that Kaizer Chiefs, abafana bok’thula noxolo [love and
        peace], gave  Orlando Pirates an embarrassing whipping of 3-1 in
        one of the most anticipated games in South Africa, the Soweto
        derby, which was played at the FNB Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg,
        and peacefully attended by 74 000;

   (2)      further notes that the revenge would never have tasted sweeter
        than it did for Kaizer Chiefs when they crushed regional rivals
        Orlando Pirates, avenging their 2-1 aggregate defeat in the two-leg
        MTN 8 semifinal in August; and

   (3)      takes this opportunity to congratulate abafana bok’uthula noxolo
        [love and peace] for their display of carpet football and their
        win.

I so move.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: May I remind you that the maximum time for a
motion is one and a half minutes and some of you speak for a long time. Is
there any objection to the motion? In light of the objection, the motion
may not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become a
notice of motion.

         CALL FOR CLAMPDOWN ON ILLEGAL SHEBEENS AFTER TEENAGER DIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs M C DIKGALE: Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council ―


     1) notes that a 16-year-old boy was arrested yesterday afternoon for
        stabbing another teenager of the same age to death in a shebeen in
        Siluma View, Katlehong, in the Gauteng province;


     2) further notes that although the boys were clearly underage and not
        allowed to procure liquor in any liquor outlet, they were drinking
        at the shebeen and then had an argument before the teenager was
        killed; and


     3) takes this opportunity to convey its profound condolences to the
        family of the deceased and calls on metro police and the South
        African Police Service to clamp down on illegal shebeen owners and
        those selling liquor to children and for those found guilty to lose
        their licences.

I so move, Chair. Thank you.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council ―

     1) notes that the Burmese military authorities have released the pro-
        democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,
        who was detained in her house for 15 of the past 21 years;


     2) further notes that the release of San Suu Kyi, who is the daughter
        of Burma’s independence hero General Aung San who was assassinated
        in 1947, comes six days after the political party supported by the
        military in Burma won the country’s first election in 20 years in a
        ballot that was widely condemned as a sham; and

     3) takes this opportunity to welcome the release of Ms San Suu Kyi  who
        remained the inspiration for democracy and freedom in Burma.

I also add that even Kaizer Chiefs is really supportive of this release. I
so move.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  CONGRATULATIONS TO CAPE TOWN METROPOLITAN POLICE FOR ACTION AGAINST DRUNK
                                   DRIVERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

     1) notes reports that the Cape Town Metropolitan Police and the
        provincial traffic authorities have arrested almost 3 000 motorists
        for drunk driving in the past five months, an average of more than
        500 drunk drivers a month;


     2) further notes that drunk driving results in the loss of human life
        and destruction of our national assets, costing the country and the
        motorists millions of rand; and

     3) takes this opportunity to call on other metro police across South
        Africa to wage a war against irresponsible drivers who drink and
        take to the roads.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               CONGRATULATIONS TO SPRINGBOKS FOR BEATING WALES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council ―

     1) notes the SA Rugby Team, the Springboks, won their game against
        Wales at  the Millennium Stadium 29-25 on Saturday;


     2) further notes that this victory means a lot to us and the team
        because the spirit and support for the next game is now better than
        before; and


     3) therefore gives praise and appreciation to the whole SA Rugby Team
        for making us proud.

May God bless them further and grant His mercy on them to achieve success
in their next game to win the grand slam!

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    CHANCELLOR HOUSE CONFLICT OF INTEREST

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr H B GROENEWALD: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:

   Dat die Raad ―

   (1)      kennis neem dat —
        (a)      die DA sy misnoeë ernstig wil uitspreek teenoor die ANC se
             werkswyse van geldinsameling;

        (b)      Chancellor House saam met oud-president Nelson Mandela se
             skoonseun, mnr Isaac Kwame Amuah, ’n steenkoolmyn van
             Swaziland gekoop het teen R500 miljoen;

        (c)      die myn beplan om steenkool aan verskeie Suid-Afrikaanse
             kragstasies te verskaf waardeur die ANC kan baat vind by Eskom
             se uitbreidingsplan van R485 miljoen; en

          d) die DA Chancellor House se betrokkenheid by die
             steenkoolmyntransaksie beskou as ’n walglike belangebotsing,
             want die R1 miljard wat as wins op die transaksie gemaak sal
             word, kan eerder aan agtergeblewe gemeenskappe geskenk word
             vir die verbetering van infrastruktuur soos elektrisiteit en
             die bou van huise.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr H B GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the House ―

   (1)      notes that ―


           a) the DA wants to express its serious dissatisfaction with the
              ANC’s method of fundraising;


        (b)      Chancellor House, together with former President Nelson
              Mandela’s son-in-law, Mr Isaac Kwame Amuah, purchased a
              coalmine from Swaziland for R500 million;

        (c)      the mine is planning to supply coal to various South
              African power-stations through which the ANC would be able to
              benefit via Eskom’s expansion plan of R485 million; and

        (d)      the DA regards Chancellor House’s involvement in the coal-
              mine transaction as a loathsome conflict of interest, because
              the R1 billion profit that is going to be made from this
              transaction should rather be donated to disadvantaged
              communities towards the improvement of infrastructure such as
              electricity and the building of houses.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In light of the objection, the motion may not
be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become a notice of
motion.

            FATAL SHOOTING AT KONDELELANI JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A G MATILA: Chair, I move without notice:
   That the Council ―

     1) notes with utter dismay that a security guard, Itumeleng Dlamini-
        shot and killed his girlfriend who was a social worker just after a
        school assembly and during an exam session at the Kondelelani Junior
        Secondary in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria yesterday, 15 November
        2010;


     2) further notes that one of the bullets fired by the security guard
        went through a window, hitting Simon Mthimunye, who had dropped his
        orphaned niece and nephew at the school and was about to consult a
        social worker when he was hit by the stray bullet and died on the
        scene; and


     3) takes this opportunity to convey its profound condolences to the
        families of the deceased and condemns in the harshest possible terms
        such disregard for human life.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          AARON MOKOENA HONOURED WITH FREEDOM OF THE CITY OF LONDON

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M W MAKGATE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

     1) notes that Bafana Bafana captain, Mr Aaron Mokoena, has been
        honoured with the Freedom of the City of London, which is a
        prestigious accolade to attest to Mokoena’s role and service to
        football and charitable organisations, which he conducts under the
        Aaron Mokoena Foundation, both in South Africa and in England; and

        astonishing and distinguished award.

                  CONTINUED INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE IN COPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

   (1)      notes that the political drama signalling the political
        dissipation of Cope continued last weekend when Cope president
        Mosiuoa Lekota branded his arch-rival and party deputy, Mbhazima
        Shilowa, a repulsive liar who is not fit to lead the politically
        fragmented organisation;

   (2)      further notes that Cope has been involved in a struggle which
        divided its president and deputy president into two camps and which
        resulted in the resignation of a number of leaders and thousands of
        their members joining the ANC; and

   (3)      takes this opportunity to call on all Cope members to come back
        to the ANC where they belong to take up the fight against poverty,
        marginalisation and the redress of the long years of apartheid and
        be prepared to take over the 2011 local government elections.

   I so move, Chair.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In light of the objection, the motion may not
be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become a notice of
motion.

Mr T M H MOFOKENG: Chair, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

        took pornographic photos of them; and


     3) takes this opportunity to congratulate the citizens who broke their

        perpetrator and calls on all communities to report incidents of
        crime in their communities.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chair, I move without notice:

   That the Council ―

     1) notes that after seven years of vigorous denials, Netcare, South
        Africa’s largest hospital group, has finally admitted to receiving
        cash for illegal kidney transplant operations that were performed
        at St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban;


     2) further notes that ―
          a) the Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed hospital group received
             millions of rands and paid a fine of just more than R4 million
             and agreed to a confiscation order of a further R3,8 million
             in terms of a plea bargain with the state, ratified by
             regional court Magistrate Kim de Freitas in the commercial
             crime court; and


          b) the hospital group firmly implicates others charged with
             fraud, forgery, uttering, assault and contraventions of the
             Human Tissue Act relating to 109 kidney transplant operations
             done at the hospital in which, it is alleged, poor Brazilians
             were recruited and paid to donate their organs to relatively
             wealthy Israeli kidney patients; and


     3) takes this opportunity to condemn in the harshest possible terms
        such repulsive exploitation of the poor by the hospital and calls
        on the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that all hospital
        groups involved in such repulsive practices are brought to book.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr J VISSER (Western Cape): Chairperson, I move without notice:

                     DIVISION OF REVENUE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T E CHAANE: Chairperson and hon members, I hereby present to this august
House the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill. The Bill was tabled in
Parliament on 27 October 2010 by the Minister of Finance during the tabling
of the 2010 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. This process was followed
by engagements between the committee and provinces which culminated in the
consideration of negotiating mandates on 5 November 2010, followed by
consideration of the final mandates on 10 November 2010, where the majority
of provinces supported the Bill.

During the adjustment period, expenditure estimates were adjusted downwards
by R2,464 billion from R818,143 billion to R815,679 billion. The reduction
in the expenditure estimates has primarily been effected in the national
government sphere, whereby the equitable share allocation of national
departments has been adjusted downwards by R7,021 billion from
R527,001 billion to R519,981 billion.

On the other hand, the equitable shares of the provincial and local
government spheres have increased by R4,166 billion to R265,139 billion and
R390,860 million to R30,559 billion respectively. It should be noted that
no adjustments were made to the national sphere as, in respect of the
financial year, it exceeds the anticipated revenue set out in Schedule 1.
The excess accrues to the national government, subject to subsection 3.

The additional allocation of R4,166 billion to the provincial government
sphere was distributed among the nine provinces. The additional allocation
of R390,860 million to the local government sphere was distributed among
the municipalities within each province. During the adjustment period,
municipalities within the boundaries of Gauteng province did not receive
additional allocations to their equitable share. The additional allocations
to the local government equitable share is for the purpose of supporting
funding related to the extension of free basic services to indigents.

The following new allocations and amendments were noted in respect of
specific purpose grants to provinces. In terms of the agriculture disaster
management grant, R50 million was allocated to the Western Cape province
for expenditure related to agriculture disasters such as drought. This
grant is allocated as the need arises.

In terms of the provincial infrastructure disaster relief grant,
R214,398 million was allocated to KwaZulu-Natal for the rehabilitation of
infrastructure destroyed by flooding. This grant is also allocated as needs
arise. The comprehensive HIV/Aids grant increases by R40 million from
R6,012 billion to R6,052 billion. The human settlement development grant
increases by a net amount of R15 million. Gauteng province receives an
additional allocation of R115 million and the North West province’s
allocation is adjusted downwards by R100 million.

The devolution of the property rates fund grant increases by
R769,035 million, from R1,096 billion to R1,865 billion. This grant could
assist in reducing the current debt by government departments to
municipalities. The committee appreciates the co-operation it received from
provinces in dealing with this particular Bill, and we have noted the
concerns from the provinces. Chairperson, we therefore move for the
adoption of the Bill without amendments. I thank you.

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West, Western Cape.

Bill accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

                          GEOSCIENCE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, the Select Committee on Economic Development
deliberated on the Geoscience Amendment Bill over the past few weeks and
has carefully looked at the amendments and the implications thereof. The
Geoscience Amendment Bill seeks, most importantly, to protect the citizens
of the country with regard to their homes built in areas characterised by
potential life-threatening geological conditions of dolomite land, areas of
potential slope stability problems and areas prone to potential severe
seismicity and flood-line areas.

The Geoscience Amendment Bill seeks also to enable the Geological Science
Council to gather geoscience information including, amongst others, with
regard to geotechnical information, exploration mining, geohydrology,
geochemistry, geophysics, engineering geology, economic geology, geohazards
and environmental geology.

This Council will undertake geoscientific research and perform generic
geological functions in any country or territory outside the Republic on
behalf of any person, institution, government or administration. This is
important for the country, considering the risk that most areas suffer and
also assists in future property development.

The Select Committee on Economic Development, having considered and
examined the Geoscience Amendment Bill, recommends that the Bill be passed
without amendments. Thank you.
Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:31.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1. REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON THE 2010 DIVISION  OF
   REVENUE AMENDMENT BILL, DATED 10 NOVEMBER 2010

   HAVING CONSIDERED THE DIVISION OF REVENUE AMENDMENT BILL [B35-2010],  THE
   SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, REPORTS AS FOLLOWS:

   1. BACKGROUND


Section 12 of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related  Matters  Act,
No. 9 of 2009 (the Act) requires  the  Minister  of  Finance  to  table  the
Division  of  Revenue  Amendment  Bill  together  with  the  revised  Fiscal
Framework if the adjustments budget  effects  changes  to  the  Division  of
Revenue Act (DoRA) for the 2010/11  financial  year.  This  is  intended  to
foster transparency  and  ensure  smooth  intergovernmental  relations.  The
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act (1997)  prescribes  the  process  for
determining  the  equitable  sharing  and  allocation  of   revenue   raised
nationally. Sections 9 and 10 (4)  of  the  Act  set  out  the  consultation
process to be followed with  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  (FFC),
including the process of considering recommendations  made  with  regard  to
the equitable division of nationally raised revenue.

In enforcing section 77 of  the  Constitution,  the  Money  Bills  Amendment
Procedures and Related Matters Act, No. 9 of 2009 was enacted.  This  budget
reform empowers Parliament to amend  the  government  budget  and  therefore
plays a greater role in  ensuring  that  the  most  urgent  needs  of  South
Africans are addressed. It provides Parliament  with  necessary  instruments
to oversee government actions and monitor its fiscal discipline. While  this
reform  is  widely  welcomed,  the  Select   Committee   on   Appropriations
(henceforth referred to as the Committee) is mindful that  this  legislation
will be phased in over the years. The Committee’s concern and  focus  is  on
the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office that will provide  more
support to enable the Committees on Appropriations  and  Finance  to  fulfil
their legislative responsibilities.

The Division of Revenue Amendment  Bill  was  tabled  in  Parliament  on  27
October 2010 by the Minister of Finance  during  the  tabling  of  the  2010
Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS).

Clause  1  (the  focus  of  this  brief)  of  the  Bill  provides  for   the
substitution of Schedules 1 to 8 of  the  Division  of  Revenue  (DoRA)  for
Schedules 1 to 8 of  the  Bill.  The  Schedules  to  the  Bill  address  the
following matters:
    • Additional unconditional and conditional allocations to provinces  and
      municipalities;
    • The allocation of unallocated conditional allocations to provinces and
      municipalities;
    • The re-allocation of conditional allocations in terms of section 18 of
      the DoRA;
    • Roll-overs of conditional allocations to provinces and  municipalities
      not transferred by national departments during the  2009/10  financial
      year;
    • Increases to a conditional allocation to a  province  or  municipality
      through virements under section 43 of the  Public  Finance  Management
      Act, 1999 (Act No. 1  of  1999)  or  section  28(2)(d)  of  the  Local
      Government: Municipal Finance Management Act,  2003  (Act  No.  56  of
      2003), as the case may be; and
    • The re-allocation of conditional allocations that were  not  correctly
      reflected in the Schedules to the DoRA.

|Total            |818142943        |815678638       |2464305     |


National Treasury (2010) [adapted]

The adjustments ended  up  in  a  net  reduction  of  R2.4  billion  whereby
expenditure  estimates  levels  decreased  from  R818.1  billion  to  R815.7
billion. The total allocations to national  departments  decreased  by  R7.0
billion, allocations to provinces increased by R4.2 billion and  allocations
to local government  increased  by  R0.3  billion.  In  effect  the  general
decrease will not impact on provincial and local spheres of government  like
on the national sphere of government where allocations were reduced.  It  is
clear the reduced  allocations  are  due  to  shortfall  in  the  unexpected
revenue collected. In terms of section 6(1) of the DoRA  if  actual  revenue
raised nationally in respect of  the  financial  year  falls  short  of  the
anticipated revenue set out in Schedule 1,  the  national  government  bears
the shortfall and in terms of section 6(2) of the  DoRA  if  actual  revenue
raised nationally in respect of the financial year exceeds  the  anticipated
revenue  set  out  in  Schedule  1,  the  excess  accrues  to  the  national
government, subject to subsection (3).

Budget spending projections also make provision for about  R3.6  billion  in
under spending at a national level (including declared savings).  Offsetting
this R9.6 billion available on the main budget against the R7.2  billion  in
the adjustments budget, the total estimated level of spending  decreases  to
R2.5 billion.

The current adjustments resulted  in  the  expenditure  level  estimates  in
provinces increasing from R261.0 billion to R265.1 billion.  The  additional
allocation of R4.2 billion to provincial equitable share was distributed  as
follows:,  KwaZulu  Natal  increased  by  R0.889  billion,  Gauteng   R0.734
billion, Eastern Cape by R0.655 billion, Limpopo by R0.528 billion,  Western
Cape by R0.429 billion, Mpumalanga by R0.316 billion, North West  by  R0.252
billion and Northern Cape by R0.099 billion respectively.

National Treasury (2010) [adapted]

Except for Gauteng, all provinces experienced roll overs due to the  unspent
conditional grants by  local  municipalities.  Although  the  Committee  has
noted the rolling over of funds; there is still a need for more  clarity  to
further  explain  the  circumstances  leading  to  such   under  expenditure
especially with regard to funds that are supposed to support  the  extension
of free basic services to indigents. On the other hand, the  Committee  need
to ensure that these funds target critical needs such as indigents,  repairs
and maintenance of ageing infrastructure.

In  Eastern  Cape,  four  municipalities  received  increased   allocations-
Sunday’s River  Valley  Municipality  received  increased  allocations  from
R25.7 million to R26.1 million,  Nxuba  Municipality  increased  allocations
from R16.2 million to R16.3 million, Inxuba Yethemba  Municipality  received
increased  allocations  from  R32.8  million   to   R34.2   million,   Senqu
Municipality received increased allocations  from  R66.4  million  to  R66.8
million.

In  Free  State,  five  municipalities  received  increased  allocations   –
Kopanong an increase from  R72.7  million  to  R78.0  million,  Mantsopa  an
increase from R53.9 million to R55.1 million, Motheo  District  an  increase
from R 152.3 million to R152.7 million, Phumelela  an  increase  from  R44.2
million to R45.1 million and Metsimaholo an increase from R79.0  million  to

from R198.6 million  to  R215.4  million,  Jozini  an  increase  from  R48.5
million to R54.1 million, Hlabisa an increase from R39.2  million  to  R43.7
million, KwaDukuza an increase from R50.9  million  to  R57.9  million,  and

Limpopo’s total allocations increased from  R3.6  billion  to  R3.7  billion
where three municipalities received additional allocations –  Makhuduthamaga
received an increase from R107.3 million  to  R111.8  million,  Molemole  an
increase from R57.0 million to R61.3  million  and  Thabazimbi  an  increase
from R45.1 million to R48.2 million.

In Mpumalanga, municipalities  received  additional  allocations  from  R2.8
billion to R2.9 billion  whereby  four  municipalities  received  additional
allocations as follows – Mkhondo an increase from  R73.3  million  to  R80.8
million, Thabachweu  an  increase  from  R59.5  million  to  R62.6  million,
Mbombela  an  increase  from  R247.6   million   to   R295.9   million   and
Bushbuckridge an increase from R339.7 million to R387.1 million.
Northern  Cape  received   an   additional   R612   million   whereby   five
municipalities  received  additional  allocations  –  Hantam   received   an
increase from R15.6 million to R17.4 million,  Karoo  Hoogland  received  an
increase from R10.1 million to R12.1 million, Ubuntu  received  an  increase
from R13.9 million to R16.7 million, //Khara Hais received an increase  from
R40.5 million to R45.4 million, and Sol Plaatjie received an  increase  from
R121.7 million to R130.9 million.

North  West   received   an   additional   R360.3   million   whereby   five
municipalities received additional allocations – Moses  Kotane  received  an

increase from  R26.9  million  to  R28.0  million  and  George  received  an
increase from R58.2 million to R59.3 million.

5. Allocations to provinces to  supplement  the  funding  of  programmes  or
functions funded from provincial budgets

This Schedule comprises of a number  of  conditional  grants  and  the  only
grant that has changed is the Further Education and Training Colleges  Grant
which received an additional R31.2 million  during  the  adjustment  period.
According to the National Treasury 2010/11 First  Quarterly  Reports,  there
was no spending for Further Education and Training  grants  as  at  30  June
2010. While the Committee welcomes the increase, the  Committee  is  concern
that  less  than  anticipated  expenditure  in  the  first   quarter   would
negatively impact on the second quarter expenditure projections.

6. Specific purpose allocations to provinces: Schedule 5 Grants
Out of approximately nineteen grants in this  category,  only  three  grants
received additional allocations – Comprehensive HIV and  Aids  Grant,  Human
Settlements Development Grant, and Devolution of Property Rate Funds Grant.

The purpose of the Comprehensive HIV and Aids Grant is to enable the  health
sector to develop an effective response to HIV  and  Aids,  to  support  the
implementation of the National Operational Plan for  Comprehensive  HIV  and
Aids  treatment  and  care,  and  to  subsidise  in-part  funding  for   the
antiretroviral treatment programme. This Grant was  allocated  R6.0  billion
for the baseline, during the adjustment the  grant  received  an  additional
amount of R40 million.

The purpose of  the  Human  Settlements  Development  Grant  is  to  provide
funding for the creation of  sustainable  human  settlements.  Although,  in
total, this Grant received additional allocations of R15  000  million  only
Gauteng received an increase from R3.7 billion to R3.8 billion  while  North
West had its allocations reduced from R1.2 billion to  R1.1  billion.  There
were no changes in allocations to other provinces.

The purpose of the Devolution of Property Rate Fund Grant is  to  facilitate
the transfer of property rates expenditure responsibility to provinces,  and
to enable provincial accounting officers to be fully accountable  for  their
expenditure and payment of provincial property rates. The grant received  an
increase from R1.0 billion to R1.8 billion. The Public  Works  Report  shows
that 49 per cent of the allocation was spent as at the  30  August  2010  in
this regard. This grant could be the main source of revenue  generation  for
municipalities  and  can  also  reduce  the  current  debt   by   government
departments to municipalities. While the Committee welcomes the increase  in
this  grant,  there  is  a  need  for  the  relevant  Committees  and  other
stakeholders to ensure that there are systems and plans in place  that  will
enable  provinces  to  spend  the  additional  allocations  efficiently  and
economically. This will assist the government to be able achieve  value  for
money in such expenditure and required outcomes.

7. Schedule 6 Grants: Specific purpose allocations to municipalities

Two grants in this category received additional  allocations  and  they  are
the Water Services Operating Subsidy  Grant  and  Municipal  Drought  Relief
Grant.

The purpose of the Water Services Operating Subsidy Grant  is  to  subsidise
water schemes owned and/or operated by the Department of  Water  Affairs  or
by other agencies on behalf of the Department.  Net  additional  allocations
to the Water Services Operating Subsidy Grant amount  to  R22.1  million  in
the 2010/11 financial year and is comprised  as  follows:  R8.4  million  is
added to the Schedule 6 Grant and R13.7 million is added to the Schedule  7:
Grant-in-kind.

However, it  will  be  important  to  provide  a  detailed  explanation  for
allocations to specific projects to the Committee so  that  the  expenditure
of these additional funds can be effectively monitored.

The purpose of the Municipal Drought Relief  Grant  is  to  provide  capital
finance for basic water supply  in  municipal  infrastructure  for  affected
households, micro enterprises and social institutions.  The  grant  received
an additional allocation of R92 million which is specifically  allocated  to
the Mossel Bay Municipality for drought relief.

8. Consideration of Mandates

Seven provinces submitted their final  mandates  on  the  2010  Division  of
Revenue Amendments Bill to the Committee and all of  these  provinces  voted
in favour of the Bill. Therefore the majority of provinces voted  in  favour
of the Bill. The two provinces that did not submit their final mandates  are
Free State and KwaZulu-Natal.

With regard to negotiating mandates, the  North  West  province  raised  the
following concerns in their negotiating mandates:
 - The Provincial  Equitable  Share  (PES)  formula  in  its  allocation  to
   provinces and municipalities needs to be reviewed;
 - The PES formula alone cannot be used in  all  aspects  of  allocation  of
   budgets to provinces, departments and municipalities. Another formula  or
   formulas of varying departments and municipalities should be used;
 - The allocation of budgets to municipalities in the North West  should  be
   done in consultation with the Province; and
 - The conditional grants  allocated  to  the  North  West  departments  are
   insufficient for the work that needs to be carried out by the  respective
   departments.

The North West Province also noted the time constraints  for  the  programme
activities related to the adoption of the  Bill,  making  it  impossible  to
comply  with  the  standard  procedures  as  per  Section  118  (1)  of  the
Constitution (Act No 108 of 1996), namely to facilitate  public  involvement
in  the  legislative  and  other  processes  of  the  Legislature  and   its
committees when a Section 76 Bill is referred  to  the  Committee.  However,
the Committee  accepted  the  reasons  for  the  strict  timeframe  for  the
adoption of the Bill;  and  appreciates  the  fact  that  Legislatures  were
briefed on matters related to the Bill.
The Gauteng Province raised  its  concern  on  the  hasty  manner  in  which
Parliament processes were undertaken in referring the Bill to  Provinces  as
this has a negative impact on the programmes  of  Provincial  Committees  in
fully complying with the  regulations  guiding  the  consideration  of  NCOP
Bills, with particular reference to public participation.

The Western Cape Province proposed the insertion of a clause after clause  1
of the Bill to propose for the amendment of section 29 of  the  Division  of
Revenue Act. This to allow provinces to amend allocations to  municipalities
in respect of human settlement grants  after  the  Adjustment  Appropriation
Bill is submitted to the legislature, but not later than  14  February  each
year. Furthermore, the MEC  for  Finance  must  approve  the  date  of  such
amendment and the amendments must be  in  accordance  with  the  adjustments
budget and appropriation legislations.

The National Treasury responded that there  is  no  need  for  Western  Cape
Province proposal because section 36 of the Division of  Revenue  Act  1  of
2010 covers the proposed clause. Section 36 (1)  states  that  the  National
Treasury may, on written application by the transferring  national  officer,
province, or municipality, exempt such officer,  province,  or  municipality
in writing from complying with a provision of Act 1 of 2010. Section 36  (2)
goes further to say any exemption granted in terms of  subsection  (1)  must
set out the period and conditions, if any, to which it is subject  and  must
be published in the gazette.

9. Recommendation

The Select Committee on Appropriations, having considered  the  Division  of
Revenue Amendment Bill [B 35 – 2010], recommends to the  House  that  it  be
approved (without amendments).

10. Conclusion

In conclusion, the Select Committee on Appropriations (the  Committee)  will
monitor the utilisation of these additional grant  allocations  through  the
in-year monitoring process which  forms  part  of  Parliamentary  oversight.
This will enable the  Committee  to  be  able  to  check  whether  financial
legislations  such  as  Division  of  Revenue  Act  (DoRA),  Public  Finance
Management Act (PFMA)  and  Municipal  Finance  Management  Act  (MFMA)  are
adhered to by provincial and local government spheres.  The  Committee  will
also monitor the efficiency of  administration  in  compiling  and  spending
various  schedules  so  that  schedules  are   not   incorrectly   recorded,
classified or misplaced in the process. This will assist  the  Committee  to
identify challenges and, enhance the level of  accuracy  and  compliance  in
all levels of government through making relevant recommendations during  the
in-year monitoring process.

Report to be considered.
