<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its deepest concern at the continuing deterioration in South Africa&#x2019;s international relations and the escalating threat which is developing for South Africa as a result, and demands that the Government fulfils its duty to South Africa by taking appropriate policy steps to correct the position.</block>

<p>Over the past few years we have frequently debated the deterioration in South Africa&#x2019;s international relations in this House. The Government has usually reacted to this in two ways. It has denied that we are headed for a situation in which our country will stand isolated, and it has tried to reassure us by suggesting that important break-throughs were taking place behind the scenes, but that these could not be discussed prematurely. I must say, with respect, that personally I have long since come to the conclusion that in actual fact there was nothing taking place either in front of or behind the scenes which could have carried enough weight to improve our position.</p>

<p>In his New Year&#x2019;s message a few weeks ago, the hon. the Prime Minister put an end to all further pretence and admitted for the first time where we were standing: in the final analysis, completely alone. I should like to remind hon. members of the heart of his message. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek het baie geleentheid gehad om in die loop van die jaar hierdie Stelling in gesprekke uit te toets en dit is my plig om vir u te s&#x00EA; dat dit my bevinding is dat as daar &#x2019;n Marxistiese aanslag, hetsy openlik of deur &#x2019;n handlanger, op Suid-Afrika gedoen word, dan sal ons dit alleen moet weerstaan. Sekere lande wat voorgee om anti-kommunisties te wees, sal nie bereid wees om wapens aan ons te verkoop om onsself te verdedig nie. Dit is die werklikheid waarvoor ons staan.</block>

<p>I wish the hon. the Prime Minister had told us which countries pretend to be anti-communist, while in fact they are not. I cannot imagine that he was thinking of America, for we ought to remember that the Americans fought communism for several years in Vietnam, that they lost 56 000 men there, that 300 000 were wounded, that it cost them 160 billion dollars, and that, as an observer said, &#x201C;It nearly tore their society apart&#x201D;. I should like to know whether France is the country that is meant. The French Prime Minister did say last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">France has almost stopped supplying arms to South Africa. We do not expect to <span class="col_1235-1236" refersTo="page_0635"/>sign any more contracts. France is resolutely hostile to apartheid.</block>

<p>One would like to know which countries are the ones that pretend to be anti-communist, while in fact they are not.</p>

<p>Frankness in politics is mostly a good thing, but I must admit that it surprised me that the hon. the Prime Minister should have thought fit to inform our enemies so officially that if they were to come, they would find us isolated. It surprised me just as much, of course, that the hon. the Prime Minister should only now, after having been in office for 10 years, have discovered how much South Africa&#x2019;s position has actually deteriorated. The question occurred to me whether the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Information had failed for all these years to inform the hon. the Prime Minister, or had not realized themselves what was going on. Most of all, however, I wondered whether the hon. the Prime Minister realized the full tragedy of his statement. With the possible exception of Rhodesia, there is no country in the world today which is not in some way integrated into a power bloc or a defence treaty of some kind&#x2014;only we are not. We are the only country in the world whose leader has to rise and state that in the final analysis, his country stands alone.</p>

<p>Surely it must be clear to any reasonable person that if we are the only country in the international community which finds itself in such a position, there must be something wrong somewhere, and that, on a balance of probabilities, the fault, or at least the major part of it, must lie with us.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The root cause of our troubles has often been identified in debates in this House as the race policies of the Government. However, it is more than that. The Government is today spending millions and millions of rands of the taxpayers&#x2019; money abroad to convince the world that it does not condone race or colour discrimination and that it stands for the abolition of all discrimination. Their terminology comes straight from the liberal textbooks. We raised no objection to this liberal posture abroad, but it had not helped, for the very simple reason that there is a stark contradiction between the Government&#x2019;s foreign policy posture and its internal policy posture. It is this contradiction which lies at the root of our present position.</p>

<p>This, of course, goes back a long time and has now led abroad to a full-scale collapse of credibility in the Government. The first significant effect of the contradiction between the Government&#x2019;s foreign policy stand and its domestic policy became apparent in 1961. There are many other cases, but I want to quote a classic one. In 1961 the late Dr. Verwoerd applied for South Africa to remain within the Commonwealth after our country became a Republic. Several prime ministers were present with Dr. Verwoerd at the Commonwealth conference in London and they and other leaders who were involved have now recounted what happened there. As we know, Dr. Verwoerd was heavily criticized because of his Government&#x2019;s internal policies, but the general consensus was that South Africa should be allowed to remain a member. Nigel Fisher, the biographer of Mr. Iain Macleod, the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, records the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Almost all the prime ministers wanted South Africa to remain in. Diefenbaker of Canada was opposed to it, but even Nehru and Nkrumah would have agreed if Dr. Verwoerd had been able to accept the presence of coloured Commonwealth High Commissioners in Pretoria. He declined flatly to do so and this was the end of the road.</block>

<p>Mr. Macmillan, Mr. Diefenbaker and others have all confirmed these facts in their writings.</p>

<p>Here was a Government who, as an exercise in foreign policy, applied to remain a member of a multi-racial international club&#x2014; it wanted to enjoy the privileges of the club&#x2014;but at the time refused, in terms of its internal policy, to accommodate In Pretoria the accredited representatives of some of the members of the club because of their colour. The result was our first exclusion and isolation from an international community of nations because of the conflict between the Government&#x2019;s internal policy posture and its external policy posture.</p>

<p>I should like to quote a second case. The Government&#x2019;s handling of the problem of South West Africa is perhaps the most glaring <span class="col_1237-1238" refersTo="page_0636"/>case of all when it comes to the question of conflict between two policies of the same Government. In 1968 the Government officially conceded for the first time that South West Africa was &#x201C;a territory with a separate international status&#x201D;&#x2014;not a separate international character, but a separate international status. Those who know the background will remember that there was a long international dispute on this very matter and that South Africa&#x2019;s eventual recognition of South West Africa as a territory with a separate international status, was a major step forward in its foreign policy. However, no sooner had the Government announced this new foreign policy posture than it proceeded at home to incorporate South West Africa administratively in terms of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s domestic Odendaal plan and to transfer all the most important powers of the Legislative Assembly from Windhoek to Pretoria. Had the Government, at that time, before there was a terrorist organization on the border as now, and long before our problems became as complicated as they are at present, followed the line of its foreign policy, i.e. that South West Africa is a territory with an international status, and then started with a Turnhalle conference, the matter would by today have been solved in peace. It can now no longer be solved in peace. We passed numerous Bills in this House to complete the integration process, which was conducted under the soft name, not of incorporation, but of rearrangement. We on this side opposed these measures. We pointed out the dangers of the new policy contradiction and warned that it was only a matter of time before Parliament would laboriously have to undo the whole political side of the Odendaal plan, because we saw self-determination and independence as the only solution for the territory, which had an international status and therefore could not become a constitutional part of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Government, however, continued to maintain the contradiction, until only recently it was faced with the inevitable. At this late stage we are faced with a great disadvantage, that a Namibian liberation army&#x2014;as they call themselves&#x2014;has come into being and has gained the support of the United Nations, the OAU and several Western powers, as well as military support from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Commonwealth countries. This was not applicable in 1968.</p>

<p>*Since then, the formation and development of a terrorist army across the border in Angola has also had the by-product of causing us to get involved in Angola. I shall leave aside the question of how unforgivable it is that the public of South Africa is only now being informed of what happened. No matter how ably and honourably our men conducted themselves during the battles, I cannot see that any balance of advantages has been derived by our country from its participation there as far as our international relations are concerned. If there are any advantages, I should be glad if the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs would spell them out to us.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to see that progress is being made with the agreement in the Turnhalle conference in Windhoek. What is regrettable, as I have said, is that this solution was not begun 10 years ago. Now the position is such that even if the representatives there were to carry their task to a successful conclusion, they would still be faced with the serious problem of the military threat from outside, which will not easily disappear and which would not have been there if there had not been a contradiction between the internal policy posture and the foreign policy posture of the Government in the past. In a year or so this territory is to become independent. Nothing can prevent this any more. We should have begun to take steps a long time ago to ensure that the day when South West Africa becomes independent, it will be friendly towards South Africa and that the closest bonds of good neighbourship will be maintained between us. Otherwise it could become a dagger reaching right into the heart of South Africa.</p>

<p>What vision is the Government showing in regard to an independent South West Africa&#x003F; To mention only one example, thousands of non-White officials are going to be required to take over the various Government services. They will have to fill some of the most senior positions in South West Africa. It is going to be of vital importance to us that there should be people in those positions who are favourably disposed towards South Africa. Where is the Government, a year before independence, engaged in any organized attempt to train the non-White of South West Africa for the important new tasks in the administration&#x003F; We should have brought them here in their <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_0637"/>hundreds to be trained in our advanced public service. But this is yet another example of an internal policy thwarting the foreign requirements. What is happening now&#x003F; The UNO has established an institute across the border, in Lusaka, and has for several years been encouraging young non-Whites to cross the border of South West to be trained there as administrative leaders with a view to the day when South West Africa will become independent. It is most probable that the people who will eventually occupy those posts and who should have been our friends will be friends of Swapo, while the friends of South Africa will be absent.</p>

<p>Time will not allow me on this occasion to deal with the dangerous deterioration in the relations between us and the three LBS countries&#x2014;not to mention Zambia and other neighbouring states even closer to us. The obduracy of the Prime Minister of Lesotho seems to know no bounds. No one will deny, but it is obvious, that between us and Lesotho&#x2014;to mention one example&#x2014;relations have deteriorated badly. Here again we have the situation that 10 to 13 years ago, when these countries became independent, they offered, one after another, to establish official diplomatic and friendly relations with South Africa. In 1964, 13 years ago, President Kaunda offered to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa.</p>

<p>This was yet another example of the conflict between foreign policy and the requirements of internal policy. We tell the outside world that we want to be friends with Africa, but on the domestic front, the Government was for many years prevented by its internal policy of apartheid from allowing Black diplomats here, until we have now come to the point where it is too late. Countries which could have become friends long ago have now ranged themselves with others and become open opponents of South Africa. Today each of these neighbouring territories is visibly becoming a basis for political and, in some cases, military action against us.</p>

<p>The clearest proof of how the Government has been paralysed by the contradiction between its foreign and its domestic policy postures lies in the history of what is known as d&#x00E9;tente. This word has now disappeared completely from our political vocabulary because the concept has disappeared. Why has this happened&#x003F; The message delivered by our ambassador to the Security Council on 24 October 1974, only two years and four months ago, was no ordinary speech by Pik Botha; it was a carefully approved Cabinet speech. The message was clear and unequivocal. I have the official text here, but I shall read only the essence of the message. The essence was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to state here today very clearly and categorically: My Government does not condone discrimination purely on the grounds of race or colour. Discrimination based solely on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended. And we shall do everything in our power to move away from discrimination based on race or colour.</block>

<p>This clear message immediately changed and improved the climate abroad for us. For the first time in years, there was a smile for us on the face of Africa, as well as the belief that we meant what we were saying. The hon. the Prime Minister was invited everywhere and doors began to open for us in Africa. On the bridge of the Victoria Falls, the hon. the Prime Minister and President Kaunda beamed with friendship, like two brothers, as it were. In the Security Council, countries such as America, France and England exercised vetoes in our favour.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We on this side welcomed the development, but we warned the Government to guard against reaction and we said that a bitter and dangerous reaction would set in if the hopes raised by the Government in respect of internal reform, were not speedily fulfilled. What happened&#x003F; It is now recent history. Once again, internal policy postures came into conflict with foreign policy postures. We are now in the third parliamentary session since the heyday of d&#x00E9;tente and yet there is no sign that the Government is planning to remove any of the basic bricks of its system of discrimination. The same ritual occurs time and time again; a thrust in the right direction abroad, a reverse in the direction at home.</p>

<p>I want to give another example of how one policy of the same Government defeats another. A couple of years ago the Government started a new campaign to win friends <span class="col_1241-1242" refersTo="page_0638"/>for us in Latin America. The going was quite good; a President came to visit us and our Prime Minister went to visit there. At that time the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs had much to tell us about our developing relations with Catholic America and the great significance of those relations. Government members can argue as much as they like that the Catholic Church in South Africa broke the law when they enrolled non-White students in their private church schools. Technically that may be true, but in the light of the Government&#x2019;s assurance that it does not condone race discrimination, was it sensible for Government leaders to explode and to threaten to close the Catholic schools so loudly that it reverberated around the world and even brought His Holiness, the Pope, out against South Africa. That had the worst possible effect in every Catholic country in the world, including Latin America.</p>

<p>The matter was further aggravated a few days ago when the Nationalist administration in South West Africa, of all places, of which the top leadership vests here in the Republic, promptly went so far as to cancel their subsidy of R24 000 to the two Catholic schools in South West Africa. Only help from abroad, from Western Germany, made it possible for the schools to continue their services. Can hon. members imagine how many times R24 000 of our taxpayers&#x2019; money the Department of Information will next have to waste to explain the howling contradiction between the Government&#x2019;s policy statements abroad and its policy actions at home&#x003F;</p>

<p>A most depressing situation has developed for us in Southern Africa. The endless conflict between the Government&#x2019;s foreign policy and its domestic policy has now finally led to the fact that the Government has lost all its credibility abroad in respect of every one of the issues that face us. Leadership in Africa is now in the hands of those who say that dialogue has brought no results and that the only practical answer is the application of force. Here is some of the evidence. President Kaunda, speaking in Lusaka, said the following&#x2014;and consider what the position was two years ago and what it could have been today&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Peaceful means of solving the problems of Southern Africa had failed and the only option left was to fight.</block>

<p>According to a report from Paris, the President of the Ivory Coast, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who was the greatest promoter of dialogue, was &#x201C;disillusioned over dialogue with South Africa and has started diplomatic moves towards establishing relations with Moscow and Peking&#x201D;. This is the kind of reaction we are getting. President William Tolbert of Liberia, whom the Prime Minister visited, says he is &#x201C;disillusioned with dialogue with South Africa and will take no further initiative to promote it&#x201D;. This president, once one of the leading proponents in West Africa of dialogue, told <i>The Argus</i> Africa News Service the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s attitude does not encourage any further attempts at dialogue on our part. The ball now rests squarely in his court.</block>

<p>Once this kind of reaction sets in, it is terribly difficult to reverse it when people are disillusioned over promises that have been made. The initiative&#x2014;and that is the disastrous position&#x2014;is being taken over by the Soviet Union and by its Podgornys. Can one believe that we are a party to a situation where the communists, of all people, are now emerging in Africa as the champions of freedom, the champions of Black freedom against White supremacy&#x003F; They are busy establishing themselves right across central Africa, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>*Surely the dangers which this holds for us must be clear to anyone. I need not say here what terrible dangers this position holds for South Africa. The one chance we had to establish ourselves in Africa has perished. It is doubtful whether this Government is still able to do anything about the matter at this stage, for once any government has lost its credibility &#x2026;</p>

<p>It should stop repeating that nonsensical story about refusing to yield before pressure from outside. We are constantly being told this. This is not the issue. Not even the most powerful country in the world today could afford not to take into consideration the realities of world circumstances and of its own circumstances. Forget about the so-called pressure from outside. We should examine the true circumstances in which we find ourselves and how we may direct the course of events so as to ensure the security of South Africa. Surely we cannot ignore the realities surrounding us, the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p>What is urgently necessary is for the Government to bring its domestic policy posture into line with its foreign policy posture without delay. If it cannot do this very soon, it does not have the moral right to stay in power.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the struggle that lies ahead for us is mainly a political struggle, although some people think it is a military one. If one studies communist imperialism all over the world, in all the countries in which it has made progress and succeeded &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; there is one point which strikes one, and that is that politics play an important part in its offensives. The political struggle almost predominates over the military one. It gives its support to a popular movement, anyone that suits it. It supports a popular political movement and then it supplies arms to that political movement, and then political and military action are combined. I recently studied the history of Mao in China. His success in China was remarkable. It took him 20 years to achieve success and the essence of his success lies in the fact that it combined political with military action. Right up to the end he fought a losing battle on the military side, because Chiang Kai-shek had the support of the mighty America behind him. His army was considerably stronger and better equipped than Mao&#x2019;s. Chiang had greatly superior military forces. Ultimately, however, it was the combination of Mao&#x2019;s popular political plan, which influenced to the masses, and his military plan which brought him success. This is the way it has been in every country which the communists have taken over. Our only hope in South Africa, if we are to win the struggle that lies ahead, is to combine our military plans with political plans which will win us the support of the broad masses&#x2014;and here I am speaking of White, Black and Brown&#x2014;and to remove at once the contradiction between the Government&#x2019;s foreign and domestic postures. Then there will be hope again that the Government may regain its credibility and then we shall be able to return to the road of peace in Southern Africa.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a saying to the effect that there is always something new from Africa. I think it would indeed have been something new if we in this Parliament could have experienced from the lips of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout an acknowledgment of the things which this Government is doing and not merely reproaches. I am afraid that Africa will still have to wait a long time for that day to arrive.</p>

<p>The motion introduced by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout implies that the Government is responsible for the deteriorating international relations between South Africa and other countries, and for that reason alone, we on this side of the House are unable to accept his motion. I just want to react to one or two matters which he raised. He referred to the attitude of a country like Lesotho, one of the BSL countries. I want to ask him this: <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_0640"/>Can the reproach be levelled at South Africa that it has done anything incorrect with regard to the BSL countries&#x003F; Has not South Africa, for her part, acted absolutely correctly in every respect in her attitude towards these countries&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that South Africa&#x2019;s credibility had been shattered in all parts of the world. I want to ask him whether he has taken cognizance of the actions of a man such as Prof. Kerina, one of the people who has been one of the greatest critics of South Africa down the years. Prof. Kerina has now realized that he can accept South Africa&#x2019;s credibility and that he can accept that South Africa does indeed have the intention of establishing a free South West Africa. This man has returned to South West Africa and is now travelling the world as a self-appointed ambassador for what is happening at the Turnhalle. The actions of someone like Prof. Kerina belie the statement that South Africa&#x2019;s credibility has been shattered throughout the world.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made the statement that the Government should recognize the realities of the situation. In truth, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s New Year message shows that the Government is fully aware of the realities, viz. that the enemies of South Africa, those who are attempting to isolate South Africa particularly in its relationships with other countries in Africa, will only be satisfied if a Black majority government takes over in South Africa. It is because we know what the realities of the situation are that this party is following the policy which it is implementing in practice today.</p>

<p>As I have said, the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is unacceptable to us. We on this side of the House want to contend that inasmuch as there is a deterioration in international relations, this is mainly due to misrepresentations made by the enemies of South Africa or to misconceptions on the part of those who ought normally to co-operate with us. We also want to contend that this situation has been brought about mainly because the communist bloc is using the misconceptions which prevail to drive a wedge between South Africa and her potential friends in Africa. They are doing this with one objective only, and that is to bring South Africa, with her strategic position and vast natural resources, under their control. Consequently, we on this side of the House want to approach this debate in a far more positive spirit and for that reason, on behalf of this side of the House, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House is convinced that sound and lasting international relations with peace-loving peoples are only possible if all population groups in South Africa have the opportunity to attain the highest degree of self-realization in all spheres of life, and accordingly requests the Government to pursue these objectives, due regard being had to the plural composition of the population.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the question we must ask ourselves is to what extent there is a deterioration in South Africa&#x2019;s international relations. To begin with, I must point out that international relations cover such a tremendously wide field that we shall not be able to deal with it comprehensively in a debate of this nature. I just want to point out one or two aspects of our relations with the outside world and I am going to limit myself chiefly to our economic ties. If we take a look at what the actual position is, we find that in regard to this key sector of our foreign relations, South Africa&#x2019;s position is by no means an isolated one in the world. We find that during the past two years, 1975 and 1976, our imports of goods, which in 1975 had already reached the high figure of R5,5 billion, rose to R5,8 billion and that our exports, excluding gold, which in 1975 had already amounted to the high figure of R3,9 billion, rose to R4,5 billion in 1976. This shows us that in her trade with the outside world, South Africa is strengthening her bonds with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Then we may ask ourselves the question: What is our position in relation to Africa, the continent which is attempting to isolate itself from South Africa&#x003F; Then we find that South Africa is at present trading with no less than 50 independent countries in Africa. The position in regard to our imports from and exports to these 50 countries in 1976 as compared to 1975, is that our imports from these 50 countries rose by no less than 23,1% and that our exports to these 50 countries rose <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_0641"/>by 7% over the past year. If we take a look at what the traffic in the official and private sectors was, i.e. trade and economic missions, we see that in 1975 and 1976 there were 61 official missions and 57 private missions from South Africa to countries abroad and to South Africa from countries abroad. Therefore, during these two years we had more than 50 missions per year, i.e. economic missions from South Africa to countries abroad and from countries abroad to South Africa.</p>

<p>If we look at the number of countries in the world with which we are still trading at this stage, we find that in 1974 they numbered 167 and in 1975 164. So by far the larger proportion of the nations of the world are still trading with South Africa. South Africa has reached the position today where she features as the 17th most important country in regard to the value of her exports and imports.</p>

<p>If we want to take a look at the confidence which the outside world still has in South Africa, we should measure this in terms of the investments made by other countries in South Africa. I shall give the figures for the past four years only. In 1972 foreign investments in South Africa amounted to R7 787 million; in 1973 they totalled R10 380 million, a rise of 33,3% in one year; in 1974 they were R12 757 million, a further rise of 22,9%; and in 1975 foreign investments amounted to R16 450 million, a further rise of 28,9%. This gives us a picture of how the world&#x2019;s investors, who have the opportunity of investing anywhere in the world, have confidence in the future of South Africa and wish to maintain their ties with South Africa to such an extent that over the past four years we have had an annual rise of more than 20% in investments in this country.</p>

<p>If we also take note of the private individual and of the impression he has of South Africa&#x2019;s future, we find that South Africa has maintained a net immigration rate of almost 30 000 per year over the past four years. Even during the past year, up to the end of November 1976, South Africa&#x2019;s net immigration figure was 30 290. This shows that, under circumstances of the fiercest propaganda against South Africa, even after certain urban areas here had been afflicted by rioting, the picture of South Africa was still one which reflected a country with a future. It is for this reason that so many thousands of immigrants settle in South Africa every year.</p>

<p>I could go on demonstrating that South Africa still has firm bonds with the rest of the world in many fields and that the picture which the world has of South Africa is a different picture to the one which was painted for us here this morning.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I want to point out briefly that the Government believes that the basis of sound relations with peace-loving peoples of the world is in our establishing a body politic in South Africa in which there is an opportunity for all population groups to attain self-realization in all fields. This is the objective of the Government. Not only is this stated in speeches by ambassadors at the UNO and elsewhere, but also implemented in practice in this way. Other hon. members on this side of the House will indicate how the Government is going about attaining that situation. I myself want to indicate briefly what progress has been made in the material sphere only, progress in regard to the standard of living of South Africa&#x2019;s non-Whites during the past year. Consequently, I should like to quote in brief the figures which I have been able to obtain from Pretoria during the past few days. The average increase in salaries and wages of all wage-earners during the period 1971 to 1976, excluding domestic servants and those employed in agriculture, was 62,4% in the case of Whites, 74,3% in the case of Coloureds, 94,4% in the case of Asians and 150,9% in the case of Bantu. And this is the country where oppression is supposedly the fate of the non-White, the country whose policy is paraded before the outside world as one of oppression.</p>

<p>If, however, we take cognizance specifically of what the central Government is doing, if we take cognizance of the average increase in salaries and wages of people in the Government&#x2019;s service, and contrast only the White man to the Black man, we find that between 1971 and 1976, the White man&#x2019;s wages increased by 46,4% and those of the Black man by 152,9%. I could continute to indicate in this way how the standard of living of the non-White in South Africa has advanced in every sphere of life. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into this in detail. I just want to make the statement that the Government&#x2019;s objective remains unaltered, viz. that the Government is attempting to give also political rights to everyone in this country. The Government believes, however, <span class="col_1249-1250" refersTo="page_0642"/>that political rights can be enduring and can create a basis for peaceful co-existence only if such rights are placed next to one another and not one above the other, so that the stronger is on top and the smaller and weaker is oppressed underneath.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Government believes that eventually, and after arduous labour, it will be able to bring about a peaceful body politic in South Africa and that this will lay the foundations for better relations with our neighbouring states as well as with other countries in Africa and eventually with the whole wide world.</p>

<p>If the hon. members could have been at Mecklenburg, the official residence of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, yesterday evening, and could have witnessed the way in which the leaders of Transkei were associating with the leaders of this country, if the hon. members could have experienced that peaceful atmosphere, they would have been able to gain an impression of the way things in South Africa and indeed in Southern Africa could be in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to question the figures furnished by the hon. member for Vasco on the foreign trade with South Africa, the number of formal and informal missions taking place or even the question of foreign investment in South Africa. However, as far as this last aspect is concerned, I should like the hon. member for Vasco to discuss this with the hon. the Minister of Finance and find out whether the hon. the Minister is satisfied with the present situation regarding foreign investment in South Africa. It seems to us that the hon. member does not realize the seriousness of the situation regarding our foreign policy. The message of the hon. the Prime Minister was a serious one. However, a certain aspect of the Government&#x2019;s policy, viz. its strategic policy as far as it concerns defence, was affected by the collapse of our foreign policy. The hon. member does not want to admit, either, that our internal policy is contributing to the collapse of our foreign policy. The hon. member says the fault cannot lie with our internal policy, but I wish to refer him to what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs had to say about this. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words are much better suited to this argument than those of the hon. member. Last year the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said at a NP congres in Durban&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Voordat dit nie volkome duidelik is dat die NP se beleid van afsonderlike ontwikkeling die oplossing bied vir ons volkereverhoudingvraagstuk en voordat ons dit so toepas in die praktyk dat ons nie meer Suid-Afrika se vyande voorsien met ammunisie om afsonderlike ontwikkeling mee af te skiet nie, s&#x00F3; lank sal ons posisie in die w&#x00EA;reld nie makliker word nie.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister therefore says that the application of our policy, the way in which we apply our internal policy, provides our enemies with ammunition to shoot down that policy, and this does not make South Africa&#x2019;s position in the world any easier. This is a fact. This is what the hon. the Minister said, but nevertheless the hon. members on the other side do not want to admit that it is indeed the internal policy of South Africa which has this tremendously detrimental effect on South Africa&#x2019;s foreign relations.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It will come as no surprise if I say that we on these benches will certainly support the motion moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member whether he is opposed to the policy or to the application of the policy&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>There are two aspects. The Minister says that until such time as the Government can prove that this policy will provide and answer to our problem of relations between peoples, our position in the world will not improve. Up to now the Government has not furnished that proof. Has proof been furnished with regard to the Coloureds and with regard to the urban Blacks&#x003F; Is the proof in the small pieces of land available to the homelands&#x003F; Therefore that proof has not yet been furnished and even in the application of that policy, there are many points of friction which provide the enemies of South Africa with ammunition with which they can shoot down that policy so that our position in the world is not made any easier. The Minister made this admission himself.</p>

<p><span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_0643"/>&#x2020;We support the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and reject the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Vasco. [Interjections.] We in this House should not underestimate the seriousness of South Africa&#x2019;s position in the international scene. I do not say that we are completely isolated, but if one takes two statements, not only the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, but also the statement of the hon. the Minister of Defence made on 31 December 1976, then one will realize that, as far as foreign policy relates to defence policy&#x2014;the strategic defence of South Africa&#x2014;foreign policy has collapsed. We are today in a completely vulnerable position as far as international aggression is concerned. The hon. the Minister of Defence said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can do nothing about the demands made on us by the weak concession-politics of Washington and Moscow.</block>

<p>He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Perhaps we have tried too hard to assure the West of our support. Perhaps we should weigh being less obviously available.</block>

<p>Has the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs tried too hard to assure the West of our support&#x003F; To whom was the hon. the Minister of Defence referring when he said: &#x201C;Perhaps we in South Africa have tried too hard to assure the West of our support&#x201D;&#x003F; Can he suggest who it is&#x003F; Has he and his department been trying too hard&#x003F; Has the hon. the Prime Minister been trying too hard&#x003F; Has the hon. the shadow-Prime Minister or the hon. shadow-Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon. the Minister of the Interior and of Information, perhaps been trying too hard to persuade the West of our support&#x003F; This is a remarkable statement and it becomes more remarkable when one thinks of the very warm and apparently cordial discussions which have taken place between the hon. the Prime Minister and the former Secretary of State of the United States, Dr. Kissinger, in Bavaria, Z&#x00FC;rich and Pretoria. There were warm intimate discussions on the problem of Rhodesia, but nevertheless&#x2014;seen in a regional context&#x2014;also the problems of Southern Africa. Yet the hon. the Minister of Defence now says that South Africa perhaps has tried too hard. I would like the hon. the Minister to explain to this House to whom the hon. the Minister of Defence was referring, and whether South Africa has in fact tried too hard to assure the West of its support.</p>

<p>What has happened&#x003F; Let us just have a look at what the hon. the Prime Minister could say in this House as recently as 21 April of last year. When dealing with the question of Western attitudes to South Africa he said that there were problems, and then added (Hansard, col. 5135)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, we know that the official attitude of Western countries is changing, and if I read the signs of the times correctly, it will change to an ever-increasing extent.</block>

<p>Can the hon. the Minister tell us if there has been a change, and if so, has it been a change for the better or a change for the worse&#x003F; I ask this, because now the Prime Minister says that even in the face of a communist onslaught, we in South Africa are going to have to stand alone. On 22 April last year the Prime Minister also dealt with the d&#x00E9;tente policy, because there were formal missions to Africa in previous years. I quote from last year&#x2019;s Hansard, at col. 5203&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of that the attempt, the initiative, is not dead at all, but definitely alive still. In spite of the fact that the graph was forced downwards in places, the tendency is still an upward one.</block>

<p>Is the tendency of our relationship with Africa still an upward one&#x003F; Can the hon. the Minister tell us whether we are developing more intimate relationships with African nations or not&#x003F; When one looks at the total impact of this, it is clear that South Africa has become tragically isolated not only from Africa, but also from the Western World.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister, because it is tremendously important when it comes to the question of defence. On 13 September the hon. the Prime Minister used these words at a big NP rally in Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sonder die steun van Amerika sal die Weste, en dus ook Suid-Afrika, nie die aanslae van die kommunisme kan afweer nie.</block>

<p><span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_0644"/>*The hon. the Prime Minister says that South Africa will not be able to ward off the onslaughts of the communists without the support of America. However, three months later he said that if there should indeed be an onslaught on South Africa, the country cannot rely on any country in the West. I should like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister or the hon. the Minister of Defence how this statement is to be reconciled with his statement 2&#x00BD; months later, that we stand alone. Listen to what the hon. the Prime Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hoewel Amerika nie van sekere aspekte van Suid-Afrika se beleid hou nie, is hy steeds in sy wese anti-kommunisties. As dit nie so was nie, sou die toekoms van Europa en van die hele Weste duister wees. As anti-kommunisties en as leier van die Weste is Amerika dus ook die leier van Suid-Afrika.</block>

<p>Is this still the Government&#x2019;s approach, or is this a new approach of surrender that we want nothing to do with the West and Africa and that we are following our own course, even though we cannot ward off the onslaughts of the communists&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think that it is appropriate to look at certain areas relevant to our foreign policy which we cannot ignore and to try and diagnose what has taken place in each of them. There are three with which I want to deal very briefly. One is the communist block. We in these benches believe that when it comes to communist intervention in Southern Africa&#x2014;represented primarily in the form of Russian Soviet imperialism, because that is the way in which it has manifested itself during recent times&#x2014;we in South Africa can do nothing by way of changing our policy to appease Soviet imperialism. There is nothing we can do to appease the demands of Soviet imperialism in Southern Africa, but there is a difference between not appeasing and helping. I believe that the way in which we are conducting our policies inside South Africa has caused apartheid to become the greatest ally of Soviet imperialism in Africa. I can imagine the little old men of the Kremlin going down on their knees every night and saying: &#x201C;Thank Lenin for the NP Government and the policy of apartheid in South Africa.&#x201D; It is not only embarrassing the West in its attempts to try to counter Soviet imperialism, but within South Africa we are creating, with the policies the Government is applying, the seed beds for the nurturing of Marxist revolutionary activity.</p>

<p>When one comes to the African States there is quite understandably a significant degree of disappointment that there has not yet been a settlement in Rhodesia, and to the extent that South Africa is seen as part of that totality, there is a disappointment. I want to make it quite clear that in spite of that I do not believe that there are specific recriminations against South Africa or against the hon. the Prime Minister for his efforts in this regard. I believe that there is a high regard for the efforts the hon. the Prime Minister had made in relation to encouraging Rhodesia to accept the concept of majority rule. There was a very high regard last year for the contribution the hon. the Prime Minister made to the release of terrorist leaders from detention so that they could participate in discussions elsewhere in Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister stated what he could and what he could not do in relation to Rhodesia, and all the evidence I have indicates that there is acceptance&#x2014;whether they agree with it or not&#x2014;of the good faith in which the hon. the Prime Minister of South Africa has acted. Nevertheless, we are caught up in the slipstream of disappointment over the fact that there has not yet been a satisfactory settlement.</p>

<p>A second reason why Africa has become cooler towards us is that despite the efforts of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and his secretary there is a real disillusionment. The year 1974/75 was the heyday of expectation. There was Pik Botha&#x2019;s speech, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech in the Senate, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech at Nigel&#x2014; &#x201C;Give us six months&#x201D;&#x2014;and the answering echo by President Kaunda: &#x201C;These are the words of reason for which Africa has been waiting.&#x201D; There was a tremendous expectancy and it is the abject failure of the Government to implement the promises in a meaningful way that has created an utter disillusionment amongst the Black leaders of Africa. I wonder how they would have reacted had they listened in to the way in which hon. Ministers answered questions as to how they had got rid of discrimination in their own departments. These hon. Ministers <span class="col_1255-1256" refersTo="page_0645"/>should have stood up and proudly told us what they had done in this regard, but every one of them ran away and ducked the issue. This Government must come out boldly on this issue; it must not make changes away from discrimination merely under the pressure of the mobs or under pressure of international forces. This Government must take the initiative; they must announce that they are proud to get rid of race discrimination; they should not do it ungraciously, secretively and surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we should not underestimate the fact that Black Africans, whether we like it or not, see in the application of the policy of apartheid on a day-to-day basis gross offences against the dignity of Black people and, because they are also Black people, gross offences against their dignity as citizens. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout gave us various examples of things which are offensive to Black people in South Africa and so also to Black people elsewhere. [Interjections.] We can say that they are wrong, that they are over-reacting to the situation, but however irrational that behaviour might seem to us, let us not underestimate the intensity of the feeling there is every time a Black man is crudely humiliated as a result of the application of Government policies in South Africa. Until we in South Africa and that Government can treat Black Africans in South Africa with the same amount of dignity as we willingly treat White Europeans in this part of Africa, we shall not be able to come to terms with the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>Obviously, the worst and most dramatic set-back in our foreign policy has been in relation to the West. Only a short while ago the hon. the Prime Minister was talking about the West being our leader. The hon. the Minister was working hard at improving relationships with the United States of America. He has himself admitted that it was &#x201C;die toepassing van die beleid&#x201D; which gave the rest of the world ammunition. I do not believe that the final reason why the Western world has moved away from us is the detailed &#x201C;toepassing van hierdie beleid&#x201D;. It is because, in the attempts of the West either to defeat, neutralize or contain Russian imperialism, we have become an acute embarrassment to them in Africa. For this reason they want nothing to do with us. One can read speeches by people like Sen. Dick Clark and others on this matter. These are sympathetic, understanding speeches about our position, but they nevertheless say they can have nothing to do with us.</p>

<p>Finally, we have lost in the eyes of the West one key factor which we possessed before, and that is that amidst all the turmoil in Africa we appeared in South Africa to offer a haven of stability. Stability was tremendously important. I have no time to read it, but the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs will recall that in his speech in Durban he said that internal stability has a direct impact on foreign relations and a lack of internal stability has an adverse effect on foreign relations. We lost this not just as a result of the unrest situation, not just because of the shooting, but as a result of the Government&#x2019;s response. They realize that one can use weapons, the police and even armies to suppress unrest in South Africa, but there will be no basic stability in South Africa until we can resolve the political equation and until Black and Brown and White people can sit down together and can come to some kind of accord. Therefore no solution which is imposed by this White House on the Black people of South Africa is going to improve our relationships. The only thing that will improve our relationships and the only thing that will enable us to sell South Africa on our terms to the Western World is if we do have a Turnhalle type of conference, a meeting of the leaders of the various communities and if, out of that meeting, there is a common voice, a South African voice which says: &#x201C;We South Africans, whatever colour we may be, are united on the basic dispensation for our political future.&#x201D; Until the Government can produce an agreement between Blacks and Whites and Browns, we are going to be in a position where even in the face of a communist onslaught, as the hon. the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apparently the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout have now reached consensus, on behalf of two parties, on one point, viz. foreign affairs. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that Marxist imperialism, wherever there is a popular movement, ranges itself on the side of such <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0646"/>popular movement and that it then provides that movement with arms.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it does in fact find such a popular movement. However, I want to ask the hon. member whether or not Swapo is a popular movement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, the communists see it as a popular movement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>In any case, the MPLA is likewise a popular movement. Has no one gone into the history of Swapo and the history of the MPLA to establish for how long prior to their becoming a movement they had been indoctrinated and influenced by Russian imperialist communism&#x003F;</p>

<p>This motion mainly concerns the question as to why the outside world is against us. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout was furnished with a clear reply by the hon. the Prime Minister during the no-confidence debate when the Prime Minister said they were demanding certain things from us which we were not prepared to concede. He referred to the UNO, which demanded, on behalf of South West Africa, that South Africa should have discussions with Swapo under the auspices of the UNO. That was the demand that was made. They demanded that South Africa should bring pressure to bear upon and apply sanctions to Rhodesia. That was a second demand that was made, and the third demand is the one we have now had from hon. members, i.e. that a majority government should be established in this country. The amendment which we moved is in complete agreement with the Charter of the UNO, and I quote from Chapter 1, article 1(2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.</block>

<p>Where do we get the idea from that one has to advocate violence and even more violence to promote a hierarchy&#x003F; The hon. member says that if we do not oust this Government in time and take the lead towards the establishment of a new corporate Republic, the entire White civilization will be destroyed. That is the fear that is being expressed. The only way they suggest this fear can be overcome, is that we should try to convince the Western nations. This was the complaint of the hon. member for Sea Point throughout. We should convince the Western nations! Not one of us who has made a study of the tendencies of world conflict will deny that the ultimate goal of communism, as interpreted by the Marxist hierarchy of the Kremlin, is world domination. This was clearly indicated by events over the past 20 years. This recipe is quite clear, particularly in Africa where, after colonization, a desire for freedom manifested itself when the Black peoples suddenly realized that freedom was within their reach and resorted to imperialist communism. However, I want to concentrate of the driving force behind this liberation, the driving force which is being exploited to establish an ideology of world domination.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the Marxist tyranny of Moscow, because we know the history of Russia. We know their attempts to liberate themselves from the Czarist control and the way in which the communists gained control over a number of States and established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That was done under the guise of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout likes to call a principle of freedom. However, I am not concerned with the slogans or methods that were used. What is important to me&#x2014;and I am convinced that the hon. the Prime Minister also thought of this&#x2014;is the way in which those States retained their powers and which methods are being applied to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination. For that reason I also want to tell the world what the position is in Russia itself. What is the position of religion, which should be the driving force behind any people and nation&#x003F; We find that in Russia the Bible is replaced by the State and the party, and that the KGB constantly keeps a watchful eye on anyone wishing to practise religion. People are constantly watched to see whether they do not say anything against the State. What has become of the individual freedom of the people of Russia&#x003F; I want to quote a piece from a book written on the KGB by John Barron. The following is stated there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_0647"/>Manifestly, to compel 246 million people to suffer such an existence, while depriving them of liberty and hope of attaining it, is a momentous task. The KGB continues to accomplish it in large part because the party has placed at its disposal multiple layers of controls that envelop the individual throughout his life. The daily administration of many of the controls is left to the militia or to special regulatory bureaux; but each constitutes a lever the KGB can pull to bend or break the individual in the interest of the Party. In the workings of these controls one can see the routine of repression and the sophisticated mechanisms of modern tyranny.</block>

<p>These are the people, this is the hierarchy, the tyranny, which not only control Russia itself, but also its satellite states. What has become of family life in Russia&#x003F; What has become of the freedom of movement in Russia&#x003F; What has become of the half million Jews who want to emigrate&#x003F; Only a few are afforded the opportunity to emigrate. What have become of those who, according to the State, have transgressed&#x003F; Are the camps in Siberia full or are they not full&#x003F; There are even mental institutions to which people who have for some reason or other, been declared mentally ill, are committed without their ever being able to get out again.</p>

<p>What about their diplomatic service&#x003F; It is said that more than 40% of their foreign diplomats are active agents of the KGB. It is also known that relatively speaking Russia has twice as many foreign diplomats than any other country. In this way these tyrants, this Kremlin power, retains control over its own 260 million people. It also projects that control over its satellites. One asks oneself: Why is Russia specifically interested in countries such as Mozambique, Angola and Somalia&#x003F; Is it not part of their pattern of world domination to take over these strategic places&#x003F; What is their first request after having taken over such a country&#x003F; The first they ask for is bases. They do not supply food; they supply guns and ammunition and immediately ask for a basis, and for that reason the hon. the Prime Minister was quite right when he said that a difficult time lies ahead, because South Africa, with its mineral wealth and its strategic situation, is one of the goals of this Kremlin hierarchy.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I believe sincerely that Africa is going to be the Vietnam of Russia. Africa is going to be the Vietnam of the Kremlin because they do not know Africa nationalism and, in the second place, because they are unable to provide these oppressed people with food since they do not have sufficient food for their own people. I think if ever there was a cowardly country, it is Russia with its Kremlin hierarchy which has not fought one single battle itself. They use the Cubans and any other nation, because they cannot risk using their own people in that struggle, because that will cause their own downfall.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening with interest to the contribution of the hon. member for Brentwood. What he said about Russia and the communist threat, one can, of course accept at once. One may differ from him as regards some minor point, but on the whole one has to concede that the dangers which he described so well, do exist. I do not really have any objection to what he said; my objection is that he did not say it in a way which will help us to solve the problems we are experiencing in our foreign relations. The motion before us, as well as the amendment to the motion which I shall discuss later on, deals with the present state of our foreign relations. To attack the Russians, is of no avail to us. It is of no avail to us to criticize our opponents only. If we want to solve our own problems, we should actually take a look at what is going on in our own midst. We should determine where the shortcomings are in our own policy. We cannot solve problems simply by reproaching the opponents or enemies of South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I think the motion moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout serves a very valuable purpose. It serves a very valuable purpose in the sense that it is time we in this House had a good, hard look at the state of our foreign policy and made up our minds exactly where we are and where we are going from here. It is very necessary for a number of reasons. There has clearly been a massive change in the dimensions, nature and shape of foreign relations between South Africa and the rest of the world. This is clear to everybody; everybody knows that these <span class="col_1261-1262" refersTo="page_0648"/>changes have taken place, but there has been no clear indication from the Government as yet as to what our new policies are and how we have adapted to meet these very significant and clear changes that have taken place. Indeed, the opposite has taken place, because far from redrawing, redefining, reclarifying our foreign policy, we have had over recent months a series of statements which have only made confusion worse.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point has produced a number of quotations which I have here as well and which I shall not repeat. They show only too clearly that we do not know which way we are going. We appear to be running off in one direction, we appear to acknowledge the leadership of the West, we say they are our leaders, we rely upon them to see us through these difficult times and a month or two later we repudiate them and say they can do us no good; we stand alone and we will face the onslaught by ourselves. What is this all about&#x003F; It is all words. Let us at least in our foreign relations be realistic. It is no good deceiving ourselves when we deal with something as important to our existence, to our survival, as foreign affairs. There are other fields, maybe, in which propaganda, even self-deceptions, can be helpful in sustaining morals. However, when one deals with foreign affairs, one is dealing with a matter which is not amenable to that kind of treatment. In dealing with foreign affairs one must get down to the realities of the situation. That is my objection to the approach of the hon. member for Brentwood, because while he described certain aspects of events in Africa, he did not get down to true cases. What are we going to do about it&#x003F; This question is what the debate is about and not about what is happening.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan should have a little more patience; we shall come to it. But before one can come to the remedies, one must define the weaknesses.</p>

<p>We discovered in the no-confidence debate, as I said, that there is no clear theme which appears to guide our foreign policy. Let us go back to realities. What are they&#x003F; We are threatened with a breakdown, or at least a steady deterioration, in our relations with Africa. We see no hopeful signs, no positive, and certainly no public signs, of a continuation of that progress which used to go under the name of d&#x00E9;tente. Undoubtedly, there must still be contacts. One finds that there are people who are still interested, occasionally throwing out some hope, throwing out a word and asking for a new approach. No doubt, as the hon. member for Vasco said, trade is still going on. These things are happening. But we are looking for something much more positive to reverse the disastrous trend of events which has been quite plain and obvious in recent months. Who are these African States&#x003F; By and large these African States are individually impotent. They are economically weak and individually impotent. They are not by themselves able to muster the kind of strength which can provide a real threat to South Africa. We have recently read with interest and with some pride the story of what happened in Angola, the achievements of a very small body of South African troops in quite a large African area. The picture painted&#x2014;and we are glad that at last the facts are coming through; we cannot think why they were concealed for so long&#x2014;of what happened in Angola shows in effect that South Africa has nothing to fear by means of conventional warfare against any of the countries of Africa. We are able to face this with confidence. However, what we cannot face with confidence, is the political effects when these countries act in concert.</p>

<p>Now, through the OAU, these countries are sometimes able to concert their voices to bring pressures to bear on world councils, to bring pressures to bear on the West, which lead the West to take action, to adopt attitudes, to perform their diplomatic tasks, in a manner which is highly inconvenient or highly detrimental to the interests of South Africa. Why is this, Sir&#x003F; It is possible to identify those things which enable the African States to concert their attitude, to agree to protest, to agree to convince and to influence the West in its attitude towards South Africa. We know what these things are, Sir. They have a great deal to do with our domestic policies. They have to do with the things which have been spoken of in this House today. They have to deal, very often, with the implementation of the policy. Even where the policy can be justified, the manner of implementing it sometimes is so disastrous in its <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_0649"/>consequences that whatever gains we have made, are wiped out overnight by these clumsy efforts which occur with monotonous regularity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to anybody who is deeply concerned about the interests of South Africa, it is most discouraging, it is most disheartening, it fills one with a mood of gloom and impending disaster that, in the difficult situation in which we find ourselves in foreign relations, these things should be done with so little regard for South Africa&#x2019;s true interests. What is the attitude of the West to us&#x003F; Without wishing to be personal, I have managed to maintain contact myself over many years, and I do have access to people who, in the course of years, now occupy senior places in America and in Europe, and I try to maintain contact with them. I believe, Sir, that when they speak on a private and informal basis, they tend to speak the truth. These people do not wish the downfall of South Africa. These people realize the strategic importance of South Africa. These people realize that their interests are linked with those of South Africa. It is entirely wrong to say, as hon. members on that side of the House frequently say, that all they want for us is our downfall, that they want nothing less than Black majority rule for South Africa. They are not asking for these things. I believe these arguments are put, or the extremists are quoted, merely in order to defend this Government&#x2019;s reluctance to make any reasonable changes at all. I believe that the West&#x2014;and I am now speaking of the responsible West&#x2014;desires things for South Africa which would surprise us if we knew how well disposed they were. These people do not want to see South Africa brought to a position of chaos. They do not want to see South Africa in the hands of an irresponsible Government. Why is it the habit so often on that side of the House to quote the irresponsibles, to quote the extremists, as indicative of what the West really wants&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, two or three months ago I happened to speak to a person who has held a very high position in the Council of Europe and in other important inter-European organizations. This man reproached me for our failure to state a case in the Council of Europe. He believes that there is much more goodwill in those councils than we realize, much more of a realistic appreciation of the importance of South Africa to the West. However, he said this to me: &#x201C;You know who is stating the case about Southern Africa there&#x003F; Constantly the communist countries. Constantly the socialist countries are taking the opportunity in these councils to attack South Africa, to blacken your name, to attribute wrong motives, to speak ill of you, and to lead resolutions and motions to your great detriment. Where are you&#x003F; Why do you not do something&#x003F; Send me something. Let me speak on your behalf.&#x201D; Actually, on one occasion, without help from us, he said that he had made up his own case and had managed to defeat a motion against South Africa asking for the cutting of trade links with South Africa in the Council of Europe.</p>

<p>I am saying this not to reproach anybody; I am saying merely that it is wrong to accuse the responsible West, the people who know what is really going on, the people who understand the significance of South Africa, of only wanting us to write off responsible government in this country, to yield to uncivilized majorities and all such statements that get made from time to time. It is not so. What they are looking for from us, is that we should create a climate here, a situation here so that Black people and Brown people will see in South Africa a reasonable opportunity for a good life within a just society. They do not put it much higher than that; this is what they want to see. They will look to the people of Africa, the people of South Africa and their reactions to what we do, as their guide-line. If we can keep our own people in South Africa happy, if we can keep them prosperous and moving forward with reasonable expectations for the future, they will not be saying and doing things which lead the rest of Black Africa to stand up as their champions. The situation will no longer be created where the Russians and communists can come into Africa and find here a very fertile field in which they can put forward their imperialistic designs. They do not come here because they care about apartheid, they do not come here because they care about South Africa in particular and about other nations, but they come to this subcontinent because they can see trouble brewing here and trouble is to their advantage. The West is asking us to create a situation where Russian imperialism cannot find an easy batting wicket, where they cannot come here and score <span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0650"/>so many runs against the West. They say: &#x201C;Please help us create a situation.&#x201D; This is what Western pressure is about and it is no good talking about the extremists and what they ask. Let us talk and think about what responsible opinion is demanding of us.</p>

<p>It is all very well to refer to the UNO where invariably, * monotonously, year after year, resolutions are passed against us by majority. If we can gain the support and understanding of the West&#x2014;I speak of the North Americans and the Europeans&#x2014;then we can laugh at these resolutions at the UNO. However, the Western countries despair when we comport ourselves in such a way in this country that they, the responsible West, the North Americans and the Europeans, no longer find it possible to defend us, no longer find it possible to object to and resist the resolutions of our opponents and enemies and no longer find it possible to exercise influence in Africa on people to seek d&#x00E9;tente or understanding with us or peaceful solutions.</p>

<p>That is what we feel needs to be clarified and put right in our foreign relations. That is the cause of the motion which we have before us today. We have seen before us a foreign policy which on the surface anyway&#x2014;we would be happy to receive assurances to the contrary from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;looks as though it has descended to negativism, to immobilism and, in fact, to little more than passive spectatorship. This is how it looks and I believe the time has come to restate our foreign policy, to restate our objectives, to tell South Africa, in the first place, and then to tell the world where we are really going to be done with this confusion, this uncertainty and the dismal picture of constant retrogression in our foreign relations.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>In the short time that I have at my disposal, I want to focus entirely on the relationship between South Africa and the United States. The first point that I simply want to underline is the importance of the relationship in terms of the very power that the United States does have in the world and the acknowledgement by the hon. the Prime Minister, as referred to by the hon. member for Sea Point earlier in the debate, as to our own readiness to see the United States as being the leader of the West and therefore our leader as well. Dr. Kissinger&#x2019;s now famous Lusaka speech marked an obvious change in United States policy towards South Africa. In that speech, which was made on 27 April 1976 in Lusaka, he said a number of important things, which I think this House ought to be aware of. We must bear in mind the timing of this speech. His trip was obviously designed to repair the somewhat tattered position of the United States in South Africa after the debacle in Angola. From the fall of the Portuguese territories came a new wave of Black insurgency, which held a direct threat to Rhodesia in the first instance and, indeed, for South Africa as well. The relentless process was armed and exploited by the Soviet Union. While they were doing that it seemed that the United States was sitting back and achieving nothing. That is why the then Secretary of State delivered his ringing speech in Lusaka on 27 April last year. He warned against a number of things. He firstly warned the Rhodesian Government to negotiate for a majority rule settlement within two years and that there was a very considerable prospect of United States assistance if that was a possibility but that if there was not, they could not look to the United States for assistance. With regard to South Africa, Dr. Kissinger urged for a definite timetable&#x2014;to use his exact phrase&#x2014;&#x201C;to end the long and outlawed occupation of Namibia&#x201D;. He promised that the United States would &#x201C;exercise all her efforts&#x201D; to persuade South Africa peacefully to end apartheid and to move towards &#x201C;equality of opportunity and basic human rights&#x201D;. I believe that this is a phrase which has not always registered as strongly as it ought to have.</p>

<p>Many people living in South Africa immediately assume that the official policy of the United States is either so anti-communistic that it will come to the aid of South Africa no matter what, or on the other hand, so anti-South Africa that no matter what we attempt to do in this country, we <span class="col_1267-1268" refersTo="page_0651"/>shall receive no support at all. I believe that both these positions are palpably untrue. I believe that Dr. Kissinger&#x2019;s stress on equal opportunity, minority rights and basic human rights, is the major thrust of American policy, if one is to read and understand the speeches that have been made both before Mr. Carter became President and subsequent to that time. Dr. Kissinger made many other speeches during his shuttle diplomacy, but I believe that he was consistent in what he was saying there, that in terms of basic fundamental human rights, the United States had a certain responsibility in Southern Africa. I was in Boston when Senator Clark made his speech to the African Studies Association. It was a very interesting speech. The timing was also very important because it came one day after the American election. Mr. Carter was the President and a Democratic regime was coming into power. Amongst other things, Senator Clark said at that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Above all, we must make it abundantly clear that our global interests in frustrating Soviet power do not extend to supporting oppressive minorities in a race war in Southern Africa.</block>

<p>He then went on to list about nine points which he believed should make up the policy of the United States towards South Africa, and no one can deny that there is a fundamental shift, beginning in the Lusaka speech made by the then Secretary of State, until the present situation where we find these words by the very influential Senator Clark of the sub-committee on Africa. We then had the appointment of Congressman Andrew Young as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Already there has been a great deal of controversy both in his own country and in the Press of our country about Mr. Young. It has been my privilege to have known Ambassador Young for about 10 years. I knew him first when he was a minister of the church in the United States, as a civil rights leader, and almost as a kind of personal assistant to Martin Luther King. I knew him when he was in Europe on conferences on racism, I have known him in this country as a visiting congressman, I have spoken to him on many occasions in the United States both prior and subsequent to the election, and there is no question that if anyone embodies the basic persistent theme of Pres. Carter&#x2019;s own words regarding foreign policy, it is Andrew Young. That is his basic commitment to human rights within his own country and, therefore, as an integral part of the United States&#x2019; policy, in relation to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Ambassador Young is that I do not think I have talked to another Black American&#x2014;particularly to one with such possible influence&#x2014;who has a better understanding of the problem of minority groups in South Africa. He speaks out of his own experience, because he is part of a minority group in his own country. That does not mean to say that I agree with every word he says, or that South Africa ought to, or that what he says is always absolutely true, right and good policy. It is, however, a good thing to remember, before we castigate Ambassador Young and before we criticize everything he does and says, that in the first place he acknowledges personally, privately and publicly that because he is Black it does not follow that he knows and understands Africa. He is willing to learn, to listen and to talk and I think we should take advantage of that. In the second place, he is a member of a minority group within his own country and, therefore, he has a deep sympathy for the problem of the minority groups in South Africa as they seek to find their way through to a new dimension.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my time is very limited, but I want to make two more points. In the first place there are enormous pressures on decision-makers in the United States; there are very strong anti-South African lobbies. I have met them and many hon. members in this House have probably met them and know who they are. That lobby is growing in strength; there is no question about it that there are more and strong groups urging very radical action by the United States in relation to Southern Africa. Coupled with that is the very real dilemma which faces the United States as it seeks to forge out a new foreign policy in relation to Africa and in particular to Southern Africa. The dilemma is that Africa has a very strong view in relation to Southern Africa and that Soviet Russia is now beginning to emerge&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to it earlier on&#x2014;as the champion of the oppressed, and the United States simply cannot sit back. <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_0652"/>It does not want to become involved in the war; it does not want to arm guerrillas and terrorists, but at the same time it wants to have some influence in Southern Africa to bring about what they describe as peaceful change. I believe that every time we take an action which suggests to the outside world that we will not move away from our basic policy of apartheid or separate development, we make the task of the United Stated that much more difficult. Let me just mention three examples, one of which is the schools and which has already been mentioned. That does not stop here in South Africa; it reverberates right through the world, because the Catholic community is a world-wide body and therefore it is newsworthy. Secondly, when one moves people in large numbers, even though one does it, as it were, with kid gloves and does not use bulldozers, that also goes right around the world and is a negative factor in our whole foreign policy. Lastly, when one bans 27 people who were working amongst Black trade unions, one has every trade union movement throughout the whole world beginning to sit up and say: &#x201C;We must take firmer action against South Africa.&#x201D; So often the policy of the Government makes the job of that hon. Minister so difficult that I urge that we think carefully about our role, particularly <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the United States of America.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinelands spoke in defence of Mr. Andrew Young. As one parson to another, I do not want to comment on that, but I hope that Mr. Young will realize that he is not representing a minority group at the United Nations, but a country, the leading country in the Western world. The hon. member for Von Brandis remarked that the West would not like to see the downfall of South Africa. I would agree with him there. However, he said that it was our policy that made it extremely difficult for the Western world to support us. It is not only our policies. I believe it is also the impression of what our policies are really all about that is created in the outside world that makes it difficult for the West to support us.</p>

<p>*The hon. members of the Opposition are also at fault in this regard, because it is remarkable how, in recent times, members on that side of the House, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular, have deliberately used the concept of apartheid when referring to the policy of the Government. They do this because they know that, to the audience they are addressing outside this House, the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has become a caricature of the actual policy of the Government. Over the years, the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has wrongly begun to assume a negative meaning, a meaning of absolute separation and blatant discrimination merely on the basis of colour. However, this is a false representation of our policy, because our policy is not a policy of colour; it is an ethnic policy. Where apartheid exclusively concerns discrimination and separation on the basis of colour, apartheid is not the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When discussing foreign relations, we on this side of the House do not deny that our domestic policy exerts a great influence upon our foreign relations. We do not deny it, but we object when the Opposition wants to allege that everything is merely the result of the colour policy of this side of the House. It is not that straightforward or simple. As I pointed out, the fact is that we are moving away from discrimination on grounds of colour. One can argue about the question of whether the rate at which this is being done is fast enough, but that it is being done and that it will continue to be done far more quickly and in a wider sphere, cannot be questioned. This is our policy, and it is essential for our continued existence. The struggle in which we find ourselves in South Africa today, is a struggle for the preservation of a free Christian civilization against the Marxist and communist powers of enslavement; it is this polarization which we must fear, and this polarization does not take any account of colour. Therefore, our allies in this struggle in Southern Africa will be Coloureds, Blacks and Indians. Therefore, in the first place, we should not judge ourselves according to the criteria which the world prescribes to us, no matter how sound their intentions may be. We must judge ourselves according to what, in our situation, is reasonable, fair and humanitarian towards our people and our potential allies. In our honest search for solutions to the problems confronting us, we shall have to be led by our own beliefs and principles and not by the dictations from outside. The outside world may advise us, encourage us and even urge us to make peaceful changes in our internal relations policy, but the outside world cannot demand that we destroy ourselves in the process. Of course, it would be naive and irresponsible of me not to say that we must take into consideration foreign attitude towards South Africa. However, we must realize that in the present international climate, South Africa will hardly be able to comply with the demands made on us. We should like to take our rightful place in the array of nations and in the community of nations, but this is being made increasingly difficult for us. It is like taking part in a race where the finishing line is moved further and further away. We are trying to play according to the rules of the game, but the rules are continually being changed while the game is on. The latest demand which is being made, is that of majority rule.</p>

<p>Of course, we on this side of the House can say that majority rule is our policy too. However, the PRP cannot say this. If I understood him correctly, the hon. member for Florida indicated yesterday that the policy of that party ultimately amounts to a disguised White minority dictatorship. However, we on this side of the House can say that our policy involves majority rule, but not majority rule as is found in Angola, Mozambique or elsewhere in Africa. We mean majority rule where the majority of the people have a say in the weal and woe and the future of that people, in a democratic way. It is ironic that many countries in the world which protest so much against the so-called lack of freedoms and the injustice in South Africa, are remarkably silent about the large majority of countries where military dictators or one-party States have no respect for freedom of speech, protection of property, for free elections or other basic human rights. A very authoritative American institution, <i>Freedom House,</i> which is continually involved in a world-wide investigation concerning the degree of political and human rights in the world, indicated in its latest publication&#x2014;that of January /February 1977, entitled &#x201C;The Comparative Survey of Freedom No. 7&#x201D;&#x2014;that there are only two countries in Africa, namely Gambia and Botswana, where the inhabitants have a greater degree of political freedom and right than in South Africa. When considering the political rights enjoyed by inhabitants of all the countries of the world, we find that the inhabitants of 62% of those countries enjoy less political rights than all the inhabitants in South Africa. But that is not all.</p>

<p>South Africa is one of the 19 countries in the world in which the degree of freedom is increasing. We are one of the 19 countries &#x201C;where there is a positive outlook for freedom&#x201D;, as they put it. This has been said by a liberal but objective institution like Freedom <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0654"/>House! One would like to see a greater degree of objectivity prevailing on the side of the Opposition, too, concerning the situation in South Africa and the complexity of it. If one listens to them, one gains the impression that there is no freedom at all in South Africa. One is forever hearing the refrain, as we heard once again from the hon. member for Sea Point this morning, that we should merely undo everything and have a Turnhalle conference in South Africa. This will supposedly solve all our problems.</p>

<p>The circumstances of South Africa and South West Africa differ immensely. Unfortunately I do not have time to go into this. I just want to say in conclusion that the Turnhalle conference came into being as an instrument for obtaining consensus between the various population groups. It was a consensus model. The Turnhalle conference was not an objective in itself. It was a means of bringing about consensus politics. In South Africa we do not need a conference like this, because we have other consulting machinery which has developed over the years and which apparently works well. Through that we practise our consensus politics. The independence of the Transkei is an excellent example of it. The Government believes in consensus politics and will continue to practise it in South Africa. Indeed, I am convinced that the social and political patterns of the future of South Africa will be determined by consensus politics to an increasing extent. This Government will seek consensus with all the population groups in South Africa in order to ensure a free Christian civilization for all its inhabitants.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the speech of the hon. member for Johannesburg West and in the course of my own speech I shall return to some of the points he made. For the time being, allow me just to express the hope that he will indeed, in the circles in which he has influence, and in line with his own way of thinking, be prepared to support some of the concrete proposals I want to make.</p>

<p>Firstly, I just want to comment on two points he made. He said that the struggle was between the preservation of a free Christian culture and communism. I want to say that in fact, the problem is how we can possibly condone the situation in which, for example, a White person in South Africa may choose a non-Christian or even a Christian of any cultural identity, be it Greek, Italian or whatever, as a partner in marriage, but not a fellow Christian who happens to belong to a different colour group because this is forbidden by legislation. In other words, to what extent can the hon. member for Johannesburg West say, in all honesty, that this, as it has been formulated here, is the point of conflict in South Africa&#x003F; Secondly, I want to refer to his concept of majority rule. In this regard, I should really like to ask the hon. member for Johannesburg West: If he says that it is the policy of the Government to implement majority rule, how, in all honesty, does he want to implement that principle, not in the case of the potential, possible independence of the homelands, but in respect of the Coloureds, the Indians and the urban Bantu&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. This motion comprises three elements: In the first place, the statement that a progressive deterioration has taken place in our foreign relations and international position; secondly, the statement that that deterioration is leading to a growing threat to South Africa; and thirdly, a demand that the Government take appropriate steps to bring about the changes necessary to deal with that situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that there are few thinking South Africans today who will deny that we are indeed isolated from the rest of the world to a far greater extent. If there was any doubt on this score, that doubt was removed by the New Year&#x2019;s message of the hon. the Prime Minister himself. In other words, I think we can speak without fear of contradiction when we say that our international position has certainly deteriorated seriously over the past year. I do not want to insinuate&#x2014;this is also my reply to the speech of the hon. member for Vasco&#x2014;that we have necessarily had a deteriorating situation in respect of our existing diplomatic representation in other countries or in respect of our trade relations. As a matter of fact, I think we have all noted with gratitude the growing commercial and technical co-operation between South Africa and Israel and between South Africa and Iran for example. But with regard to the international political scene, it is surely very clear that during the past 12 <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_0655"/>months a grave deterioration in our position has occurred. A few of the manifestations of this are the Angolan war and the reaction it aroused in respect of our participation in it, the reaction of the UNO and the Security Council, the statements which followed the change of government in the USA, the increasing enmity at the OAU and the growing estrangement between the states on our borders and ourselves.</p>

<p>In regard to Rhodesia, too, the situation is becoming more and more difficult for us. Whilst on the one hand we can say with pride, as has been done here, that South Africa&#x2019;s importance in Southern Africa is being acknowledged, and this goes for Rhodesia as well, it is also very clear that there is an increasing tendency to hold South Africa responsible for what is claimed to be an unyielding attitude on the part of the Rhodesian Government. The hon. the Prime Minister touched on this point and I think that the overall standpoint he put forward, that it is not our duty or responsibility to interfere in Rhodesia, will probably have the support of the vast majority of Whites in South Africa. But the pressure on South Africa in respect of Rhodesia will increase; it seems to me that we need have no illusions about that.</p>

<p>The internal disorder since June last year has further reinforced our isolation. It has caused growing enmity towards South Africa. Furthermore it has also, for the time being at least, put paid to the claim we made so often in the past, that South Africa was a model of internal political harmony and stability. It is equally certain that that deterioration in our international position has indeed given rise to a serious threat to us. This has been spelt out here, too, by what the hon. the Prime Minister himself said, namely that even if South Africa were to experience a terrorist onslaught today, with the direct and indirect support of the communist states, there would be little hope that South Africa could be supported in this regard by her friends in the West. The Western powers, our Western friends, cannot be viewed today as the champions or the patrons of the White man and White rule in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before lunch I concluded with the statement that not one of our Western friends&#x2014;and this is not a statement which any of us relishes&#x2014; can afford to act as patron or champion of the White man and White rule in South Africa. Not even the very valid reasons we can advance, viz. that we are a supplier of essential raw materials to the world, that we are also of military importance to the West and that we are a steadfast anti-communist bulwark in Southern Africa, help us one jot. There is a network of factors to which this isolation may be attributed. We would obviously be wrong to place the blame on a single aspect. We could, for example, put forward the argument that the West&#x2019;s unwillingness to take effective action against the expansionist imperialism of Soviet communism was one reason for that situation. However, it is not my task today to analyse all those factors. I think it is very clear to me and to all of us, to each and every thinking South African&#x2014; whether we like it or not&#x2014;that there is a direct relationship between our internal political policy and this attitude towards us adopted by the outside world. Everyone concedes this. There is no thinking South African who would dispute this statement today.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the connection is clear. Now, if we were to ask what it was exactly in our internal policy that elicited such objections, it is very clear that it was simply because we elevated race or colour to the status of the discriminatory element between persons in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is no good &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my friends opposite in all honesty that it is no good telling me that it is not a matter of discrimination, that the issue is not race and colour, but peoples or differentiation, that the issue is not apartheid but plural democracy and multi-nationalism. Mr. Speaker, we can say those things till the cows come home but it will make no difference. In other words, what people are interested in is not the shadow but the substance, and the substance is what I have indicated here to the hon. members. Mr. Speaker, surely it is very clear what our Western friends want of us and what our own secure and continued existence demands of us. Our own survival, in the first place, demands that we move away from race or colour as discriminatory elements between persons in South Africa.</p>

<p>This brings me to the third point in the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, viz. what must be done, what steps ought to be taken by the Government in regard to policy to help save this situation. Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that the first thing we must do is determine our priorities. In other words, we must first determine the fundamental minima, the unnegotiable prerequisite for the survival of the White man in South Africa. This is our first duty. Mr. Speaker, those priorities will probably concern two matters: in the first place, the question of the political rights of the White man and preventing the domination of the White man in the political sphere by the more numerous non-Whites. This is one of the prerequisites. The second prerequisite concerns the survival, in the biological and cultural sense, of the White man in South Africa. Those are the two fundamental prerequisites for the White man in South Africa. I believe that it will indeed be possible to reach consensus with the non-Whites on those two principles. I myself believe this. That which is not covered by those two fundamental principles, is irrelevant and ought to be eliminated. Consequently, I say that it is only through close consultation with the non-White himself that we shall be able to determine what it is in this dispensation that is unacceptable to him. Separate entrances, taxis, buses, restaurants, hotels and other separate amenities obviously have nothing to do with the fundamental requirements for our survival and these must be done away with. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In plain language, I want to suggest, firstly, that machinery be created for proper consultation between White and non-White on these principles. With due deference, I want to say that I do not think that the Cabinet Council will represent that machinery. In the second place, I want to suggest that precise stages, linked to a timetable, on how discrimination may be eliminated be published by this Government. In this regard, I want to suggest that the very appointment of an advisory multi-racial committee&#x2014;I do not even want to commit the Government, hence the word &#x201C;advisory&#x201D;&#x2014;which could advise the Government on how and at what pace discrimination might be eliminated, would immediately bring about a change in the whole international climate. In the third place, I want to ask that the Government should now give us an indication of a timetable, programme or plan for the future, as regards the improvement of the quality of life of our non-Whites. The Erika Theron report could provide us with a sound point of departure, as far as the Coloureds are concerned. When we have done all these things, I think we shall be able to make a start with a new diplomatic offensive in the world and in Africa too. With all deference, I want to express the hope that the concrete proposals I have made will, in fact, be given a positive hearing on the other side.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have a problem this afternoon because as hon. members know, my time is limited. However, I shall try to deal with all the important points that were raised in this debate, but if some of them have to stand <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_0657"/>over until the debate on the Foreign Affairs Vote, I hope hon. members will forgive me.</p>

<p>*Unfortunately we on this side cannot associate ourselves with the motion moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and we confidently support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Vasco. There are quite a number of the statements of fact made by hon. members opposite with which there is no fault to find. We agree with them and share their concern at the hostility of the outside world towards South Africa, as well as at many other matters which they touched upon. We have never tried to gloss over that hostile attitude of the outside world towards South Africa. The general tenor and spirit of the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is completely unacceptable to us on this side. The motion and speeches from the opposite side left one with the impression that South Africa was totally isolated and was the only country, or if not the only then one of very few countries in the world, which was experiencing difficult foreign problems and that the only solution was a complete change in the policy of the Government. This change has to be such that it would satisfy the outside world. Surely this is not the case. When one analyses South Africa&#x2019;s foreign relations, one must see and analyse them in the correct perspective. This, unfortunately, the hon. members opposite do not do. I concede that our foreign relations are not satisfactory. Inherent in that are dangers to our country. But is South Africa an exception to the rule&#x003F; What country&#x2019;s foreign relations are satisfactory today and do not have inherent dangers&#x003F; This cannot even be said of the powerful United States of America or of the West, seen in the light of the fact that Russia and its satellites are gaining ground in the armaments race with the West. There is virtually no part of the globe today in which States do not have to contend with external threats.</p>

<p>Let us consider Southern Africa. What is the position here&#x003F; Apparently the hon. members do not realize that in these dangerous times in which the entire world finds itself, neither South Africa, nor any of our adjacent neigbouring states, find it necessary to use military forces to defend our common borders. I do not in any way want to imply that the Government is underestimating our problems with the outside world, or that we should do nothing to avert the dangers. On the contrary. These are matters which are constantly receiving serious consideration from, and are a priority to, the Government. I myself, and my department, have devoted ourselves to this continuously during the past 13 years, and believe me, it was no easy task, for South Africa has become the scapegoat of almost the entire world. Why was this the case&#x003F; It was to a very large extent the result of developments in the international sphere, developments which were entirely beyond our control. I am thinking here of the power struggle between the Free World and Russia and its satellites, a struggle in which the strategic importance of Southern Africa resulted in its becoming a target. Secondly there was the liberation of Africa and the establishment of the OAU, which is used by the majority of its members as a pressure group against South Africa. Thirdly there was the Second World War, which led to a distortion and an emotional misuse of the concept of human rights. The international fashion in this sphere changed, as it were, and according to world opinion the earlier spectre of communism had to make way for racism and discrimination as the two most pernicious evils in the world. As is typical of the application of double standards, which one could also call selective morality, racism and discrimination on a large scale are ignored almost everywhere in the world, except in South Africa.</p>

<p>All these currents and developments made their influence felt on the UNO, which, in spite of its lofty ideals, rapidly degenerated into a purely international political organization in which power blocs and pressure groups tried to promote their own interests with their preponderance of votes. South Africa was simply not in a position to influence this historic process or to steer it in some or other direction. Nor would we have been able to do so, regardless of what our internal policy happened to be. Take our relations policy, for example, which is based on the internationally accepted principle of self-determination. However, we receive little or no credit for adjustments, for changes and adjustments in respect of the application of that policy, changes which flow from the policy. The best example of this Government&#x2019;s sincerity is the independence of Transkei. But it is not recognized by the <span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_0658"/>international community. Many Western powers make no secret of the fact that if a few African States would recognize Transkei, they would follow suit. What is involved here, therefore, is not the question of whether it is right or wrong, but of what is advantageous.</p>

<p>In spite of difficult circumstances the Government cannot be accused of not having done everything possible&#x2014;and of not still doing this&#x2014;to rectify and uphold South Africa&#x2019;s position in the world. Think, for example, of the dozens of penetrating talks conducted by our hon. Prime Minister, by myself, my colleagues, high-ranking officials such as Mr. Brand Fourie and others, with leaders of the West, the Middle East, the East and Africa over a period of many years. Think of the valuable work done by our foreign missions, the reciprocal visits by Parliamentarians, by official missions, other groups and individuals from the public and private sectors, from which a wide-ranging exchange of ideas has resulted. Nor have these contacts been in vain; otherwise there would not have been international recognition today that South Africa has a key role to play in Africa, and Mr. Cyrus Vance would not have said on 31 January that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think that South Africa can play a very important role in this area. We have been in constant communication with the South Africans and will continue to do so.</block>

<p>Apart from the international events since the Second World War, there are many other factors which influence our foreign relations. One of these is our internal policy. We do not argue the matter with hon. members on that side of the House. I myself, and others have stated repeatedly here and elsewhere that there is a direct relationship between internal policy and our position in the world. At the same time other factors may not be overlooked, and economic and strategic considerations may not be underestimated, as other speakers on this side of the House have already indicated. Of far greater importance to our foreign relations are two vital issues: i.e. South West Africa and Rhodesia. These two issues are at present of the utmost importance in the determination of South Africa&#x2019;s relations with a whole series of countries in the Free World, but particularly in respect of our relations with countries in Africa. These two factors weigh more heavily than all the other factors on which hon. members on that side of the House placed so much emphasis. I shall return to this again later.</p>

<p>Although South Africa&#x2019;s internal policy is not acceptable to the outside world and in spite of the deliberate attempts of our enemies to isolate South Africa in the diplomatic and every other possible sphere, South Africa&#x2019;s official representation, in all parts of the world, has expanded considerably during the past 13 years. This also applies to South Africa&#x2019;s foreign trade, including our trade with Africa. The hon. member for Vasco quoted illuminating statistics in this regard, and I want to add only one example, viz. our trade with Latin America, since the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to South America. Our total trade with Latin America has increased almost five-fold during the past 13 years; in other words, it increased by 500%, in spite of the fact that the Latin American countries do not approve of our internal policy.</p>

<p>As far as the Republic&#x2019;s diplomatic representation in Africa is concerned, I admit that the position is by no means satisfactory. Nevertheless a considerable number of contracts have been made in Africa in recent years, many on the very highest level. Many of those contacts are still being maintained today, in many cases with good results. Hon. members opposite want us to display more initiative. In this regard I want to remind them of the joint effort by South Africa and a number of Black States to find a peaceful solution to very difficult, probably the most difficult political problem in Southern Africa, viz. Rhodesia, and to encourage and promote a peaceful solution to that problem. This led to the bridge conference in 1975. This conference did not lead to a final solution, but as a result of that conference and what preceded it, firm foundations were laid for future talks, which did in fact take place. This also led directly to a far more active interest on the part of the United States and other Western Governments in the problems of Southern Africa and particularly in the Rhodesian question. It resulted in what I could call the Kissinger initiative, in which we and other African States also played an important part. The United States also succeeded <span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0659"/>in obtaining the co-operation of Great Britain and other important Western European States. The Kissinger initiative&#x2014;and I admit this&#x2014;did not bring a solution to the Rhodesian question either, but it was by no means a failure. On the contrary. It was highly successful in so far that it eliminated the crux of the Rhodesian question which is therefore no longer in dispute now. The acceptance by Mr. Ian Smith, his Government and the caucus of his party, of the principle of majority rule within two years, put an end to that important aspect of the Rhodesian question. In the meantime there was change of Government in the United States and the British Government continued the initiative. They came forward with new proposals in regard to interim arrangements until it was possible to proceed to the establishment of a majority government. I may mention in passing that Mr. Ivor Richard and his team were intent on getting certain important assurances. In the first place they wanted to give the Black Rhodesians a guarantee that Mr. Smith would not go back on the principle of majority rule&#x2014;in other words that there should be no reversal of the acceptance of majority rule within two years. In the second place, Mr. Richard tried to give the Whites in Rhodesia a guarantee that there would be a future for them in Rhodesia, and in the third place they wanted to try to ensure that an immediate halt was called to the terrorist war. No one in the world can find any fault with these three objectives, but, as we all know, Mr. Richard and his colleagues did not achieve their object and afterwards the situation deteriorated. Although a deadlock has been reached, we know&#x2014;in fact it is general knowledge&#x2014;that Great Britain and the U.S.A. are determined to continue their peace offensive in regard to Rhodesia. We, the South African Government, welcome this of course. Personally I remain convinced that the vast majority of Rhodesians, White and non-White, desire a peaceful solution to their problem.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In fact, two days ago Mr. Ian Smith informed us of his Government&#x2019;s determination to explore further avenues for a settlement. We naturally welcome this as well.</p>

<p>*In addition I believe that the front-line presidents also desire a peaceful solution, in spite of what many of them say in public. As far as South Africa is concerned, the Government remains prepared to assist wherever it can to promote and guarantee peace in Southern Africa. What is important in this debate, however, is that if a solution to the Rhodesian question is achieved by negotiation&#x2014;which I personally believe is still possible&#x2014;it will affect our position very closely for it will promote friendly relations between States in Southern Africa and will make it easier for us to normalize our position in Africa. I firmly believe that what is happening in South West Africa and what is possible there, can also happen in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot reconcile myself to the second statement in the motion either, viz. that the deterioration in our internal relations is responsible for the escalating threat, which, according to the motion, is developing for South Africa. The greatest immediate threat to South Africa&#x2014;in fact, to the entire free world&#x2014;is the Russian endeavour to achieve world domination. The strategy of the Russians and their allies is the systematic and piecemeal elimination of all resistance and all obstacles in their path. The Republic of South Africa&#x2014;in fact, the entire sub-continent&#x2014;is such a stumbling block to them. The Russian/Cuban involvement in the sub-continent must therefore be seen as a threat to all of us in Southern Africa, White and non-White, to all who attach any value to their freedom. That threat to us exists, not because we are Whites or non-Whites or because our policy is not acceptable to the world, but because we are making the task of the Russians and Cubans and their allies to control Southern Africa a difficult one. As usual the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and his colleagues opposite too, believe that they have an instant solution to South Africa&#x2019;s international problems. This time he calls it &#x201C;appropriate policy steps&#x201D;. What does that mean in political language&#x003F; It simply means that we must satisfy the outside world by accepting the principle of majority rule in South Africa. [Interjections.] For years now that hon. member has been harping on petty apartheid.</p>

<p>If this does not happen, the same fate will await such a majority government in South Africa as that which befell Hungary in 1965 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, in spite of the fact that the countries in question already had Communist governments at that juncture. Why should the Russians abandon their imperialistic aims as a result of a change of Government policy in South Africa, or as a result of the National Party Government being replaced by an Opposition party or Opposition parties&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, Sir. There are no instant solutions to our international problems. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout and his colleagues do not have any&#x2014;in fact, no one has. The NP does not have instant solutions to our problems either. We do have other solutions, internally as well as externally. These are no new solutions. We have had them for many years. We do not have a short cut either. Our solution extends over a very long road, a road we have been following for almost 30 years now, and we have already made a great deal of progress, as hon. members on this side indicated. I am referring to the road of self-determination of peoples and national groups, a principle which is accepted all over the world. In the case of South West Africa as well, which has for so many years been marring and complicating our relations with the outside world, we have walked the road of self-determination consistently and with good results. The result is that there are good prospects for a speedy solution through negotiation, a solution which will be acceptable to all the population groups and will not be forced upon anyone.</p>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its deep appreciation for the way in which the Government acknowledges the interdependence between the Republic of South Africa and the Bantu homelands and is developing such interdependence to the benefit of both.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the policy of separate development recognizes and accepts as its point of departure the existence of different peoples in South Africa, all of which possess a language of their own, a culture of their own, a history of their own as well as a traditional homeland of their own. The basic point of departure of this policy is in no way based on colour. On the contrary. It is a recognition of the diversity of peoples which exists in South Africa. It is true that sharp and clearly defined national differences exist between the Black people of this country, differences which, in essence, are perhaps greater sometimes than the differences between White and Black. One asks oneself whether the struggle in Angola is not evidence of the sharp differences which can and in reality do exist between Black and Black.</p>

<p>Consequently, the development of the different homelands does not seek to create differences between people. On the contrary, it is an attempt to guide individual groups who already have an identity of their own, towards greater autonomy and self-determination. The development of these different national groups and their homelands, should not be seen, however, as an attempt to isolate these people from each other in every sphere. The homelands must be seen as separate units and eventually as new states, which, whilst maintaining their own sovereignty, will form part of an ultimately strong and economic whole which will lead to political stability and from which everyone <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0661"/>will benefit. The policy, therefore, is founded on the firm basic principle that every people has a sovereign right to govern itself according to its own system of values, its own capabilities and its own needs; in other words, to be able to retain for itself that which has value to it as a people and to pursue objectives which it formulates for itself.</p>

<p>In a unitary state, on the other hand, the interests of a variety of peoples, such as one finds in South Africa, would clash with one another. Because of the conflict potential which this has the unitary state is not a suitable system for the Republic of South Africa. The realities of the situation in South Africa, where there is a variety of peoples, really lend themselves to only three alternatives for us. These are, to be specific, integration, isolation or co-operation. Let me say once that the NP rejects integration in a heterogeneous country such as South Africa. Nor do we believe that it offers any solution whatsoever, because integration would lead to an eternal power struggle. The principle of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; in a unitary state would lead to one thing only, because integration can lead to one thing only. This would not eliminate discrimination but would lead to discrimination against minority groups unable to maintain themselves in such a unitary state. Let us not forget that constitutions and declarations, those paper guarantees, have never guaranteed the rights of minorities anywhere in Africa; indeed, in every part of Africa, they have not been worth the paper they were written on. One can say the following about this whole concept of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;; &#x201C;one man, one vote, once&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The problem in a unitary state with a heterogeneous population such as we have here, is that it is virtually impossible for central overall government to meet, without discrimination, the social, cultural and economic needs of each group. These needs can simply not be satisfactorily accommodated if the differences which exist between the population groups are not recognized and respected. All over the world the experience has been that some form of decentralization of functions is essential for political stability, which, in turn, is a prerequisite for economic development. There are many examples which serve to illustrate that regional interests, group interests and ethnic differences cannot simply be ignored. Firstly, I refer briefly to the power struggles which arose in virtually all the African states after decolonization and which, in many cases, continue to this day. These are power struggles stemming from ethnic differences existing between the people concerned. Every African state is governed by some tribe and not by a representative government chosen from the people for the peopl&#x00E9;.</p>

<p>In the United States of America, which is already practising a form of decentralized government on a regional basis, voices are often raised for further differentiation on a basis of race. I could quote many examples of this. In Quebec, for example, the language question is a serious point of difference. A very interesting article appeared in the magazine <i>Time</i> during 1975, very interesting because it emanated from a source which has very little understanding of ethnic differences and of differences between people. In that article the argument was advanced&#x2014;in fact the confession made&#x2014;that now, more than ever before, movements fighting for separateness and for regional interests were emerging. Then the following examples were mentioned. Firstly, Spain was mentioned where one finds the Basque separatists who literally shook the Franco r&#x00E9;gime to its foundations. Then there is also the case of France, where problems with the Corsicans exist. The separatist movement in Corsica led to a clash between the police and the separatists. There is also the generally known example of Northern Ireland, where more than 1 300 people have died. There is also the example of Scotland, where the Scottish nationalist movement continues to grow and is emerging as a political power group. Then there is the case of Belgium, where the feuding French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemish are engaged in an eternal struggle. In this case, the respective languages are the dividing line between the two factions. Quite a few more examples of islands, etc. were mentioned but the point has been illustrated adequately. The article went on to try and give an analysis of the causes of the struggle. It said that one of the reasons for the struggle, was that the government machinery had become too large and too bureaucratic to be sufficiently sensitive to local interests. It also said that mother states were no longer able to inspire broad cultural realities and to effect a <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0662"/>feeling of solidarity amongst the population. It summarized this by saying (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">Broadly, these reasons, and the reasons for these conflicts, may be formulated &#x2026;</block>

<p>And, according to the article, this applied throughout the world&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as a need for a recognition of identity, a recognition of language differences, cultural differences and differences in the level of economic development.</block>

<block name="quote">Most militant minority groups in Western Europe, for example, live in areas which are economically underdeveloped and the central government is then blamed for this state of affairs.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it stressed that this trend of the need for the recognition of individual identities was emerging more and more and that it could not simply be ignored.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that I have now demonstrated adequately that political integration would have disastrous consequences for South Africa. However, I also want to state that a complete economic integration would likewise have serious consequences for all our homelands. By complete economic integration is meant the total release of the market mechanism so that production factors may move across political boundaries at will. Such a situation in South Africa, in which these powers had been released altogether, would give rise to the already existing industrial concentrations in the Republic continuing to be strengthened and to very little development taking place in the homelands and in the lagging areas. If one takes note of the figures, one sees that in 1969 the Witwatersrand, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban by themselves supplied as much as 81% of the Republic&#x2019;s total industrial production, whilst those areas together comprise only 3% of the total surface area of the Republic. This gives us a clear indication of the concentrated attraction of the metropolises. These centres, of course, came into being for different reasons. The Witwatersrand developed due to the discovery of gold and the harbours came into being as a consequence of the economic activity which was taking place on the Witwatersrand. However, it is a fact that once development has taken place, many external economies arise in such an area. A strong attraction arises, too, an attraction which gives rise to further concentration. Economic development in the homelands would be rendered impossible in more than one respect if the Government were to allow the free operation of the market mechanism to be the only regulator of economic activity.</p>

<p>However, the NP&#x2019;s policy makes provision for the deliberate counteraction of the market mechanism so as to avoid complete economic integration and to render homeland development and industrial decentralization possible in that way. I want to make it quite clear, however, that in making the statement that the Government rejects complete economic integration as an alternative, I am stressing that it is not the objective of the Government to balkanize South Africa economically. This is not the case at all. The economic whole of South Africa must remain intact. The policy of economic and industrial decentralization to the homelands and to other lagging areas is based on sound economic principles, principles which will strengthen the entire South African economy.</p>

<p>What has just been said leads unambiguously to the conclusion that integration, be it political or economic, cannot work in South Africa. This country of ours, which has already been described as &#x201C;a pocket edition of world problems&#x201D;, is a country in which one comes across what is probably the greatest variety and heterogeneity in the world. Our history throughout testifies to stability and phenomenal economic growth. This can only be seen as the consequences of the recognition of these basic principles.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the other alternative with which we are faced in South Africa, viz. isolation in the sense of complete national self-sufficiency, is something, however, which is not feasible in practice either. The oil crisis, for example, has shown that even mighty America experiences problems when she has to do without the co-operation of other countries. Neither this nor a movement in the direction of total isolation or national self-sufficiency offers any solution to the problems of our country.</p>

<p>The rejection of the first two alternatives brings us to the third alternative, viz. interdependence <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0663"/>and economic co-operation in South Africa. I honestly believe that there is a growing realization amongst all the population groups of South Africa that we are interdependent on one another, that we need one another and that we would be much worse off without one another than with one another. In passing, I want to point out that the BSL countries, for example, benefit greatly from their proximity to South Africa and from the advantages which they receive from the South African economy.</p>

<p>This brings me to the first point in connection with interdependence, and that is that the White economy relies very heavily on the production factor of Black labour. During 1970 the Black labour force constituted approximately 69% of the total labour force in service of the White South African economy. A continuation of this clearly emerges from the economic development programme for 1974-&#x2019;79. There it is stated that if we grow at a target rate of 6,4%, the demand for labour during 1974-&#x2019;79 will increase by an additional 1,3 million Blacks, which will bring the total employment of Black labour in 1979 to 7,446 million. At that stage, Black labour will represent approximately 71% of the total labour force.</p>

<p>Apart from the homelands&#x2019; rich labour potential, they also have at their disposal the inherent ability to make a mighty contribution towards food production in Southern Africa, particularly in the light of the rapidly increasing population in Africa. If we regard an annual rainfall of 500 mm as the dividing line between successful and unsuccessful dry-land crop production, we see that 76% of the total surface area of the homelands satisfies this criterion. 76% of the total surface area of the homelands receives more than 500 mm per annum, while only 35% of the Republic&#x2019;s surface area receives more than 500 mm per annum. It is interesting to take cognizance of the fact that the Tomlinson Commission made the comparison and estimated that 100 ha of land in the homelands equalled 147 ha in the White area. The potential of the homeland land therefore exceeds land in the White area in the ratio 147:100. Prof Tomlinson also estimated that the present homelands, because of their production potential, were able to supply food to between 30 million and 35 million people. Consequently, it is very clear that in future the homelands will be able to make a substantial contribution, particularly towards food production in South Africa as well as in Africa.</p>

<p>The homeland areas in the eastern part of the country have at their disposal a considerable water potential in the form of perennial rivers and possible dam sites. Since water for human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use will be a limiting factor in South Africa in future, we find in this sphere, too, an area for interdependence.</p>

<p>As far as mining is concerned, it is important to note that the rock formations of the Bushveld igneous complex, which are to be found chiefly in Bophuthatswana and Lebowa, are of the major parent rocks of minerals in South Africa. Deposits of tin, platinum, chrome, vanadium-bearing ore and magnesite are found here. Moreover, there are 59 working mines in the homelands but there is every indication that this number will be increased considerably in the future. It has already been established&#x2014;this is an important figure&#x2014;that approximately 50% of the world&#x2019;s known chrome deposits are found in the homelands, the vast majority being in Lebowa. However, this tremendous potential which the homelands have can only be utilized and exploited with the aid of the Republic&#x2019;s knowledge, capital and entrepreneurship. The Republic&#x2019;s infrastructure, too, is necessary for these exploitations, for example, power, transport and so on. The beneficiation of many of the minerals which are mined in the homelands, takes place in the Republic. These are further examples of interdependence and co-operation in the economic sphere.</p>

<p>On the other hand the high population growth rates of the homelands make them particularly dependent on the White economy for employment opportunities. In order to avoid unemployment, approximately 69% of the economically active Black population is found in White areas. Up to now labour has been the most important single export product of the homelands. The earnings of commuters and migrant labourers alone during 1973-&#x2019;74 represented approximately 73% of the gross national revenue of the homelands. This state of affairs is not unique to our homelands, nor must the homelands be seen as the only places where this happens.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to this interesting statistic. During 1973-&#x2019;74, according to a <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0664"/>report of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, migrant labourers from Lesotho earned 75 million American dollars, the equivalent of R52 million, here in South Africa. In contradistinction to that the gross domestic product of Lesotho during the same period was only R64 million, which indicates how absolutely dependent on the Republic Lesotho is. This amount of R52 million is almost as much as the country&#x2019;s total domestic revenue. If one looks at Lesotho, one sees that it is estimated that approximately 80% of the net number of entrants into the labour market in Lesotho will eventually have to come and work in South Africa in future as Lesotho does not have that potential. To give a further illustration of the point of interdependence, I should just like to point out, that Lesotho, for example, will receive R14 million from the Republic out of the common customs and revenue fund in the period 1976-&#x2019;77. On 30 June 1976 as many as 160 630 citizens of Lesotho were employed here in the Republic. When one considers the absolute interdependence which exists here, the dependence of Lesotho on the Republic, one finds it strange that such unfriendly sounds are issuing from that quarter. With an eye to the long term, it would perhaps be in Lesotho&#x2019;s own interests not to cloud relations with the Republic because we cannot deny the interdependence which exists in Southern Africa. The best we can do is to tolerate one another and to develop to our mutual advantage.</p>

<p>Apart from employment opportunities, the homelands are also sadly lacking in entrepreneurship, capital and technological knowledge. In this regard, the already far advanced White South Africa can make an essential contribution towards the exploitation of the natural potential of these areas, but always in a sovereign political context.</p>

<p>Isolation in the economic field, therefore, is not in the interest of either the Republic or the homelands. It was for this reason that, as far back as January 1955, Dr. Verwoerd pointed out the road of co-operation when he spoke in this House about a constellation of states. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said in a statement as recently as 20 October 1976 that one must bear in mind that our Government had always said that as the Black people became independent, a sort of commonwealth association, a constellation or power bloc of peoples, could come about, a large set-up without authority over all the peoples.</p>

<p>In the first instance, this co-operation between us and the homelands seeks to ensure for all participating parties complete political sovereignty. This is important. However, there would be co-operation in the economic sphere and joint efforts in the technological field. The sovereignty of the participants, however, would remain unaffected by the joint efforts in the economic and technological spheres because each one of them would still have individual control over the nature and scope of its participation in such systems.</p>

<p>As will become apparent from the speeches which my colleagues will make, the NP has already laid the solid foundations on which this co-operation will rest and in years to come as more and more homelands become independent, it will continue to build upon it in an evolutionary manner. Meanwhile, the economic development programmes in the homelands are leading to a progressively more rapid opening up of the undisputed potential which they have. In this way, the bottlenecks of capital and entrepreneurship are being diminished and the road towards more numerous and better employment opportunities, greater production and an increase in revenue, is being paid.</p>

<p>By way of illustration, I just want to mention that co-operation with the Republic as a result of the existing interdependence, has tremendous advantages for our homelands. We need not be ashamed of the achievements of our homelands. If we take a look at the gross national revenue of our homelands, we see that in the year 1973&#x2014; these are latest available figures&#x2014;it stood at R175 per capita. We may compare this to those of many African states, whose gross national revenue per capita varies from R63 to R102. The most important thing is for us to look at the prevailing growth rates in our homelands. It is remarkable that the annual growth rate of our homelands, in terms of the annual gross national income per capita, averaged 9% over the period 1960 to 1973. The highest growth rate in Africa which I could find for the same period was 4,2%. This shows that the rate of growth of our homelands is at least twice that of the rest of <span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0665"/>Africa. This is an achievement we need not be ashamed of.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am even more puzzled, having heard the hon. gentleman, than I was before. The motion that we are debating expresses its appreciation for the way in which the Government acknowledges the interdependence between the Republic of South Africa on the one hand, which includes the majority of the homelands, and the Bantu homelands on the other hand. It puzzled me to understand how we could have a relationship between the Republic&#x2014;which includes all the homelands&#x2014;and the other homelands, unless one is referring to the independent States of Basutoland, the Transkei and the others as homelands. This, to my mind, is not the norm today. What has puzzled me more, having listened to the hon. gentleman, is the fact that he spent the first 20 minutes of his speech, which lasted 30 minutes, not dealing with interdependence at all&#x2014;I can understand it, as I shall show in a minute&#x2014;but dealing with matters upon which I should have thought there was little argument. The hon. member indicated that one must deal with South Africa on the basis of the differences of the various &#x201C;volke&#x201D;, in other words, one must deal with South Africa as though it were a plural society which, to my mind, everybody accepts. He decried the validity of a unitary State as a solution for South Africa&#x2019;s problems. I would have thought that everybody in this House agreed long ago that one could not solve South Africa&#x2019;s problems on the basis of a unitary State. It is interesting, in passing, to note that the only party which seeks to administer a large part of South Africa on the basis of a highly centralized unitary State, is the National Party, because it is daily overriding those federal elements in our constitution dealing with the White part of South Africa, namely the provinces, in favour of a centralized unitary State. This is contrary to everything the hon. gentleman pleaded for in his speech.</p>

<p>He then went on to say that every &#x201C;volk&#x201D; in South Africa had a right to sovereignty. If that could be achieved, I think many would agree with him, but I have yet to hear how the Coloured people and the Indians are to achieve their sovereignty in South Africa. Then he went on to say that integration would lead to a total discrimination against minorities, but he did not indicate how the policy of his Government in respect of the Coloured and Indian people overcomes that difficulty which he pointed out. He went on to deal with the necessity of the decentralization of functions and power. I would have thought that everybody in the House agreed with that. Finally, he stated some of the factual positions we have in South Africa where one has an interdependence between the areas we know as the homelands and the rest of South Africa, which nobody denies. What he has not dealt with, however, is&#x2014;and I now read from his motion&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2026; the way in which the Government acknowledges the interdependence &#x2026;&#x201D; I heard nothing about the manner in which &#x201C;the Government &#x2026; is developing such interdependence to the benefit of both&#x201D;. The hon. gentleman gave a catalogue of some of the things which are to be found in the homelands such as mines, land which has good agricultural potential, areas of good rainfall and areas which have mineral resources. However, what he did not indicate was that most of the mining rights have been given to Whites. These things we know. Consequently I think it is fair to say that I am as puzzled, having heard the hon. gentleman, as I was when I first read this motion. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us analyse briefly the situation so far as interdependence between the various regions of the Republic of South Africa is concerned, which is the way it should be put. What interdependence is there between the various regions of the Republic of South Africa, because that is what we are talking about, apparently, i.e. those areas which are called homelands or reserves in the legislation, and the White areas of South Africa. There is an interdependence and it is known to everybody, but apparently I must recite it. There is interdependence because one has regional self-government in the White areas of South Africa in the nature of the provinces and one has regional self-government in the Black areas with a regional government for <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0666"/>KwaZulu and those other areas, the homelands, which have not yet achieved their independence.</p>

<p>The Bantu homelands which have reached the stage of self-government have the control of their education and roads, to name but a few aspects. They also control certain aspects of their agriculture, public works, community affairs and local government, all of which is largely paid for by the Republic of South Africa by way of subsidies. There is no greater interdependence at the level of government between the homelands and the Republican Government than there is between the provinces, the White provinces, and the Republican Government. It is nothing novel and I have yet to hear a motion introduced into this House complimenting the Government for the interdependence which exists between the province of Natal and the Republic of South Africa, or the province of the Cape and the Republic of South Africa. To do such a thing would be regarded as absurd because it is seen as a normal incidence of regional government in this country. It is no more novel here than it is in France, Spain or anywhere else. I believe that regional self-government for any area which has a quality of its own&#x2014;and the Bantu homelands, for historical reasons, have a quality of their own&#x2014;is a sensible thing. Regional government should be given to areas such as those. In all countries where there is regional self-government, there is interdependence between governmental levels. Where there is local self-government, in the form of municipalities, there is interdependence between communities. No one has to be thanked or complimented for bringing that about. In other words, interdependence between governments and communities within one State is automatic and in the nature of things. It is like night and day or morning and afternoon, and one does not have to thank the Government for that or compliment the Government for bringing it about.</p>

<p>I think that what we should be looking at in this debate is the true interdependence that exists in South Africa as far as racial groups are concerned, and that true interdependence is not merely between those areas that are called the homelands and what is thought of as White South Africa. The interdependence that we are concerned with in South Africa is between people&#x2014; Black people and White people. That is the interdependence which is real. And where does it occur&#x003F;</p>

<p>It occurs at almost every level of life imaginable. It occurs at the level of capital and labour which, at this moment of time, for historical reasons, means largely White capital and Black labour. It occurs at the level of industry, which is largely directed by Whites and has a largely Black labour force. It occurs at the level of commerce where much the same applies. It occurs in the Government Service where the direction of affairs is largely in the hands of Whites and the manpower is, to an overwhelming extent, Black, and I use the term Black in the broad sense to include Brown as well. There is also not a farm I know of in South Africa that has not a labour force of Black people, some of the labour forces running into many hundreds. One can also mention transport. Even in the Government transport services the same criterion applies. The same can be said for the service industries and the majority of homes in South Africa. There is interdependence at every level, not between the homelands and the Republic of South Africa, but between people, Black and White. These are levels of interdependence that have nothing to do with Government endeavour. These levels involve private people going about their own affairs in a natural way. This interdependence has arisen, as I have said, from the normal activities of businessmen, industrialists, farmers and housewives. What I found paradoxical-ironic indeed to the point of amusement&#x2014;was that we should have a motion praising the Government for this interdependence. However, when one examines the issue at any depth at all, one finds that the principle areas of interdependence between Blacks and Whites in South Africa are in those fields of endeavour where the Government has done its utmost to stop that interdependence. This is the irony of the whole situation when one is dealing with a motion of this kind. That is one of the main reasons why I had the utmost difficulty in deciding what was intended to be conveyed. Anybody who has been a member of this <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0667"/>House for the last ten or 20 years will know that in almost every field I have indicated&#x2014;I shall go through them in more detail in a moment&#x2014;the NP has spent year after year, and we have spent hour after hour of debate in this House, not in order to bring about interdependence between Black and White, but to avoid interdependence between Black and White.</p>

<p>Let us look at the question of industry. We have had legislation relating to job reservation, we have had endless debates on influx control and there has been the Physical Planning Act, to name just three matters regarding industry. What are these designed to do&#x003F; They are designed to prevent interdependence between Black and White in the field of industry. So far as farming is concerned, there are the enormous Bantu Control Boards designed to prevent exactly that interdependence. Then there is the limitation on the number of servants people can employ in their homes in the urban areas. That is also designed to avoid interdependence. In the field of transport, we have had situations where the non-White is not allowed to drive a bus or a taxi, or if a non-White possesses a taxi, he may take only passengers of a certain colour, again in order to avoid the very interdependence which, apparently, we are now to praise.</p>

<p>What is there for which the House must thank the Government in this regard&#x003F; All it indicates to me is that, regardless of the policy being advocated by the Government of the day, like every other country in the world, we have a total interdependence between those classes of society that make up the population of this country, and interdependence which the policy of this Government, as I have said, was designed to prevent. To put it in a nutshell, the degree of the interdependence between Black and White in South Africa stands in direct relation to the failure of Government policy in that regard. Indeed, with this motion we come perilously close to thanking the Government and praising it for the failure of its policy. Perhaps, Sir, you will understand my surprise and my puzzlement at reading this motion, as I have indicated earlier.</p>

<p>How often have I not heard it said in this House, how often have I not heard Ministers of Labour of the Nationalist Government plead that we must do our own work because to rely on the Black man would ultimately give him political power in White South Africa&#x003F; Why was it necessary to introduce all these limitations, which we have had, so far as the employment of Black labour by commerce and industry is concerned&#x003F; In order to reduce numbers. As somebody said, it is a game of numbers. First of all, what was to be done&#x003F; As I have indicated, they were to be moved out. When it became apparent that they could not be moved out, the game changed to what I might call the shuttle game. In other words, provided the Black workers were moved quickly enough between the homelands and the White areas, it was all right because they were not permanently in the White areas. When that did not work, the game changed once again to what one might call the remote control vote, which is the stage in which we are at the present time. In other words, we have moved from the necessity of getting rid of them from White South Africa to the position today where one can praise the Government for allowing them here, provided they vote elsewhere. It is a question of time before that one is moved out, and we can all wonder for a moment what the next game will be.</p>

<p><span class="col_1301-1302" refersTo="page_0668"/>I have an idea, Mr. Speaker, that it may well be the federal game because it is my thinking&#x2014;and that is why I said so to the hon. gentleman earlier that to talk about ethnicity, the existence of different racial groups in South Africa as being a fact of life, is simply to state something we all accept. We are a plural society. We have identifiable racial groups in South Africa with a community of interest of their own. It is that community of interest of our racial groups which cuts across the ordinary class relationships in an industrialized society which they have in Europe, and which gives to racial groups a community of interest of their own. As the hon. gentleman has said over and over again&#x2014;and we all agree with him&#x2014;there is an interdependence to an ever-increasing extent, not only between the areas in which the non-White peoples live and the areas in which we live, and the authorities which administer them, but between individuals. Wherever they may be living or working, there is that interdependence to an ever-increasing extent. One will be driven to the situation, eventually where one has to have an economic, political and constitutional framework which reflects that interdependence. And what are the elements of it&#x003F; Identifiable communities, which suggests separation; yet at the same time, the very interdependence which the hon. gentleman is speaking to in this motion, suggests a coming together. I can think of no other way by means of which those two situations can be accommodated in a heterogeneous society such as we have in South Africa than a federal system which has ethnic bases, which are brought together at higher levels in some sort of federal arrangement.</p>

<p>I should therefore like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, acknowledging the interdependence between Black and White in South Africa, urges the Government to adopt economic, political and constitutional policies which more truly reflect that interdependence.&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am being very honest when I tell you that I have a great deal of respect and esteem for the hon. member who has just spoken. I have a great respect for his intellect and his ability as orator, but I really did not hear him at his best today. He lacked the fluency with which he usually puts his case and this was an indication to me that he was not sure of his subject. That was why he pointed out to us that he did not understand the motion of the hon. member for Lydenburg properly and correctly.</p>

<p>Before I am tempted to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech argument for argument, I want to come to my own speech, for this is a fine, an excellent subject. I trust that I shall be able to refute some of his statements during the course of my speech.</p>

<p>The concept of interdependence between our country and the Bantu homelands is subject to the addition of two words or an action which precedes interdependence, and this is good neighbourliness. Without good neighbourliness, good co-operation and interdependence are impossible. With good neighbourliness the horizons are open and there is no limit at all to the possibilities of interdependence and mutual co-operation. Since interdependence between States and between people are so closely related and the concept of good neighbourliness is in turn closely allied to this, I should briefly like to mention two examples of how bad neighbourliness can cause interdependence or co-operation to miscarry, and how good neighbourliness can promote it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I was a boy, there was an old man who hired a farm in our district. What happened there, made an indelible impression on my young mind. That old man was not a very popular neighbour among our parents. One of the reasons for his unpopularity was his ability to have the cattle of his fellow-farmers sent to the pound time and time again. After a while this became so bad that the farmers in the district had to make sure that their gates were properly secured at night, but even so it still happened from time to time that their cattle would be in Uncle Salt-Salt&#x2019;s camp the next morning, or in his lands, or in the pound already. Then, some of the wise old men of our district told a few of us young boys to stand guard for a few nights. We did so, and after the fourth or fifth night Uncle Salt-Salt arrived&#x2014;he only got that name later on. We saw him coming along with a packet in his hand. It was late at night. He came to a neighbour&#x2019;s camp and opened <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0669"/>the gate. He took something from the packet in his hand and threw it on the ground, something which we later learnt was salt. He called the cattle by crying: &#x201C;Salt! Salt!&#x201D; The cattle drew near. He threw the salt all along the road and the cattle licked it up. The cattle followed him as far as the gate of his camp. He opened the gate and threw the salt on his own land. In this way he led the cattle to his camps, and sent his neighbours&#x2019; cattle to the pound.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the farm which he rented came on to the market, and had to be sold at a public auction. Then the wise old men came together and decided that they would not under any circumstances allow Uncle Salt-Salt to buy that farm. They decided that the most well-to-do farmer among them would buy that farm in order to get rid of that unwelcome neighbour. And this is what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now you can understand why, in recent times, often when I read or hear about statements which our neighbouring State Lesotho is making, I think of that time in my childhood. I make bold to say that Lesotho is rapidly becoming an undesirable neighbour, as Uncle Salt-Salt was in our area in those years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we had another case, one of good neighbourliness. There was also a young farmer who rented a farm in our district. He was exemplary and hard-working. His dedication and hard word knew no bounds. His farming methods and techniques were such that the older farmers often had to go to him for advice. The farm which he hired also had to be sold at public auction. Once again the wise old men came together and decided, however keen some of them were to have that farm not to bid against that young farmer so that he could obtain the farm at a fair price. They decided to give him the chance. On the morning of the auction two strange buyers from Johannesburg arrived, and according to all visible evidence they were able to make a very high offer for the farm. However, the old men quickly made another plan. I shall not reveal the method which they decided upon here, but that afternoon they eliminated those two possible buyers in a certain way and that young farmer bought the farm. He was worth a great deal to his district. He was worth a great deal for co-operation between farmers, and although he is already an old man today, he is still one of the best farmers in the south-eastern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a good, mature neighbour is stable, secure and has his own identity and although the Government helped to give stability, identity and security to the Bantu homelands, the recognition of the identity of the homelands and of their full constitutional status is not yet the end of the road for them and for the Republic as far as interdependence is concerned. The work still lies ahead. Indeed, we are already engaged in that work. What are we involved in&#x003F; We are involved in development in all spheres, development in the interests of the homelands, in the interest of the Republic of South Africa, and in the interest of the whole of Southern Africa. What did a prophet like the late Dr. Verwoerd say in connection with interdependence between various States in South Africa&#x003F; On 27 January 1959 he said&#x2014;the hon. member for Lydenburg has already referred to this in passing (Hansard, Vol. 99, col. 65)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our dealings with the other countries of Africa, we are seeking above all else for friendship. If we find we cannot gain this friendship in a certain way, let us say by establishing certain forms of systematic relations, but that we can gain this friendship by assisting one another in the scientific, economic and other fields, we should obviously adopt the policy by which the main objective, in gaining a friendship, can be achieved. The same applies to our own Bantu in South Africa. Friendship and good relations will not be achieved by giving them some say in Parliament through White representatives or even a few Native representatives. It will eventually result in a struggle between a majority of the one racial group and a minority of the other group. But that friendship can be achieved if the one group is allowed to develop towards exercising full control amongst his own people and the other group is allowed to acquire or retain full control amongst his own people. It is on that point which I wish to place all the emphasis: That our struggle is not in the first place destructive, but constructive. We want to build up a South Africa in which the Bantu and the White man can live next to one another as good neighbours and not <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_0670"/>as people who are continually quarrelling over supremacy.</block>

<p>The present Prime Minister concluded his speech during the no-confidence debate this year with similar ideas and viewpoints. However, this is what two White leaders say. What does a recognized Bantu leader say&#x003F; Dr. Phatudi, Chief Minister of his homeland says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Terselfdertyd trek ons voordeel uit die beleid van afsonderlike ontwikkeling. Dit is baie bemoedigend om Blanke-steun in Suid-Afrika te vind, omdat ons gevind het dat ons nie sonder die Blankes kan klaarkom nie en hulle ook nie sonder ons nie.</block>

<p>This is interdependence. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons word algaande meer en meer bewus van ons interafhanklikheid wat, na ons mening, baie voordelig is. Ons maak &#x2019;n deel uit van die hele Suid-Afrikaanse bemarkingsopset, bestaande daaruit dat al die tuislande integrale dele uitmaak van hierdie polsende ekonomiese eenheid en in die lig hiervan word enige industrie of ondememing beskou as &#x2019;n eenheid net so volwaardig as enige soortgelyke eenheid in enige Blanke-gebied.</block>

<p>Then these last five words from a Black leader who sees the prospect of independence ahead&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Onafhanklikheid is in die lug en sprei sy geurige aroma oral oor.</block>

<p>There is the proof. We are proving that interdependence is already taking place on a large and commendable scale between ourselves and the homelands. Provision of capital and the creation of infrastructure by the Government of the Republic indicates unselfish, disinterested service in many spheres on our part to the people of the homelands. The Republic of South Africa has a network of communications facilities such as roads, railway lines, telephones, electricity, etc. at its disposal, and these services and facilities extend to the furthest corners of the Republic where they border on, and often enter the homelands. What is more: The Government of the Republic is, at this stage, making enormous amounts of money available in order to make similar communications services possible for the homelands. Under the auspices of the BIC the homeland transport services are at present conveying 121 000 workers from their homes to their work and back every day. Annually these people earn R153 million for themselves and their homelands. The Bantu homeland transport services employ 3 400 homeland inhabitants every day. Expertise is a very great and immeasurable service which we provide to the homelands, skill which is gained through years of experience, civilization and study. We are making that skill available to the people of the Bantu homelands on a large scale. Highly trained staff is being seconded to help these people with veterinary services, medical services, forestry, agriculture, water affairs etc. We are helping these people in the military sphere. At the moment we are helping the Ciskei to create their own police force and on 1 February we began to train the Tswanas&#x2019; own soldiers under the supervision of one of the Republic&#x2019;s officers. When these people become independent later this year, they will already have 221 well-trained soldiers at their disposal. The previous speaker asked what private individuals are doing to further interdependence. One of the examples which I can mention, is that 70 farmers helped Bantu homeland farmers to plough and cultivate their lands at the beginning of this agricultural season. They assisted in everything that was necessary. Food is the fountain of life for a country and its people. We should like to ensure that the homelands do not in later years, become the victims of famine, as many Africa States do, for we are concerned about their weal and woe and their prosperity. In order to guard against this the State is also giving the Bantu homeland farmers agricultural training. This is still not enough, and therefore I should like to address a request to homeland leaders, the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Commissioners-General in the various homelands to help the homeland farmers to produce sufficient food for their own people in future. Today I should like to make an appeal, i.e. that an attempt be made in future to encourage young Black homeland farmers to seek employment with White farmers in the Republic of South Africa. I do not doubt for a moment that if those farmers are carefully selected and have the prospect <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0671"/>of this task held out to them, they will not hesitate to pay a good salary to those young Black homeland farmers. While those homeland farmers are earning a good salary, they will master the skills, techniques and methods of farming. Then they will be able to go and apply these in their own homelands to the benefit of their own people.</p>

<p>In this way we, the Republic of South Africa, are performing a task here. In this way we, the Whites of the Rep&#x00F9;blic of South Africa, will prove to the world that we did not come to this part of Africa to suppress, to rule or to enrich ourselves at the expense of others, but that we came to have our own country, our own identity and our own independence. Mr. Speaker, because we know and can remember the desire that preceded independence, we understand the aims and desire of these people of the homelands. We want to say to them this afternoon, that in future they must guard against the possibility of those things which the so-called well-disposed world holds out to them turning out to be a case of all that glitter is not gold, for those things can lose their lustre with time and ultimately they may find themselves plunged into utter darkness.</p>

<p>We want to warn them not to pay too much heed to the words of a so-called well-disposed world, because those words may deafen their ears later on to the detriment of themselves and of their people. We ask them to look at, to see and to listen to what the White Government of the Republic of South Africa is doing for them and will do for them in future. On our part we want to say&#x2014;the hon. member for Lydenburg made this point&#x2014;that we also appreciate what they are doing for us. In many respects they provide us with labour and they are favourably disposed towards us in many respects. Today we want to ask them to consider these things and to believe the facts which they see and hear every day. We and they must continue hand in hand in order to build a good South Africa, a South Africa which in Africa ought to be the most progressive, prosperous and fortunate part of Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Meyerton will forgive me if I do not react to his speech directly. He spoke a great deal about bad neighbourliness and the need for good neighbourliness. I agree to a great extent with the criticism of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in regard to the introductory speech of the hon. member for Lydenburg, which sounded more like a statistical dissertation than a speech introducing a motion before the House. Furthermore, it did appear to me at times as though he was verging on being out of order, because he dealt at great length with the relationships between Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa. We all realize that Lesotho is not a homeland, but an independent State and therefore beyond the scope of the motion before the House. I may say, however, that I do understand the hon. member for Lydenburg when he speaks about the interdependence between the homelands and the Republic. I believe that he was probably referring to those homelands which are about to become independent and to the future development of interdependence in order to ensure our future security through better understanding between White and Black. However, I cannot accept the motion of the hon. member for Lydenburg as it stands, because it expresses appreciation to the Government for something it has only recently woken up to and only recently begun to act on. Therefore&#x2014;I feel I have to do it&#x2014;I move the following amendment which, I believe, is far more positive than the motion of the hon. member for Lydenburg and also brings the whole House of Assembly into the picture&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House acknowledges the interdependence between the Republic of South Africa and the Bantu homelands and urges the Government to develop this interdependence to the mutual advantage of the Republic and the homelands.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>*The maintenance and development of interdependence between the homelands and the Republic is a most essential factor in respect of the future security and progress of both the homelands and the Republic. This interdependence is, in the first place, of historic nature. In the second place, it has to be developed upon services shared by the homelands as well as the Republic. In the third place, it has to be based upon a growing economy with mutual benefits for the partners concerned. In the fourth place, a political interdependence has to be developed in which <span class="col_1309-1310" refersTo="page_0672"/>one group does not dominate another and which fosters mutual trust in the hearts of all our peoples.</p>

<p>I first want to discuss briefly the historic heritage of interdependence. This was largely caused by the fact that the Bantu tribes moved southwards from Central Africa, by the colonial policy of Britain, the discovery of diamonds and gold at the end of the 19th century, and the industrial development which took place during and after the two world wars. The Whites have become increasingly dependent on the labour provided by the Bantu, and the Bantu of the homelands, indeed of Southern Africa, have become increasingly dependent on the money which can be earned in the White parts of South Africa. Therefore, with the growth of mining and the development of industry, this interdependence became a real factor in the community of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Let us now deal with the second point, viz. services such as railways, roads, harbours, airways, telephone and telegraph communications, radio, the provision of electric power, water schemes, security services, technological services, and so on. These services constitute a very important factor in the development of all our peoples. These services are a most important factor in the provision of higher standards of living and form the real basis of interdependence. In order to be able to develop and strengthen this, all of us have to believe that they are partners in the owning and maintenance of these services which contribute such a great deal to the welfare of all of us.</p>

<p>Together with my second point, the third point also plays an important role. This is the growing economy within and outside the homelands. If only the Government had paid heed earlier, the growth of the economy within the homelands would have made far greater progress than is the case today. I do not gainsay the fact that major endeavours were made in the seventies, but a great deal remains to be done to afford the Bantu businessman and industrialist a significant place in the economy and to provide the required employment opportunities. It is particularly for this reason that I have moved my amendment. The Government should be prompted and encouraged and, in fact, urged to take further steps in the direction of economic independence for the homelands and thereby bring about increased and firmer interdependence between the homelands and the Republic.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to express a few thoughts about political interdependence. This is perhaps the most important as well as most delicate of all things relating to interdependence. It is important that we should place this matter on a higher level than the vicious politics of exploitation. We should discuss this matter frankly as adults. People talk about change, but change is in fact the art of politics and the politician who denies this is not worth his salt. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs in an earlier debate referred to instant solutions and said there was no such thing; that is true, because politics means adjustment. How then do we achieve political interdependence&#x003F; I shall begin by making a few suggestions. We have the homeland Governments, which can be developed fully. We have interdependence with regard to the services which can be utilized to the benefit of all of us. We are constantly developing interdependence in economy. I put the following questions to this House: Why not establish something such as the European Common Market, which statutorily binds every nation with a single economy, and the utilization of common services&#x003F; Why not establish something such as the European Council in which consensus can be reached on matters of common interest&#x003F; Why not establish something such as the Nato Alliance between us and the homelands and, perhaps, other independent countries in Africa&#x003F; I put these points as a basis upon which one may start in order to achieve political interdependence. From that a federation or a confederation may develop, but everyone will be master of his own affairs. The time to begin is now.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because of the limited time at my disposal I am not going to reply to what the hon. member for Albany has said, except to say that his was a very positive contribution. I wish he was quite right in his idealistic view that we can guide the homelands to economic independence. Not even the great America succeeds in being economically independent. The hon. member for Lydenburg has told us that isolation for the Republic and the homelands will not do, that integration will not be <span class="col_1311-1312" refersTo="page_0673"/>politically acceptable and that the only possibility will have to be economic co-operation with a view to political independence and economic interdependence. While he was talking thus about isolation and economic co-operation, I thought about the famous words of John Donne&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main.</block>

<p>And then Donne uttered these winged words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any man&#x2019;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind.</block>

<p>And that is exactly what this motion tells us&#x2014;that the fate of the White man and the Black man in this country is linked. I want to talk very shortly about how economic interdependence can be effected with the aid of political independence. In doing so I hope I shall be able to reply to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He started his speech by giving us a long list of all the points on which he agreed with the hon. member for Lydenburg. However, he added that the hon. member for Lydenburg had at no stage said how interdependence could be developed. I trust that I shall be able to reply to this question of his and that he will see the light.</p>

<p>I also want to discuss homeland consolidation, the decentralization of economic activities and about channelling and training of labour. If there is any time left when the 20 minutes are up, I should also like to discuss the correct spatial establishment of economic activity. I want to begin with the subject of economic interdependence and political independence. Last year B.E.R.B.D. published a beautiful piece of work entitled &#x201C;Swart Ontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika&#x201D;, a work in which an exposition is given of a strategy we should adopt for homeland development, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Dat die verskillende bevolkings in Suid-Afrika sover prakties moontlik maksimaal in hul eie gebiede sal woon en werk;</li>

<li>(b) Waar dit tans nog nie moontlik is nie, moet die Swart bevolkings in hul eie onderskeie lande woon, en op &#x2019;n daaglikse pendelbasis in Blanke-gebied werk.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is the idea which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana made such fun of. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(c) In gevalle waar (a) en (b) hierbo nie moontlik is nie, kan surplus-arbeid vanuit die Swart tuislande ingevolge die trekar-beidstelsel as derde alternatief en laagste prioriteit op enkellopende basis in Blankegebied werk.</li>

</ol>

<p>The implementation of this strategy affords the Black nations an opportunity to give expression to their political, economic and social aspirations. Now, the Government proceeded as follows in order to implement this strategy. In the first place, there is the delimitation of land and a programme of homeland consolidation. Not only is this an essential basis for peaceful co-existence between White and Black in this country, but between Black and Black as well. Through, for example, the setting aside of land, the supplementing of that land in accordance with the Act of 1936 and the evolutionary process of ever-increasing political control, the Transkei became a sovereign independent State in October last year, and is today moving inexorably towards a greater future. The delimitation of land has contributed towards allowing the inhabitants of the homelands to realize their political aspirations and by so doing to develop their own national structure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana asked: What about the Bantu in the urban areas&#x003F; Is he not aware of the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, Act No. 46 of 1959, which enables the Bantu outside the borders of the homelands to be linked, politically and administratively, with the homelands with which they have an ethnic bond&#x003F; With regard to the consolidation before the latest consolidation programme of 1975, there were no fewer than 112 separate blocks in which the Bantu lived. Due to the consolidation efforts of 1975 they were reduced to 24 and the hon. the Prime Minister has already held out the prospect that those 24 could be reduced through a process of exchange.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to speak about the decentralization of economic activities and about establishment of industries, firstly in the homelands in accordance with our strategy and secondly in the border areas. We <span class="col_1313-1314" refersTo="page_0674"/>initiated a programme of industrial decentralization as far back as 1960 in order to afford the political aspect of separate development greater economic substance. The Government&#x2019;s decentralization programme has a positive and a negative aspect. But in this case the negative aspect promotes the positive aspect. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana alleged that we were working against economic interdependence and referred specifically to section 3 of the Environment Planning Act as an example. He also referred to job reservation and influx control. I maintain that in this case the negative promotes the positive. On the one hand we are promoting industrial development in some areas and on the other hand it is necessary to cut down on an over-concentration of people and the establishment of industries in certain areas. Hence section 3 of the Environment Planning Act! The hon. member asked what that had to do with economic interdependence. Only this, that it was necessary to limit the influx of Bantu to the White metropolitan areas by means of the negative provision in section 3, because those Bantu are needed for the economic development in their own homelands.</p>

<p>What is the annual supply of labour from the homelands&#x003F; A very interesting survey was carried out in the homelands between 1973 and 1975. It was found that on average, during those three years just over 100 000&#x2014; the exact figure is 100 100&#x2014;Bantu have entered the labour market. More than 65 000 of these 100 100 found employment in or near the homelands. An average of 28 428 found employment in the homelands themselves. 1 400 found employment in the primary sector, i.e. in mining and agriculture. I am not referring to ordinary agriculture here, but to certain agricultural projects undertaken by the BIC and others. 5 000 found employment in the secondary sector and 22 000 in the tertiary sector. Sir, 36 858 found employment in the border areas just outside the homelands and the balance of 34 814 which could not find employment in or near the homelands, are the potential migrant labourers.</p>

<p>In other words, just less than one-third found employment in the homelands, just over one-third found employment just outside the homelands in the border areas, and the other third are potential migrant labourers. This is a tremendous improvement on what the situation was years ago, but is still not good enough. One remembers that it was only in 1970, as the hon. member for Albany mentioned, that this process of industrial development in the homelands really gained momentum and it is unfortunate that this had to take place in these years when there has been no major economic growth.</p>

<p>What is the Government doing to promote industrial development&#x003F; It is doing so by means of fiscal concessions and other incentives. Growth points have been established in the decentralized areas and we are revising these concessions from time to time. The infrastructure has been built up. The private sector has been encouraged to supply capital, entrepreneurship and know-how. In this regard I also want to break a lance for the officials, the people of the BIC, the XDC, BERBD and the officials who have been seconded to the homeland governments. It is unnecessary to erect a monument for those people. We have only to look at what has been done within a few years in the homelands, namely the factories that have been constructed, the towns that have been built on the empty plains, agricultural projects, job opportunities that have been created and the standard of living which has risen. The hon. member for Lydenburg pointed this out. A more sophiscated economy has been created for those people. I know of no one else who has made a greater contribution to a prosperous and more peaceful South Africa.</p>

<p>This motion refers to interdependence. I think we have here the finest example of interdependence between the homelands and the White areas. The homelands have a need for development aid, not only money, but also know-how. We have a need for peaceful and continued existence and now the one hand is washing the other. We cast our bread on the waters and after many years it comes back to us. But for economic activity we need more than capital, entrepreneurship and knowledge. We also need labour as the most important component, and this is where the homelands are the providers and where we complement one another.</p>

<p>I should like to speak very briefly about the channelling of labour. For economic activity and growth in and near the homelands we must not only check the quantitative exodus of workers, but also the qualitative exodus of their best-equipped people. There is a growing <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0675"/>number of high-school, trade-school and university students who complete their studies in the homelands every year. These are the leaders on whose shoulders the task of building a nation rests. They have a task to perform in those homelands which is too great for them to accomplish in their lifetimes. Now it is true that we find that the majority of Black people go to the White areas during the high-productivity years of 20 to 24. Among them are some of their best-trained people. This constitutes national erosion. I think it should give White employers a guilty conscience to employ people whose services have become indispensable in their own country. Their training programme in the homelands should be in the first place be focused on service to the homeland and then on the needs of the White economy near the homeland. For years to come the most important &#x201C;export article&#x201D; of our homelands and the most important &#x201C;earner of currency&#x201D; will continue to be their manpower. But this export should take place in such a way and this currency must be earned in such a way as to promote homeland development to the fullest extent. I think we should seriously consider doing away with restrictions on the vertical upgrading of Black workers in the deconcentrated border areas. In the metropolitan areas there are certain restrictions on the vertical mobilization of the Black worker, but these restrictions are there not only for the protection of the White worker, but also in the interests of nation-building in the homelands. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana spoke about job reservation. Surely he knows that job reservation affects a mere 2% of our labour force.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Can the hon. member persuade the trade unions to do that&#x003F; He knows that the trade unions can impose restrictions, and surely the hon. member does not want industrial unrest. There are employers in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency who impose restrictions on those Black workers. There is the deficient training of those Black workers, which imposes a restriction on them. There are few restrictions in the border areas, but there are still restrictions and in the homelands, of course, there is no restriction whatsoever on the vertical mobilization of the Black worker. If we can relax the restriction in the border area, we can offer the Black worker of Johannesburg an incentive to better his position by training and by holding a more senior position in the border area. The man who earns R100 per month in Johannesburg can earn, with training, R200 per month in the border areas because he occupies a more senior post. Furthermore the difference is bigger than the difference between an income of R100 and an income of R200. Due to his bigger income as a commuter in the border area, he is also a consumer in his homeland and because he is a consumer there, he promotes the economy of the homeland. This in turn creates more job opportunities.</p>

<p>In order to implement our strategy, there should be a restriction on the horizontal mobility of Black workers, and that is why we have influx control, something which does not suit the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Coupled with that, the vertical mobility of the Black workers near the homelands should be promoted. To achieve all this, the correct spatial establishment of economic activities is necessary. Within the framework of such a dispensation the Black worker as commuter can realize himself politically, economically and socially. In fact, apart from the provision of employment within the homeland&#x2014;and this should always enjoy the highest priority&#x2014;I believe that this is the only way in which we can achieve political independence and economic interdependence. I gladly support this motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a saying &#x201C;look before you leap&#x201D;! The hon. member who has introduced this motion, still has to learn that many hon. members who aspire to the Cabinet may spoil those chances by displaying impetuous and rash ambition.</p>

<p>I have listened attentively to what the hon. member for Port Natal had to say. Of course he never got round to dealing with the question of interdependence between the homelands and the Republic of South Africa. One would have liked to think that a printing error crept into the Order Paper, but once again, in the style of NP members, he tried to encourage the other hon. members in this House and their supporters outside that the <span class="col_1317-1318" refersTo="page_0676"/>policy is succeeding, that the policy is working, that there is no crisis, that there are no problems, and that everything is going well, but, of course, the facts prove the opposite. The facts prove that the policy of separate development is an utter failure, a sorry failure, and that the NP, under these circumstances, does not seem to be able to come forward with an alternative which might solve the racial problems of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am going to be very friendly and positive today and I am going to try to help the Government. [Interjections.] The hon. member must keep quiet now. I listened attentively while he was speaking. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was asleep. I think the hon. member had better keep quiet now, so that we can discuss and go into these matters. Mr. Speaker, today we are discussing the policy of the NP, not the policy of the Opposition parties in this House.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>The first matter we should consider is the question: What is the basis for sound interdependence between the Republic of South Africa and the homelands&#x2014;Transkei, Lesotho, Botswana, those countries which border on our country, those countries in respect of which interdependence with South Africa exists and with which interdependence must be maintained, developed and strengthened&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, it means that there must be co-operation, co-operation on an economic level. Trade should be carried on with and assistance granted to the homelands in order to develop their economy and to solve their unemployment problems. When we consider the facts, not the clever talk we had from the hon. members of the NP here, we see for instance&#x2014;these are replies which were furnished last year&#x2014;that altogether 69 729 Blacks were employed in the mining industry in five of the major homelands. That is a small percentage of the available labour in those areas, and not nearly enough to employ the new employees coming into the market. If we consider another sector, for instance the industries, we notice that the total employment of Blacks in all the homelands last year amounted to 24 025.</p>

<p>In other words, Mr. Speaker, all this clever talk is of no avail. We should rather consider the facts. We should rather try to do something about the situation, something which will improve the situation and is likely to make for progress. If one wants to give substance to interdependence, it means that one will have to think in terms of the elimination of tension, the elimination of unfinished business on the agenda, the elimination of prejudice, the creation of equilibrium. This means that the Government will have to negotiate with the leaders of those people with a view to solving the existing problems. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us consider the economic problems of these areas. Take KwaZulu as an example. KwaZulu is one of the largest Bantu homelands. Between the years 1960 to 1973 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in 1960 the income in respect of KwaZulu&#x2019;s domestic product was 44% of the income of the total population. Thirteen years later&#x2014;after the NP came along with its policy and all its thoughts and ideas&#x2014;it dropped to 22%. That is the percentage of the income in respect of the domestic product of KwaZulu, which was earned in KwaZulu, compared with the total domestic product of that country. Mr. Speaker, let us consider the facts once more. The facts prove that the policy of the NP was a complete failure. When referring to interdependence between States, one need only think of Lesotho. This is a good example of where the basis for interdependence has failed, where it was a failure. What were the reasons for that&#x003F; I think it is important to consider the reasons for that. <span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_0677"/>There are historical reasons. There are economic reasons. Lesotho is impoverished and completely dependent on South Africa. [Interjections.] Lesotho is isolated. Lesotho is frustrated, and as a result of that &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; it reacts in this way to South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I said that we should consider Lesotho so that we do not make the same mistakes here in South Africa with regard to the homelands. However, what is happening in Bophuthatswana&#x003F; Now Bophuthatswana&#x2019;s leader has said that, as a result of his disillusionment and his frustration because the NP is not prepared to satisfy his legitimate and just demands, that he would accept independence, but that he would use it as a lever to obtain equal rights for himself and for the Blacks in South Africa. This happened because the Government did not satisfy his legitimate demands. He also said that, if the Government is not prepared to comply with his legitimate demands for land&#x2014;in other words, if the Government of South Africa does not consolidate Bophuthatswana in a just and rational way&#x2014;it may lead to bloodshed. This is not extortion. That is a timely warning from a friend of South Africa to the South African Government. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what does the NP want to achieve&#x003F; What are the National Party&#x2019;s ideas about interdependence&#x003F; Is it their idea to get rid of their responsibilities towards Black South Africans and of their responsibility to satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of the Blacks&#x003F; Is it their idea to dodge and evade their political responsibilities towards the Black man&#x003F; Is it their idea to shirk the responsibility they have towards the Black man with regard to his political and his constitutional rights&#x003F; Do they want to replace the political imperialism or the white colonialism which was practised with regard to the Black man with economic imperialism and with economic colonialism with regard to the Bantu homelands&#x003F; [Interjections.] Do they want to replace the political oppression with economical oppression&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is an answer to all these problems, but it will depend on the intelligence and the insight of the Government and its leaders. Will the Government be bold enough to negotiate at this stage with the Black leaders of South Africa with regard to the rational consolidation of the homelands, after their policy has collapsed&#x003F; Will the Government have the insight to realize that, if they want to create homelands which are economically, politically and geographically viable and acceptable to the inhabitants of those homelands, it is absolutely essential for them to consolidate the homelands rationally&#x003F; Will the Government realize that it has to do this&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Government must forget about the 1936 legislation. It can in no way satisfy the real requirements of those people. Will the Government realize that it will have to do so on a basis of negotiation with the leaders of the homelands, and also with due regard for the viewpoints of the Blacks in the urban areas&#x003F; [Interjections.] Will the Government realize that the basis on which this has to be done, should be a basis on which the boundaries of the homelands should be determined afresh by means of negotiation and that far more land will have to ge granted to those homelands&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I do not have the time for that now. If it is an intelligent question, I shall reply to it afterwards outside the House. [Interjections.] The Government have to negotiate with the homelands leaders and the urban Black leaders concerned to consolidate the homelands rationally now. The Government must not do this by buying out the land of White landowners and handing it over to the homelands. In this way millions of rands are wasted. It must be done by drawing new boundaries and by affording the White population and owners of land and business enterprises the opportunity to become citizens of those areas. In this way their skill, capital and leadership will be retained in those areas for the benefit of the Blacks. What the Government should do is to spend the funds they would have spent on the buying out of land for the homelands, on education, economic infrastructures and administrative infrastructures. If the Government were prepared to take that step and to make that change in their policy, they would have the support of the homelands, of the White groups, the industries and probably also of <span class="col_1321-1322" refersTo="page_0678"/>countries outside South Africa.

<p>This will be a real step in the right direction and it will mean that it will be possible to consolidate the homelands realistically within a few years and make them economically and politically viable. The interdependence between South Africa and the homelands, whether independent or not, will then rest on a sound basis which will bring about progress and peace for South Africa as well as the homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because all the other parties in the House moved amendments, I also want to move an amendment. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, in order to ensure that the interdependence between the Republic of South Africa and the homelands will rest on a foundation of mutual trust and co-operation, calls on the Government to negotiate with the relevant Black leaders&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) the rational consolidation of homeland areas into viable geo-political states as distinct from purely ethnic homelands; and</li>

<li>(2) the right of all South African citizens who, in terms of Government classification, are related to a homeland seeking independence, to retain South African citizenship, if they so wish. &#x2019;</li>

</ol>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, paragraph (2) of the amendment is essential, because if you want good relations between South Africa and the homelands it is absolutely essential that in addition to the rational consolidation of the homelands, and economic, political and geographic viability which can only, in the first instance, be brought about by consolidation and, in the second instance, by massive investment, leadership and assistance, you must also have trust and co-operation. There are many things that must be considered, but one of the most important questions that must be sorted out by way of negotiation between the Government and the leaders concerned is the question of the citizenship of people who are South Africans, whether they are related to the homelands or not.</p>

<p>The message for peace and prosperity is this: Negotiation now between the Government and the leaders concerned. Then this Government can start talking about the possibility of their policy being a success. If they do not do so, then I am afraid the hon. member for Lydenburg is quite correct in the implication of his motion today that the policy of the Government has proved itself in its performance to date to be a sorry and complete failure.</p>

Another point that I wish to draw attention to, is that although the hon. member stated quite correctly that, according to the report of the Tomlinson Commission, 100 morgen of agricultural land in the homelands are equal to 147 morgen of agricultural land in White areas, one should always, to put it in its true perspective, take into account the percentage of land owned by the Bantu as against the land owned by the Whites, as well as the density of population, and so on.

<p>No, you had half an hour at your disposal, while I am only allowed to speak for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think that when the post-1948 history is eventually written, it will be known as the era of lost opportunities. This Government will have the dubious privilege of having enjoyed a comfortable majority throughout that period. The Government also had the advantage of a very subservient Press. It is only recently that we find some of the Afrikaans Press querying some of the policies of the Nationalist Party. During this time the Government failed miserably to really lay the foundation for the economic and political development of South Africa, based on the conditions as they exist in the country. One of the reasons why it wasted so much time and opportunity is that the Government and the people who designed the policy only came up with theoretical solutions to South Africa&#x2019;s problems and then tried to implement those theoretical solutions with a total disregard for the real situation as it exists in the country. I, too, had difficulty in listening to the hon. member for Lydenburg and in deciding exactly what he was getting at with this motion. The only conclusion I can arrive at as far as the motivation for this motion is concerned, is that deep down he too is suffering from a guilt complex, because his party has been wasting so much time in this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>*Today the Government realizes that it has wasted opportunities, and it is utter nonsense to try to pretend now that everything has developed as originally contemplated.</p>

<p>Now they say that this is not true. Did I not say that they feel guilty and a little ashamed of their past and their approach to life&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;You know, Sir, it is a matter of suffering from acute mental rigidity. They made up their minds and decided that this was the way it had to be. Therefore we wasted 25 to 30 years in South Africa. Why is this so&#x003F; The problem is&#x2014;this is very important&#x2014;that basically the NP rationalized the South African situation along the lines of the European example. One finds countries in Europe that are politically independent, but economically interdependent. I would be the first to agree that certainly there are certain similarities between the South African situation and that which one finds in certain European countries. There are, however, certain significant differences which compel us in South Africa to develop along different lines to those along which we have been developing over the past three decades.</p>

<p>Let us for instance look at some of these important differences. If one looks at the problem of the supply of labour, one finds that in Europe, for instance, only a degree of interdependence exists. The German economy depends only for 5% or 10% of its labour force on guest labourers, &#x201C;gaste-arbeiders&#x201D;. On the other hand one finds that countries such as Spain and Italy generate capital and provide job opportunities for approximately 90% of their people, whilst only 10% of the people have to sell their labour on the market. Let us for instance look at the position of trade in Britain. As a member country of the European Economic Market, Britian markets only a certain percentage of its total exports <span class="col_1325-1326" refersTo="page_0680"/>in the countries within the European Economic Community.</p>

<p>What is however the situation in South Africa&#x003F; To start off, South Africa depends entirely for its supply of unskilled labour on imported labour from the homelands. In the case of semi-skilled labour the figure may be 90% or more. One must realize that, ultimately, if the NP policy is to be successful, the situation will arise that we shall have to rely completely on imported labour. It is therefore not just a matter of being interdependent, but of being totally dependent. What is more, the homelands generate very little wealth. They provide very few job opportunities for their people. They rely for about 90% on South Africa to provide those job opportunities. This is the situation which we face, viz. that here we have an unparalleled interdependence. The hon. members mentioned interdependence between the homelands, but just think for one moment what the degree of interdependence is between Soweto and Johannesburg. It is far greater than that between the Republic of South Africa and, say, Vendaland or any of the homelands. Because of these conditions, because of the fact that nowhere else in the world is there such a high degree of dependence of one on another, it is absolutely imperative that a new economic structure must be found, as well as a new political and constitutional structure.</p>

<p>I know that hon. members always come along and quote the example of the three ex-Protectorates. Let us consider a few aspects of the ex-Protectorates. They have, in the first place, never been part of the Union or of the Republic of South Africa. Secondly, although those ex-Protectorates provide a great part of our labour force, the situation only becomes clear once the stage has been reached that the NP policy is fully developed&#x2014;&#x201C;ten voile ontplooi, soos hulle s&#x00EA;&#x201D;&#x2014;because at that stage one will have a situation where the labour force will be entirely foreign.</p>

<p>*Another matter was raised by an hon. member&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Lydenburg&#x2014;when he said that total economic integration is dangerous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>There he says again that it is dangerous. The process of economic integration brought us to our present situation. That process started long ago. It made South Africa strong, and also safe in the sense that both were so dependent upon one another that they simply had to co-operate.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Economic integration is a fact in South Africa. One cannot dispute that. It is not a danger, but a safeguard. One cannot divide the wealth of South Africa. Nowhere else in the worlds does one find exactly the same conditions. The wealth of South Africa has been created through the mutual efforts of both Black and White and all of us have a legitimate share in it. One cannot come with a political design or structure which aims to deprive people of their legitimate share in the wealth of South Africa. [Interjections.] Do those hon. members want to-encourage people to forfeit their legitimate share in the wealth of South Africa&#x003F; Of course not! This is the danger of the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>The economy in Germany has only for a small part been built up with the help of guest labourers from a foreign country, but in South Africa one has a situation that everything one sees, the gold mines, the clothes one wears, the wood in this building, everything contains a Black and White factor. Because of that situation, because we have such a tremendous total dependence on each other, we have to find another political solution. As regards the homelands, quite frankly they should have been developed many years ago along the lines of private initiative and with White capital. If we had done it that way, perhaps those areas would have been less dependent upon South Africa. I agree completely with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that here we are dealing with an interdependence, not just between areas of South Africa, but between the very people of all races in South Africa. Because of that sort of situation which one finds in South Africa, one must move towards the establishment of a new political and economic structure, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has quite clearly stated.</p>

<p>What has been happening to the economic structure which the NP has been trying to build up&#x003F; Because the Government has made it difficult for private enterprise to play its full role in the development of South Africa, it has adopted in the development of the <span class="col_1327-1328" refersTo="page_0681"/>homelands certain socialistic principles. Let us face it. The Government has been trying to develop the homelands along socialistic lines. The result of that was a very slow, retarded growth. If 10 or 20 years ago we made the best use of opportunities and allowed White capital and enterprise to enter the homelands, perhaps those areas would have been less dependent on South Africa and it would have been more in line with what they think their policy should be. As a result of their neglect, they are faced with the situation that their policy is failing. The only alternative in this country is to have&#x2014;and let us be quite frank about it&#x2014;a situation in which you have a sharing of political power and no problems concerning the maintenance of identities of people. Ultimately, whether one likes it or not, one will have to accept a federal concept and develop South Africa along those lines.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the debate which has taken place here this afternoon has furnished incontrovertible proof of the resounding success the NP has had during the 30 years it has been engaged in this immense undertaking. If I have to examine briefly what the three parties on that side of the House have said today, it is a fact that the members of the Independent UP have adopted a positive and a more patriotic attitude now that they have left the labyrinth of the UP. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Albany might as well have been omitted, for that is precisely what we are doing. In actual fact, it was not an amendment, but only a confirmation of the motion moved by the hon. member for Lydenburg. The Independent UP alleges that we could have made greater progress with the policy of separate development and with the granting of independence to the various States within South Africa. I agree that this could have happened, but then the NP should have been in power since before 1948 and the UP should not have wasted so much time in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said that he recognized the regional governments and also recognized that there was interdependence. He alleged that it could not be otherwise, since there are Governments which exercise meaningful powers. But those Governments have not always been there; there have not always been political structures in those homelands and there have not been matters entrusted to them to deal with, because everything was dealt with on their behalf by this Parliament. The powers they have now received, powers which the hon. member recognizes and which he finds satisfactory, were brought into being by the NP in the face of UP opposition. The states they recognize today, they used to call Bantustans, and they ridiculed them. Did they not go about in 1953, when all these people were still in the same party with them, telling everyone to vote for the right to vote again, because the division caused by the NP was going to result in hot-beds of communism which would destroy South Africa&#x003F; Surely that is so. [Interjections.] They fought the creation of those states tooth and nail, because they were opposed to them. Then the hon. member for Edenvale was still fighting for them, but nowadays he is fighting against them.</p>

<p>At that time, when the NP was laying the foundation for the great step which, in the opinion of the NP, would improve South Africa&#x2019;s situation, the UP failed to appreciate it and ridiculed it. Now, however, they are forced to recognize it, for it is written into their policy. It is also written into the policy of the PRP that they will form a federation with those States. The UP and the PRP have both demonstrated today that they accept as facts the homelands, the interdependence between South Africa and the Homelands and the co-operation, not because they want to accept these things, but because they are facts.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall explain if the hon. member wants to know why this was done. The Government took the right step at that stage. [Interjections.] Because South Africa is governed by the NP with its creative powers and strength, it was the only country in the world which was engaged in such an undertaking at that moment. There was no precedent in the world which we could examine to see what mistakes they made that we could learn from. The only <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0682"/>example we had was White South Africa&#x2019;s own history. This showed us how South Africa had been economically exploited and colonialized. The Government of the first decade after 1948 said that it would not allow White capital to operate freely in the homelands because it wanted to protect the Black man from the exploitation to which the White people of South Africa had been subjected. In the second place, the Government did this because it did not want to allow the homelands to be colonialized in the economic sphere, and the third reason was that it wanted to reserve the opportunities in the homelands primarily for the Black man.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale knows exactly what the Tomlinson Commission recommended. The Government decided at the time that it could be done by means of corporations working on behalf of the Black people. Subsequently, however, the African States became independent, and it became clear that people all over the world, who had alleged that they would invest in those countries, did not invest there. Money did not flow into those countries as had been expected; other examples came to light subsequently, and the Black people came to realize that the National Government was working in their interests in the homelands. Because that confidence had been created, Whites could subsequently be allowed in on the agency basis, and later still&#x2014;as the homeland governments developed&#x2014;they themselves could lay down the conditions on which the Whites would be allowed there. The hon. member for Edenvale, who pretends to be an expert in this field, ought to know that the introduction of Whites in the sphere of agriculture, for example, is still a very delicate matter today, because the Black people attach tremendous importance to their land and because they still fear that they will lose their land and that it will fall into the hands of Whites. Even today, when Whites are brought in, care must be taken to make quite sure that it is done in such a way that the Black man does not lose any land, but that it is preserved for him. The White initiative entering the country in this way must be aimed at promoting the development of the homelands.</p>

<p>The PRP gave me the best example in this connection when the hon. member for Bryanston said that he hoped Chief Gatsha Buthelezi would sit in this House one day. I shall indicate in a moment that this is a symptom of the fact that that hon. member does not believe in homelands, that he does not want them and that he only accepts them because he has to. The NP and the nationalism and leaders of the Black peoples have made them a fact and that hon. member cannot stop them. The hon. member made an important statement today, a statement contradicting his own policy. He said that if he could draw the homeland borders, it would be a success, but if we draw them, it will not be successful.</p>

The hon. member went further and accused the White man of South Africa of refusing to give Bophuthatswana land which rightfully belongs to it.

Surely this is a false accusation he has made against the White people of South Africa. Bophuthatswana has all the land to which it is entitled and the Whites have given it some of their land in addition. What is the hon. member doing in making such an allegation which is completely unfounded&#x003F; Surely he is trying to destroy racial harmony in South Africa. That hon. member is not serving the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>The whole discussion which has taken place today has served to prove that there is in fact interdependence and co-operation between the Republic and the homelands. I briefly want to quote a number of great experts in the economic field. I quote what a certain Gierch says in <i>Economic Union between Nations and the Location of Industries</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By reason of agglomeration economies, the abolition of restrictions on trade and factor movements would strengthen the <span class="col_1331-1332" refersTo="page_0683"/>attractiveness of the highly industrialized centres for both labour and capital.</block>

<p>In other words, if the economies of different countries, for example those of South Africa and the homelands, were incorporated into one great economy, as those hon. members would like, it would cause production factors such as labour and capital to be diverted from the less developed areas to the more highly developed areas. That is what they are all advocating today. They say that job reservation should be abolished, that decentralization should be abandoned and that the market mechanism should continue.</p>

<p>They say that the economic laws should apply. However, I say that they are making further attempts to throw dust in the eyes of the homelands and the people of South Africa, the Whites, by saying that they accept the homelands, while in fact they want to strangle the homelands economically. They want to use the economy as a weapon for destroying the homelands.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, this hon. member is the one who does not understand. How do they mean to develop the homelands if they want the people to leave the homelands&#x003F; With what means do they want to develop the homelands&#x003F; How can they develop the homelands if no capital enters the homelands, channelled in that direction by this Government in terms of section 3 of the Environment Planning Act, 1967&#x003F; I should like to read to the hon. member an article from a newspaper dealing with events in Gazankulu. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gazankulu, the small homeland with fewer than a million inhabitants, is a homeland in a hurry. Near the town a huge new dam is taking shape with irrigation canals cutting straight through the bush and the rocky hills to where the water is needed for irrigation schemes. Local women work in the blistering sun unloading rocks off trucks which others will use to cover the huge earth wall. Women do the work because their men are away, working in the urban areas.</block>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For this reason I want to deal with the question of interdependence and I maintain that there can only be interdependence if the various Governments have meaningful powers and if they have economic strength. Because these things have been achieved and because they will be achieved to an increasing extent in the future, the interdependence and the co-operation will have to grow. For this reason I want to tell the hon. members that interdependence is determined by a number of factors, and these are the assets which each of these countries possesses. This is the one factor which determines whether or not there can be interdependence and whether there can be co-operation. The second factor is the interests of the various countries and the third factor which determines interdependence is the various objectives of the countries. When one comes to the basis, I want to tell those hon. members that as far as the economic production factors are concerned, namely land, labour, capital and management, South Africa is better endowed in respect of two of these, i.e. management and capital. However, in respect of the other two, i.e. labour and a potential which is as yet unexploited, but which may be exploited, the homelands are better endowed, relatively speaking. This provides the basis for interdependence, and hon. members on this side of the House have repeatedly pointed out the number of people who come from the homelands to work here and who invest in the homelands the money they earn here. Capital is required in the homelands for developing the territories, but <span class="col_1333-1334" refersTo="page_0684"/>those hon. members do not want the people to live in the homelands. They want as many as possible of them to come h&#x00E8;re so that they may spend their money here and not in the homelands. Not only do they want to remove the labour from the homelands; they also want to remove the capital. Now I ask the hon. members why they say that they want to develop the homelands. Why not be honest and say that they do not want to develop them&#x003F; They are in favour of a unitary state. The only reason why they say there must be homelands and why they accept them is that they are a fact, but they want to use the economic axe to kill the homelands.</p>

<p>This, then, is the basis which determines interdependence. The first and most important asset which any country has is its people. The people from the homelands earn that money, but some of South Africa&#x2019;s people are also working in the homelands, providing what the homelands need so urgently, namely managerial skill. In the same way as they provide us with labour, South Africa provides them with that production factor, namely management. It is true that we should have liked to do much more than we are doing at the moment, but because of the shortage of manpower, we can only do what we can.</p>

<p>According to the 1970 census, there were 8 866 Whites economically active within the homelands. Those Whites had better academic qualifications than the average economically active White person of South Africa. In other words, those people of South Africa who find themselves in the homelands are the people best qualified to help the homelands perform that very managerial function. I should like to give hon. members a few statistics. Of those 8 866 persons, 4 227 had a Std. 10 certificate or higher qualification. If they did not have a Std. 10 certificate, they had a diploma. That represents 47% of them. Of the economically active people of South Africa, only 41% had those qualifications. Of the 8 866 economically active Whites in the homelands, 8,6% are graduates, while only 5,6% of the economically active people in South Africa have degrees. This is a typical example of interdependence in one field. One man has a surplus of one thing and another man has a surplus of something else. These are exchanged to everyone&#x2019;s advantage and in the interests of all.</p>

<p>However, there are many other assets. There are minerals in the homelands, and some of those minerals lie on either side of our common borders, on the other side of the border, inside the homeland, and on this side, inside South Africa. Those minerals must be exploited to the advantage of both, and for that reason there must be co-operation in order to exploit that wealth to everyone&#x2019;s advantage, because there is interdependence. The same applies to water, for there are rivers forming the border between South Africa and the homelands. In order to exploit that source of life to the advantage of both, there must be co-operation, understanding and the will to develop, to make progress and to exploit. In this way, there are many other things as well, but I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>I should like to come to the question of common interests which influence these matters. The homelands of South Africa have already, by way of legislation, been placed in exactly the same position in respect of the marketing of agricultural products as the one in which the independent States of Southern Africa have been placed. Legally speaking, they are in exactly the same position, because agriculture and agricultural marketing have been entrusted exclusively to the homeland governments and are dealt with by them. We advise them when they ask us for advice or when they desire this, but that function is completely in their hands. In respect of that matter, therefore, they already find themselves in exactly the same position as that of Lesotho, Botswana, Malawi and any other State. This also applies in respect of certain financial and monetary matters, including customs. In this connection they are in the same position as other independent States. Arrangements are made with them in the same way as they are made with other States.</p>

<p>There are many matters of common interest between us and the homelands, matters in respect of which we are dependent on one another and in respect of which there is co-operation. One thinks, for example, of the problem of stock diseases. South Africa is a stock-importing country, and South Africa makes veterinary services available to the homelands and to the countries of Africa as well, in order to promote the production of beef. Because these services are made available, the animals come to our markets and they fulfil a need in South Africa. Mutual arrangements <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0685"/>have to be made for the transportation of cattle and for the treatment they are to receive before crossing a border, in order to combat the spreading of stock diseases. In regard to all these and similar matters&#x2014;I cannot refer to all the matters concerned, for my time has almost expired&#x2014;there is one hundred per cent co-operation between us and the homelands. This also applies, for example, in respect of plant diseases, public health, etc.&#x2014;there are a great number of these matters. I have a list here of more than 30 matters of this kind, in respect of which co-operation is already taking place between us and the homelands at this stage. As the homelands continue to develop constitutionally, economically and in many other fields, they will enter an increasing number of spheres and the scope of their undertakings will grow. For this reason, the co-operation will have to increase in the future, in the interests of everyone.</p>

<p>There are still other matters of common interest. We all have ideals. Each of these peoples shows unmistakable signs of wanting to become great, of wanting to become strong and to grow. The Whites show these signs and the Black peoples show them as well. These peoples and their responsible Governments all show that in order to realize the ideal cherished by each of them, they must have authority over themselves and they must have political independence, and that there must be co-operation in many fields. In this way, too, there must be co-operation in the field of security. One of the greatest safeguards we have in respect of our security is the fact that we find ourselves in precisely this situation. Each one has authority over itself and a course which it pursues by itself, but our interests, including our security interests, are so interwoven that the fact that we are placed as we are is in itself a safeguard. Our own interests compel us to co-operate with one another and to bear with one another if we are not all to end up under communist domination.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the other side said that the policy of the NP had failed. In fact, the policy of the NP has not failed. The fact is that after only 30 years, we have progressed to the point where the first homeland has already become an independent country &#x2026;</p>

<p>Before the 30 years have passed, a second homeland will have become independent. In addition, there is the greatest measure of understanding and co-operation. The most gratifying of all is that when one visits the homelands and speaks to the leaders and the ordinary people, one finds that there is a positive spirit among them. I find it very distressing, after having come into contact during the recess with homelands and with people who are struggling to make progress, people who are forging ahead, to be confronted in the House of Assembly with people who are more advanced and who ought to know better, but who have no feeling for this, who do not understand it and, worst of all, who do not show any desire to understand and to help and encourage those people. The things which the people do in the homelands are belittled. The homelands are dismissed as backward regions. However, their homeland is their most precious possession; it is their fatherland. But the homelands are belittled and those people are told, &#x201C;Leave your fatherland and come to the White man&#x2019;s land.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one has been listening to speeches in this hon. House for a long time, inevitably certain meanings and certain images come to mind. One image which occurs to me, is the image of separate development. Apartheid, separate development, has now reached the stage of achieving a latitude, in which it has the same meaning for some people as religion has in broad terms, it has become meaningless. To some people it has become a supermarket, a supermarket where everyone can take what he wants and interpret it as he likes. The logical consequences of apartheid now have to be responsible for every specious argument, every idea, every speculative thought expressed. The quintessence or the essential purpose of apartheid is now being broadened out into an undefined, aimless wandering about with ideas.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>By all hon. members of the PRP and by some people in our own ranks. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, the emphasis is now being shifted away from the people and towards the State. Is it not true that today more importance is attached to diplomats than to the nation, than to the people who make up the nation, the workers, the teachers, the farmer on his farm, the productive contributor towards the nation&#x2019;s capital&#x003F; Some people see our salvation in what the diplomat does for us. I also want to point out that the task of the diplomat is made less effective due to the norms, the rules and the demands made by the seekers for international political power and by their lackeys. This is true in particular in regard to South Africa, because the norms and the demands made are such that the Republic of South Africa as a State will only be popular if it complies with the norms and demands made by those political seekers for power and their lackeys. However, then there will no longer be any nation left; specifically, no White nation. I therefore believe that those things which have to do with the strengthening of our nation and its power structure, needs must be placed on the list of priorities without delay. When we discuss the power structure, we must take note of the fact that we are today reaping the fruits of the difference in the power structures which the colonial powers had here in Africa. There is a difference between our power structure and that which the colonial powers had here. Their power structures were based outside South Africa. They were based outside the colonies. Our power structure is based within the geographic confines of our fatherland.</p>

<p>Today, we speak to people in the outside world who prescribe norms and demands to us, people whose power structure is based elsewhere, people whose power structure, which must supposedly make decisions for us, is situated elsewhere. Is it not outrageous that the EEG said at its latest meeting that South West Africa will only be recognized if a power structure outside South West Africa, the OAU approves&#x003F; Only then will they, too, agree!</p>

<p>What is happening in Rhodesia at the moment&#x003F; In spite of the efforts made by Rhodesia to achieve an internal agreement, <span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_0687"/>the outside world says that it cannot recognize this because there are foreign bodies, other power structures, front-line presidents who have to be consulted before a dispensation satisfactory to everyone in Rhodesia can be established. We must shift the emphasis onto the strengthening of our own basis of authority which is situated here in our own country. A power structure does not consist of a group of commercial negotiators or Press philosophers or academic speculators and their ideas. Nor does it consist of people who speculate about our economic position. Our power structure derives from and was created by ourselves. It is anchored in our natural resources and in the use we make of those resources, and in our own creative courage. It is anchored in our own people. It is a matter of urgent and vital importance that we look to our people. I am afraid that the rift between the differences in identifying the threat to our existence in this country is becoming deeper and deeper. There are significant thousands of people who see our salvation and escape from the threats facing us, in a settlement with the outside world, in a partial acceptance of the requirements and norms which are prescribed to us by the outside world. There are also those who see our salvation in arming and strengthening of our own people and our own national character.</p>

<p>What is confronting us in our country&#x003F; I fully believe with heart and soul that we shall not be able to meet the threats against our country successfully unless we consider a few cardinal points within our nation. By the year 2000 we will have a population of approximately 50 million people in South Africa. If we consider what proportion of our country&#x2019;s total surface area of 143 million morgen of land is productive arable land from which food can be produced, we find it amounts to approximately 17 million morgen. If 17 million morgen have to feed 50 million people, it means that every person would have to be fed from approximately 0,7 morgen of land. Even if we were to increase our volume of production by means of improved breeding methods and improved production methods and even if we should double it, it would still mean that we shall not be able to feed our people as we should in order to eliminate hardship and poverty, in view of the higher demands we set ourselves, <i>inter alia,</i> a higher standard of living and an ever-increasing national domestic product.</p>

<p>We shall have to take the following fact into account: In 1975, 48 000 Whites, 19 000 Coloured, 8 000 Asians and 207 000 Bantu entered the labour force&#x2014;a total of 282 000 new workers entering the labour force. The outside world cannot absorb their labour. The outside world is geared for an ever-increasing standard of living and therefore will not be able to help us. We will definitely not be able to fend for ourselves with our present economically active population. In 1976 we had 1 802 000 economically active Whites, 826 000 economically active Coloureds, 229 000 economically active Asians and 7 209 000 economically active Bantu&#x2014;a total of 10 066 000 economically active people. However, in contrast, there are only 5 million people who are skilled or semi-skilled in the technological, academic, scientific and agricultural spheres.</p>

<p>Let us look at the present position as regards income. At the end of last year the average annual income of our Whites was R2 500; that of the Asians, R600; that of the Coloureds, R500; and that of the Blacks, R270. In terms of the standard of living and income of the First World&#x2014;that is to say, the developed world&#x2014;the vast majority of our population belongs to the Third World and some to the Fourth World.</p>

<p>What image does our country create for us when we leave here&#x003F; It is an image of extravagance in comparison with poverty and want, an image of unjustified ease and luxury in comparison with enormous emotional and hate-generating frustration. If we only look beyond our borders, we must prepare ourselves for the development of a contrast in Africa, something which will be and will form the breeding ground for frustration and rejection of authority in our own power structure for years and decades to come. The colonial powers left Africa in poverty, ignorance and pestilence.</p>

<p>This is largely the basis of the negation, or inability, or instinctive hostility of the Blacks in Africa towards us as Whites. They judge us by the criteria applicable to the old colonial powers. We have to pay the price today. The finest Defence Force and the finest weapons can only afford us up to 40% protection. The capital we need for defence, for training and for an effective and quantitative ethnic policy is being swallowed up by a <span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0688"/>love of ease, an extravagant community living beyond its means, a false patriotism, a false evaluation which considers achievements in the sporting sphere to be sacrosanct and which causes us to look to our diplomats to save us from the fix we are in. We have prided ourselves on our resources. We have gone from platform to platform saying that we are one of the richest countries in the world&#x2014;name it and South Africa has it. We prided ourselves on our strategic position as regards the Cape&#x2019;s strategic situation and in our hour of oppression fixed our hope upon our geographic and strategically situated position. Bristling with pride, we have prided ourselves on our ancestors. We said that if they could surmount these problems; why could we not do so&#x003F; We went from pulpit to pulpit and from platform to platform and said that we were a Christian nation. We hid behind this and tried to find our salvation in it. If something goes wrong, we say that the liberals and communists are the cause of it. We looked for reasons for everything. If things go wrong with the economy of our country, we say that the petrol price or the gold price is causing it. I think that we have been making a mistake. Our evaluations have been incorrect. We are experiencing a crisis now, and our men are at the border. They are prepared to give their lives, but what are we doing&#x003F; What is this nation doing, this nation which has been so proud of its Christian forebears, this nation whose sons are now at the border, this nation which tells us day and night that we are experiencing a crisis&#x003F; What is this nation doing in a crisis&#x003F; Our holiday resorts are fuller than they have ever been, for a longer period than ever before in our history.</p>

<p>The first sortie of our petrol and speed regulations failed pitifully. We are still struggling with our imports, but just take a look at the unnecessary imported articles which this nation consumes. We have been practising deceit on a large scale. I can mention examples of deceit which are practised today: price offences, profiteering and ignoring the lesson which the crisis through which we are living, should be teaching us. We are hiding behind the clock. We thrust the malodorous finger of our own interests into the eyes of our nation and of our authorities. We as Whites have became entirely dependent upon Black labour. If we had to take the Blacks in the north of our country out of our factories and out of our economic structure, it would collapse entirely. This is a fact which we must face up to. We are rapidly strengthening the grip of agitators who are defying the authority of a country on the basis of the internal weakness of every one of us in this geographically confined country of ours.</p>

<p>I was at primary school 55 years ago and in spite of the new demands which the new world in which we are living makes of us all, the syllabus and what is taught in our primary schools today is identical to what Cas Greyling learned 55 years ago. The subject matter taught has not been correlated and adapted to the new demands being made. We have not bred a man and a child for whom petrol regulations are unnecessary and we have not bred people who will escape the accusation which I am making today, namely that we have a reckless White population and reckless subordinates whose guardians we pride ourselves as being. The subject matter of our education has not succeeded in leading our young people into the arena which the twilight years of the 20th century have brought us to. Meaningless&#x2014;I say this emphatically and deliberately&#x2014;ineffectual programmes of education, projected on the acceptance that this luxurious community will exist forever, are being applied in our schools today. We have allowed ourselves to be led into a state of confusion by warped, misplaced humanist and speculative ideas. What was once secondary, now demands to be made primary. It is vital that we should once again, as a matter of urgency and without delay, institute an inquiry into the programme of education of our nation. This is vital. We made a great fuss&#x2014;I agree&#x2014;about having to improve the lot of the educator, but we cannot stop there. We shall have to investigate the content of education so that the child of today, who is the father of the nation of tomorrow, can be introduced to the requirements and demands which economic and spiritual preparedness will make of him. Hon. members must please not maintain that economic preparedness implies that one has to save a certain amount of money. The components which we must build into our children in order to guide them towards real and effective economic preparedness, are legion. A nation which acts as our nation does in a moment of crisis, is certainly not an <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_0689"/>economically resilient nation. The resources which God gave us in South Africa&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;will not be of any advantage and will be of no effective use to us, if we do not have a spiritually and economically resilient nation to exploit these resources. Therefore South Africa cannot deal effectively with the problem of the labour flow to the labour market, intending or hoping that we shall escape social unrest and poverty. We shall not be able to solve the problem of the squatters by physically shifting them to another place.</p>

<p>No, I do not agree with those hon. members on that score. We shall only be able to solve the problem by bringing our economic vitality and growth potential into line with out population growth.</p>

<p>It must therefore be stated as a matter of primary importance that a quantitative ethnic policy has become an absolute necessity for us. The logical consequences of separate development are that it gives us the key to the right of self-determination and a sphere of sovereignty which can be accepted and recognized by everyone and in which we will be able to talk about the problem which is not only a South African but a world-wide one, freely and without suspicion or insinuation. This demands a quantitative, purposeful, full-scale action which is clothed in status by the authority. It is an action which will cost a great deal of money and demand a great deal of consultation. Gen. Hertzog began to enunciate the segregation policy 64 years ago. For 64 years we sweated and struggled, until 26 October 1976, when the sovereign independence of the Transkei was recognized for the first time. The realization of what I am asking for is going to be a long process, but it is the only process which will last. It is the only step we can take to deal with the dilemma of the terror of numbers, because the Coloureds and the Blacks in the White areas as well as those from the homelands will always be dependent on us to a greater or lesser degree. I am not afraid of the terrorists on our borders. I cannot think of a single nation in history which was destroyed by military action. Nor do I know of any nation which was brought down by the economic sanctions of another. However, I do know of peoples and kingdoms which disappeared entirely from history and from the face of the earth, due to a lack of preparedness. If we do not make the revaluation of the subject matter of our education a matter of primary importance, so that the demands which this era and this century make of us can be complied with, apartheid alone will not save us.</p>

<p>Hon. members may go ahead and shout &#x201C;Hear, hear&#x201D; but I repeat that apartheid alone, as a measure to effect political separation, will not save us. It is vital that we should look to the heart of our nation. It is the duty of the authorities to provide guidance and act in a purposeful manner. It is also the duty of the authorities to entrench our youth, because our youth do not get any entrenchment from a nation which acts like this nation of mine does in an hour of crisis. I say this although I really love that nation as much as any of the hon. members. However, the example set and the entrenchment provided by the adults to our young people today, is like a pitiful image or picture of what I ought to see before me. The responsibility rests squarely upon the shoulders of our authorities and of all of us to take the lead so that we may entrench our young people, who are the fathers of the nation of tomorrow, and initials them into the demands made by the new times and new political developments as well as the new political and economic developments and the new social structures which have come to the fore.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Carletonville, after half an hour of haranguing this House about political development, made the following significant statement, that there are peoples who lost their way in the history of the world through a lack of preparedness. I agree with that hon. member, but I wish he would get that message across to the Cabinet, which represents him in this House, because it is that very lack of preparedness which has brought South Africa to the state it is in today. There is not only the fear of the terrorists on our borders, terrorists which the hon. member says he does not fear at all, but there are also the fears of internal unrest, economic fears, <span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_0690"/>etc., all of which have been brought about through that Cabinet failing to create, within South Africa, a preparedness or ability to meet the crisis we are facing.</p>

<p>The hon. member says apartheid cannot save us. Never before have we heard from that hon. member&#x2019;s lips a saying of such wisdom and foresight, but I wonder when he will be able to get that message across to his colleagues in the Cabinet. I believe that the harm that the philosophy of apartheid has done to South Africa is what has brought South Africa to the position of being virtually on its knees today.</p>

<p>It is that same apartheid which has caused our troubles on our borders by bringing these people to our borders. That is the excuse they are using. It is that apartheid that has caused the unrest that just about tore the heart out of South Africa in the second half of last year and which is still going on; it has not ended yet. It is that apartheid which has brought South Africa to the economic crisis we face today. I therefore think the time has come for us to bring this debate back to where it should be, and that is the realm of economics and the effect of the Government&#x2019;s policy on the man in the street, particularly as far as that policy affects his pocket and his standard of living. I want to remind the House this afternoon of the amendment that was moved by my friend, the hon. member for Constantia, on Wednesday of last week when he moved&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while recognizing the need for adequate expenditure on defence to deal with threats to our security, declines to pass the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill until the Government, <i>inter alia,</i> takes steps to deal effectively with the critical economic, financial and political problems facing the Republic in order to ensure its safety and future prosperity.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I hope that the hon. member for Carletonville will learn the lesson inherent in this amendment. I believe the attention of the House should return to that amendment and to a measure which was introduced by the hon. the Minister of Finance as a financial and economic measure.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance misled the country on Monday of last week when he introduced this measure. I believe he painted far too rosy a picture.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that the facts are there. Facts have been presented during this debate, however, to refute many of the facts the hon. the Minister presented, and I hope to produce some more facts a little later to refute those arguments and in some way to bring this matter back onto an even keel. I do not believe the public must be left to live in a fool&#x2019;s paradise as a result of the enthusiasm of this hon. Minister for what is, in fact, a lost cause. There were headlines reading: &#x201C;Horwood forecasts economic upswing.&#x201D; Where is it&#x003F; No one has seen any signs of it. If we do not have an economic upswing, however, this country is really going to be in trouble. It rests with that hon. Minister and his Cabinet to see to it that we do have an economic upswing. He went on to speak about unemployment, a matter I shall deal with a little later. He also spoke about the fact that the rate of inflation had dropped.</p>

<p>I think, however, he went a long way towards misleading the general public when he spoke about inflation. I have a copy of his speech here, and I quote (Hansard, 7/2, p. C. 1)&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps in a small business. But if it concerns a small business in terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio, that small business affects everyone of us. The people outside are being lulled into a false sense of security by the rosy words that come from the hon. the Minister. He knows it is a false comparison he is making. He knows that in 12 months the cost of living has gone up by more than 11&#x00BD;%. Yet he talks of 9%. He said: &#x201C;Dit is verblydend.&#x201D; Even with the figure at 9%, he is satisfied with it. I do not believe that anybody should be satisfied with that.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also compared the increases of the last quarter of the year with those of the third quarter of the year. The hon. the Minister must know that in the last quarter of the year the least number of increases in commodity prices occur because in that quarter factories are slowing down, production is at the end of its run and production costs are the lowest of the whole year.

<p>The hon. the Minister says I am talking rubbish. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: Why did he take the unemployment figure as at June 1976 and not as at 31 December 1976&#x003F; He did so for exactly the same reason. He chooses those figures which he thinks will best suit his case, because he knows he has a weak case when he tries to tell the people of South Africa they are living well. He must go out and meet the housewives. He must go into the supermarkets and talk to them because they have found that the price of almost every commodity they buy has gone up in the last month by another 10% or 12%. He knows full well that the price of foodstuffs has gone up by nearly 15% in the last year. He talked of 9% on the &#x201C;seisoensaangesuiwerde syfer&#x201D;&#x2014;those are the words he used. Yet he knows very well that the price of foodstuffs and also the cost of living for non-White people has gone up by well in excess of 15%. Why has it gone up&#x003F; It has gone up because of the mismanagement of the economy.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who is present at the moment, has also played a part in this. We are not going to talk about cheese this afternoon&#x2014;let me put his mind at rest on that score. That is in such a mess that is impossible for me to deal with that in the short time I have at my disposal this afternoon. However, what did the hon. the Minister of Agriculture do in respect of the price of bread&#x003F; In the last year he has put up the price of bread by 25% for a loaf of white bread. The price has gone up by 4c on a white loaf and 3c on a brown loaf. Why did he put the price of bread up&#x003F;</p>

In point of fact less than a quarter of a cent went to the wheat farmer. Did the miller get any increase&#x003F; No, the miller got nothing. The baker got nothing. The supermarket owner or distributor got nothing either. In other words, 3%c of the 4c increase went into the pocket of the hon. the Minister of Finance because that hon. Minister had to reduce his subsidy from R130 million to a little over R65 million. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister says that that is quite right. I am glad that he acknowledges it. What it amounts to, is that the people of South Africa were taxed an extra 3%c on a loaf of white bread to fill the coffers of the hon. the Minister of Finance. R65 million went towards helping to balance the budget.</p>

<p>I shall reply to you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I believe he has R400 million of the importer&#x2019;s money, money on which the importer is paying interest, which is today pushing up the cost of living because importers are paying more for their imports as a result of the money the hon. the Minister of Finance has taken away. He has now cancelled that scheme, but I ask him again: Has he repaid that money&#x003F; When is he going to repay it, or is he going to keep it for another six months, interest free&#x003F; He has had R400 million out of the pockets of business in South Africa for the last six months, interest free, simply so that the Government can have some money to balance its books because, as I have said before, the Government was insolvent. It needed the R65 million out of the pockets of the housewives for the bread and it needed the R400 million from the import deposit scheme simply to balance its budget.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of unemployment. It is hard enough for people to have to battle to live and to battle to get money to pay for food. When they are unemployed as well, then the situation becomes much worse. But what does the hon. the Minister say&#x003F; He said that there were 22 581 persons unemployed in December 1976 as compared with 11 492 in 1975, an increase of nearly 100% in one year. He went on and said that as a percentage this figure was very small and that it was nothing really to worry about. Has the hon. the Minister taken into consideration the number of unemployed people who are not registered with the Unemployment Insurance Commissioner&#x003F; I do not believe that the hon. the Minister has because if he had taken the trouble to get out of this House, to come away from his ivory tower, and to meet with the man in the street, he would have found that there are thousands and thousands of unemployed people today who are not part of the figures which he has given. The hon. the Minister must know that last year in excess of 65 000 pupils wrote matric.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of those 65 000 people are unemployed today. Those members who, like me, have contact with the young people in South Africa today, will know that this is a terribly worrying aspect. There are numbers of people who matriculated last year and who graduated from university, who are unable to get employment, and they do not appear in the figures which the hon. the Minister gave. Under the system which is applied in this country, until such time as they have worked and have been registered as workers and have contributed to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, they do not appear in the unemployment figures. So when the hon. the Minister talks about 22 000 people unemployed, which represents only 1,2%, as he puts it, I believe <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0693"/>that the true figures of unemployed Whites, Indians and Coloureds is more than double that because of the young people today who are walking the streets trying to get jobs, jobs which are not available to them because of the economic policy which the Government has followed. I do not believe that even the hon. the Minister of Finance can refute that statement.</p>

<p>When we come to the African people, the hon. the Minister says he does not accept the figures which have been given by various authorities. The survey unit of the University of Pretoria has given a figure of 700 000 unemployed Africans. The hon. the Minister says he is prepared to accept that in the year from June 1975 to June 1976 there were 38 000 in the urban areas and 62 000 additional unemployed Africans in the rural areas, which makes a total increase of 100 000. Referring to these figures in his speech the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; wat in die omstandighede nie as buitensporig voorkom nie.</block>

<p>Not exceptional, Sir! It is only another 100 000 people out of employment, that is all. The hon. the Minister says that it is not exceptional. When one looks at this figure as a percentage, accepting that the hon. the Minister will abide by the figures given by the University of Pretoria, this represents something like an increase of 20% over the unemployment figures of 1975. Furthermore, that figure was as at June 1976. What about the end-of-year laying-off&#x003F; What about the building industry which did not take its people back at the beginning of January when they restarted the new year&#x003F; What about those who were paid off when the work ran out at the end of 1976&#x003F; Those figures are not taken into consideration at all. I believe that the hon. the Minister must be sure and that he must present the full facts when he presents a picture like this.</p>

<p>I believe that South Africa is in trouble. It is not only in trouble from an international economic position, but I believe that internally it is in trouble. The hon. the Minister knows of the unrest that we have had. It has been politically inspired; I am prepared to concede that, but one must bear in mind that that is coupled with the economic problems which the non-White people are facing today, their daily struggle to make ends meet, and that that is coupled in turn with massive unemployment. We are getting to the stage where unemployment amongst the African people is massive. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government does not keep these figures, if we accept the most conservative figures, we are getting close to a million unemployed today amongst the African people. This is a situation that, I believe, South Africa cannot tolerate any longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that this hon. Minister of Finance and the policy which he is furthering on behalf of the NP Government played a large part in exacerbating the situation, and I therefore support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a temptation for any Nationalist today to poke fun at the hon. Opposition a little because of the tremendous confusion which is prevailing in their ranks. But that is not what I am going to do today. I would prefer to address myself to hon. Opposition members who feel as we do about matters relating to our fatherland, hon. members who have an honest and sympathetic approach to the problems of South Africa. South Africa, in exactly the same way as other Christian democratic countries in the world, is waging a struggle for survival, particularly because Russia, in its desire for world domination, has its eye on South Africa and on Africa. If it cannot gain control of these territories, it cannot succeed in its efforts to achieve world domination. That is why our struggle is a struggle for survival. That is why I say that these are such serious times that we cannot waste our time on jokes, but should instead, talk to those hon. members of the Opposition who think as we think and feel as we feel.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had an unfortunate betrothal of political views and of political parties in this House. It was unfortunate for South Africa as well as this House. I am pleased to hear that that unfortunate political betrothal was broken off over the weekend for we &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes at my disposal I should like to confine myself today to those people who feel about South Africa as I and other Nationalists do. Today I am not going to be unparliamentary by accusing any hon. member or group of acting in a deliberately unpatriotic way towards South Africa. Patriotism is a concept which is interpreted in various ways by various people. Sitting in those benches opposite are many people of whom I have come to realize over the years I have known them that they feel exactly as I do about South Africa and that they have the same love for South Africa as I have. Politically we do differ. In many respects we differ widely from one another, but I want to say at once that our conception of what patriotism is is identical. Today I want to address myself to them and tell them that I am pleased that they have disengaged themselves from a political betrothal which definitely had a very unfavourable effect on them. I want to mention a few examples. On Wednesday, when we were listening to the hon. the Minister of Finance introducing the little budget, and the hon. the Minister said very soberly that South Africa was being affected by certain financial tendencies in the world and that South Africa was having a hard time of it, jeers and cat-calls went up from those benches which were like a slap in the face. I expected this of certain people, but from certain other people in those benches I found it shocking.</p>

<p>The second example to which I want to refer was when the hon. the Minister of Community Development was speaking about squatters, people who are squatting illegally and have become a danger to themselves and to the community around them. There were cat-calls, and irresponsible noises went up from those benches. I am thinking for example of the hon. member for Wynberg who asked what laws were being broken by those people and who had made those laws. Surely that is irresponsible language. Now that the betrothal has been broken off, I trust that we are going to be rid of that type of language in this House, in particular on the part of that party. I am not talking about the other people. It is not going to help them simply to break off the betrothal. My advice to them is: Get rid of your Japies, of certain professors in your ranks, of your &#x201C;butterbulls&#x201D; and your &#x201C;bittermouths&#x201D; and then there will be hope again for the UP in the years to come and they can again become a worthy Opposition in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to say in all earnest, Sir, that we find ourselves involved in a war of propaganda in the world. Communist countries, with Russia and China in the lead, are waging a war of propaganda, and all of us in South Africa should be very careful what we say in these times. Every word spoken in this House and outside this House and written in the newspapers is seized upon with the utmost eagerness to help in that propaganda campaign against South Africa. The communists are propagating incitement against South Africa and they are propagating terror. Every movement, every step we take in South Africa is used by those people against us. Therefore I want to make an appeal to the responsible members in the UP today to return to the days of a responsible Opposition. They must say nothing and do nothing which is conducive to pernicious propaganda. They should rather do something to oppose it, in this House and outside. It is their task as well, and we ask them to support us in this. Internal violence is being stirred up and every word spoken here is being used for that purpose. We are engaged in a serious economic struggle. A sound economy can contribute a great deal to saving South Africa. We need that sound economy in order to arm ourselves, and in order to carry out our policy for the development of separate, independent peoples in South Africa. That policy is succeeding and is the only policy which can save South Africa in these difficult times. For that reason I address myself to the responsible Opposition and ask them to support the Government in its attempt to give the peoples in South Africa their freedom, to give the Bantu population groups their own freedom in their own Bantu homelands, as we have now done in the Transkei. In addition I want to ask them to help us with that great attempt to bring about peaceful co-existence in South Africa for those population groups which traditionally have no homelands but have to live with us in South Africa. We are engaged in forming healthy communities. That is why I turn to the Opposition today and ask them to <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0695"/>help us in this task. There is a collective task for us. We are not asking the Opposition to join us in these benches, for, believe me, we have no more sitting room here on this side, but we are asking them to be a responsible Opposition in the interests of South Africa. Forget about those people and help us to combat them; then you will once more be that old Opposition from the days of General Smuts and General Botha.</p>

<p>You must not forget those old traditions of yours and sink into the mud and quagmire with which you are being threatened by these people. Opposition is always welcomed by the Government and a responsible Opposition is necessary in a democratic country. I want to tell you that you have a very, very important task to perform as an Opposition in South Africa. Then, one day, if you were to become strong enough&#x2014;which might be a little far-fetched&#x2014;to take over the Government, then you have that opportunity.</p>

<p>Help us, too, with the second structure we are working on, viz., the establishment of a pattern in South Africa with which the human dignity of each individual will be recognized, whether in his homeland or in his ethnic context within the borders of the Republic of South Africa. Help us to establish those population communities so that they may occupy the position worthy of them in politics, in society and in the economy. This Government is trying to make this possible for each population group and race. If the Opposition wants to co-operate with us honestly, do they think we would be so petty as to object to their having their own party context and preserving their own party&#x003F; On the contrary. I think that a very good spirit could prevail between the Official Opposition and the Government. For this reason I want to address myself to them today and ask them to leave the things with which they are busying themselves now, and to co-operate with us. This is one of our major tasks, and I believe that by now they should be quite firmly convinced that the creation of separate peoples will succeed. We have already proved this in the Transkei. I believe that within the next two or three years it will have been proved to such an extent that no one will argue about it any more. I appreciate that it is difficult for the Opposition, but they should admit their mistakes and support the Government in this.</p>

<p>We have another policy as well, an internal policy for those population groups which do not have a homeland of their own. We are developing those groups. We state only one condition, i.e. the preservation of a distinctive identity. After we have assured each one of his identity and his right to be able to have a share in the politics of South Africa, there is another tremendous task awaiting us. Our policy is not that of integration. Surely a part of the Opposition have also come to realize this, for they do not believe in integration either, or in surrendering their identity. Recently I have heard hon. members on that side of the House discussing this matter very openly and constructively. We know that some of our friends in the Opposition are not trying to integrate with the non-White peoples, nor are they trying to do so in the political sphere, or am I wrong&#x003F; Some members of our Official Opposition do not believe in these things and that is why they cannot continue their negotiations with the PRP. The PRP is looking for a short cut to integration, to political power-sharing and to Black majority rule in South Africa, The Official Opposition is aware of this, after all, and therefore I am now asking them to support us in our broad, sound policy, for surely they agree with us. I am asking them to remain a healthy Opposition. They have the right to level criticism, but I want to ask them to come forward and be honest with themselves in this regard. Expel those hon. members who are intractable from the party; take back the hon. members sitting here and become once again a fine, great and strong Opposition.</p>

<p>I have respect for the IUP, apart from the fact that they can sometimes kick up quite a fuss, as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town is inclined to do. However, that makes no difference; he remains a splendid fellow for all that. Sometimes he gives us something to laugh at, but surely that is also necessary here in Parliament. However, the hon. member does nothing which is irresponsible in the extreme. That is why I am making an appeal to those people to join us in creating economic opportunities for the other peoples and population groups in South Africa. Let us also create cultural opportunities for them. Hon. members may criticize us freely in respect of the implementation of our policy but they must in heaven&#x2019;s name stop trying to <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0696"/>criticize a policy which people have for the past 28 years now regarded as the policy of this country. This is the road along which we are seeking the salvation of South Africa, and it is ridiculous of those hon. members to keep on wanting to kick against the pricks. Let us rather seek a solution to our problems within the policy of the NP, for we are prepared to make certain concessions.</p>

<p>No, I am not talking to you, for if I am not careful I shall tell you what you are, and then Mr. Speaker will call me to order. I am not going to yield to the temptation today of discussing patriotism with that hon. member, for it could get me into trouble. I want to ask the official Opposition to co-operate with us to create a healthy South Africa, for then we shall once again have the earlier <i>status quo,</i> i.e. that there will be two respectable parties in the House of Assembly which can debate matters with one another, an Opposition and a Government. If the Opposition, at the next election, acts patriotically and in terms of the recipe we all know, we shall be better off than before the last election. There will not again be an Opposition, a Government and a one-woman party in South Africa. There will be a Government and there will be a Parliament consisting of a strong and healthy Government, a Government which will inevitably be a little stronger than it is at present. However, there will also be an Opposition consisting of patriotic members who think and feel as we do about patriotism.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Namaqualand appealed to the Opposition&#x2014;and I think he was referring specifically to this group when he spoke of a responsible Opposition&#x2014;to exercise caution, since South Africa was involved in a propaganda war, in what it said and for everyone to set a watch before his mouth. The hon. member also asked us to support the Government in its attempt to give peoples their independence. Surely it is not necessary for me to repeat for the hon. member what we have been doing since we have been sitting here as a group, which is to act as responsibly as possible under the circumstances in which South Africa finds itself today.</p>

<p>The hon. member will see in the course of my speech in what direction this side of the House will move. However, the hon. member need not be so inquisitive. Usually a Chief Whip should only be curious about what is happening to members of his own party and not with members of the opposite side.</p>

<p>The words of the hon. member for Namaqualand came across to us as being very sincere and we can tell the hon. member that we shall act in that spirit in South Africa, because we realize that the situation is serious and we also know that the economy as well as the security of this country today leaves much to be desired and that it is essential for that reason for everyone in South Africa to stand together to put the economy into order and to keep national security at such a level that no other country will have any chance of gaining any foothold whatsoever within our borders.</p>

<p>Since Thursday I have had the opportunity to move around outside this House for some time and especially to note what the public outside is saying about the economic situation in the country. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance, if he is not aware of this already, that a spirit of pessimism prevails amongst members of the public about the economic position of the country. People are shocked because of the collapse of certain top companies. This came as a considerable shock to the public. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it surprised me to observe even in the rural areas, even in the smallest towns, a high level of unemployment amongst the people, especially amongst the non-White groups. This is a major source of anxiety to people who think and reason about these matters. The feeling is that this matter should be submitted to the Government for attention. Moreover, I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that the people outside are in no mood to absorb any major increase in taxation in the near future. The public is in fact prepared to accept that our economy is strongly influenced by what is happening outside our borders. Most of the people who are informed, realize that Europe is still experiencing a major recession and that unemployment figures in Europe are high. <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0697"/>Even in a country like West Germany there are many graduates who are unemployed, and in America there are approximately 8 million unemployed. That is why South Africa cannot derive any benefit today from the expectation that the recession abroad will be converted into a time of prosperity. Consequently we do not find it strange either that there is a lack of capital coming to South Africa today. Apparently there is a shortage of essential, badly needed capital everywhere in the world. For that reason one will also find that merely a small stream of foreign capital is flowing to South Africa under the present circumstances. It is also very clear that the foreign investor has a lack of confidence in Southern Africa. That lack of confidence can be attributed to the fact that the foreign investor is sceptical about the ability of the White man in South Africa to maintain civilized standards. He is sceptical because he believes that we and Rhodesia will go the same way in Southern Africa as Mozambique and Angola and will get Black majority Governments. It is not so much a question of a failure to effect changes which are necessary in South Africa. They think that we shall probably not be able to maintain our standards here. That is why there is a lack of confidence in the future of Southern Africa. South Africa&#x2014;the State and the Government&#x2014;will have to make a definite attempt in this regard to cause the foreign investor to regain his confidence in South Africa. That is why all changes that have to be made, for example, essential changes to improve race relations, should take place at all times against the background of orderly progress&#x2014;with the preservation of law and order as a very important priority&#x2014;if we want to restore confidence in Southern Africa. Co-operation and progress cannot be created on a basis of licentiousness and lawlessness. If those aspects were to be removed, I am sure that confidence in South Africa would be restored. For that reason we must endeavour at all times to absorb the Black man who is on the side of development and progress into a broad spirit of South Africanism. The advanced and civilized Black man should be the partner in building a better South Africa. We do not believe that they are the people who are seeking confrontation. Nor are they seeking polarization. However, it is a duty we have, we as the leaders in this country, to make those people our partners in building a better country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand asked us to support the Government in certain things. I am going to submit certain matters to the Government now, and I hope they will receive attention from the Government in due course. The Government is dealing with plans to move away from discrimination on grounds of colour alone, a development which we welcome. However, we are entitled to know what progress has been made on that road and what progress has been made with the committee that is doing this work. For that reason I accept the suggestion of the hon. member for Namaqualand that we must help, especially now that the Government knows that this group in Parliament does not want to turn South Africa upside down. So has the time not arrived for the Cabinet committee concerned to listen also to what we have to say in this regard&#x003F; We could possibly make a valuable contribution in this regard. So far it is a creation of the Cabinet itself. There should be the largest degree of unanimity possible in South Africa about these matters. Unless they are attempted on the broadest possible basis, one should be careful that there is no reaction from the left or the right which might possibly harm such an initiative. For the sake of sound race relations such a state of affairs should be avoided at all costs. I do not want to claim that we on this side have all the answers, because that is impossible, but we may have a point of view which affects an aspect of this matter and ought to be heard, and if it is at all possible for the Government or the Cabinet Committee to hear our viewpoint in this regard, I believe they should do so.</p>

<p>A Cabinet Committee has also been appointed to investigate the question of the way in which the Coloureds and Indians may be given an effective voice, over and above that which they have in the joint Cabinet Council. This is the committee which is to make recommendations on possible ways of moving away from and substituting something better for the Westminster system. It is in the national interest that this should be done, but here, too, we have an area in respect of which there should be the largest degree of co-operation possible in South Africa, because it can have far-reaching consequences for South Africa. Our group is also prepared to make its contribution in this regard. I think the hon. <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0698"/>the Minister of Defence is the chairman of the committee concerned and if he is prepared to hear us in this regard, too, we are prepared to make our contribution.</p>

<p>After the events of the weekend, there are a few trends which are definitely emerging. Instead of a joint Opposition of the UP and the PRP, there are once more two, each with the same set of principles under its arm. At least the one came away with the marriage officer. So apparently they expect another marriage in future, because the extra marital affair, with some at least, cannot be prolonged for too long a period.</p>

<p>The Marais Committee with its 14 principles has brought no direction or certainty to Opposition politics. The confusion in South Africa is now greater than ever before. It is against this very thing that we in this group have been sounding warnings over the past few months. We pleaded with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and we warned him not to ride a tiger with the hon. member for Sea Point. There is just no way in which the irreconcilable can be reconciled. Therefore it was an absolutely futile venture on his part. For months those two Opposition parties sat around the same conference table&#x2014;I believe that they were sincere in what they did&#x2014;to find common ground for forming a new political party. Indeed, the hon. member for Sea Point was telling us continuously that he was seeking a re-grouping of the Opposition forces in South Africa. He never said that he was looking for a political party which could become a real alt&#x00E7;mative Government in South Africa. To date the hon. member for Sea Point has gained only ex-Judge Kowie Marais. I want to address a word of warning to the hon. member for Sea Point. Mr. Justice Kowie Marais said the following in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 2 January&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The new political Opposition in South Africa should be led by a younger, completely new younger figure with a very distinct Afrikaner heritage. None of the existing leaders, Sir De Villiers Graaff, Mr. Colin Eglin or Mr. Theo Gerdener are suitable.</block>

<p>Then the question was put to him: &#x201C;But Mr. Marais, what about yourself&#x003F;&#x201D; Not one fits the bill, that is neither Mr. Japie Basson nor the hon. member who is smiling so broadly behind me. His reply was reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He added that he would consider acting as leader of the new party, but only if it is unavoidable and only on a short-term basis. &#x201C;I am not really a politician. I would hesitate a long time before I joined the crush in the arena.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now he has joined the hon. member for Sea Point, and the hon. member for Sea Point is a man who might also have political aspirations to become the leader of the party.</p>

<p>Exactly what has this hon. gentleman achieved in South African politics&#x003F; He could hand out a document to everyone, principles with which everyone agrees, but principles which everyone can interpret in his own way. Then surely those principles are ambiguous and vague, as we said. Why then must the UP principles of 1973 be rewritten simply to satisfy the PRP&#x003F; Everyone knows that they follow a completely different line, a line which has always been known as the &#x201C;integrated common society&#x201D;. That is their alternative for separate freedom and as long as it remains the alternative for South Africa, separate freedom will always win. Now the PRP continues in its direction on the basis of the 14 Marais principles. But it does not deviate from its policy. The Official Opposition also adheres to the 14 principles, because another interpretation can be given to them, but the UP will take steps to formulate a policy which will fit in with the 14 principles. In addition to this the official statement mentions that the Marais committee did in fact lay down a basis for a new party and that &#x201C;We must not miss this chance.&#x201D; How can this happen when Mr. Kowie Marais has failed&#x003F; What individual will join such a new party&#x003F; Now the public of South Africa will only have more doubts about such a plan and will know that it will lead to a fiasco, to the detriment of a sound parliamentary government. Opposition politics in South Africa cannot be allowed to remain suspended in a vacuum. If we want to save South Africa, surely the mechanism with which we want to save it cannot take longer to design than the <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0699"/>malaise may last. For that reason we believe that only one other alternative remains. That is that the Government lends us its ear. We know the country and its problems as well as they do and we have a willingness to help. We want to help South Africa. We know that the country is under enormous economic pressure. We know there is an economic recession, with a high inflation rate. The private sector of South Africa has become paralysed; there is no doubt about that. Productivity in South Africa is low and there is a spirit of pessimism. Powers outside South Africa want to exploit the situation by putting greater pressure on South Africa. That is why we say that the private sector must be activated. And what is the best: A recession or strong growth in which we might have inflation to a certain extent, but not social evils like unemployment&#x003F; The security requirements of this country make it necessary for us to stimulate the private sector more and more, because it is only the private sector in South Africa that can earn what is required to employ more people who can earn money and enable us to have more taxpayers in South Africa. We are prepared to assist the wagon to cross the hill. We must prove to the outside world and the UNO that we can show those people who believe that armed assistance should be given to Swapo only and who want to deprive us of our arms and deny us arms, those people, for example, who do not want to recognize the independence of Transkei, that we here in South Africa are a community that can work out our own salvation. The time will come again when we shall be able to prove that our communities in South Africa can act in unison. When we have reached that situation, when South Africa is once more on the road of progress and of unity, when South Africa is once more on the road of co-operation, then, we can resume the political fight if it is necessary to fight in South Africa at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have really witnessed an interesting spectacle here this afternoon in that the hon. member for Newton Park has had to take his old political father to task. This makes one think that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition embarked upon this courtship of his like an ardent old widower. All it has brought him is that six of his children have left home and that now, after the weekend, he is left with a rather slender little bride. [Interjections.] When one observes the joy of the hon. member for Sea Point, it appears that the midwife who was supposed to be in charge of the whole story eventually decided that she wanted to be a bride herself. There the hon. member for Sea Point has now ended up with ex-Judge Kowie Marais. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this debate is characterized by the fact that it began on a very excited note with a most irresponsible attack made by the Opposition on the Government when the Government announced its intention of removing the concentration of squatters in Modderdam Road and at the University of the Western Cape. One has had great appreciation for the hon. member for Green Point over the years. Unfortunately it is clear, from the speech he made earlier in this debate, that his political frustration has also begun to cloud his political judgment completely. Now one only hopes that this thing between the UP and the PRP will soon come to an end, because it appears that at the moment there is such a competition between those two parties to see who can make the most bitter and harmful statements, not only against the Government, but against South Africa as a whole. Mr. Speaker, one regarded the Opposition with great compassion earlier this year, fearing that it was about to expire. Looking at it today, however, one really gets the impression that it is going out of its way, like a drowning person, to drag under the one who is trying to save it. I shall refer to the speech of the hon. member for Green Point again in the course of my speech. However, I am sure that if he were to read his speech again, it would give him a hangover. Of course, the hon. member for Yeovill&#x00E7;&#x2014;it is a pity that he is absent today&#x2014;could not allow the hon. member for Green Point to say these ugly things about the NP without trying to surpass him, without trying to put it in even uglier terms.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish I were able to strip the hon. member for Yeoville of some of his haughty arrogance, for I think it is high time someone did this. As far as I am concerned, his so-called patriotism and his striped shirts are gimmicks of the same order, especially if one notes what he said in this debate. If I may quote it word for word, the hon. member for Yeoville said (Hansard, col. 1093)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0700"/>There is, of course, no doub.t that people who illegally occupy land are breaking the law. That is a crime they are committing &#x2026; With great respect, there is a far greater crime being committed, and that is the fact that there are people who are without houses. It now seems to be a crime to be without a house, a place to live. That is the crime. What one must ask oneself here is who commits the greater crime&#x2014;he who lives on a piece of land when he has nowhere else to live or he who pulls the purse strings and does not see to it that there is housing for people&#x003F; Who commits the greater crime&#x003F;</block>

<p>The hon. member says this with very great calculation, because the hon. member never says anything that is not calculated. He says this to the Black people, a very large percentage of whom are not only squatting illegally, but are also illegally present in the Western Cape. They have recently entered this area without being entitled to do so. What is he saying to the Black people, if one listens carefully&#x003F; He is saying that this Government consists of criminals; that they pull the purse strings, but are not prepared to provide housing to the Black people. He is saying to the Black people that they may flock to this area without control and may squat wherever they want to, because their crime is nothing compared to that of the Government, which is able to provide the housing to which they are entitled, but fails to do so. This is the patriotic South African we always have here. I am not allowed to say, of course&#x2014;I know you will not allow me, Sir&#x2014;that the hon. member is an agitator. I promise you, Sir, that I will not say so. But no agitator could do better than the hon. member did in his statement.</p>

<p>If that is your inference, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it. [Interjections.] Listening to this hon. member&#x2019;s stories about the redistribution of wealth, and noting the organized and often militant nature of the concentrations of squatters, one asks oneself whether the PRP is really so far removed from it all as they would like us to believe. I shall not answer that question, for as a patriotic South African, the hon. member should be better acquainted with what the Government is doing in the field of housing. Because this hon. member has acted in this way, the hon. member for Wynberg, in his over-keenness to make himself acceptable to the PRP, believes that he should go a little further still. The hon. member came here through the good offices of the hon. member for Newton Park, survived and thinks he will survive again. Let us examine carefully what the hon. member said. He said (Hansard, col. 1114)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Community Development &#x2026; what law he refers to when he speaks about transgressors against the law.

<p>It is enough to chill one&#x2019;s blood. Imagine a member of this House telling people that they are not transgressing any law and that the law which the Minister says they are transgressing is just a law of Parliament, and that, as such, they had no part in it. [Interjections.] In other words, the hon. member is saying that the people need not take any notice of the law because they had no part in it. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, can you imagine a more reckless irresponsibility than this hon. member has shown&#x003F; He advocates that we on this side of the House should act with greater compassion. Let me ask that hon. member today where his compassion was when the houses of his labourers were declared slums by the Paarl municipality. He took a firm stand, oh yes, and he refused to have those houses demolished, but his compassion was so great that in spite of this, he still allowed those houses, which were not fit for human occupation, to be occupied from time to time. That <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0701"/>is where the hon. member&#x2019;s compassion comes in. The same applies to the PRP. These are people who make a great fuss about compassion, but where was the compassion of those hon. members when their boss had the squatters removed from the grounds of the Marina Da Gama&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>No. The hon. member had enough time available to him and he did not use it. The hon. member used his time to make the most strident and irresponsible attack. Now he had better swallow his medicine. The practical conduct of these hon. gentlemen differs completely from the verbal attack which is made here. The tragedy is that the words they use here serve to encourage resistance outside, because it has become fashionable to elevate all squatters to the status of a holy cow, of people who are beyond reproach. Among those squatters are a large number of people who have real merit, but who have been driven by necessity into the situation in which they find themselves today.</p>

<p>I do think there will be any argument if I say that on the part of a large percentage of them, it is not a question of being unable to find accommodation. Squatting is an integral part of their philosophy of life. A large percentage of them are unable to comply with socially acceptable norms. The image of them which is usually projected is that of an unhappy group of people who have never had a chance in life. The hon. member for Green Point has made surveys in this connection and from these it appears that, according to him, the majority of the squatters come from the Greater Cape Town area. I cannot dispute that survey. However, if the facts are correct, I say to the hon. member today that it appears from further surveys that 33% of the squatters come from the Bellville area and that 20% of those who come from the Cape Divisional Council area have already had houses in housing schemes available to them in the past.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>It is no estimation, but an actual survey that has been made, just as representative of the facts as the survey made by the hon. member. The hon. member for Green Point now wants this basic concentration to be provided with services and to be turned into emergency camps. Now I want to ask the hon. member: Is it because the CRC and the University of the Western Cape are situated on these grounds, two institutions which the Opposition has always tried to discredit in the eyes of the world&#x003F; Is it because these two institutions have now acquired some prestige that he wants to harm them with the presence of squatters&#x003F; Is that the reason why the hon. member wants emergency camps at that specific spot&#x003F;</p>

<p>But we also have a responsibility to protect the interests of the established Coloured communities. A Coloured man whom I recently helped to acquire a house in the adjoining Belhar, which is a good residential area, came to complain to me during the weekend that his water account had become impossibly high because he did not dare forbid the squatters to use his taps. There are good, decent and civilized Coloured people in the Cape Peninsula today who have to live in over-populated circumstances. For them there is little chance of accommodation, because there are those people among them who are always moving about and who must receive priority as far as accommodation is concerned.</p>

<p>A senior member of the CRC recently came to consult me about accommodation. He is a member of the Labour Party. We in our turn went to see the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs about this matter. This Coloured person requested us to give less attention to the squatters in order to give more attention to those people who are living in over-populated areas, because they were able to accept the responsibility of tenancy. Unfortunately one can never persuade these people to make such statement in public. Now people demand to know why we do not consult the squatters&#x2019; committee. The hon. members for Wynberg and Green Point are making a great fuss about this. Hon. members may imagine what the situation would be if a large group of people were to establish themselves illegally in an area, to form a committee authorized to make regulations &#x2026;</p>

<p>That hon. member ought to confine himself to the comics in <i>Die Burger,</i> he would understand them better. The squatters&#x2019; committee even takes upon itself the right to give permission concerning who may enter the area and who may not. The squatters are there illegally, and now hon. members of that side of the House expect us to consult them. Hon. members want to know why we did not consult Lofty Adams, the CRC member for that area. However, this poor man has become addicted to publicity. Why should he be consulted about the illegal presence of certain people in an area&#x003F; I could also lay claim to this, because the whole area is situated within the boundaries of my constituency. Do not the people of my constituency and I myself have any rights to be protected in this connection&#x003F; The people in my constituency and I live about 2 km from this settlement of squatters, as the crow flies, and on top of that, we get the south-easter blowing from that direction. It is all very well to be far removed from these things and then to preach compassion. But where do the hon. members for Green Point and Yeoville live&#x003F; The hon. member for Green Point ought to support his city councillor, Mr. Tom Walters. There is a man with great compassion, someone who wants to line up caravans on the Green Point commonage.</p>

<p>Over the years the Government has transformed slum communities into orderly and proud communities. In the meanwhile, the Coloured population in the Cape metropolitan area increased by 44% during the period between 1960 and 1970, and there has been an uncontrolled and incessant influx to this area, in spite of the fact that there are fewer job opportunities and a lack of housing in the area. No Government can accommodate such a constant drain on its means and its capacities. Similarly, no Government can allow slum conditions, whether uncontrolled or controlled, as in the so-called site and service scheme. If dramatic measures are not taken soon to serve as a deterrent, it is unlikely that this uncontrolled influx could ever be halted. No Government would ever be able to place housing on a sound footing in the direction in which we are already making progress. Measures have been announced in this connection, but time does not allow me to deal with them at any length now. However, the Government will not deviate from the course it has adopted; it cannot do so. This is not just a display of strength on the part of the Government. The fact is that if it does not do this, conditions in the Cape Peninsula will become absolutely chaotic. In this respect employers have a special duty. But still more than this, the whole Opposition has a very serious duty. Let there be a common will to resistance among us so that we may create order in this field. It is no use trying to dissociate ourselves from the problem as the hon. member for Green Point has done. He cries out to the world, &#x201C;Be my witness that I am not the one who wants these things.&#x201D; He says (Hansard, col. 1082)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope that people outside will, as a result of our words in this House, indicate to the people outside South Africa that this Government action does not get the approval of all the Whites of South Africa, but that it raises feelings of revulsion in the hearts of many White South Africans.</block>

<p>He went on to say (Hansard, col. 1083)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In conclusion, I hope that what has been said here will let the Brown and Black people of South Africa know that this Government&#x2019;s action is rejected by many thousands of White South Africans who are no longer prepared to deny to them their personal dignity and their basic humanity.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the speech of the hon. member for Tygervallei was typical of the speeches of all the members on the opposite side of this House, with the exception of the hon. member for Carletonville and perhaps the hon. member for Florida as well. The members on the opposite side of the House have made no attempt to reply in a positive manner to the criticism which has been expressed <span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0703"/>from this side of the House. The hon. member for Tygervallei, who has just resumed his seat, represents an electoral division in an area in which real and fundamental problems are being experienced today. Although he had the opportunity of doing so, he did not avail himself of the opportunity to give positive answers to the criticism expressed from this side of the House. Why not&#x003F; After all, he had an opportunity to tell this House what positive and effective action the Government was going to take in order to solve those problems in such a way that race relations would be improved and not further disrupted. What is the reason for the state of affairs in which, after the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister in the no-confidence debate, none of the speakers of the NP, with a few exceptions, had either the courage or the ability to give South Africa and this House positive leadership or to supply information or answers which could have instilled confidence that the Government was in a position to deal with South Africa&#x2019;s problems&#x003F; I just want to refer briefly to what another hon. member from that side of the House, the hon. member for Parys, said. I am not going to refer to all the snide remarks and rude humiliations which he directed towards members on this side of the House. However, I want to draw the attention of this House to something which that hon. member said because I believe that it can do South Africa a lot of harm. He said the following (Hansard, col. 1176)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must tell Africa that if a single person, White or non-White, is killed on South African soil, we shall aim at the heart of the host country.

<p>The hon. member for Florida was one of the Nationalist Party members who made an honest attempt&#x2014;unfortunately an exclusively technical attempt&#x2014;to analyse and investigate the policy of the PRP. I am sorry that he never arrived at the realities. I am sorry that he never arrived at the philosophy of the party. He might have arrived at the realities in regard to the technical aspects of that policy but he never gave attention to the philosophy of the party and consequently he never arrived at the truth of that aspect. That member, together with the National Party, is obsessed with the colour aspects of policy in South Africa. In other words, everything is seen and measured in terms of colour. The consideration is how many Black people there will be on the voters&#x2019; roll, when there will be a Black majority on the voters roll and when there will be a Black majority in the government. This is not the yardstick by which the success of the philosophy and the approach of our party should or can be measured. Our philosophy is to create a State in South Africa which will give equal civil rights to each South African citizen.</p>

<p>It is important to determine whether that policy will completely remove discrimination on the grounds of colour, whether that policy will create equal opportunities for all South Africans. It is no good talking about the removal of or moving away from discrimination as a concept if the Government does not have the honest intention of carrying it out in practice. When we speak of the removal of discrimination, it is important&#x2014;and there are others in this House who ought to take cognizance of this as well&#x2014;to realize that one cannot remove discrimination in parts only. One cannot remove discrimination up to a certain point only. Once one has begun with the process of removing discrimination, that process must be carried through to its logical conclusion and it is better for the process to be carried through under control instead of getting out of hand like a forest fire.</p>

The Government said recently&#x2014;the newspapers are full of it&#x2014;that a Transkeian citizen may share all the rights and privileges within South Africa which a White man who is a citizen of a foreign country enjoys here. In other words, after those people who had or have a relationship with the Transkei on some basis, have been forced to relinquish their South African citizenship, the Government says that they will shortly be able to enjoy the same rights and privileges that White citizens of other countries enjoy in South Africa. Now I want to ask the hon. member: If Black children of Transkeian citizens apply for admission to that school, may they be admitted to it&#x003F;</p>

But until such time as he relinquishes his South African citizenship, he is subject to harsh and cruel discrimination at the hands of the White Government in this country.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I do not want to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. All this has resulted in South Africa finding herself in a dangerous and difficult situation today. It has resulted in South Africa standing alone in the world today. It has resulted in the hon. the Prime Minister having to admit in his message on television a few months ago that South Africa is isolated and alone and that we cannot appeal to any country in the world for assistance or support if an onslaught on South Africa materializes. Do you know what this means, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; It means that the 4 million Whites in South Africa today are faced with a very great decision. The 4 million Whites of South Africa find themselves in a country of 22 million people, on a continent of between 200 and 300 million people, in a world in which they no longer have any friends, in a country within Southern Africa where increasing race problems are being experienced, where internal disorder has arisen in recent times and may well arise again in the future&#x2014;we hope it will not. They find themselves in a position where the economy of South Africa is weakening and where the resentment of the non-White groups in South Africa towards the Government is mounting daily. Under those circumstances the Whites of South Africa are faced with a choice today, a choice between two alternatives. One alternative is that of confrontation and the other is that of reconciliation between the races. If a confrontation were to come, if a race war or revolution in South Africa were to come&#x2014;and all the signs point to the fact that we are moving rapidly in that direction&#x2014;we must accept that, as a result of such a confrontation, everything in which we believe in South Africa, all our standards, all our norms, would be destroyed. It would mean the destruction of the democratic process. It would mean the destruction of free enterprise. It would mean the destruction of individual liberties, of the freedom of speech, of the freedom of religion. It would mean the destruction of the judicial system as we know it in South Africa today. It would mean the destruction of all trust and co-operation between the groups in South Africa. In other words, a race confrontation in South Africa would lead to an intolerable, hostile community.</p>

<p>It would lead to a situation in which there would be no viable or meaningful future for the White man in South Africa anymore and it would be the implementation by the Government of a policy of apartheid, discrimination and White domination which would lead to those circumstances. This is something that none of us would want to happen. There is only one alternative; there is only one way in which such a state of affairs can be avoided. This is by way of a process of reconciliation of the races in South Africa. What are the requirements for reconciliation&#x003F; What are the basic requirements which we shall have to accept&#x003F; In the first place, there is the removal of all forms of discrimination: Communal discrimination, political discrimination and economic discrimination. In the second place, we have to design a system, a system which makes provision for the participation by all South Africans, regardless of their race or colour, in the political power system of South Africa. In other words, there must be power sharing in which all South Africans will be able to participate in the political systems of South Africa at all levels. Most important is that this will have to take place on a basis of negotiation between Black, White, Coloured and Indian in South Africa. The most important consideration is that negotiation will have to take place, effective negotiation, between South Africans to create a new future for South Africa. What will be the first test to which such a process will be subjected&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, the first test is whether, by way of a process of negotiation, we are able to avoid a revolution in South Africa. The second test is whether we shall be able to create a community and a system in South Africa in which White and non-White&#x2014;Black man, Coloured and Indian&#x2014;will be trained to accept responsibility in the positions of leadership in our community, in which they will gain experience and accept the responsibilities of leadership, in which they will benefit from free enterprise, experience the stimulation of individual freedom, in which they will experience the protection of the rule of law, and in which they will develop a respect and esteem for the democratic system and for free enterprise, and consequently will be prepared to defend that system against any other alien system. In South West Africa the Government has an example of what can be accomplished through negotiation. At the Turnhalle the Government has an example of what can be accomplished when Black and Coloured and White man seat themselves around the same conference table in order to investigate problems and to formulate answers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is happening in South Africa today is that Black politicians and White politicians are shouting at each other from positions far removed from each other. As a result of this, those positions are hardening. Polarization sets in and it becomes more difficult to bring about reconciliation. On the other hand, once a process of negotiation has been initiated the immediate consequence is that the alienation between the groups concerned is replaced by a process in which common objectives are pursued &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for South Africa to avoid confrontation, only one possibility exists and that is to initiate a process of negotiation. This can happen by way of a national convention, or whatever name may be attached to it. However, it must be a process in which Black and White and Coloured leaders gather around a <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0707"/>conference table. It does not matter how long it takes, or how many problems are experienced; what is important is that they come together to analyse South Africa&#x2019;s problems and move together in the direction of answers to the problems.</p>

<p>It is true that the question may be asked what can be negotiated, in the light of the existing policy of the NP Government. What are the things that can be negotiated within the very confined space offered by the present Government policy&#x003F; There are quite a few aspects which I should like to point out. In the first place, I want to refer to the Coloureds. As far as the position and the aspirations of the Coloureds are concerned and as far as the recommendations of the Erika Theron Commission are concerned, I put the question: Is the Government not prepared to announce in the course of 1977, on the strength of the recommendations of the Theron Commission, within the confined space which its own policy offers it, that it is going to do everything in its power to implement said recommendations on a basis of negotiation with the Coloureds and to heed the legitimate and justified aspirations of the Coloureds&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the second place, there is the urban Black man. The Government has already started moving away from the position it adopted a few years ago in relation to the urban Black man. Is it not possible, on the strength of the Government&#x2019;s own policy, immediately to enter into negotiations with the leaders of the urban Black people, with a view to creating better living conditions in their residential areas&#x003F; Is it not possible, by way of negotiations to give the urban Black man a more meaningful role in politics in his own area&#x003F; This can be done without deviating at this stage from the spirit of NP policy.</p>

<p>What about the removal of discrimination&#x003F; Indeed, it is Government policy&#x2014;i.e. if one is to take any notice of what its spokesmen say&#x2014;to move away from race discrimination. It is difficult indeed to believe that this is really so. In any event, the Government says that it wants to move away from discrimination, but it is no good just saying so. The Government must not leave it at words only, if it wants to create a good impression, if it wants to bring about a change of attitude, it must put its words into action. The Government must move away from discrimination in a dramatic fashion. Is it not so that even within the confines of NP policy, the Government can now open negotiations with the Black people, the Coloureds and the Indians of South Africa at all levels to investigate all forms of discrimination in order to move away from them&#x003F; This cannot be left until the year 2000. Can the Government not announce a timetable for the removal of discrimination&#x003F; Can the Government not hold out the prospect that by the year 1980 it will have done away with all forms of discrimination&#x003F; Can the Government not put forward for South Africa a programme and a timetable with regard to the abolition of discrimination and offer new hope to the Coloured, the Indian and the Black&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I come to my final point, something which I touched on last Friday, but to which I received no reply. We do not accept the policy of independent sovereign Black states as expounded by the Government. We will not accept it because we do not believe that it will make any notable contribution to the solution of South Africa&#x2019;s problems.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>We say to the Government that if they want to cherish any hope of their policy making a contribution to the solution of our race problems, there are many steps which must be taken in order to improve the policy and make it more realistic and acceptable. In the first place, the question arises as to whether the Government is prepared to negotiate now with the Black leaders of the urban areas, as well as of the homelands regarding the future of the homelands. Is the Government prepared to deal with its policy not as a product of the White man which is offered to the Black man whether he accepts it or not&#x003F; Is the Government prepared, at this late stage, to abandon the approach and to replace it with a dramatic new approach, in terms of which negotiations will be conducted with both homeland and urban Black leaders, with a view to establishing a new homeland concept based in the first place on a realistic consolidation of the homelands&#x003F; Does the Government not think that if it were to make the announcement during 1977 that it was prepared to do this, it would most likely bring about a dramatic <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0708"/>change in the image of its policy&#x003F; The most important aspect is to bear in mind the fact that the Government will be unable to succeed, on the one hand, in buying land quickly enough, and, on the other hand, in buying sufficient land from White landowners for handing over to Black farmers in the homelands. Can the Government not change its approach in order to draw new boundaries in agreement with and after negotiation with the Black leaders and to offer White landowners, businessmen, farmers, industrialists, and so on, who live within the new boundaries of the homelands, the opportunity of deciding whether they will remain there or not. If they decide to move away, the Government will compensate them, but if they decide to remain there, their skill, leadership and capital will also remain in the homelands and will give the homelands the opportunity to develop realistically, effectively and with greater success and therefore, to create a better future, not only for the inhabitants of the homelands, but for the population of South Africa as a whole. The question is simple: Is the Government prepared, in view of the problems we are experiencing and because answers must be found, to abandon in 1977 the approach it had in the past and replace it with an approach which is founded on negotiation and reconciliation in order to avoid in this way the dangerous consequences of confrontation&#x003F;</p>

How that hon. member can dare to rise to his feet and address a request to hon. members on this side of the House to reply to arguments in a positive manner is beyond me, for the hon. member excells in his method of acting negatively and not positively in everything he says and deals with. He has just been attacking the hon. member for Parys by saying that the hon. member did South Africa tremendous harm with his speech last week. He also dared to make an appeal to the Government to take action against the hon. member because of his irresponsibility. I think that, if that had been done, the hon. member for Bryanston would very soon do an about turn himself. Of course I do not know where he will return to from here, for I do not know whom he represents. If this hon. member lets the word &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D; fall from his lips and in the meantime uses the word &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; repeatedly I cannot, unfortunately, take him seriously, for then all he is really doing is to play with words. I shall leave it at that and return to the hon. member for Bryanston afterwards when I indicate the irresponsible way in which the Opposition frequently makes statements.</p>

<p>Before doing so I should like to put a question to the hon. member for Pinelands. I want to do so because I went on a drive through Rondebosch over the weekend. There I noticed a large piece of vacant land and subsequently discovered that it was called the Rondebosch common. Because we heard frequent references in this debate last week to the problem of the squatters and because we heard the sympathy expressed by hon. members on that side of the House in regard to where the squatters would go if they were to be moved, the idea occurred to me that if we were able to move the squatters to such a large piece of vacant land as the Rondebosch common, it might be a solution. I established that the Rondebosch common is situated in the constituency of the hon. member for Pinelands. If the hon. member for Pinelands is honest in his intentions, if he is serious about this matter, and because he discusses the Coloureds so sympathetically in this House, I want to tell him that if he has the courage of his convictions he should rise to his feet and invite the hon. the Minister of Community Development to allow those squatters to move to the Rondebosch common. [Interjections.] In that event he would surely have performed a positive deed. We want to ask him whether he is prepared to issue that invitation I should like to hear [Interjections.] I am simply asking that an invitation be issued.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>I am putting a question to the hon. member for Pinelands. I shall leave it at that. If the hon. member for Pinelands does not want to reply, I leave it to his conscience.</p>

<p>It sounds like a commonplace when I say we are living in a dangerous world. It is also true that the Republic of South Africa cannot escape the dangerous times in which we are <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0709"/>living. We have heard from various hon. speakers, <i>inter alia,</i> this afternoon from the hon. member for Newton Park, that we are experiencing difficult problems in the economy. In the first place, we have already heard from the hon. the Minister of Finance that we are experiencing economic pressure in the Republic of South Africa, not necessarily as a result of the policy of the Government, but as a result of certain factors which have an effect on us, and about which we can do absolutely nothing. Among the factors mentioned were the gold price, the oil price, the recession which afflicted the entire world and the ripple effect of which we are still experiencing in South Africa today. The present state of inflation and all the problems in regard to the economy fit in with the world-wide communist plan very well indeed, as far as South Africa is concerned as well. We also heard from the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that we have become the scapegoat in the world and that double standards were being applied when it came to the Republic of South Africa. We know that racism and discrimination are in fact the pernicious factors when the Republic of South Africa is being discussed. In the meantime, however, there are many countries in the world where precisely the same things are happening, without their being taken to task for it. We know that our policy of self-determination is not accepted, despite the fact that the UNO itself subscribes to such a policy of self-determination.</p>

<p>In the third place we have to contend with internal disorder. No one can deny this, but I want to contend this afternoon that the internal disorder is not the work of the masses either. We have to content with this as a result of the incitement and militant actions of only a small number, percentage-wise of Black and coloured people who have fallen prey to Black as well as White agitators. I want to suggest that these agitators do not mean well with South Africa and all its inhabitants, regardless of whatever colour they may be. The agitators are, in a subtle way, by means of statements and false distortions, inciting the people of colour.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we also have to contend with statements by hon. members on that side of the House which border on the unpatriotic. If I reflect on this, I ask myself why it is so that people who are also South Africans, make statements which are to the detriment of the Republic of South Africa. I answer my own question by saying that these people are trying to score petty political points and that in the process they are doing incalculable harm to South Africa. In this way these people find an ally in the greatest enemy of the Republic of South Africa and the world, i.e. communism. I know that hon. members on that side of the House try to dismiss the danger of communism by saying that the Government, according to them, only mentions it to cover up its own incompetence in respect of its policy. I want to discuss this and briefly sketch a picture of the most important strategy and tactics of communism. Finally I shall compare this with statement made by hon. members on that side of the House, in order to prove the statement I have just made.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what Lenin said in 1922, i.e. that the road to Paris and London run through Peking and Africa. In addition he formulated the policy to achieve this by saying that to encircle, isolate and destroy Europe it had to be done through the loss of Africa. If this is one of the objectives, what is the strategy&#x003F; I want to refer to what Stalin said in 1924, i.e. that the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariate in a country should be used as a fulcrum for the rejection of imperialism. That is indeed the strategy. He elaborated on this when he said the following in 1948&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Deur die Westerse w&#x00EA;reld van sy koloniale besittings te beroof, verminder ons die wins van die kapitalisme, verlaag ons die lewenspeil van die werkende massas en skep ons die situasie wat vir revolusion&#x00EA;re bewegings nodig is.</block>

<p>Put another way, it means the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aangesien &#x2019;n direkte aanval teen Europa nie moontlik is nie, is dit nodig om &#x2019;n omsingelingsbeweging deur middel van Asie en Afrika op tou te sit.</block>

<p>If this is the strategy, I have to ask myself&#x2014;if we know what the objective is and if we know the strategy&#x2014;of what tactics these people will make use. I find that Stalin wrote that, as far as tactics are concerned, they involve the forms of struggle and the organizations <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0710"/>with which the non-communists massas may be drawn into the revolution so that they may see that the overthrow of the existing order is the best alternative. What forms of struggle was he referring to&#x003F; Stalin himself mentioned the following forms of struggle: Making demands, protests, demonstrations, parliamentary and extra-parliamentary action against the existing order. When he refers to organizations which may be employed for these tactics, he mentions trade unions, youth movements, factory organizations, women&#x2019;s associations and study circles. If he had thought far enough, I think he would have included some Opposition parties in this list.</p>

<p>If this is true, what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said last week is true, i.e. that communism ranges itself alongside a political movement and subsequently provides that movement with military assistance. My question in return, however, is this: If that is true&#x2014;and it is true&#x2014;does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout not see the danger in an organization such as Swapo, and in organizations with very fine-sounding names of which we also have a certain number in the Republic of South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>When we think of these forms of struggle and organizations, the hon. member for Sea Point is to my mind making an absurd statement when he says that apartheid is the breeding ground for communism. In the same way I do not want to accept what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said either, and I shall quote from <i>Die Burger</i> of 6 December 1976. What I find interesting, however, is that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made the statement in the home of none other than the hon. member for Newton Park. I wonder whether the hon. member for Newton Park will still give ear today, especially in his own home, to such a statement when it is made. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Regering het die instrument en bondgenoot van die kommunisme geword deurdat hy met sy beleid van apartheid die vrugbare teelaarde vir kommunistiese oorheersing skep.</block>

<p>I think this statement is devoid of all truth. It is absurd on the basis of the facts I have just mentioned, i.e. that Stalin and Lenin had already worked out the programme. The policy of apartheid is making no provision for it whatsoever, because this policy is already seeking, in the concept of separate development, to afford all the various population groups the right and to offer them the opportunity to develop in such a way that there is no need for them to be reduced to poverty. Therefore this is an absurd argument which one may simply reject.</p>

<p>If this is what has been planned on a world-wide scale, what does the communist plan for Africa as such&#x003F; They asked Prof. Potekhin to work out a master plan for Africa. This master plan was published in 1960. In this master plan Prof. Potekhin proposed four phases. The first phase which Prof. Potekhin mentioned was the independence of all states within Africa should be encouraged. This sounds very commendable, but then comes the second phase. The economic ties between these nascent independent states and capitalistic countries must be broken. In addition they must not accept the economic aid of these capitalistic states. This is so-called neo-colonialism. As for the third phase Prof. Potekhin says that the leaders who withstand the communist pressure or resist neo-colonialism, should be deposed. We have sufficient examples in Africa of this standpoint, and how it has already been applied. The last step of Prof. Potekhin&#x2019;s master plan is that, wherever a government is found in any country which withstands all the various methods, chaos has to be created, and because chaos has to be created, there has to be a take-over of the trade unions.</p>

<p>Coming closer to home we find in the programme of the South African Communist Party that the immediate objective is to destroy the existing state and to create in its place so-called new &#x201C;peoples&#x2019; institutions&#x201D;, and in these new &#x201C;peoples&#x2019; institutions&#x201D; the non-Whites must be rapidly promoted, so that, according to them, all &#x201C;State institutions&#x201D; may be fully representative of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member is correct. What is more, the land should be returned to the people and&#x2014;we should take note of this&#x2014;separation in residential areas <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0711"/>and in education must be eliminated. When I say this, my mind goes back to the PRP congress in Pretoria at the beginning of October 1976, when a virtually unanimous resolution was passed in favour of compulsory race integration in schools and in universities. I then ask myself how it is possible that there is such a close link between the idea of the South African Communist Party programme and the statements and resolutions of the PRP. Let us now consider the statement of a person far closer to our own time than the year 1960. I am now quoting what was said by Selznick, an American, on the communist threat. He said <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the State power of the Soviet Union, the most secure source of communist influence is not its own agitation or its organizational effectiveness, but the unrest generated by stresses in society.</block>

<p>With that strategy and those tactics of communism in mind, I ask myself to what extent we are in this process helping, by means of statements from that side of the House, to achieve the communist objective.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to refer to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I should like to quote from <i>Die Oosterlig</i> of 11 November 1976. There it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Suid-Afrika staan aan die vooraand van sy eie Franse Revolusie, het die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout ges&#x00EA;.</block>

<p>When such statements are made, there is no doubt in my mind that we are playing directly into the hands of the communist onslaught. I quote further from the same report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As jy &#x2019;n Swartman in Suid-Afrika is, kan jy dus net so goed in kommunistiese Rusland woon sover dit die vryheid en vrye ondememing betref, het mnr. Basson ges&#x00EA;.</block>

<p>I think this borders on the unpatriotic. To my mind it is also interesting, in the same context, to read in a report that Winnie Mandela said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following in her evidence before the Cilli&#x00E9; commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Kommunistiese Regering vir hierdie land is beter as die huidige Regering.</block>

<p>Do hon. members find a specific similarity between these two statements&#x003F; I prefer to leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>But let us consider the hon. member for Sea Point for a moment. I want to quote from <i>Die Burger</i> of 7 April 1976. The hon. member praised Gatsha Buthelezi of KwaZulu among others as &#x201C;a great South African&#x201D;. Let us now consider Gatsha Buthelezi as the &#x201C;great South African&#x201D;. This same Gatsha Buthelezi gave the Black Power salute at the PRP meeting last year at Jan Smuts, where the hon. Leader of the PRP was present with some of his people. What did they do, however&#x003F; Absolutely nothing! I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die konferensie het besluit dat &#x2019;n komitee die vorming van &#x2019;n verenigde Swart/Wit front teen die Regering, bestaande uit die PRP, die VP en Inkatha gaan ondersoek.</block>

<p>It was also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die leier van die PRP, mnr. Colin Eglin, en die organiseerder van die kongres, mnr. Horace van Rensburg, het hulle heelhartig agter die voorstel geskaar.</block>

<p>If this is so, I maintain this afternoon that these people are, through word and deed, becoming the allies of an enemy which presents a serious threat to us. I go further. This same Gatsha Buthelezi said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following to Dr. Kissinger&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We Blacks in South Africa do not agree with Mr. Vorster that South Africa is a West frontline of defence against communism.</block>

<p>I ask myself this question: Why do they not agree as far as this is concerned&#x003F; Why do they not believe this&#x003F; Is it perhaps because Buthelezi himself is in favour of communism and, if that is the case, is the hon. the leader of the PRP still prepared to say: &#x201C;This is one of the great South Africans&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<block name="quote">White power, not Black power, was at the root of the racial unrest in South Africa during the past three months, Dr. Alex Boraine said.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the hon. member for Virginia to pardon me if I do not reply to his speech because I have very little time at my disposal since I am the last speaker on this side in this debate. I should like to say at the outset that I believe that the members in these benches have clearly shown to the hon. members in the Government benches the seriousness of the economic situation in South Africa today. I think the members on this side have clearly highlighted the problems with unemployment and the problems with insolvencies, which are reaching an all-time record, and also the problems the housewife is experiencing with inflation. However, I would like to commend the hon. the Minister for acknowledging the basic reasons for our present economic plight. He <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0713"/>said we are suffering with a balance of payments problem, a low growth-rate problem and also a problem of extreme inflation. However, Sir, I do believe that it is extremely regrettable that, if I am not mistaken, not a single speaker on the other side of the House has clearly identified the real causes of these problems. They have also not given this House any clear-cut objectives as to how the hon. the Minister intends to cure these problems. Rather, as was said by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, the debate on that side of the House has been a purely defensive debate, an attempt to minimize the seriousness of our present situation, an attempt to reassure the public. I believe, as the hon. member has said, that the hon. the Minister has painted a picture of optimism which I believe has given this country a false impression and has inculcated in a lot of people a sense of false security. However, we on this side of the House have accepted the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s identification of the basic problems, viz. a balance of payments problem, a low growth-rate and inflation. We accept these as the basic reasons for the mess in which the country is today. But what are the causes of these problems&#x003F; I should like to summarize what I believe has been put forward by hon. members in these benches.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the balance of payments problem. Why do we have a balance of payments problem&#x003F; I think that the reason is primarily that there is a lack of confidence in the South African economy at the present time, a lack of confidence which has led to a flight of capital from South Africa and a great reluctance on the part of overseas investors to come to South Africa to provide us with essential capital which is absolutely necessary to fuel our economy. Why is there a lack of confidence in South Africa at the present time&#x003F; First of all, we have political unrest within South Africa because of the internal policies of apartheid and of discrimination based on colour. These are the policies of this Government in South Africa at the present time. Secondly, we have a lack of confidence because of external political pressures which are being brought to bear on South Africa in order to try to get South Africa to change these policies. In the face of all this we find that this Government has adopted an intransigent attitude towards these problems and is not prepared, as far as I can see from this debate, to come up with any permanent political solution to the problems which are very basic to the South African economy. Another factor which is contributing towards our balance of payments problem is the unprecedented rate of Government spending. This has involved a considerable amount of money being spent on the importation of goods, which this Government has budgeted to pay for through the earnings of our gold sales, at very high world prices. This has not materialized. We warned the hon. the Minister over two years ago that his budget was unrealistic in this respect. They laughed at us and now South Africa and the taxpayer is carrying the baby.</p>

<p>Secondly, the South African economy is suffering from a low growth rate, a growth rate which in the light of present circumstances is far too low to sustain first of all our growing population, secondly, the rising aspirations of our people and, thirdly, this Government&#x2019;s extravagant spending programmes to which I have already referred. These programmes are consuming an ever-increasing proportion of our available investment capital which we on these benches believe should be invested in the more productive area, the more economic area, the more wealth-generating area that one finds within the private sector here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Thirdly, our economy is in a mess because of the consumption expenditure of this Government, consumption expenditure which is biting deeper and deeper into our gross domestic product. This excessive Government consumption expenditure has put our economy into an inflationary spiral which is leading to an erosion of the standards of living of all our people.</p>

<p>Fourthly, and finally, our economy is in the critical state in which it is today because this Government is following a socialist plan of spending, very similar to what one finds in Great Britain. Those of us who see what is happening in Great Britain today, realize that such spending must lead eventually to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>So far this is a brief summary of the charges which have been made from this side of the House. But what has been the reaction from the Government benches&#x003F; So far not one speaker on that side of the House has effectively countered these charges, and I <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0714"/>sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will attempt to do so. I sincerely hope that he will not try to reject these charges. After all, Mr. Speaker, how can any hon. member on those benches deny these charges which have been made during this debate&#x003F; After all, this is the charge which has been laid by Dr. Wassenaar. He has now been supported by many influential people in the business sector, such as Mr. Cronje, chairman of the Federated Chamber of Industries, and Dr. Reynders, a director of the Federated Chamber of Industries. This is the greatest charge which, I believe, faces this Government at the present time, at a time when our economy is in extremely dire straits. Yet, hon. members on those benches persist in saying that these charges are not true. What must our people be thinking today&#x003F; How do they feel about the whole situation when they hear the charges which are being laid against this Government and the rebuttal of those charges by hon. members on the Government side&#x003F; Who is really facing up to the truth of these matters&#x003F; At the present time South Africa, our nation, is facing probably the most critical situation in its history. We have our young men on our borders. Internally we have unrest and we have a tremendous amount of poverty. Internationally, the pressure is beginning to increase, and economically we are in dire straits. Yet, the Government stubbornly refuses to face up to the truth and to the realities of our present economic situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what are the facts in this regard&#x003F; Here I would like to refer to the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s Quarterly Bulletin of December 1976. I have it here. It is the same document from which the hon. the Minister quoted figures during his opening speech. The December report of the Reserve Bank shows that the gross domestic fixed investment for all sectors increased at an average annual rate of 18,67% during the past eight years. During the same period the public authorities&#x2019; fixed investment increased at a marginally lower rate of 18,5%, while that of public corporations increased at a whopping average annual rate of 26,3% The private sector, that sector which generates most of our new wealth, on the other hand, ran a poor last at 17,6%, 1% lower than that of the nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if one studies these figures for the last four years, rather than for the past eight years, one finds that public corporations have increased their investments by an average annual rate of a massive 36,58%, while the private sector is running at half that rate, namely 17,38%, which is 2,2 percentage points below that for the nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the figures from the Reserve Bank Bulletin which, I believe, are the most reputable figures we have, also show that the private sector&#x2019;s share of the net domestic investment over the past four years&#x2014;that is from 1972 to 1976&#x2014;has on average been 6,72% lower than the average level it enjoyed during the previous four years, the period from 1968 to 1971. This drop of 6,72% of its share of the available new investment funds, when related to the net domestic investment for the four-year period 1972 to 1976, represents a loss of investment capital to the private sector of a total of R1 177,6 million, which, related to the gross domestic fixed investment for the same four-year period, represents 5,08% of the total.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Finance to imagine what effect this sum of money would have had on our growth rate had it been fed into the private sector instead of being spent in the public sector. This is the very charge which has been laid by us in these benches, by Dr. Wassenaar and by other leading industrialists in South Africa.</p>

<p>I would like to take a closer look at the consumption expenditure to which the hon. the Minister referred in his opening speech when he related expenditure to the national account. I take issue with him when he says that the figures quoted &#x201C;scarcely seem to justify the charge of profligate Government spending&#x201D;. The facts are that during the past eight years the expenditure on the GDP has increased by an average annual rate of 14,12%, consumption expenditure by the general Government has increased by a massive average annual rate of 18,26%, while the consumption expenditure of the private sector has lagged on behind with 13,26% per annum. The facts of the matter are that the private sector is falling behind in the economy of South Africa. It cannot keep pace with Government spending, which has to be paid for, after all, out of the earnings of the private sector or with the money of the taxpayer or from foreign borrowing. It is no wonder that at the present time we have a <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0715"/>massive problem with inflation and that our economy is in the mess that it is. I believe that these figures clearly indicate that the charges laid against the Government are valid and that the Government should take heed of them at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after all the jumping around there has been in Opposition ranks recently, especially over the past weekend, I am sure you will not blame me for saying that it is becoming more and more difficult to know exactly whom to address if one wants to debate with the Opposition.

<p>The Opposition need not get excited; I have not even started on them yet. I just want to say that matters will become worse and worse in the future. I just want to know whether the eventual official Opposition is going to consist of a Gerdener-Graaff brew. I do not think so, because that would be too much of a &#x201C;one chicken, one horse&#x201D; partnership. Or will it be an Eglin/Basson partnership, or perhaps an Eglin/Kowie Marais partnership, or perhaps a triumvirate of an Eglin/Basson/Kowie Marais partnership&#x003F; I sincerely hope not, for it would be an evil day for South Africa if that were to happen. [Interjections.] In the long run, however, I would not exclude the possibility of the Myburgh Streicher party emerging as the official Opposition. At this stage, they seem to me to be the most stable of all the parties over there. [Interjections.] If the present hon. Leader of the official Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff, still seeks to make overtures to the Progressives or to merge with them, or whatever he wants to do, I want to give him a piece of friendly advice. I want to tell him: &#x201C;He who sups with the devil must use a long spoon.&#x201D; Then he will have to contend with the Helen Suzmans, the Eglins, the Waddells and the Zac de Beers, to mention just a few. Was it not the hon. member for Houghton who said that if her party were to come into power, they would allow the Communist Party to operate here as long as it did not transgress the law&#x003F; That was what she said, after all. To go into this a little further, I want to refer to the latest edition of <i>Business Week,</i> a magazine which is very well known to hon. members of this House. In it, a great deal is said about Southern Africa and South Africa. Quite a number of pages are devoted to this. This is the edition of 14 February 1977. When they try to ascertain the position of South Africa as a country in which foreign capital may be invested, the opinions of several people are quoted. Dr. Zac de Beer allegedly said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;If I were a foreigner looking clinically at South Africa,&#x201D; says Zac de Beer, an executive director of Anglo American, &#x201C;I would refrain from investing here until South Africa looked safe for private investments, which means until the obviously essential political reforms are carried out.&#x201D;</block>

<p>My hon. friend, the hon. member for Ermelo, asked the hon. member for Johannesburg North in this debate what he had to say about this remark made by his fellow director of Anglo American, but he was silent because he had nothing to say about it. In a moment I shall refer to what he had to say, which is also quoted here. In this edition of <i>Business Week</i> they also quote Mr. Eglin as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;United States companies are in a better position than South African companies to promote racial equality,&#x201D; says Colin Eglin, a partner in a construction management firm and a member of Parliament who heads the opposition Progressive Reform Party. &#x201C;South African companies do not have the option of disinvesting. The Government very much wants American companies to stay and American managers can point to the pressures on them from home.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here the American corporations are invited to bring pressure to bear upon us, because, it is <span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_0716"/>alleged, our own companies cannot disinvest the investments which have been made here. I think this is a scandalous statement. Let us just look for a moment at what the hon. member for Johannesburg North says. This is quoted here and is used against us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Separate development is a fraud and a fiction,&#x201D; says Anglo American&#x2019;s Waddell.</block>

<p>Then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; make it impossible for a Black or Brown in South Africa to enjoy any of the benefits of private enterprise,&#x201D; says Gordon Waddell, a director and executive committee member of Anglo American.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it will be an evil day if these people ever come into power in South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, in my Second Reading introductory speech to this debate last Monday, I summed up the economic position of the Republic in a few words. I said that we were definitely on the right track, because the current account of the balance of payments was improving, inflation was diminishing and that if we persevered with our present policies, the rest would follow in good time. I went out of my way to quote facts and figures to show that at this moment South Africa compared very favourably with a whole list of countries that could normally and reasonably be compared with us today. The hon. member for Amanzimtoti, who has just sat down, talks about the economy being in a mess. Every second phrase he used was &#x201C;a critical state of affairs&#x201D;. Of course, when faced with the facts, the Opposition simply comes forward in the old style and their general line of attack is that there is practically nothing right with this country and anything which is not right, is in any case the fault of the Government. I shall deal with that. That is the sort of thing that is put across the floor of this House in a responsible debate. In my speech I also gave a frank exposition of South Africa&#x2019;s economic problems. For the benefit of hon. members it is printed in Hansard. I pointed out that other comparable countries even without our special economic problems today, e.g. the low gold price, which does not hit other countries as it hits us, because it is our biggest export &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The big fall in the gold price is a special problem we have to live with. The political uncertainties of Southern Africa as a whole is not our doing, but we have to live with it. The vastly increased defence spending in order to make this country militarily prepared and the vast increases in expenditure which we had to find, have all come at once. Yet despite that, other countries are in worse shape than we are. The facts bear that out. If we on this side of the House are so hopeless because of the fact that we have had some problems, does it not then follow&#x2014;if logic means anything&#x2014; that all the Governments of all those other countries must be much worse than we are&#x003F; Another implicit assumption of the Opposition is that if their financial, economic and political policies&#x2014;whatever they are, do not ask me what they are&#x2014;had appertained it would have placed South Africa in a much better situation than she is today. That is the sort of thing which arises from this sort of argument. I hope the House does not expect me to comment on that situation.</p>

<p>If we look at the more immediate financial position, we find that the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism boils down, very substantially, to two or three things. They say that we have severe problems in obtaining foreign capital, that there is a lack of confidence on the part of overseas investors in South Africa, that the Government has spent too much and they then make fitful reference to things like inflation, and so on. I shall come back to these points later on.</p>

<p>*First I want to refer very briefly to several remarks made by hon. members on this side of the House, remarks which I found striking. The hon. member for Langlaagte&#x2014;if I may say so&#x2014;spoke very sensibly about the money spent on luxuries by some township developers and certain local authorities. The hon. member gave examples of this, and I want to <span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_0717"/>assure him that, unlike the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x2014;who said they were just trivia&#x2014;I consider these matters to be of the greatest importance. I want to point out to this House that quite some time ago I appointed two inter-departmental committees. One of these committees, the one under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the Treasury&#x2014;which is doing an excellent job&#x2014; had to inquire into the building norms applied by various bodies in respect of the projects for which they are responsible. It has a bearing on hospitals, universities, roads, public buildings and many other things. I think that during the next few years we shall save hundreds of millions of rand in this way. The other inter-departmental committee is under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Finance and is investigating municipal finances in South Africa. I want to assure the hon. member for Langlaagte that the arguments he advanced and the examples he furnished will be thoroughly investigated by that committee. The hon. member for Sunnyside &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; made an interesting suggestion.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. Opposition should not try to monopolize this debate. They can wait, because we have had some very constructive suggestions from this side of the House. I shall deal with hon. members opposite one by one in a moment.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sunnyside suggested that we consider levying taxes on horse-racing, seen from a national point of view, and that we use the funds for defence purposes. I want to assure the hon. member that we shall give close consideration to that proposal. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia had a great deal to say about the scarcity of foreign capital, and said that it was showing signs of drying up. He further said that it was becoming subject to shorter terms of repayment. The hon. member for Von Brandis, who explained to me that he could not be here, went further and said that the Government had overspent and that it was unable to meet many of the commitments it would like to meet. I am sorry that he is not here so that I can ask him what all these commitments are. However, we can come back to that question when he is here. I would like to come to the question of foreign capital, or the lack of it, as hon. members opposite would like to say, and the question which they are so anxious to tie up with it, namely the question of business confidence in South Africa from abroad. Let me quote some figures which indicate the volume of foreign capital we have received during the last nine or ten years. I would like to place this on record because I think it is high time this was done. The receipts of foreign capital were as follows&#x2014;</p>

<table border="1">

<tr>

<td><p>1968</p></td>

<td><p>R456 million</p></td>

<td><p>1969</p></td>

</table>

<p>As far as 1976 is concerned, we have a very preliminary figure for the last quarter, but I <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0718"/>would say that it looks as if the net figure for the year could be somewhere in the vicinity of perhaps R800 million. This is the position now, at a time when we are told that all the capital has dried up and when everybody knows that the conditions in the international capital market have generally become much more difficult. This is the position, and if one looks at a very interesting component of this capital, one finds that a very sizable amount is in the form of long-term private capital, which is a very good index of overseas confidence in South Africa. During the first three quarters of last years long-term private capital amounting to R630 million was received and I quoted it in my speech last Monday. If one looks at the figures for the latest year, 1976, one finds that the foreign capital inflow is in fact above the average, and I want to stress again that this is at a time when we are told that overseas capital is drying up or rather has dried up. At such a time the 1976 figure is significantly above the average for the years since 1968, which I have quoted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member must please give me an opportunity to speak. I have had great patience in listening to a very large number of speakers on that side. I also have to watch the time factor.</p>

</speech>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member behind would interrupt less, perhaps there would be time to answer some questions. The average inflow over all these years has been about R630 million, so the figure for last year is, in fact, above the average. The facts are therefore against all these doubts and fears and airy imaginings that one hears from the other side every time an hon. member gets up to speak.</p>

<p>I want to take as a further example the recent period 1970-&#x2019;74. I am leaving 1975 out of the picture because that was a very special year when nearly R1 900 million was received. In that period the foreign capital amounted to 10% or 11% of gross domestic fixed investment. In other words, foreign capital coming in was roughly 10% of all our fixed investments. I am not saying it is not important; we have always welcomed foreign capital and we use it very productively. I want to state, however, that it is not a decisive factor. If a shortage of capital should emerge for any reason, this country can be absolutely certain that we will take steps to mobilize our own capital resources more efficiently every day. [Interjections.] We are certainly not depressed about the situation and we are not pessimistic. We have enormous confidence in this country&#x2019;s future. At this moment we are, in fact, pushing forward with a whole series of extremely important capital development projects and the provision of basic infrastructure for this country, and we shall continue to do so in the future. We will give that assurance.</p>

<p>I say again that conditions have become tighter. This is something I said in my speech last week, but this applies, of course, to a very large number of other countries as well. I would like to stress again that we on this side wish to view the situation in perspective. We have in the past had times when it has been just as difficult, if not more so, to obtain foreign capital. Only three years ago we had a net outflow of nearly R100 million, which was infinitely worse than last year, and I think hon. members will agree that we came through rather well, and even at that time we were pursuing a very large number of basically important infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>One begins to wonder, when looking at this whole issue of foreign capital investment in South Africa, how the question of confidence is, in fact, determined and how the assessment is made of South Africa as an investment outlet today in certain quarters. I want to refer once more to <i>Business Week.</i> It is stated in this periodical that investors overseas are wary today, and mention is made of the big Sasol 2 project in South Africa, and the Fluor Corporation, a Los Angeles engineering and building company. It is stated that the Fluor Corporation was reminded of this difficulty last year when the Export-Import Bank of the United States turned down its request for a 15-year $375 million loan guarantee to help finance an oil-from-coal plant&#x2014;i.e. Sasol 2&#x2014;that Fluor is building for the South African Government. The article goes on to state that the Export-Import Bank of the United States &#x201C;was unable to find reasonable assurance of repayment of the <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_0719"/>loan&#x201D;. This was said by Mr. Stephen M. Minikes, the bank&#x2019;s senior vice president, to a congressional committee in the United States. I think that is pretty shocking.</p>

I gave the facts about Government spending as a proportion of aggregate spending in South Africa in my speech a few days ago. Those facts have not been doubted or queried by a single member opposite.

<p>The budget deliberately saw to it that Government spending in South Africa, in real terms, remained virtually constant. What better could we have done&#x003F; Since then we have had to provide a certain amount for a 10% increase in Public Service salaries and certain other increases which were quite inevitable, as will appear later. However, even with those increases, if one takes out defence spending&#x2014;which, after all, is an enormous burden on the Exchequer, although rightly so; we have done it deliberately&#x2014;the increase in Government spending at this moment is appreciably below the increase in the rate of inflation. In other words, except for defence, we have not increased Government spending in real terms. In fact, in real terms there has been a decrease. That is the position. Sir, when I show that we have reduced Government spending, the Opposition, parrot-wise, simply keep on screaming that we have in fact increased it.

<p>The hon. member for Constantia criticized us for raising capital by big price increases to finance State enterprises. He said we were raising prices very substantially in respect of Escom, Iscor and so on. He said we were using those increases to finance our enterprises. He then spoke of using deficit financing, whereupon I immediately asked him what he meant by deficit financing. In reply he said he could not give me the answer off-hand. Perhaps the hon. member when he speaks again, will give me the facts about this deficit financing. But I want to ask the hon. member: How else should this essential expenditure on the production of steel, on the production of power in South Africa, on the building up of Sasol and all these other big projects be financed&#x003F; Must it be financed from taxation&#x003F; The hon. member is on record several times in this hon. House as having objected to that method of financing. The hon. member objects to the use of current revenue to finance capital projects. The hon. member will remember that he said that several times.</p>

<p>In the past the hon. member has also had a good deal to say about the rapid increase in bank credit and in the quantity of money, but I noticed that on this occasion he was very quiet. In fact, we have deliberately through our monetary policy very substantially reduced the increase in the quantity of money and the issue of credit. As the hon. member knows, it has been down to an absolute minimal percentage during the last several months. That is the policy we are deliberately applying, together with fiscal policies, in order to correct the balance of payments deficit and to handle the inflation problem.</p>

<p>With regard to the balance of payments problem I can perhaps be forgiven if I just remind the House again that we have in fact over the last five or six months seen a very substantial improvement in the current account of the balance of payments, directly as a result of these measures. That is freely conceded. Of course, there also was the import deposit scheme, which we introduced at the beginning of August. We said that that was to be a temporary scheme. It amounted to a 20% deposit on imports, and that has helped very substantially to improve the current account. Now, after six months, we have announced that we are ceasing that operation.

I said that the import deposit scheme would cease on 2 February and that the successive deposits would be repaid, each one after six months. In other words, if an importer made a deposit on 1 September he will be repaid six months later.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into lesser issues, but the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;and I think it is not the first time he has used this argument&#x2014;said that the <span class="col_1407-1408" refersTo="page_0721"/>correct measure of the growth in the economy was the gross national product&#x2014;I quoted the gross domestic product&#x2014;the measure of what is available to sustain standards of living in the country. I would like to remind the hon. member that the real gross national product is affected by the terms of trade and the terms of trade, which are very substantially outside our control, have moved against us since 1974 by something like 25%. It is a very big move against us. Over a longer period there is of course little difference between the growth rate of the GNP and the GDP. I submit that as a measure of economic activity the GDP is superior to the GNP, and I am prepared to argue that point.</p>

<p>Coming to the Part Appropriation Bill itself, the hon. member drew some rather far-reaching conclusions from the fact that the figure we are seeking approval for is R2 922 million. He pointed out that this was 25% higher than the previous year and said it indicated a budget of R10 000 million. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. member. I can assure him that the budget will not be anything near R10 000 million.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course you should be pleased. The hon. member should surely know by now that, first of all, in the part appropriation we do not give a whole lot of details. He deplores the fact that we have not given him details. Secondly, he should realize that the figure we give there bears virtually no relation to the final figure in the budget. So if the hon. member will practise just a little patience we shall in a matter of weeks know what the figure is that we will provide for in the budget. This is a figure for four months. The hon. member should be very careful not to draw far-reaching conclusions from it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville is not here at present. He did inform me that he could not be here. But I wish to deal rather briefly with some of the points he made. First of all, Sir, he once again accused me of window dressing in the budget. When he first said that, previously, I objected to that, and I object again now. If I am window dressing, as he has explained it, I am acting contrary to the standing instructions of the Treasury, and the Auditor-General will very soon be on my back and on the back of the Treasury. Nothing of the kind has, of course, happened. The hon. member for Yeoville also had a good deal to say about, what he called, the heavy Exchequer spending during the first few months of the current financial year, the financial year which started in April last year. I would like to explain very carefully, once and for all, why that expenditure was heavy. It was heavy during the first few months. The test, however, is after a year. The test comes on March 31 whether expenditure was in fact unreasonable, and I suggest, with respect to my hon. friends opposite, that they should be a little bit more careful with these easy criticisms that have been thrown about about excessive Government spending. Let us look at the figure on March 31, the figure for the full year.</p>

<p>During the first few months of the current financial year we had to spend at a rapid rate on defence. The Special Defence Account usually starts the financial year by drawing on its balance with the Public Debt Commissioners. But in April 1976, this balance had already been drawn because of our commitments in Angola and in South West Africa. Secondly, the Railways had planned borrowing to finance their capital requirements during the first quarter of the financial year, but in the event they found it necessary to draw on the Treasury somewhat earlier than planned. This also meant the Exchequer had to spend. Thirdly, there was a change in the procedure regarding the payment of interest on Railway debt.</p>

<p>This meant that an amount of R70 million had to be drawn from the Exchequer, an amount which in previous years would have been paid directly by the Railways. Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, the provincial administrations also drew earlier than usual, because their balances had also been drawn upon. Fifthly, Iscor, because of the very substantial costs escalation which all these big corporations are experiencing, drew R50 million to meet urgent requirements early in this financial year. Lastly, Community Development drew a substantial amount to reimburse local authorities which had temporarily financed certain housing schemes which happened with <span class="col_1409-1410" refersTo="page_0722"/>our full knowledge and which we regarded as very important.</p>

<p>These factors account for something like five-sixths of the amount by which Exchequer issues in the first-quarter of 1976-&#x2019;77 exceeded the corresponding figure for the previous year, and I am glad to have had the opportunity of putting the record straight on that.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the hon. member for Yeoville, and also the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, spoke about Glen Anil, and more specifically asked why the Government had furnished a guarantee of R5 million in respect of Glen Anil. Mr. Speaker, I would say that it was the Government&#x2019;s clear duty, in view of the approach of the consortium of banks and the wide repercussions of the Glen Anil case, to investigate the banks&#x2019; proposals very thoroughly. As I have mentioned earlier, it was an extremely complicated exercise. This could only have been done through a Government guarantee in order to keep Glen Anil alive while the matter was being investigated. Glen Anil desperately needed funds, but the banks said that they were not prepared to give them another cent unless they could get a Government guarantee for that amount to keep Glen Anil going for a matter of a few weeks so that we could complete our investigation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can perhaps come back to that, but I should be able to give the House more details in a moment. I want to continue with my explanation, because the hon. member for Yeoville also raised the question whether this extension of time resulted in one bank receiving, as he put it, a preference over other banks. I believe this is the position, but I should like to add that it was realized by all the banks, who nevertheless agreed to it. The value of security varies from day to day, and it will be almost impossible to restore the <i>status quo ante</i> by legislation as was suggested. The Reserve Bank&#x2014;I agree with it&#x2014;is very much against that sort of suggestion. I should like to remind the House that the guarantee of R5 million was in fact restricted to an amount of R1,4 million and was, I believe, absolutely unavoidable to make that investigation from our side.</p>

<p>The hon. member also says that a township developer needs to be looked at carefully. I can just remind him and the House that the Fouch&#x00E9; Commission, which is sitting at present, is doing precisely that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also had something to say about smaller banks. He talked about guarantees being made available and suggested that a guarantee scheme for deposits up to a certain maximum should be instituted. I can assure the House that, as far as we are concerned, we have been giving careful attention to the position of the banks from the very start of this whole operation. The Reserve Bank is looking very closely at these and other suggestions in order to bring about, perhaps, a more effective rationalization of the whole banking system and, indeed, to strengthen the banking system in South Africa. Having said that, I want to reiterate what I said in a speech the other day, that despite the unfortunate experience which Rondalia had earlier for quite other reasons and which Rand Bank had directly as a result of Glen Anil, the position is most definitely under control and there is no reason whatsoever at this moment for any undue concern about the safety or security of banks in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppe seemed to be unduly crusty when he spoke the other day. Usually he gets up in a good frame of mind and seems to be very friendly, but there was something bothering him this time. I discovered what it was. He was very cross with me because I had not replied, as he said, satisfactorily to a question he put on the Order Paper. He wanted full details of the curtailment by us of capital projects. [Interjections.] Yes, he said he wanted details. I think the hon. member, should he think about this carefully, would appreciate at once that there are literally hundreds and hundreds of items. There are how many dozens of departments concerned with the various projects and if one put together all the items, one would have an extremely detailed list. However, the hon. member expects us, first of all, to co-ordinate all that into one place and then to look at all these details, some of which are extremely important and others less important. The Treasury would have had to go into every one in order to discover, firstly, precisely what was originally asked for; secondly, what was allowed as escalations in the <span class="col_1411-1412" refersTo="page_0723"/>interval&#x2014;in the case of some of them over many years&#x2014;and, thirdly, what we said at some point should be the final figure for each specific one. He should realize that in some cases there cannot be a final figure. I can assure the hon. member that the Treasury spent a lot of time on this and came to the conclusion that it was quite impracticable. If the hon. member should like to discuss this with us, I am sure we would be able to convince him of that within a matter of a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that since the State President actually mentioned that in a specific paragraph of his address when he opened this session of Parliament, it struck me as having significance. That is why I put the question on the Order Paper.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is perfectly true. I did not say we did not have to look very critically at some part of that, but I am saying that, as we interpreted the hon. member&#x2019;s question, it certainly would have been a major operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South&#x2014;he seems to have disappeared for the moment&#x2014;informed this House in a very confident tone that I had apparently misled the House on inflation matters. I stand by what I said, namely that in the fourth quarter of last year the seasonally adjusted rate of inflation was 9% above the previous quarter. We have been using these quarterly figures for a very long time. It is not my fault if the hon. member does not understand what a &#x201C;seisoensaangesuiwerde syfer&#x201D; is. The hon. member said that I misled the House because I quoted the correct figure. The trouble is that every time one quotes a figure which shows an improvement in the economy, it is completely unpalatable to some hon. members on the other side. That was the hon. member who in a speech in Pietermaritzburg in September said that South Africa was in fact insolvent. I do not propose wasting the time of the House in replying to that except to put it to the House here.</p>

<p>A great deal has lately been said about the legitimate place of the Government in the economy and of the relation of the Government to private enterprise. Quite a number of people came into the act on this, among them the FCI, who came into the picture in a matter of hours after Dr. Wassenaar&#x2019;s onslaught on private enterprise hit the headlines. One of the things the FCI said&#x2014;which was surprising&#x2014;was that the South African economy had shown signs of distress ever since 1969. I have taken the trouble to look at the gross domestic product figures from 1969 to 1975&#x2014;including the low growth rate of 214% in 1975&#x2014;the gross domestic product, in real terms, has on average increased by more than 5% per annum, one of the most rapid rates in the world. This happened in a period during which the South African economy is said to have shown signs of distress. If one looks at the aggregate of investment, which is another very good indicator of activity, the gross domestic investment, one will find that the position is even better. The gross domestic investment has in real terms since 1969 to the end of 1975 risen by at least 814% per annum. One can go on like this. It is so easy to throw these criticisms around and use them in public, but it is less easy to substantiate them. What is being overlooked, of course, is that the South African economy is not only basically sound, but also remarkably versatile. I happen to have some figures here with me. If one looks at the composition of the gross domestic product, i.e. the value of all our goods and services&#x2014;our whole production&#x2014;one finds that we are not simply dependent, like some countries, on copper, cocoa or any one single crop. What is the position in South Africa&#x003F; Agriculture, for instance, is contributing at least 9% of the total value of all our production at this moment. Mining contributes 15% to the gross domestic product. This means, of course, the increasing use of our mineral resources, which is going to be a great feature of this country&#x2019;s development as we go forward. Manufacturing contributes 22%; construction, 4&#x00BD;%; transport 8&#x00BD;%; commerce, or the wholesale and retail trade, 13&#x00BD;%; financing, insurance and real estate business, nearly 10&#x00BD;%; and general government not even 10%. We must bear in mind that this is an extraordinarily versatile economy and if things become strained in one direction, we have eight or nine other major directions which can be used in order to absorb that strain.</p>

<p>I know hon. members become a little irked when we refer to what is said in other quarters, especially if they think these are <span class="col_1413-1414" refersTo="page_0724"/>quarters which ought to support them, but I want to refer now to <i>The Star</i> of 8 February. It said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senator Owen Horwood was perfectly justified in defending his fiscal policies yesterday. There is consensus that within the general economic framework and considering the excesses of the past, his budget policy is the right one.</block>

<p>So much for Dr. Wassenaar&#x2019;s talks of a &#x201C;tragic budget&#x201D; in 1976. They say further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is still plenty of inflation in the pipeline.</block>

<p>They go on to swing the argument to the political side by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The real brake on the economy is the political policy.</block>

<p>They then say more about the political side. But I am now dealing with the financial-economic policy. The <i>Financial Mail</i> of 11 February says that we are on target with our financial policy. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far Senator Horwood&#x2019;s financial policies have been signally successful.</block>

<p>I am not saying it, and I am sure I can be forgiven for reading it in this House, because I have been listening to some very strange criticism for 12 hours. They went on to quote what I had said and added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Optimism is the wine of fools, but it is also a vital ingredient in all successful recipes for economic recovery. The Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;Chef de l&#x2019;&#x00C9;conomie&#x201D; was therefore quite right to pour a moderate measure into the first important parliamentary financial debate of the year.</block>

<p>They then talk of good news in different directions and add&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For production to have risen by 1%, export volumes must have risen sharply, while the share of imports in the total supply of goods and services, must have fallen. In fact, imports have fallen in terms of volume as well.</block>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that I am aware of a recent phenomenon in South Africa, a phenomenon which, to my mind, is a serious one. Up to now there has been a tendency for those who do not like us, who disagree with us, perhaps on many other grounds, to include in their attacks on us various criticisms of our economic and financial policy. That is all right. If certain people want to do it, they may, if only they would stick to the facts. We can defend ourselves. I am not on the defensive here when I talk of the financial economic policy of this country. Until now it has been an attack on the Government, but now, all of a sudden, it has become a very much broader based attack. There is now an attempt, both inside and outside the country, to discredit not simply the Government and hopefully to destroy it, but also to attack the Afrikaner. I happen to be an English-speaking South African, but I regard myself as an English-speaking Afrikaner. I have Afrikaner blood in my veins and I am very proud of the fact. If there is one group in this country that deserves well of the country, it is the Afrikaner. If one looks at history, who has brought this country to where it is in terms of basic security and safety&#x003F; If all the frills are cut out, who has&#x2014;especially lately&#x2014;stood in the breach if it has not been the Afrikaner&#x003F; I believe that it is a tragedy that the English-speaking South African has not bestirred himself and taken a much more active role in our political affairs. That is one of this country&#x2019;s really great tragedies. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>When I read about the attempt to draw on these overseas media&#x2014;I have read <i>Business Week,</i> which has a circulation of millions&#x2014;I want to say, and I am speaking for thousands and thousands of English-speaking people in this country, that we thank a great and kindly Providence every day that we have an Afrikaner Government in power. I should like to know where this country would have been as a result of this last onslaught &#x2026; [Interjections.] This hooliganism will not deter me and those thousands of other English-speaking people in South Africa who are coming to support the Government every day &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, regrettably I was away from the House during the Second Reading debate on this Bill. However, I did spend much of the weekend reading the Hansard speeches of those members who took part in the debate on this Bill. After consideration of the speeches in Hansard, I have come to the conclusion that I personally consider this to be a bad Bill. I say this because, in examining this Bill, I find that there are many inconsistencies in it. The main inconsistency I take issue with is that the Eill is designed to prevent the showing of films on Sundays because it is said that this will lead to the commercialization of the Sabbath, and yet we all know that there are many, many other activities which commercialize the Sabbath. For this reason I believe that this inconsistency is going to create a tremendous number of problems for those who are going to have to administer the legislation. It was suggested that one of the reasons for introducing this Bill was that the showing of films on Sunday is a recent development in South Africa, that the showing of films will change the traditional pattern of Sundays as we know them and that it is therefore necessary to prohibit the showing of films for gain. It was quite clear from the evidence led by various members, however, that in the case of Margate on the South Coast film shows for gain have been going on for 20 years and that this has, in fact, become the way of life of the people in that area, so I cannot see why this hon. Minister feels he is now justified in changing something that has been accepted as the normal way of life by people for over 20 years.</p>

<p>I found that in the course of the debate there were a number of members on the Government side who appealed to the hon. the Minister to extend the powers of this Bill to include Sunday sport, and yet I should like to ask on what grounds they make such an appeal because Sunday sport as I know it, and I am now 45 years of age, has been the way of life of people in Natal ever since I can remember. Are those hon. members now intending to request legislation which will change the way of life of the people whom I believe I represent&#x003F;</p>

<p>I also believe that this is a bad Bill because there are a number of bad principles involved in its implementation. The first one I should like to mention is that of exemption. The very fact that this Bill, in terms of clause 2(1), allows the hon. the Minister to grant exemptions to people for the showing of films is discriminatory in its very essence. It discriminates against some people and not against others. In fact, one hon. member went as far as to say that he had no doubt that the hon: the Minister would grant exemptions to various other language groups or race groups but that he would grant no exemptions to the Whites. It is my belief that this discriminates against certain White people here in South Africa. I do not like the way the hon. the Minister intends to grant exemptions either because I feel that the granting of exemptions involves an arbitrary action on the part of those who have these powers, and these exemptions are going to be granted by either the hon. the Minister or various officials. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the officials, to whom he is going to give these powers, really understand the sentiments and feelings of the people who are going to have to apply to them for exemptions. I do not intend going into this matter any further because much has already been said about it, but for the reasons I have mentioned, I consider this a bad Bill.</p>

<p>Having read Hansard it was very clear to me that in the main hon. members on the other side gave cognizance primarily to one Christian point of view. I think they must agree with me that evidence was led that there are other Christian points of view which disagree with the very principle of the method of controlling the commercialization of Sundays provided for in this Bill. I studied carefully what a lot of hon. members had to say and found that many hon. members on the other side were guilty, I believe, of a purely personal approach to this Bill. They took a very parochial point of view. If I may go so far, I believe that in fact they took a <span class="col_1419-1420" refersTo="page_0727"/>rather selfish point of view in this connection. There were many, many members, such as the hon. members for Stilfontein and Pretoria East, who referred to &#x201C;my Sunday&#x201D;, &#x201C;my constituency&#x201D; and &#x201C;my voters&#x201D;. I should like to ask the hon. members on the other side: What about my constituency, my voters and my Sunday&#x003F; It is because of this attitude that I believe that, in addition to this being a bad Bill, it is also a sad Bill. After all, cinema viewing is not in itself a crime; it is not in itself a sin. After all, the hon. the Minister himself has consented to grant exemptions to allow people to show films on Sundays. This, surely, must indicate that the showing of films on Sundays is not in itself a crime.</p>

<p>After having read the Second Reading debate on this measure in Hansard, I found that there were things said during that debate which I personally would rather had not been said. This is an extremely sensitive subject. It concerns differing views and, as the hon. member for Algoa said, it concerns religious norms and, I believe, differing norms. I agree with the hon. member for Algoa that this is so, but at this juncture I want to say that the subject of religious norms and of Christian norms is a very touchy subject. Wars have been fought over this particular subject. I am sure that many hon. members on that side will agree with me in this respect. It is because of this that I should like to say to the hon. member for Pretoria East that I was rather upset at what he had to say in his speech on 2 February. Referring to the speech made by my colleague, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North, he said (Hansard, 2 February 1977, col. 676)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the same old &#x201C;Boerehaat&#x201D; we have experienced throughout.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is venom which spouts forth from the fountain of hate for the Whites and the Afrikaner in South Africa in particular.</block>

<p>Sir, these are very, very strong words and I for my own part&#x2014;and I believe that in this I also speak for the members in these benches, who incidentally include a lot of Afrikaners&#x2014;believe he is wrong to assume such things and to say such things about members on this side who are opposing this Bill. He is also wrong to presume that we adopted this attitude when we opposed this Bill. Speaking for myself for a moment, I want to say that I denounce the term &#x201C;boerehaat&#x201D; and all it stands for, especially at this time when English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking boys and men are on our borders defending our country. I believe that terms such as this should be struck from the mouths of those people who represent South Africa in this House. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We oppose this Bill because we represent our voters&#x2019; points of view. We represent our constituencies and we represent the attitudes of the people who have elected us to this House. We, especially those of us from Natal, possibly view things quite differently from members on that side of the House. I should like to say to hon. members opposite that we like to have a say in those matters which we term as being close to hearth and home. We like to have a say in what we can and cannot do on Sundays. We like to have a say in those things which we should or should not do on Sundays. This is part of our English-speaking South African tradition. The fact that, as one hon. member pointed out, there is no legislation in Natal prohibiting the viewing of films on Sundays&#x2014;decisions of this nature are left to the local community&#x2014;is surely part of the tradition and the heritage of the people who live in Natal, a tradition which incidentally, may I say, includes a great respect for the Christian way of life.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, that is up to the Durban municipality. I do not believe there are fewer churches in my constituency, in terms of the number of people there, than there are in the constituencies of the members opposite.</p>

<p>I should like to remind the hon. members on that side that South Africa is not a homogeneous society, but a plural one. As such, there are differing viewpoints, differing traditions and differing attitudes towards religious points of view and Christian points of view. I believe it is essential for peace and harmony in this plural South Africa of ours for all of us to have mutual respect for each other. There should not only be such mutual respect between Black and White, but also <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0728"/>between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people. I do not believe that you can have mutual respect between people if in the first place you deny one group or section of the population its own self-respect. I believe that this Bill imposes itself upon the self-respect of the people of Natal. We are not the type of people who take kindly to this kind of imposition. We believe that we as English-speaking South Africans from Natal, especially, are true South Africans and that we are loyal South Africans. I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that we will be seen to be defending South Africa should that occasion unfortunately arise. We believe most definitely in defending our fatherland and we also believe in obeying the laws of our land. We also believe that the lawmakers of this land of ours must take cognizance of our attitudes and beliefs in these matters and especially our norms in matters as sensitive as this one, just as much I believe as those hon. members on that side of the House who have appealed to us during the Second Reading debate to respect their points of view and norms. It is this disrespect for one another&#x2019;s tradition, one another&#x2019;s beliefs, that breaks down the mutual respect of people. That is why we in these benches believe in the federal system of Government. It is only through a federal system of Government that the traditions of individual groups can be preserved for that group. That is why we believe that the powers which are inherent in this Bill should be given to the local authorities and not to the central Government because the local authorities are far more in touch with sensitive matters such as those that are contained within this Bill. I should therefore like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti is still approaching this legislation as if it is really aimed against Natal and does so in spite of the fact that the hon. the Minister has denied this allegation on more than one occasion. The hon. member keeps on harping on one string, namely that these things did not exist in Natal and that there was no interference by the authorities in the way in which Natal spent its Sundays. Even that premise is wrong, and we are still waiting for an answer from the official Opposition as regards that very premise. Apart from anything else, I should like to refer the hon. member to Act No. 24 of 1878 of Natal which is similar to Act No. 28 of 1896.</p>

<p>No, it concerned all shops, &#x201C;save those excepted shall be closed on Sundays&#x201D;. Apart from that, I should like to point out that the Public Holidays Act was passed by this Parliament in 1950. Hon. members of the Opposition will find it very interesting to take another look at the debates which took place when that legislation was being adopted. Four additional days were elevated to the status of Sunday by that Act. There was no argument, and no question of us, as a central Government, telling Natal or any local community how to spend their Sundays. That legislation was introduced and accepted by all the members of the Opposition with universal acclamation. It interfered with the private affairs of every citizen of the country. It added four public holidays to the Sundays which already existed.</p>

<p>If we look at the debate on this legislation, a debate which is almost at an end, listen to the arguments of the Opposition and study them again in Hansard, it is clear that what the basis of their argument amounts to is the fact that the passing of the Bill is not the responsibility of Parliament, but that it actually falls within the scope, within the framework, of local communities. A matter of this nature must be left to local communities. When the hon. member for Umhlatuzana was confronted with the position of drive-in theatres which do not fall within the jurisdiction of local authorities, he replied that the local authority which has to decide on this, is the provincial council. Why&#x003F; He himself quoted the examples of community A which would decide in one way and community B which would decide in another. I think that <span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0729"/>one can safely say that the communities which send Nationalists to this House, will vote in favour of the Bill. In contrast, the communities who send UP or PRP members to this House, will vote against the Bill. I am not quite sure whether this is the case, but for the purposes of my argument I shall accept that this is in fact the case.</p>
