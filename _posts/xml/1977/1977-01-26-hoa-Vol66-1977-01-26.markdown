<p>Mr. Speaker, prior to the adjournment of this House last night I said that I was sorry for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but that it was not possible for me to save him. From now on he will just have to try and save himself.</p>

<p>I notice that the hon. member for Houghton is not present at the moment.</p>

<p>I mentioned last night that there were many female Bantu servants who were not treated well by their employers, especially in certain parts of our country. I also pointed out that I had personal experience of such cases. Complaints about this had been made to me in the past. When I was talking about this last night, the hon. member for Houghton said to me, &#x201C;You talk a lot of rubbish!&#x201D; I should like to read a letter here this afternoon with the leave of the hon. House. This letter was published only the other day, on 23 November 1976, in <i>The Star.</i> It was written by a Bantu woman and concerns the treatment she received from her female employer. In reading this letter hon. members may rest assured that this is the type of treatment which a servant has received from someone who is probably a supporter of the PRP.</p>

<p>I should like to put it to the hon. member for Houghton that I said yesterday that the experience which I had gained was not a lot of nonsense, but was based on facts. However, she has to have more regard to these things. To the hon. member for Mooi River I should like to say that the Afrikaner has always acted honestly in his politics, even if the hon. member does not understand him. The Afrikaner did not flee from Kenya; it was other people who fled.</p>

<from><span class="col_195-196" refersTo="page_0115"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, naturally I shall not reply to the speech of the hon. member for Stilfontein. Never before in the history of this Parliament has a motion of no confidence in the Government been more justified than it is this year. There is not the least doubt that South Africa is faced with the most serious crisis in its entire history as far as its existence is concerned. The chief elements in that crisis were stated clearly and fearlessly by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in his no-confidence speech. The elements may be summarized in five points.</p>

<p>In the first instance a critical point has been reached in the internal relations between White and non-White. The occurrences since 16 June last year represent a massive rejection by the Black populations of our country of the Government&#x2019;s policy and of the political, social and economic dispensation which has been created for them. The large number of people who have been killed, the thousands who have been wounded, the houses and other buildings which have been destroyed by fire, the large number of people who have been detained and the damage which amounts to millions of rands, all testify to the Blacks&#x2019; resistance to the existing order, to their lack of confidence in the Government of the country, which is their country too, and to their disbelief in the present system being able to satisfy their needs and aspirations adequately.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every one of us who loves this country and who makes constructive co-operation among its population groups the first priority, rejects violence as a means of protest and as a means through which change can be effected, because nobody with any common sense can believe that better understanding and improved co-operation can be achieved across the dead bodies of people, from the ashes of buildings destroyed by fire or in front of the barrel of a gun. Indeed, every person killed or wounded, whether that person is Black or White, merely reinforces the bitterness, the distrust and the hatred &#x2026;</p>

<p>Who are the inciters&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and the Afrikaner himself knows this. As regards the exact contributary causes, the course and handling of the riots, we shall have to wait for the report of the Cillie Commission, but there need not be any doubt about the fundamental underlying causes which brought about the estrangement and alienation between White and non-White. If I have time, I shall deal with this matter later on in my speech.</p>

<p>One would be making a complete blunder and would be misjudging the occurrences over the past seven months if one were to see them simply, or even primarily, as an attempt on the part of communist agitators to incite revolution. I would readily accept that there were such agitators, as I do accept the evidence in this regard presented by the Minister of Justice to this House yesterday, but it would be extremely tragic if we were to try and explain away the bitterness and frustrations which exist amongst the non-Whites, by adopting the point of view, as is being done by some of our fellow countrymen, that the dissatisfaction and resistance amongst the non-Whites would not have existed were it not for communist agitation.</p>

<p>In one particular respect the occurrences of the past few months have probably ushered in a new era in our history. For the first time Black youths have taken the law into their own hands on a large scale, and asserted themselves, sometimes even to the extent of terrorizing and intimidating the adults in their own community. On the basis of my own observations it is clear to me that their general conduct, seen as a form of protest against and resistance to the White authority and the dispensation which has been created in South Africa for non-Whites, enjoyed large-scale support from the adults in their own community. Here I am referring specifically to the Black parents and other adults who are permanent residents in the urban areas, as well as to the reaction in the Coloured community. In their resistance the youths succeeded to a considerable extent in mobilizing at least the sympathy and the passive co-operation of the adult community. Even more illuminating is the fact that many of these youths intimated that they felt so embittered about the present set-up that they would even be prepared to die, and that they would no longer be intimidated by the fear of action on the part of the authorities. It is general knowledge that fairly large numbers&#x2014;I do not know the exact numbers&#x2014;have left the country, some of <span class="col_197-198" refersTo="page_0116"/>them with a view to furthering their studies and others with a view to undergoing military training. We ought to take due cognizance of the conduct of the Black youths in this regard, because if it were to happen that these youths were to become totally alienated from the system, this could cause nothing but the most serious problems for all of us on the road ahead. Furthermore, it would appear that the Black youths in our urban areas have become convinced to an increasing extent that the necessary changes will not be brought about by means of peace and reason, and that violent action consequently constituted the only alternative. In this connection they are prepared to accept support, wherever it may come from.</p>

<p>There is hardly any doubt as regards the feeling of mutual solidarity which exists between them and the Black peoples of Africa. Equally alarming is the degree of solidarity between the Black and Coloured youths which emerged during the riots. There is no doubt at all in my own mind that drastic improvements will have to be effected in our political and economic dispensation if we want to counteract effectively the negative possibilities of Black consciousness and of Black power. If these changes and improvements are not effected as soon as possible and in a planned fashion, the position of the moderate non-White leaders&#x2014;fortunately there still are a considerable number of them at present&#x2014;is going to be hopelessly undermined and we are running the risk of the leadership of the Black masses falling into the hands of reactionaries and revolutionaries. What I find absolutely amazing and inexplicable, is that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and his hon. Deputy Ministers&#x2014;in particular those who deal with urban Bantu affairs and with Bantu education&#x2014;were so completely out of touch with the feelings and frustrations of the urban Black population that they did nothing at all over the years to allay these frustrations and feelings of bitterness. If we bear in mind the fact that the hon. the Minister has been occupying this portfolio for more than ten years, then the occurrences which have taken place since June last year, must be seen as an absolute motion of no confidence in his handling of Bantu affairs. If I were in his position, I would have realized this and tendered my resignation. The fact that the hon. the Minister and his deputies were so unaware of what was happening amongst the Black urban population, or if they did know, were unwilling or unable to do anything about it, makes them, in my opinion, incompetent to remain in charge of these vitally important portfolios any longer.</p>

<p>It was an extremely unfortunate remark which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education made, viz. that we as Whites provided the money for Bantu education and consequently had the right to prescribe what the medium of instruction should be. I hope that I am quoting the hon. the Deputy Minister correctly in substance. It was nothing but fuel on the fire in the particular circumstances which prevailed at the time. What is more, it testifies to a premiss, to an approach and to a mental attitude, an insensitivity which, in my opinion, make him unsuitable for the work which he is supposed to be doing. We expected the hon. the Minister and his hon. Deputy Ministers to be the vanguard in restoring peace and calm to the Black residential areas and in creating effective communication channels. We could have expected of him, of all people, to have been able to convince the Blacks that the Government had a plan and the intention to remove their legitimate grievances and to create a new dispensation, one which would take also their wishes and desires into account. It would obviously have been so much better if we had built up that attitude of mutual trust and co-operation over the years. However, the riots hit the hon. the Minister without his having any effective means of communication with the Black urban population. Nor did he have the means of bringing about calm and hope in the Black residential areas. We do not have to look far for the reason for this because it is to be found in the ideological pre-occupation of the hon. the Minister and some of his hon. colleagues in this House and outside, as well as in his continued refusal to accept the urban Blacks as permanent parts of the population structure outside the homelands. His vacillating between &#x201C;permanent-temporary&#x201D; and &#x201C;temporary-permanent&#x201D; also contributed towards this, as well as his approach that the Black man in the city finds himself in a so-called &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; capacity in that city, that the only claim of the urban to Bantu rights is to rights in the homelands and that <span class="col_199-200" refersTo="page_0117"/>only the homeland leaders have the right to speak on behalf of the urban Blacks.</p>

<p>It is in the implementation of that ideological prison that the Prime Minister too has never taken the trouble himself of developing a corps of responsible Black leaders outside the homelands and of remaining in touch with them. If there is one lesson which we have probably all learned from these riots, it is that the established Black urban population has shown very clearly that they do not regard the homeland leaders as being competent to speak on their behalf. What I have said in respect of the Bantu in the city, applies as much to the Coloured population. The only possible difference is that the present Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations have been occupying that portfolio for a short time only.</p>

<p>Among the Coloured population, however, as is perfectly clear from the Erika Theron report, we have the same degree of bitterness and alienation and we also have the inability of successive Ministers, including the Prime Minister himself, to allay that bitterness and frustration.</p>

<p>The second element in this motion of no confidence, is that whereas the riots, evaluated at this moment, have had the effect of further polarizing the relationship between Whites and non-Whites&#x2014;and no doubt can exist in this regard&#x2014;they have also caused a large number of Whites to question the future of our country and the expected course of events. The occurrences since July&#x2014;whether we like it or whether we agree with it is not relevant&#x2014;have caused many Whites to ask themselves to an increasing extent whether they have to accept that violent racial conflict has now become unavoidable in South Africa and to what extent they and their children are going to be involved in it. You and I, Mr. Speaker, as we are sitting in this House, do not fall into that category of people. Our overriding loyalty towards our fatherland and the belief that accommodation and co-operation is possible between all our population groups and that these will be found, leave us no choice. However, it would be foolish to deny or underestimate the widespread anxiety and doubt which exists amongst a relative large section of our White population.</p>

<p>They do not want to land in a situation of violence in which they may be obliged to take up arms against South Africans of a different colour and against their fellow man. They probably do not doubt that the Whites, at least for quite some time to come, will be able to hold their own here in the military sphere, to them the outlook is dismal, however, if the Whites have to rely on action of that kind in order to safeguard their position and future. All these months they have been waiting anxiously for the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government to bring them a message of hope, an assurance that the future will be one in which White and non-White together will be able to face the possible dangers which may threaten us from within and without. They have been hoping to get a plan from the hon. the Prime Minister, a new vision in terms of which it would have been possible for such tolerance and mutual loyalty to be realized. I am sorry to say, however, Mr. Speaker, that we and they got nothing. All we got was the New Year message of the Prime Minister in which he said that South Africa was being threatened, that South Africa was standing alone and that we must gird our loins to face the struggle.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on this side have already dealt in detail with the third aspect of this no-confidence debate, namely the desperate economic position in which the country finds itself as well as its implications for race relations. The potential explosiveness which will be created by large-scale unemployment will immediately be realized by any person with normal intelligence and insight. Already we find that young Blacks and Coloureds are crowding the streets in search of jobs.</p>

<p>If our tense racial situation gets unemployment and famine as allies, it can only strengthen the forces of isolation and revolution. Therefore it is obvious that if we want to start removing the legitimate grievances of our non-White <span class="col_201-202" refersTo="page_0118"/>groups and to create a better quality of living for all, we will need considerable amounts of money as well as an economy which is strong and dynamic. Furthermore, it is essential that we should at least open the doors within our economic system, so that everyone in our country is given the opportunity to make full use of his individual abilities. Therefore, in my opinion, it is urgently necessary to implement plans in this correction immediately, bringing in organized commerce and industry and other groups of employers. Therefore it is entirely inexplicable to me that neither the hon. the Minister of Labour, nor the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, nor the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, nor the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, has come up with positive suggestions in this connection.</p>

<p>The connection between our racial situation and foreign investment confidence has already been expounded by my hon. leader and therefore I need not go into the matter any further.</p>

<p>The fourth aspect, which has been growing even more evident than ever before in the past few months, is the increasing international isolation in which South Africa has been placed. The sobering fact, as the hon. the Prime Minister has indicated himself, is that even in the case of an armed attack against South Africa, it is practically certain that even our erstwhile Western friends will not aid us directly or openly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout have sketched the full implications of this situation for us. What the hon. the Minister of the Interior said concerning the fact that our domestic policy has become an embarrassment to our Western friends, if I understood him correctly yesterday &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; is unfortunately only too true. However, I am amazed to hear so often from the ranks of the party on the opposite side words which imply that the situation of isolation is apparently something to be proud of and not something about which we have to be unduly concerned. Let me state very clearly and straightforwardly that there is no merit at all in isolation, whether we have chosen that isolation ourselves or whether it is forced upon us. The implications of such isolation are much too far-reaching and dangerous for us.</p>

<p>Obviously no responsible South African will ever argue that we should adapt or change our domestic policy merely to gain the favour of countries abroad, not even of other countries in the Western world. However, it would be highly irresponsible for us not to take serious note of the reasons why they will not associate themselves with South Africa. No one asks that we should go out of our way to satisfy the communist countries. But it is completely erroneous and misleading to allege or believe that all the Western powers are interested in, is to bring about Black domination in South Africa and in this way to endanger the survival and safety of the Whites. Our first consideration must always be to create a dispensation here by means of which co-operation and peace may be brought about and frustration and bitterness may be eliminated and by means of which human dignity will be recognized and respected, in terms which will be acceptable to the Western world as well. In other words, we must have a domestic dispensation which will eliminate the possibility of confrontation and conflict. Once we have this, I believe that we will be able to look forward to better understanding and co-operation in our foreign relations as well.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to dwell on the manner in which the riots were handled by the police. Let me begin by saying that we all have the greatest understanding for the difficult circumstances in which the police sometimes have to take action. Indeed, in the recent riots there were many cases where the police acted in a manner which was not only highly responsible, but also extremely human. There were cases in which their actions served to defuse potentially dangerous situations. It is also obvious that in times of tension and where serious situations arise in which the police have to deal with a hostile <span class="col_203-204" refersTo="page_0119"/>and disorderly populace, when lives and property are threatened and the police themselves are in danger of their lives, it cannot be expected that it will be possible to avoid loss of life entirely. But having said all this, I should be neglecting my duty if I neglected to say that many of us in the Cape Peninsula have serious misgivings about the manner in which the riot police conducted themselves here in the city centre.</p>

<p>&#x2026; and also in certain cases in the Coloured and Bantu townships. I can say quite honesty that to the best of my information and insight, their conduct in those case caused a great deal of bitterness in the Coloured community and among the settled Black population. I am referring, <i>inter alia</i>, to the action taken by the police against children in school grounds. In this connection I want to point in particular to the riots which arose during the Christmas season between the settled Black population and and the contract labourers in Nyanga and Guguletu. The fact that so many people lost their lives, that a whole number of people were wounded, that houses were burned down and that people were left homeless and lost all their possessions, simply serves to emphasize the fact that the authorities failed in their duty and responsibility to maintain law and order in those townships.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that some of the settled Black residents of the townships are convinced that the riot police, or some of them, some individuals, incited the contract labourers and that the police stood by and did not intervene to avoid the contract labourers from taking action against the lives and property of others. I am not in a position to confirm these accusations straight away, but what is important &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; is not only whether the allegations are true, but that there are large numbers of people who believe that they are true. This is the point.</p>

<p>Therefore I say it is highly desirable and necessary for steps to be taken to prove the correctness or otherwise of these allegations. It is in the light of this that I have asked for the appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry in order to investigate these particular occurrences. On this occasion I want to repeat this request to the Government. It is clear that there were special circumstances here which justify special enquiry. The fact that the Cilli&#x00E9; Commission was not able to come to Cape Town during those riots or immediately afterwards in order to investigate matters locally supports my conviction that a commission of inquiry is essential. The police have an extremely difficult task under normal circumstances because they are expected to enforce legislation and regulations which are unacceptable and irritating to a large section of our urban Black population. This fact alone has brought about a great deal of alienation between the police and a considerable portion of our non-White population, and we shall have to make a special attempt to eliminate that mistrust and create better relations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to make just two remarks. Often in history revolutions have become unavoidable because the rulers did too little too late in order to allay the bitterness amongst their subjects and to meet their aspirations. I trust that we will have the wisdom to prevent a similar tragedy in South Africa.</p>

The conduct so far, I must admit quite honestly, of the first three senior Ministers who participated on the Government side and who occupied themselves with petty party-political games, has been completely out of place in the times in which we are living. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Prime Minister, in the unique position which he holds, will indeed give us, our country and his people a message of hope and good expectations <span class="col_205-206" refersTo="page_0120"/>which will create a new vision of mutual trust and co-operation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that in listening to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech this afternoon, we were forced to witness a pathetic spectacle. The speech amounted to nothing more than an attempt, reinforced by a batch of unproven stories, which he himself admitted to be unverifiable, to qualify for admission to the PRP. That is what the speech consisted of. I and many other hon. members on this side had thought that, as a result of his credors and all his about-faces and political somersaults the hon. member had long since qualified for membership of that party. But it seems to me that some doubt still exists in that party as to whether they do, in fact, want him. I think it is pathetic that the hon. member should have delivered such a speech in this House.</p>

<p>I just want to react to a few points, aspects which relate more specifically to my work. Afterwards I shall return to the splinter parties on the opposite side. I want to say to the hon. member that when, referring to the recent riots, he speaks of resistance among the Black people as a whole aimed at what he terms the existing order in South Africa, he has, in my opinion, committed a grave injustice, especially against the general Black masses of South Africa. Yesterday the hon. Minister of Justice himself gave evidence here on the basis of sound information that only a small gang of people had been involved in the riots. The hon. member, however, alleged that the Black masses as a whole had identified themselves with the riots. That indicates to what extend the hon. member is out of touch with responsible circles in the Black masses. I have been in frequent contact with them over the years, and during the past six or seven months as well; I have been in contact with the leaders&#x2019; corps of the Black masses. They are responsible people, and there are many of them. All their organizations are just as shocked by the goings-on, inflamed by agitators and other elements, as we as Whites are, or at least as some of we Whites are. I think it is pathetic of the hon. member to do such a thing and then on top of it, in the same breath, so to speak, to exonerate agitators&#x2014;communist agitators as he himself terms them&#x2014; completely from the incitement which took place. Yesterday, in this Chamber, he beheld weapons and other instruments or murder, objects displayed by the hon. the Minister of Justice. And then the hon. member still maintains that it was not attributable to agitation but to the resistance of the Black masses as a whole. In my opinion, anyone who speaks this way, is an irresponsible person, one who does not qualify to occupy a seat in this the highest Council Chamber. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope you will give that hon. loudspeaker on the opposite side a chance to speak but please, not at the same time as me. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Edenvale lays all the irresponsibilities and the uprisings at the door of the schoolchildren. I can say that the schoolchildren were to a great extent the victims of intimidating agitators. That is how things were. The hon. member will still see this. We will receive, at a later stage the reports of a proper judicial commission of inquiry. Then we shall have at our disposal an objective report on the matter. For that hon. member to say that I and my deputies and departments are out of touch with the Black people, that we are unwilling to help from leaders&#x2019; corps among them, is utter nonsense and proof of the hon. member&#x2019;s absolute ignorance. He is supposed to be an authority on the Bantu and therefore ought to know about these things. He ought to know that many different bodies&#x2014;I am not referring to the homelands now&#x2014;have been established among the Black people, bodies through which they can fulfil their aspirations.</p>

<p><span class="col_207-208" refersTo="page_0121"/>A few months ago, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition came forward in South Africa with his slogan: &#x201C;Save South Africa!&#x201D; According to him a &#x201C;Save South Africa&#x201D; campaign had to be launched, and he consequently embarked upon it at once. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that a broader and effective Opposition had to emerge and even offered to remove himself from the scene in order to assist in the formation of that broad, effective Opposition. Yesterday we witnessed here the pitiable joke of the hon. member for Durban Point who actually boasted of that offer of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to remove himself from the scene so that a broad, effective Opposition might emerge.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in that way, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition succeeded only in demonstrating that the implications of his admission were twofold, viz. that his party&#x2014;as it had existed until recently&#x2014;would be in the future what it had been and still was, a totally ineffective Opposition in South Africa, and that he considered himself to be incompetent Leader of the Opposition. That is what he admitted. All that I can say about it, is that we have known it for a long time. In fact we have always been secretly thankful for it. But South Africa deserves a better Opposition and a better Opposition Leader and it is a pity that up to now she has not had one. South Africa has a good Government and has a good Government leader. That is the fortunate aspect of the matter. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The energy expended on the &#x201C;Save South Africa&#x201D; campaign was, in actual fact, directed more towards a &#x201C;Save the UP&#x201D; campaign, a &#x201C;Save Graaff&#x201D; campaign. It was a more personal matter. But what has happened now&#x003F; Those hon. members have put their heads together. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. leader of the PRP and Mr. Theo Gerdener have, as leaders, put their heads together. I think we can indeed refer to them as &#x201C;the three front-line leaders&#x201D; of South Africa. [Interjections.] They discovered, however, that there were more than three &#x201C;front-line leaders&#x201D;, so they then acquired a fourth. They acquired ex-Judge Kowie Marais to go and work out matters for them. The result is the so-called 14 points.</p>

<p>Let us now determine what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has in the meantime achieved with his campaign. Firstly, he himself condemned the UP as being too ineffective to engineer any salvation for South Africa; that is to say, if South Africa in fact needs salvation. In the second place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition caused his own party to split. He has once again caused a rift in his party. This is the third time that something like this has happened. I am not talking about individuals who have left his party in the past. What we are dealing with here is the third split in the UP and it is obviously not the last. Earlier today we heard that five members of the Provincial Council had left the Leader of the Opposition and had joined the group of the hon. member for Newton Park. This is certainly not the end of the story. We shall have to watch the rift widen. All these things have happened to the UP, and yet the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the short-sightedness of the hon. member for Sea Point. Although all these things have taken place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition declares that it does not discourage him in the slightest. He says: &#x201C;I intend to press on&#x201D;. He is carrying on with his task and he says he shall do so with &#x201C;vigour and resolution&#x201D;. Just listen now to whom it is he allows to support him&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;was&#x201D;. The Opposition is welcome to him. It is very clear that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now found himself in a &#x201C;swop shop&#x201D;. What did he get in that &#x201C;swop shop&#x201D;&#x003F; He got Mr. Gerdener in the place of Mr. Boet van den Heever, but he had to give away five other members into the bargain to be able to get that one. And there is more: Today he lost five members of the Provincial Council as well, and that is still not the end of it. He will have to forfeit even more.</p>

<p><span class="col_209-210" refersTo="page_0122"/>In the third place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has divided the Opposition which he wanted to strengthen against the Government, so that now there are already three groups and little hope remains for their unity. Where is that supposed unity which he strove after now&#x003F; In the fourth place he has advanced the cause of the PRP tremendously. So far nothing has happened to them. In fact, they sit with hearts aflutter from expectation, their eyes fixed on the people who will still join them. [Interjections.] They expect Mr. Basson to come to them and I can tell them that he probably will join them; and he, in his turn, is only waiting for enough followers to support him. That is all.</p>

<p>In the fifth place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has not had success whatsoever in his attempts to jolt or sway the Government and the NP. He has not succeeded in that at all. [Interjections.] The hon. members may feel free to leave the House if they do not feel like listening to me; but they must leave me alone. I say that the Leader of the Opposition has not jolted or swayed us in the slightest. The Government continues to deal with everything unflinchingly and with insight and our leader, the hon. the Prime Minister, displays his international stature as the adviser of world leaders. That is the position of the Government compared with that of the Opposition. Those are the errors of judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who wants to &#x201C;save&#x201D; South Africa. He wants to do that but he cannot even save his party or himself. He and his party look a sorry sight. They have indeed abdicated or capitulated; he did so personally, firstly by abandoning his party in that way and secondly by rendering South Africa a disservice as Leader of the Opposition, because an Opposition ought to be effective. An Opposition ought to know the path it is treading and to keep its destination in view, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is completely lost. And then we have to listen to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition saying, as he said here the other day, that his party has never failed to serve South Africa as an Opposition. I tell you, Sir, that they have failed miserably. And that is the salvation that he offers South Africa.</p>

<p>But, Sir, if South Africa must now be saved, how does one save it and by what means does one save it&#x003F; Let us now consider how and by what means the Leader of the Opposition wants to &#x201C;save&#x201D; South Africa. We have already seen how he failed in his attempts. With who else is he now associating himself&#x003F; First and foremost, he is associating himself with the Progressive Reformist members. They will either act as co-workers or there will be a new party. They are now arguing with one another about whether there should be a new party or an amalgamation or whatever. This association with the Progressive Reform Party now causes many questions to emerge. I ask in the first place: Do they agree on matters of cardinal importance&#x003F; All sorts of issues are referred to in their 14 points, and I shall come back to this shortly. However, we have already read how the United Party makes right-wing statements in connection with these 14 points whilst the PRP makes left-wing statements about them. They cannot even agree on that score. They cannot even reach a consensus on the interpretation of the concept &#x201C;plural society&#x201D;, as is the case with so many other things about which we probably do not yet know. Then there are the so-called principles of the PRP. Does the United Party agree with all those principles&#x003F; The PRP tells us that their principles are beyond reproach. I now come to the question of leadership of this new grouping. Are they going to agree about that&#x003F; Can the Leader of the Opposition tell me whether he is going to accept the hon. member for Sea Point if he is elected leader of this new formation which they want to establish as the Opposition&#x003F; If the hon. member for Bezuidenhout were to be chosen as leader&#x2014;and I know he is itching to be chosen&#x2014;will they accept him&#x003F; Sir, they say nothing; they do not hear me. I know what is going to happen. There is going to be such squabbling among themselves over the leadership as we have never seen in a political grouping before. But, Sir, who are their friends&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member will hear it all, if he will just wait. [Interjections.] I ask again: Who are the friends of these people&#x003F; I read in the newspaper recently that one of the groups with which they are making friends is Inkatha-KwaZulu. We know that Mr. Ray Swart is concluding agreements with them. But that is not all, Sir. A few weeks ago the leader of Inkatha-KwaZulu, Chief Buthelezi, extended an invitation to the PRP, the UP and everyone who wants to follow him, to join and go along with his Inkatha-KwaZulu to form what he calls a &#x201C;shadow government&#x201D; with him. As the newspaper report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Join me in opposition,&#x201D; says Gatsha.</block>

<p>They were to join him in what he had called a &#x201C;shadow multi-racial body which would be a foretaste of things to come&#x201D;. What was the reaction to this&#x003F; The hon. member for Sea Point nearly lost his breath in the rush to be the first to say: &#x201C;Yes, I am prepared to accept such a conglomeration in Inkatha-KwaZulu. &#x201D; I now ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Does he agree&#x003F; I ask the hon. member for Umhlatuzana: Does he agree&#x003F; He is the one who made so many objections in this House a few years ago to the antics of the hon. member for Yeoville concerning the Mahlabatini fracas which had taken place. I want to ask the hon. member for Durban Point if he is going to join the Inkatha movement. The hon. member cannot speak because he has lockjaw. The leader of the Inkatha movement said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White rule will soon be over.</block>

<p>Does the hon. Leader of the Opposition agree with that &#x201C;dictum&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. member for Durban North said a few months ago in Durban that the time has come to use extra-political structures to bring the Government to a fall, and I now want to know if the United Party agrees with that. However, they remain as silent as the grave. [Interjections.] Those hon. members can discuss this later and give us an answer in this regard. We can spend a whole day discussing the 14 principles, but I do not want to go into this any further, because I should like to deal with more positive aspects &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes, I realize that all of them, from the hon. young member for Rondebosch to the oldest hon. member opposite, are only too grateful if I leave the 14 points alone. I should like to have an opportunity to discuss these 14 points later on and I hope that my colleagues on this side of the House will also do so. From first to last those 14 points are vague on fundamental matters and I can mention many examples of this. There are anachronisms on related matters, ambiguities and contradictions on concrete matters, while it remains silent as the grave on many important matters. Consider for example the &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D; which we hear about there, their constitutions, the consultation of population groups, etc. On these matters they remain as silent as a sealed grave. Those 14 points include quite a few idealistic matters, but&#x2014;I should like to dwell on these for a while&#x2014; they also contain some very dangerous elements with regard to very cardinal issues for South Africa. In point No. 4, for example, mention is made of sharing of political rights which South Africa ought to have. It passes smoothly over the manner in which this sharing should take place, whether there are safeguards, whether there are electoral qualifications, whether there is formal representation, and whether there are all kinds of political checks and balances. Nothing whatsoever is said about these very practical matters. That is why I maintain that those 14 principles are dangerous and are becoming more dangerous because they are in the hands of dangerous people. They are unrealistic and extremely unacceptable to South Africa.</p>

<p>If South Africa does need to be saved, the NP has been working on this concept for many years. The greatest rescue operation ever performed in South Africa was performed by the National Party Government when it recognized the Bantu to be a diversity of peoples and did not treat them as one great mass of people, as the hon. Leader of Opposition is advocating by implication. We <span class="col_213-214" refersTo="page_0124"/>recognized each nation, and helped it on its way to its own destination. We did not allow them to be swallowed up by other nations. Thus we help each one of them, each in its own sphere of national life, whether this concerns agriculture, education, their natural resources, their infrastructure, their health, economic development, or whatever it may be. We assisted them, in every aspect of national life, and last but not least] we helped them with their own constitutional development to expand their own Governments and their own administrations, to such an extent that the Transkei has already become an independent country and Bophuthatswana is rapidly on its way to becoming one. This is the rescue operation, not of individuals, but the rescue operation with which the National Party is helping the peoples of South Africa to come into their own. Yes, the hon. member for Johannesburg North is shaking his head about this because these are things for which he does not care a jot; the position of the peoples of South Africa does not matter to him. He has a home to which he can flee if he has to. We also have our future programmes for the other Bantu peoples. Legislation will be introduced during the present session of Parliament to enable other peoples to accept internal independence and autonomy, if that is what they want, even before they accept international independence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this way the National Party and its policy in terms of which it recognizes the separate peoples, in that way respects the desire for self-realization of each of these national groups so that our Bantu people are entities on their own today, people with self-respect, with their own voices and aspirations, their own homelands and their own inalienable spiritual and material assets. With this we comply absolutely with the constitutional emancipation, the constitutional devolution, which is so popular in these modern times that we even find it in Britain, where Scotland and Wales are being allowed to apply devolution so that they can form their own Governments. That is what causes such a creature without context as the hon. member for Johannesburg North to roar with laughter.</p>

<p>This motion of the Leader of the Opposition is an absurdity, especially when gauged in terms of the political situation in which he finds himself. We will take these affairs of the Bantu peoples still further until, as we have said so often, we will before long achieve an association of peoples, White as well as Bantu, which will be associated with one another here as States, countries and even independent nations, on the basis of their interdependence as externally or internally autonomous countries, a great constellation of peoples with each of these peoples in their own orbit. In this, as we have said so often, there will be the most comprehensive consultation and contact with one another without a central legislative authority over all, for that would restrict the right of self-determination of the Bantu and White people. In terms of the same principle of national unity, we shall also keep the ties of the exiles, the diasporas of the various Bantu peoples in the White areas of South Africa, with their own homelands and with their own Governments and with their own people alive. We have already done this to such an extent that already they have drawn members of their Cabinets and Chief Ministers from the White areas, according to their own political set-up, in the process of awareness which is situated around their own homelands and within their own homelands. According to this same principle of national unity which is being realized with regard to the Bantu, we have already succeeded in establishing organizations of their own for Bantu communities in White South Africa and in developing those organizations into stronger unities, notwithstanding the ravings of the hon. member for Edenvale here this afternoon. We shall also, during the present session of Parliament&#x2014;that is what I hope and intend to do&#x2014;introduce legislation to create even further possibilities for the development of these bodies of the Bantu in the White areas to enable them to conduct all their affairs in their communities themselves, within the framework of our policy of course. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Are those members on the other side of the House so childish as to believe that we shall work within the framework of their policy&#x003F; That is sheer childishness! People like that should not be sitting here. As the hon. Prime Minister said yesterday, that is indeed &#x201C;stupid&#x201D;. We shall do it within the cadre of our policy. [Interjections.] Yes, of course. Even if it upsets the now sleeping hon. member for Edenvale, I must say this: It will happen here within White South Africa where the Bantu are secondary to the Whites, as the <span class="col_215-216" refersTo="page_0125"/>Whites are secondary to the Blacks in the homelands. The hon. members will have to accept this. That former reverend from Pinelands will just have to accept it. He must realize that if he wants to argue with us, he cannot expect us to accept his liberal political standpoints. All these things are happening here in South Africa, as I say, in an evolutionary way, because we are not a static party or Government. These innovations are also taking place in regard to obsolete processes or methods. Some people call this discrimination. Perhaps some of the things were in fact discrimination in the past, but what we do, we also do on the basis of principles, because we have to deal with a large heterogeneous mass of people. This dynamic, in other words the elimination of these obsolete, possibly irritating measures, we are realizing with the following principles as basis: That law and order between groups and people be maintained throughout, that friction be eliminated and prevented, that the identity of peoples and groups be respected and preserved, that unnecessary discriminatory or irritating measures based solely on colour be condemned and that it is essential to make specific services available to specified groups of people. Finally, I want to mention the very important principle that there must be no sharing of political power among the various groups of the various peoples within one government. This Government functions according to this principle and this Government has&#x2014;as other members have already mentioned&#x2014;brought about great changes, changes which could always be explained in terms of our ethnic policy. However, that does not count with the members opposite, because the changes which so many people in South Africa advocate, are changes based on integration or changes which reveal Marxist tendencies, and this is not the way in which we see matters. South Africa, however, will throughout and permanently be saved by a National Party in power, and the present period in the dispensation of our Government will increasingly be regarded&#x2014;as I predicted five years ago&#x2014;as the dynamic third decade of the National Party.</p>

<p>Very well. I will then say that he spoke without grace and filled me with disgust. There is something I do not understand about the hon. the Minister. He is the man who is responsible for all the trouble. He is the man who only acted under pressure when it came to problems about the language medium.</p>

<p>When the trouble occurred, he sat trembling in his office in Pretoria and left everything in the hands of the Minister of Justice. He is the man who has to put matters right, but he sits trembling in his office and does not say a word. After everything was over, he said there had been a misunderstanding about the whole matter. What the hon. the Minister does not understand is that when he makes concessions afterwards, when he makes them under pressure, he demonstrates his weakness and his inability to deal with the situation. He should have told us why he did not deal with the leasehold situation and the position of the <span class="col_217-218" refersTo="page_0126"/>businessman earlier. He should have told us all of these things. But no, he acts under pressure and that shows what his weakness is. He is the Minister who had the audacity to get up in this House and say that if the Blacks would give up their citizenship and their birthright, they were likely to get better hospital treatment. Does he remember saying that&#x003F; He said it not once, but twice. Those are the sort of things that hon. Minister says and he is the man who, more than anyone else, is responsible for the unrest that has occurred in South Africa during the last year. If the hon. the Prime Minister wants to do South Africa a service, he will throw that man out of his Cabinet and do it as soon as possible, because that hon. Minister is a danger to race relations in South Africa. Therefore, the sooner he goes, the better it will be.</p>

<p>Why did he not tell us about his discussions with Chief Minister Mangope, whose attitude on the question of land is apparently now resulting in threats of war against South Africa&#x003F; Is that true&#x003F;</p>

<p>Well, Sir, in an article which appeared in <i>The Citizen,</i> a newspaper upon which I make no comment, it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Tswana people felt so strongly about the present grossly unjust distribution of land that unless it was put right by peaceful negotiation with the South African Government, it could lead to a confrontation and even to war in South Africa, Chief Lucas Mangope, Bophuthatswana&#x2019;s Chief Minister, said here yesterday.</block>

<p>This article appeared on 25 January 1977. The Chief Minister was further reported as saying:</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas we are for peaceful negotiation, we are prepared to fight it out verbally, as I told Mr. Vorster, the question of land consolidation could end up in a fight, a military fight.</block>

<p><i>Die Burger</i> apparently also got it wrong.

<p>Let me say why I find this debate so remarkable. We first had a trio of Ministers who put on a song-and-dance act for us. They were followed by this Minister and all had apparently decided to distract attention from the facts. We find ourselves in the situation that there is a motion of no confidence to which, no doubt, there will be moved some amending motion of confidence in the Government, in some form or another, when the hon. the Prime Minister gets up &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall vote; I shall be here to vote for a long, long time. I shall be here to vote long after that hon. Minister has gone. We are going to be asked to vote to give our confidence to this Government. Confidence is given on the basis of past achievement and what you are going to do in the future. So far we have not heard much from the Government benches, but what are their achievements in 1976&#x003F; They led us into Angola and they led us out again, as a result of which they brought our foreign relations into a state of disaster. We have experienced a situation where the economy of the country deteriorated more rapidly during 1976 than it has for decades before that. We had a situation of unrest in South Africa, but hon. members opposite do not explain any of these things. They will get up and ask proudly for confidence in themselves. Is this not the height of cynicism&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_219-220" refersTo="page_0127"/>Then, with respect, I should like to address myself to the hon. the Prime Minister. I took the trouble, together with many other South Africans, to watch the hon. the Prime Minister on New Year&#x2019;s eve and to listen to him. I was full of expectancy as to what I was going to hear, and felt that now we would be told how we would be led out of the morass in which we were. Here would be the leader who would tell us where we were going. What did we see&#x003F; We saw a dour pessimist, a man who in fact came to tell us how bad things were, and that we found ourselves in a position of isolation in this world. That is the message which we got from the hon. the Prime Minister on that night. Isolated we stand. The question that I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister today is: Does he, in addition to wanting to be isolated in the world, want to be isolated in South Africa&#x003F; I speak to him as an Opposition member of Parliament, as a man who is in the Opposition, and who knows how Opposition voters are thinking. In South Africa we who represent Opposition people, represent about 40% of the White population. [Interjections.] If you challenge it we can have an election and we shall see. If hon. members cannot count, that is not my problem. We make our contribution to South Africa.</p>

<p>We pay our share of the taxes. We make our contribution to industry, to finance, to commerce, to farming, you name it. Opposition people make their contribution. Opposition voters and their sons serve in the forces the same as anyone else. We believe that we make as big a contribution to South Africa as anyone else. We do not pretend that we make a bigger contribution, but we take second place to no one. In so far as South Africa is concerned, there are two things I want to point out. The first is that we do not know where we are being led. We are not told where we are going to end up. The second is that we are allowed to play no part in the shaping of our own destiny. The truth is that we find ourselves in a situation in South Africa where today thousands and thousands of opposition voters are asking where in fact South Africa is going. Is it going to be a war that is going to last for ever&#x003F; Are our soldiers in fact expected, indefinitely, for the rest of their adult lives, to fight&#x003F; What is the end of the road&#x003F; The hon. the Prime Minister, neither in his New Year broadcast nor on any occasion, has been able to set out for us where South Africa will be in five years&#x2019; time and thereafter. We are entitled to know. The South African Opposition voters, and I think very many people who support the Government, have been waiting with expectancy for the opening of this Parliament and this debate so that they can be told where South Africa is going. So far not one of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s members of the Cabinet has given the slightest indication as to where in fact we are going. That is what we expect, and we hope that when the hon. the Prime Minister speaks on Friday he will give us an indication as to where in fact we are going.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister need not worry about where I will go. I will be around here to watch him, Sir.</p>

<p>We talk about change in South Africa. The issue in South Africa is no longer whether there will be change or not; that is an accepted fact. The issue with which we are faced is whether the hon. the Prime Minister will give the lead in South Africa to make sure that there will be peaceful change and that there will not be violent change. The issue is solely one of whether the change will be peaceful or whether it will be violent. The hon. the Prime Minister has the key to that. That is what South Africa is waiting to hear. We Opposition voters, who see ourselves as people who have a stake in South Africa, who are here and want to remain here as a part of South Africa, find ourselves in a position as if we were in an omnibus. We are obliged to pay for the ticket. We are obliged to get into the bus. We are obliged to take those who are dear to us in with us. We are obliged to have our belongings in that bus. The hon. the Prime Minister is the driver of that bus and he takes no notice of where anybody is telling him to go. He is heading down the hill for a crash, and we have to be in that bus; we have to go with him down that hill. [Interjections.] That, Sir, is the tragedy of South Africa. That is why we find ourselves, as Opposition <span class="col_221-222" refersTo="page_0128"/>voters, as people in the Opposition, with a high degree of frustration. The hon. the Prime Minister speaks of self-determination. With respect, Opposition voters are not even allowed to decide for themselves with whom they want to go to school, not even when it affects no one else. Surely, we are entitled to have some say in respect of the determination of our own affairs, when it affects no one else. However, we are to have no say in South Africa. We are to play no part.</p>

<p>In other countries &#x2026; [Interjections.] We do not have to join the NP. We are entitled to our political beliefs. We are entitled to differ, Sir. However, in other countries, for example the USA, Germany, Israel and elsewhere, the structures of government and the committee systems which they have, enable everyone to participate in the machinery of government. Here in South Africa we are allowed no say. The hon. the Prime Minister speaks mockingly of the plight of the UP.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole problem of the Opposition voter is his frustration. He knows that, in fact, the Government is doing wrong, but he can do nothing about it. [Interjections.] He can do nothing about it. [Interjections.] Hon. members can laugh at this. They can mock it, but it is reality. The test for the hon. the Prime Minister is not only whether he wants to be isolated internationally; it is whether he wants to be isolated in South Africa. Does he want to maintain the unity of his NP in South Africa, to maintain Afrikaner unity at all costs, and to do it at the expense of the survival of White South Africa&#x003F; That is what is in effect taking place. The hon. the Prime Minister knows&#x2014;he knows it, as well as anybody else sitting in this hon. House&#x2014; that he cannot bring about the changes which he would perhaps like to bring about, because he is afraid. He is looking over his shoulder. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister knows it, Mr. Speaker. [Interjections.] However, he puts the unity of Afrikaner nationalism above the survival of Whites in South Africa. If he goes down in history as having sacrificed the Whites in South Africa because of that, he will certainly not go down in history as the great Prime Minister he would like to be in these circumstances.</p>

<p>When we talk about isolation, it is not exclusive merely to Whites in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister knows better than anyone else in this House what the problems of Rhodesia are. Today, five minutes before midnight, Mr. Ian Smith is looking for new Black political parties, for moderate Blacks, to help him. Why do we not profit from other people&#x2019;s experiences&#x003F; Today there are still moderate people among the Black, the Coloured and the Indian communities, who will co-operate in South Africa, but will they be there tomorrow&#x003F; Will they always be there&#x003F; Will they always be available&#x003F; Is the hon. the Prime Minister not making the same mistake which Mr. Smith has been making in holding on while he can and then at the 11th hour seeking to find the friends he needs&#x003F; Isolation in South Africa is disastrous for all of us. It will be a disaster if we become isolated in the world. It will be a disaster if the hon. the Prime Minister becomes isolated from the White community as an entity. It will be a disaster if he allows himself to become isolated from the Black community as such. I therefore appeal to him not to leave it until it is too late. We know that the things which we ask him to do today will have to be done tomorrow. We know it and we are sure that he knows it as well. The difference is that we believe he should act when he is not under pressure, but as has been demonstrated by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the NP waits until it is under pressure and then the effect of what it does is utterly and entirely lost.</p>

<p>The message which the hon. the Prime Minister delivered on New Year&#x2019;s eve was also a message which related to the economy and the question of confidence. He pointed to the fact that the economy was virtually&#x2014;if one were to paraphrase what he said&#x2014;on a war footing. He said that there was fear of external aggression and internal disorder, that we would have to have a larger army and that a period of no economic growth awaited us when in fact we need growth more than ever. He also predicted a drop in living standards, high inflation and eroded savings, a reduction in overseas investment and higher unemployment. It is a new kind of South Africa to which the hon. the Prime Minister showed <span class="col_223-224" refersTo="page_0129"/>the way on New Year&#x2019;s eve. In this debate the only comment so far on the economy has come from the hon. the Minister of Justice, who said that the economy was not affected by the disorders that have taken place. Even the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs must smile at that statement, because it is really so ludicrous. We all know and the hon. the Minister of Finance himself has said how the erosion of overseas confidence has affected our ability to get funds overseas.</p>

<p>The position in South Africa is far more serious than merely the lack of adequate long-term finance. The truth is that the political problems of South Africa cannot be solved without an economic solution and our economy cannot be put right without a political solution. That is the truth of the matter. If we look at the economic scene, we find inflation at a rate which erodes our savings. We find no <i>per capita</i> growth in the economy at all. We find, in fact, that the living standard of the average Mr. South Africa has dropped by over 10% in a period just in excess of two years. In other words, every South African is on average 10% worse off than he was just over two years ago. One can refer to the balance of payments problem. One can refer to the unemployment which has come upon us, to social unrest, bankruptcy, Government debt increasing at over R6 million per day and foreign debt getting shorter and shorter while the repayment terms are also getting shorter and shorter for us. It is an interesting statistic that while over a year ago local debt had an average length of two years and six months to redemption and overseas debt an average length of five years, today we are borrowing mostly at 12 months with the occasional loan which we manage to get at three years and perhaps sometimes even a little longer. Prices of food and other household requirements go up and up and we now have in South Africa the really remarkable economic phenomenon that for butter and cheese, of which there is a surplus, the price goes up. Yet no one thinks of the solution of putting dairy products, so rich in protein, within the reach of the under-privileged. The tragedy is that now is the time that South Africa in fact needs to be economically strong. The threats of external aggression and internal disorder will cause greater commitments to service on our borders and greater commitments to service inside. A drop in the living standard of the White community will cause wage pressures which will accentuate inflation when we can least afford it. Quite obviously, rising Black expectations must necessitate greater expenditure on social services, including education.</p>

<p>What is needed, therefore, is a completely new look at South Africa&#x2019;s priorities. Firstly, I believe we have to take a look at our capital programme. Not only need it be more flexible with regard to economic fluctuations, but priorities must be re-examined. We cannot continue with capital programmes which are above our means. I want to put this question to the hon. the Minister of Finance: What comes first in the priorities in his mind&#x2014;new opera-houses, new buildings for the SABC, new buildings for provincial administrations and local authorities and for statutory bodies who have to have office palaces, or do we need street lights in the Black townships, money to build houses and to remove squatter camps, roads in Black suburbs, a hospital in Lenasia and technical training facilities for Black youth&#x003F; Which is the urgent one&#x003F; If we are to survive, luxuries and ideological projects must be abandoned&#x2014;not sacrificed, for that is the wrong word&#x2014;in order that the backlog for the underprivileged may be made up. Higher spending power for lower income groups needs to be generated and as we know, more production will bring more prosperity for the whole country, so that if the lower income groups earn more, it means prosperity for all.</p>

<p>Secondly, there must be action in respect of unemployment. Under-utilization of capacity means not only that people are out of work; it also means higher unit costs and so more inflation. We are running short of capital in South Africa and yet we have a labour surplus. We must stimulate labour intensive activities and industries which bring about import substitution.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have to deal with our balance of payment problems. Industries need to be stimulated which are export orientated. We should give incentives to industries which are near our ports in the same way as we have given incentives to decentralized industries. Export rebates, the same as have been given in respect of steel, should be given in other fields and there should be further encouragement for the beneficiation of raw materials. Inefficiency, which shelters under colour <span class="col_225-226" refersTo="page_0130"/>protection, has to be eliminated. Fifthly I believe, that one of the industries which should be stimulated is low-cost housing, because not only is it labour intensive, but it helps to fight unemployment and so solves social needs. Sixthly, there must be greater encouragement to the public to save, and the public &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting myself, an authoritative source, I assure you. The public must be protected in their savings against the ravages of inflation. Savings will not increase until this is done or until real disposable income increases and the fear of inflation is reduced. Seventhly, public expenditure must be rigidly controlled and current expenditure must not be allowed to rise at a greater rate than that of the GDP. Eighthly, basic food requirements must be kept within the reach of all, and ninthly, where defence expenditure must increase, other non-productive State expenditure must be cut back.</p>

<p>Confidence must be restored by ensuring stability and by making political changes which indicate that in the long term our problems can be solved. New investment has to be encouraged and we need to look again at the issue of only allowing a 15% return.</p>

<p>There are many things that can be done to put our economy right, but I stress that if we do not put our economy right, political solutions alone will not be the answer. The two go together, and we must work together to achieve them in order to put South Africa right.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for Yeoville ought to be the last man in this House to adopt such a superior attitude as he did in the first part of his speech, when he reacted to the speech made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. member for Yeoville will never in his life even qualify to stand in the political shadow of Minister Botha, a man who has given 25 years of excellent service to South Africa and this House, a man who has given 16 years of excellent service to the Ministry of Bantu Administration. The hon. member will not even be able to stand in his shadow. Mr. Speaker, then the hon. member has the temerity to say that the hon. the Minister sat trembling in his office in Pretoria. The hon. member read here from a report in which Chief Minister Magope spoke of possible war confrontations on consolidation, and he just about trembled out of his pants in this House.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think I am speaking on behalf of everyone on this side of the House in saying that the tirade delivered against the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development this afternoon by the hon. member for Yeoville was not worthy of him or of his party. We on this side of the House are grateful and proud of the fact that the Afrikaner people has produced a man such as Minister M. C. Botha to render this service to the country. I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Before doing so, I want to say to the hon. member for Newton Park that his conduct yesterday, as the leader of the new group, was well-judged. He made a good impression. We listened to him, and the appeal he made to the hon. the Prime Minister and to other hon. members on this side of the House will certainly not go unheeded. However, I want to assure the hon. member and the majority of other hon. members who have remained in the UP that we are not rejoicing at what has happened in the UP. I personally regard it as a major political tragedy which is being enacted in South Africa. We derive no satisfaction from the situation in which the hon. member and some other hon. members of the UP still find themselves today. The motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition states that this House has no confidence in the Government because, it is alleged, in a time of crisis in South Africa, a situation in which a new political dispensation is required, it has failed to adopt policies capable of creating a permanently peaceful society which can give a new deal and new <span class="col_227-228" refersTo="page_0131"/>hope to all our peoples. That is the essence of the motion.</p>

<p>In considering the first part of this motion, one must bear in mind that South Africa has a plural community, a community consisting of eight different Black peoples, a Coloured population group, an Indian population group comprising approximately 700 000 people&#x2014;it is the biggest group of Indians outside India&#x2014;and two White population groups. There is no plural community in the world in which a majority governs without dominating the minorities. There is no plural community in the world in which a minority group governs without the use of armed force. Neither of these two alternatives is acceptable to the NP in South Africa, especially when we consider the numbers of the Black people in South Africa. For this reason, we on this side of the House consider the basis for a permanent and peaceful community in South Africa to be the policy of separate development. To us, this is the basic reason. The Black population groups in South Africa still occupy the territory which belonged to them historically, and we are adding another 714 million morgen, which we are buying for them with our money. The fact is that our Black population groups are flourishing and rapidly developing after 200 years in South Africa. This is more than what some other countries in the Western world could say of their indigenous populations. Some of them cannot even show us an indigenous population any more. In spite of this, they have the temerity to meddle in our affairs and to work for a Black majority government in South Africa.</p>

<p>The political development of the homelands is an acknowledged and accomplished fact, and this is the recipe for a permanent and peaceful community in South Africa. The Government&#x2019;s standpoint in connection with the political development of the Coloured people and the Indians is clear. The CRC and the Indian Representative Council are recognized concepts and institutions in terms of constitutional law and each one must be developed to its full potential by these two population groups themselves.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Any enthusiastic student in constitutional law would be able to figure that out for the hon. member. I do not think it is incumbent upon me to waste my time by giving the hon. member a lecture on this subject. What must be realized in connection with these two councils is this: No one walks before he has crawled. But some people in South Africa want to run even before they have crawled or walked. This is creating unnecessary frustration for them. The White people in South Africa followed the long political road and with very good result. However, the Government does not content itself with the present dispensation as the final answer. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, and I believe that this answers the hon. member&#x2019;s question in part, the Government has already nominated a Cabinet Committee which is considering the possible future remodelling of the present system with regard to the Coloured Persons Representative Council, the Indian Representative Council and the political dispensation for the Whites in South Africa. Responsible Coloured and Indian leaders accept the good faith underlying the actions of the Government. Considering these basic principles, the Government has succeeded in creating a permanent, peaceful community in South Africa. However, one must expect that there will be leftists, radical elements in South Africa which would like to disrupt this peaceful community. This is exactly what they have tried to do over the past few months, but the fact remains that the Government&#x2019;s policies, which are criticized by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, are succeeding. A further proof of this is the independence of the Transkei, the approaching independence of Bophuthatswana and the fact that the vast majority of the non-Whites had no part in the riots and that some of them even rose in revolt against the lawless elements. Approximately 490 000 foreign Bantu are legally present in South Africa every day and approximately 40 000 are in South Africa illegally every day. Do these people come here for no good reason, to a community which is not peaceful&#x003F; Surely they come here, Mr. Speaker, precisely because they can make a living in a peaceful community in Africa.</p>

<p>The second accusation made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, is that the Government has failed to give a new deal and <span class="col_229-230" refersTo="page_0132"/>new hope to all our peoples. No new deal is required, because for 29 years, in seven general elections, the Whites have been saying in greater and greater numbers that they are satisfied with the present dispensation. Why should the Government now consider a new deal if the White electorate has already given its opinion on the matter and continues to give its opinion&#x003F; The second point I want to mention is that the majority of the responsible non-White leaders have accepted the basis of the policy of separate development. Thirdly, the majority of non-Whites are satisfied that the present dispensation holds the greatest number of advantages for them. If anyone denies this, and I see that the hon. member for Griqualand East is shaking his head, the hon. member must tell this House where the millionaires in Soweto come from if this dispensation does not hold the greatest number of advantages for them. Where does the advantage come from when we consider that in 1955, approximately 8% of the Black population was at school, while the figure stands at approximately 21% today&#x003F; Are these not advantages&#x003F; The standards in the educational sphere are not inferior to those of the Whites. In fact, and there is more than enough proof of this, the university education at our Black universities is comparable with the best provided at our White universities. Go to Turfloop and see what the situation is as far as Turfloop students are concerned. These students are snapped up by the private and public sector in this country. Why&#x003F; Because the people obtain such good qualifications at this university. Those students, in respect of whom we so often have to listen to criticism, go overseas and obtain fine post-graduate qualifications. If a new deal is required, and if all is not well under the present circumstances, how do hon. members opposite explain the fact that 20 years ago, there were approximately 500 registered Black nurses in South Africa, while today, under a dispensation which they criticize, there are approximately 25 000 registered, qualified Black nurses in South Africa&#x003F; Therefore, we have no problem in replying to a motion which basically consists of these two points.</p>

<p>However, discussing a motion such as this one involves more than that. Discussing a motion such as this one means analysing the Opposition standpoints as well. These are equally relevant. What do we have here today&#x003F; We have a UP which has capitulated. The burden has become too heavy for them. They accept Mr. Justice Marais&#x2019; 14 points and in so doing they accept Black majority government in South Africa. As early as last year, during a discussion of the previous policy of the UP, the hon. member for Von Brandis indicated that that policy of the United Party would have led to Black majority government in any event. Last year the UP tried to deny this, but now it is an accomplished fact, and I do not think the hon. member for Hillbrow, who may speak after me, can deny this. Only the year before last, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The PRP could never become an effective opposition because its policy of Black majority rule would never be acceptable to the White voters.</block>

<p>Today he says that the Opposition in South Africa will achieve real unity even during this session, not a loose coalition of irreconcilable elements, but behind and around clear objectives. He also says that one of those objectives is the creation of a new Republic in which all population groups of South Africa will be able to close their ranks. He was speaking officially on behalf of the UP. Will the hon. member for Hillbrow be so kind as to tell us what his Transvaal leader meant by saying &#x201C;they will be able to close their ranks&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then he goes on to say that when this happens, they will demand a constitutional conference such as the one in South West Africa, in which the new opposition will act as an alternative Government and in which the various peoples of a multi-national South Africa will be brought together to draw up a new federal and confederal constitution for South Africa, moving away from the present Westminster system. This is very interesting. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout speaks of a &#x201C;multi-national South Africa&#x201D; and not of a &#x201C;multi-racial South Africa&#x201D;, while the PRP speaks of a &#x201C;multi-racial South Africa&#x201D;. The PRP is now speaking openly of &#x201C;Black <span class="col_231-232" refersTo="page_0133"/>majority government&#x201D;. The hon. member for Houghton is sitting there getting a kick out of it, for she is the one who brought this about. However, only last year they were still denying it. Last year Senator Bamford said during the Durban North by-election: &#x201C;The Progressive Party stands for a Black majority government.&#x201D; However, the hon. member for Yeoville categorically denied that during a debate in this House last year. The hon. member for Durban North, who is sitting over there at the back, fought an election in Durban North and was politically honest enough to say the following in an electoral letter, dated 27 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As u meegedeel is dat die PRP ten gunste van kommunisme en &#x2019;n Swart meerderheidsbewind is, wil ek eenvoudig verklaar dat ek en die PRP geheel en al gekant is teen ALBEI.</block>

<p>That letter was signed by himself. What does the hon. member say now&#x003F; What does the hon. member for Durban North say now&#x003F; Does the hon. member for Durban North still say he is against a Black majority government&#x003F; The hon. member for Parktown said in July last year&#x2014;I quote from <i>Die Vaderland</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die PRP is nie begaan oor die Regering wat aan bewind is nie. Ons staan ook nie vir Swart meerderheidsregering nie. Onder &#x2019;n PRP-bewind sal die Regering nie noodwendig Wit of Swart wees nie: Dit sal bestaan uit Suid-Afrikaners wat die politieke mag deel.</block>

<p>Now the PRP says openly, by the mouth of the hon. member for Houghton, that they advocate a Black majority government.</p>

<p>These various groups are now pleading for a national convention or a constitutional conference. This is nothing new. They have been asking for this for two or three years.

<p>The PRP and the UP are playing right into the hands of Buthelezi. He is the foremost advocate of Black majority government, and in one revolutionary, inflammatory speech after another he propagates these stories, and the Prog leaders and Prog representatives run after him like a lot of terriers and confirm every word he says. I think it should be put on record here what he has said on occasion in connection with the subject. He is the man whom hon. members on the other side accept as the leader at this conference table of the future. In November last year, this man said in Johannesburg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The moment of truth has arrived for the White man. He either accepts the Black man or rejects him completely. There is no middle course. Fooling around with such things as separate identities is criminal folly and will do the country great harm. Apartheid or majority rule: The choice is as simple as that.</block>

<p>He makes no secret in his speeches of the fact that he propagates a Black majority government as the only final solution in South Africa. He makes no secret of the fact that it will be brought about by revolutionary methods, unless the White man is prepared to capitulate. We are not prepared to do that. What did he say in Soweto in March 1976&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I issued a friendly warning to the Prime Minister that if we as Blacks did not reach fulfilment through his policies, we would have unrest and civil disobedience &#x2026; South Africa has a place in Southern Africa &#x2026; History demands, however, that South Africa&#x2019;s rightful place should be determined by the majority of the people &#x2026; The Whites can only do one thing to help themselves: They must be prepared to share power. We want to be free to participate in majority decisions &#x2026; In the word of the late Robert Kennedy, a revolution is coming. We can affect its character. We cannot alter its inevitability.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to place on record this important point made by this gentleman in a speech before the International Affairs Group in Nigeria. In November last year he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will be made manageable only by majority rule. The power of the people must come and it will come. Chief Buthelezi said he did not believe the structures of apartheid and separate development would ever crumble if the threat of resorting to arms and explosives was not a real threat.</block>

<p>This is what is said in Nigeria, Mr. Speaker. This is the leader with whom the hon. gentlemen on the other side want to sit down around the conference table to determine our future. He makes no secret of the fact that the <span class="col_235-236" refersTo="page_0135"/>ANC and PAC are his real friends in his so-called struggle for liberation. On 8 November he was in Washington again, and there he addressed the Black Washington Technical Institute Confrontation. There he pleaded with the Blacks of the USA for their help in the so-called liberation struggle of the Blacks in South Africa, and he asked them to bring pressure to bear on the USA Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">to assist those in the liberation struggle, both within and without South Africa. We need to be politically creative in order to establish effective partnership links between yourselves and ourselves in collaboration with our brothers in exile. I told Dr. Kissinger that the publicity given to the internal problems of South African groups in exile will not detract from that ultimate appeal to the Black South Africans. These are Black organizations and they are part of the liberation front. We at home are part and parcel of that liberation front. We in the struggle for liberation inside the country would be embarrassed by aid from quarters which are hostile to the exile movements of the people of South Africa. We should assume that aid to us inside South Africa should never be a source of embarrassment to our brothers abroad &#x2026; I say this for two reasons. Firstly, because withholding support from the movements prolongs the struggle. While the struggle lasts, the apartheid machine of violence continues its nefarious work.</block>

<p>Then he made this statement quite clearly and said the following in <i>To the Point.</i> It was said during a conversation he was alleged to have had with Dr. Kissinger and is identified as being his own words. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;It is important for you to understand,&#x201D; he told Dr. Kissinger, &#x201C;that unless you convince the banned ANC and PAC and ourselves as Black South Africans of your good intentions in Southern Africa, you will have no success in reaching an understanding with the vast majority of Black South Africans.&#x201D; Buthelezi hinted too that he had links with these organizations and he said this: &#x201C;Word has come to us from our organizations in exile &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>Is this still your friend&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the United States has not accorded them the recognition their legitimacy in South Africa demands.</block>

<p>Hon. members on the other side can reply to these things and they must tell this House how far some of them are prepared to go along this road. This is the political division which is taking shape at the moment, and it is an extremely dangerous political division which is developing in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is absorbing a part of the UP, together with the Progs, into this united Opposition in South Africa, an Opposition in which the radical leftist leaders of the Coloured population occupy a prominent position of leadership. This is making the real choice for the White people in South Africa very clear. This is what is going on at the moment, in this House as well. Is this what responsible UP members want&#x003F; I doubt it. I know of many hon. members on that side of the House who do not want this. They are not people who want to have any part of terrorism. They do not want to have any part of Black majority government, nor of the use of violence. Why are hon. members allowing themselves to be led by the nose into that situation&#x003F; It is for them to reply to this question.</p>

<p>What is our reply&#x003F; Our reply is that the National Party represents conservative thinking in South Africa. The conservative White people&#x2014;English as well as Afrikaans-speaking&#x2014;are the ones who will govern South Africa in the future, just as they have done in the past. The choice for a responsible voter is clear. We are not prepared to be dictated to in our own country and to sacrifice our constitutional identity. To everyone who is prepared to listen, we say quite frankly that the possibility of a majority government in our part of South Africa will not even be considered by us. Moreover, we are prepared to fight for the retention of our constitutional identity. I believe it is necessary for some people in South Africa to realize this.</p>

<p>This Government is implementing its policy in a responsible manner and it accepts the results of its policy. It does not run away from them. In our own country this Government will occupy a position of strength, and it <span class="col_237-238" refersTo="page_0136"/>will maintain law and order. The Government will see to it that we will not lose our constitutional identity, but in the process it will also ensure that a constitutional system is established in terms of which everyone in White South Africa will be given his rightful place.</p>

<p>However, we shall determine our own pace. That pace will be a responsible and well-considered one. The NP has both feet on the ground, and for that reason it will continue to govern in South Africa indefinitely.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to say at once that I found it a welcome change to be able to listen to the restrained contribution of the hon. the Deputy Minister. All thinking South Africans realize that our moment of decision has arrived. Our people outside know intuitively that we are on the eve of clashes, of conflict and trials of strength. In view of these circumstances, what a spectacle we have been witnessing here during the past two days! One senior Cabinet Minister after the other indulged in cheap politicizing here. But I must exempt the hon. the Minister of the Interior. He and his hon. Deputy Minister were the only two who tried to talk on the basis of the motion now before this House and who tried to state a point of view. Apparently the other hon. members on the other side are only interested in showing us how strong the Government is. I have never in my life seen a Government that is so strong yet still feels so insecure that it constantly wants to become stronger and stronger. However, the stronger the Government becomes, the deeper the quagmire into which they are plunging this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister started off quite well. But I must point out that, to my way of thinking, he committed two fatal blunders. He kept telling us about the success the Government is achieving with its policy and how more and more people were voting for the National Party. We have already told him that this does not mean a thing. This does not prove that the Government is right. All the Germans voted for Adolf Hitler, but today one cannot find a German anywhere who was ever a supporter of Hitler. What the Government is doing is to win all the battles. That is true; but it is losing the war&#x2014;the war for the survival of South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister went on to say that the non-Whites and the Black leaders support Government policy. Then he devoted a good two-thirds of the time at his disposal to criticizing Chief Gatsha Buthelezi. If he is such an ardent supporter of Government policy, why is it necessary to criticize him in this manner&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, the Black leaders accept it, but what is their motivation&#x003F; They say they accept the Government&#x2019;s programme, because at present that is the only way in which they can achieve something for their people, and they are going to use the present eystem of apartheid to break down apartheid. That is their motivation. The kind of argument we have had from hon. Ministers up to now has been common or garden politicking. They referred to the Marais principles and said that these were too vague. I happen to be looking at the Government&#x2019;s policy now, particularly its sports policy, something which is dear to me. I am reading the English version for it is stated better there than in the Afrikaans version. It is pointed out that the Government established a Department of Sport and then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thanks to the magnificent work done by this department, the Government can continue with its policy of affording sportsmen from all population groups the opportunity of reaching their highest competitive level, even in the international sphere, within their own national context. In this way the opportunities which did not exist previously are being created without interfering with their traditional system of administering and participating in sport on a separate basis.</block>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Now I am asking how they correlate this with what is happening at the moment&#x003F; If they want to ask questions like little Crown prosecutors, as the hon. the Prime Minister did, I ask them: Whose interpretation of the sports policy do they accept&#x003F; The interpretation of the hon. Mr. Koornhof, or that of the hon. Mr. Andries Treurnicht&#x003F; [Interjections.] Surely everyone can play at this little game, but the <span class="col_239-240" refersTo="page_0137"/>situation in South Africa is too serious for that.</p>

<p>As we see it, we are on the eve of a crisis of survival. I want to say at once that there are only a few tiny rays of light for us. The first is that there are at least hon. members on the Government side who are starting to say what must be said. Recently there were quite a number of them who were not prepared to associate themselves with the verkramptheid of Mr. Treurnicht, and they were prepared to state this in public. We are delighted to see that there are now senior newspapermen who no longer see themselves as mere propagandists for the Government, as one of them put it. They no longer follow slavishly, but are themselves starting to say what has to be said. We are also delighted to see that there are businessmen, Afrikaans-speaking businessmen, who are also starting to say what has to be said. Then we again witnessed the spectacle of the hon. the Prime Minister climbing into them and reading them the Riot Act. He forgot about his image as the African statesman. Then he read them a lecture as Big Daddy Idid Dada would have done to his people. [Interjections.] Give me a chance.</p>

<p>The hon. members still have lots of time.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member whether he has read the speech to which he is referring or the newspaper report on it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I know what he said, and he only showed how vulnerable he is. What did the businessmen say&#x003F; They said he must make changes, he must do away with apartheid and this is why he went for them. The Government cannot make these changes. A little window-dressing, a few peripheral changes, yes, but they cannot change the basic structure, because we have a tangle of acts, ordinances and regulations that have been intertwined over the years. Let me give an example to illustrate this. These days everyone is saying that the Immorality Act should be abolished. It was a big blunder and it should never have been placed on the Statute Book. That is what the Erika Theron report says. However, if the Government wants to do away with the Immorality Act, surely it must immediately repeal the Mixed Marriages Act as well, for how can people be allowed to be together in the same bed, but not be allowed to marry&#x003F; However, if they repeal the Mixed Marriages Act, they must at the same time repeal the Group Areas Act, for how can people marry, but not live together&#x003F; If the Government has repealed the Group Areas Act, they must of course grant full civil rights to everyone, for you cannot give such rights to one group on one side of the street and not to the people on the other side of the street. No changes are going to take place, except, as I have said, only a minor change here and there. It is precisely because of its perseverance with this policy that the Government has brought us to a position which is at variance with the rest of the world. This is what hon. members of the Government side do not understand and this is the essence of the motion of my hon. Leader. The old order is past and the present political structure has becone an anachronism. The blueprints which did exist, have gone up in the flames of Soweto. What is at stake is the survival of South Africa and we must now concentrate on certain limited objectives. We must enlist the full national potential and all the national energy in the struggle to ensure South Africa&#x2019;s survival. If we do not do this, we can prepare ourselves to start making the funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>[Inaudible.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Now I come to the hon. Minister who has such a lot to say. I should like to talk to him. The first thing we require is to ensure our survival is a strong economy. The road ahead will be long and steep and dangerous and we will not reach the summit unless we travel on the back of a strong economy.</p>

<p>I should like to state certain requirements for having a strong economy, and then ask hon. members to indicate to me to what extent the Government has managed to fulfil those requirements. In the first place, one must have foreign confidence. Today we all know that there is no foreign confidence. South Africa needs risk capital, but the capital is leaving the country; it is not entering the country. The so-called &#x201C;securities rand&#x201D; is at a premium of 40% overseas. This shows the lack of confidence <span class="col_241-242" refersTo="page_0138"/>in South Africa overseas. Jan Marais was in Germany recently. He says a country like Mexico can borrow money in Germany at 9%, while South Africa, if she wishes to borrow money, must pay 14%. What is the position with regard to governments and business concerns in the outside world&#x003F; We only have to read what is going to happen under the Carter administration. Initially the outside world adopted a neutral attitude towards us. Then they became indifferent and now they are becoming more and more aggressive and antagonistic.</p>

<p>The second important requirement is internal confidence. There is no confidence internally. At the moment the amount of private investment will not even assure us of a growth rate of 1%. It is not only that we are not growing; we are regressing. A sensitive barometer is the building industry. This year the building industry did not expand; in fact, it laid off more than 50 000 people.</p>

<p>A third requirement is the maximum utilization of our economic resources. I am referring in particular to capital and manpower. Surely there is no maximum utilization of our capital, because there is already a shortage of capital, and the Government takes by far a too big share of it for itself. Last year we established that the value of development projects amounted to R28 000 million. When one does this, surely there is not enough left for the private sector, and when a government does what this hon. Minister did the other day, viz. to tax the petrol consumer and to impose duties on petrol in order to pay for capital works which will be enjoyed by future generations, it is the worst economic short-sightedness one could possibly imagine.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the optimum utilization of manpower. Instead of the Government helping us in this regard, they are doing the opposite. Here I can refer to the dozens of regulations and acts with regard to physical planning and job reservation, which are specifically aimed at restricting the optimum utilization of manpower. Once again the Government is the big competitor. At the moment the Government, with its wide ramifications, is employing almost one million people. The annual pay-out to all the people employed by the Government and all its ramifications every year, already amounts to R10 000 million. Surely what remains cannot be sufficient for private enterprise. As far as that is concerned, therefore the answer is also a negative one.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, there can be no progress unless there is a minimum of interference by the Government in the economic process, and here in South Africa there is more interference than in any other free enterprise country. Once again the Government competes with its form of State capitalism and its public utility companies. We all know that that form of economic process is the most uneconomical.</p>

<p>Sir, there is a fifth factor which I wish to mention, and that is that the management at Government level is so poor. They have a number of people with academic qualifications, but they have no one with any business experience. It has become so bad that Afrikaner businessman recently went to the Prime Minister and asked him please to include one of the leading Afrikaans businessmen in the Cabinet. The rationale was that they would at least like to have someone in the Government who knows something about business. If we want a good example of poor management at government level, I should like to refer to the recent butter fiasco. The world has been in existence for 5 000 million years, and we had to wait 5 000 million years before that Cabinet invented a new economic law. Their law states that if one has a surplus of a certain commodity, one copes with it by increasing the price! Now I should very much like to know what has become of the principle of joint Cabinet responsibility. What did the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs do in the Cabinet when his colleague proposed this absurdity&#x003F; Surely he is also responsible for this. The problem with this Government is that they never want to take a look at themselves to find out where the problems are, they always want to rationalize. The fault is always something that has blown over from abroad. We do not create inflation here; it is blown over from abroad. So, as an example I have chosen the island of Hong Kong and I have done this precisely because Hong Kong has no economic assets or raw products of its own. Hong Kong is situated on the route between the east and the west and if something can be blown, it is blown there. What was the position in Hong Kong last year&#x003F; Their growth rate was 16% while the growth in South Africa was 2%. The inflation rate in <span class="col_243-244" refersTo="page_0139"/>Hong Kong was 2%, while it was 12% in this country. One can borrow money at any bank in Hong Kong at 7% interest. The maximum taxation per person there is 15% and the maximum taxation of a company is 17%. I would suggest that the Government strongly considers sending the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to Hong Kong so that they may go there and learn something.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, to summarize: Nearly all the economic indicators in South Africa are negative at the moment. South Africa&#x2019;s currency, the rand, ought to be the strongest in the world, yet it is one of the most vulnerable. As a matter of fact, I am surprised that the hon. the Minister of Finance has not devalued our rand once more. The House will remember how eulogistic he became last time. He gave us so many advantages of devaluation that we thought he was going to do it every second month. Perhaps the hon. the Minister has also learned a lesson.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the unemployment situation in South Africa. To ensure full employment in South Africa we have to create 1 500 new jobs every day, and I want to know what the hon, the Minister of Economic Affairs is doing about it. When we want to know the unemployment figures, they can never give them, because they have not got them. My information is that to get a reliable estimate of the employment situation as far as the Black people are concerned, would cost the country R25 000 a year. I want to challenge the Government that if it is only this amount, they are either bankrupt if they cannot afford it in order to give us one of the most vital statistics that we require, or else they are deliberately withholding this vital information from the people of South Africa. However, I think the answer to this whole question was given to us recently by Mr. Len Abrahams, who is not a man that snatches figures out of the air. He said that South Africa&#x2019;s national product could have been more than double its present figure, it could have been R63 000 million instead of R27 000 million, on one condition, viz. that we eliminated apartheid. The Government might query this and say that it is not so. But again we challenge the Government, because this is so vital to South Africa, to appoint a commission of inquiry. After all, the Government appoints commission at the drop of a please Appoint a commission of inquiry, therefore, to determine for South Africa the cost of this farce that we call &#x201C;apartheid.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The second thing that we in South Africa require to ensure our survival, is peace and stability on the home base. Think of the metamorphosis, of the change that has come about. I can remember the hon. the Prime Minister standing up there and saying that South Africa is an example of peace and tranquillity to the whole world. He even invited everybody to come to South Africa to come and view the situation here. According to him all this peace was apparently brought about by this new invention, this magnificant piece of inspiration called &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, which came from the NP. Who would he invite today to come and look at South Africa, at the peaceful situation that we have here&#x003F;</p>

<p>We saw the tragedy of the situation when the hon. the Minister of Police went into action yesterday with his bombs and his guns.</p>

<p>What we have seen so far, Mr. Speaker, is only the tip of the iceberg. When young Africans in their dozens come up to the police, stand there and say: &#x201C;Shoot us if you want to,&#x201D; you are not just dealing with terrorists who have infiltrated from the outside; you are dealing with a situation of fundamental importance. The Government&#x2019;s reaction has been a characteristic one. They have appointed a commission of inquiry. No sooner had they appointed a commission to find out what had caused the riots, when one after another, Ministers stood up to tell the commission what they were appointed for in any event. What use is it&#x003F; We know the Government&#x2019;s record on this score. We have had the Tomlinson Commission, the Snyman Commission, the Erika Theron Commission. They always appoint commissions of enquiry but when these commissions come forward with recommendations that are unpalatable they toss them overboard. [Interjections.] The important thing is, and this is what they do not realize, that these are merely the first stirrings. The next classical stage, unless immediate steps are taken to remove grievances, will be what we call &#x201C;urban terrorism.&#x201D; The Blacks have learnt another lesson, and this is vital to South Africa. They have learnt, and they put it this way: If you want change in South Africa, it can only <span class="col_245-246" refersTo="page_0140"/>come about as a result of violence. It is true that the number of casualties has been small because the clashes have been between the police, a disciplined force, and between groups of activists. It is equally true if one does not do something about this situation, it will degenerate into urban terrorism. Then the public on both sides will become involved, deep-seated human emotions will become involved and then your casualty figures will start escalating. Yet the answer is so simple: Give the non-Whites a meaningful role in the political decision-making process in this country and do away with discrimination.</p>

<p>Look at the Government&#x2019;s sad record on this score. We all remember the &#x201C;Give us six months and you will be astounded&#x201D; initiative. That was two years ago, and what has happened since then&#x003F; For example, the Minister of the Interior came back from overseas recently and was interviewed by that faithful ally, SATV. He was asked to give examples of how the Government was eliminating and breaking this problem of discrimination. He said: &#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; and he gave us three. He said, first of all, that we must look at the Government&#x2019;s sport policy. All right! The Minister is making progress and he is losing popularity, even with his own people. He now even has Dr. Koot breathing down his neck. But how many non-White people will take advantage of it&#x003F; How many are going to play rugby at Newlands&#x003F; Is it a thousand, is it five thousand, is it ten thousand&#x003F; It is an infinitesimal portion of the total. The second example the Minister gave was when he said: &#x201C;Look at our new mixed hotels policy&#x201D;. How many Blacks are going to get into the Mount Nelson Hotel&#x003F; If they go there, the chances are there that they will not go through the front; they will go through the kitchen door and will be washing the crockery. The third example he gave was when he said: &#x201C;Look at what we have done about throwing open parks and throwing open libraries in our big cities.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, do you remember when the Prime Minister came rushing in here, red in the face&#x003F; It was at the time when the city council of Johannesburg threw open their parks and their libraries. He came here and threatened them. The things he was going to do to the Johannesburg city council; of that you have no idea. Now his own Minister has the temerity to come here and to quote to us this example of how his Government is breaking down discrimination. What more can one say&#x003F; What is true, is that there will be no move in this regard because the Prime Minister himself has said that there is no discrimination in South Africa. He said: &#x201C;If I were to wake up tomorrow and find my skin is black, nothing would be different. I would merely find myself in a different environment.&#x201D; If the big boss, the makulu boss, says that what can you expect from the lesser lights&#x003F; In fact, nothing is going to happen in this field, because how can even this so-called Cabinet of all talents possibly remove something if it does not exist&#x003F;</p>

<p>The tragedy in South Africa is that when all of us should have been building connecting bridges between our population groups, the Government set out to erect dividing walls. When we should have sought to look for common factors, they concentrated on seeking differences. When they should have made apartheid something that is voluntary, they made it mandatory. When in the question of human relationships we should have given each one a personal choice, they sanctified it in law. That is why we have been brought to this situation.</p>

<p>There is, however, also a third factor necessary for our future survival, i.e. support in the outside world. Hon. members will remember how we questioned this. Time and again we drew attention to our isolation and were given every assurance by that side that there is a greater understanding, in the outside world, of our problems! In fact, they even said there was growing support for the policy of separate development. Then, over the New Year, came the anti-climax, the d&#x00E9;nouement in this sad saga, the pricking of the bubble. We were told we stand alone. Even if the communists attack us, there is not a single nation in the world that will lift a finger to help us. That is the message that came from the hon. the Prime Minister. What he does not realize, however, is that the Western world will still go along with him at the moment because they are using him. They want him to lean on Ian Smith more and more and they want him to bring South West Africa to majority rule, and once there is majority rule in those two places, his position will be different. Then he will have no bargaining power. He will have no diplomatic leverage, and South Africa, in every sense of the word, will become expendable.</p>

<p><span class="col_247-248" refersTo="page_0141"/>We are drifting into an abyss, and that is why it is so tragic to have had the kind of reaction we have had from senior Ministers on that side. The hon. the Prime Minister has, until recently, had a choice. If he had opted for an outward movement&#x2014;not only diplomatically, but outward in every sense of the word&#x2014;he could have saved South Africa. What did he do, however&#x003F; He threw in his lot firmly and irrevocably with the verkramptes. I regret it, but my message, as far as South Africa is concerned, is a gloomy one. I think it remains only for certain hon. members&#x2014;and there are still some of them there on that side&#x2014;to see what is happening. We on this side have gone through the motions. We are discarding what is irrelevant. We are trying to renew and change the whole political structure in this country. However, these muted mutterings we have here from time to time from that side are not sufficient. They must now also take action. They must stand up so that they can be counted, because if they do not do this, I regard the chances of saving South Africa as being one in a thousand. Unless we take this chance now, the vengeful wrath of all future generations will be heaped upon us for having led South Africa and its people to this disaster.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member began his speech by hurling reproaches at this side of the House. He alleged that all we were supposedly doing was scoring political points and not getting to the heart of the matter. The hon. member has been in Parliament long enough to know what to expect if a UP which has been cut to ribbons comes to a parliamentary session and says that they have broken themselves down in order to form an entity which does not yet exist, if from the outset its members start trying to qualify the 14 point plan of ex-judge Mr. Kowie Marais in order to suit their own interpretation. After all, he must then expect us to deal with that same aspect, too. Surely it is relevant to the political scene, because after all, they are here, or do they want to conduct a one-sided discussion with us&#x003F; Is the hon. member for Hillbrow, with his new-found courage, not prepared to subject this great deed of theirs to the test of debate&#x003F; If we want to do so, it is petty politicking but he makes 20 jokes in the course of a half-hour speech, then he considers that he is advancing sound constructive criticism. Let us just look at the way in which they have been trying right from the beginning of this debate, to get away from certain logical consequences of the 14 point plan of Mr. Justice Marais. I want to make the statement that the 14 point plan of Mr. Justice Marais is heading towards majority rule and is founded basically upon a unitary state. I shall read the three points which support this. The first point is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All South Africans have an equal right to full citizenship and citizenship rights, either in a federation or confederation, which can only be realized &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now come the key words:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in a country &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say, a unitary state.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; where there is no discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, religion or sex.</block>

<p>The next point is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Full citizenship is the basis for loyalty towards the State.</block>

<p>That is to say, the Central State. Even though it is called a federation, and even though there is a degree of decentralization, it nevertheless remains a unitary state.</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to point out that nowhere in this 14 point plan is the word &#x201C;identity&#x201D; used. The hon. member for Mooi River concluded his speech with the emotional assurance that for him and for the UP, the maintenance of identity will ever remain the firm basis of approach.

<p>It appears in that little document from which the hon. member for Hillbrow has just quoted. It is the programme of principles which was distributed at the time of the last election. If he sends it to me, I shall look it up and read it to him. The maintenance of identity does not affect only &#x201C;a cultural and religious heritage&#x201D;. In a heterogeneous society like South Africa&#x2019;s, the maintenance of identity basically has to do with political rights and their secure entrenchment.

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands, with whom the hon. members opposite will soon be joined in the same party, said at the end of last year&#x2019;s session:</p>

<block name="quote">Sal ons voortgaan om die hele land te verdeel &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then I leave out a few pieces of rhetoric. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in plaas daarvan dat dit geplaas word op een Suid-Afrika waarin ons bereid is om saam te staan.</block>

<p>It is, therefore, a unitary state. They cannot get away from this. But they want us to ignore it. They want us to let the capitulation of the UP in respect of its central standpoint that it advocated a federation of peoples, to go by unaccounted for and unanswered. Does the UP still advocate a federation of peoples&#x003F; I do not have an answer because there is no mention of a federation of peoples in that 14 point plan. It was the cornerstone of their policy. It was not a cornerstone which materialized from nowhere&#x2014;it was also the result of a &#x201C;new deal&#x201D; which they wanted to work out, the new deal of a study committee with the best constitutional experts as the hon. member for Mooi River said in his speech. The advice of those constitutional experts, which the hon. members have defended so hotly over the past two or three years, has now been thrown overboard. The party has forfeited its essential character by accepting this 14 point plan.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow made a lot of statements and I cannot go into detail in respect of every one of those statements because then I would not be able to make a positive speech as well, something I should very much like to do because they want me to do so and because I need to do so. I just want to make a few brief statements. He made a statement about the extremely high rates of interest. I dispute his allegations and I am sure that it will be shown later in the debate that not all loans are obtained at that extremely high rate of interest. He made the statement that in terms of our system we shall not have optimum utilization of manpower, and after that he fell back once again on the old story of job reservation. Surely he knows that labour peace is a prerequisite for optimum utilization of labour. I say to him, and he will not be able to dispute it, that were job reservation to be lifted, were the Government to say that control over labour was to be suspended, the industrialists and businessmen would themselves be forced to apply it just as strictly as it is being applied at the moment, otherwise there will be chaos and labour peace will fly out the window. Surely he knows that labour control is a mechanism which is applied even in a country like America, because there is a large majority of Whites and a small minority of Blacks. There is a degree of job reservation, possibly for reasons other than those which apply here, and they compel their employers to maintain certain ratios. Labour control, as embodied in our legislation, ensured that there was economic growth and ensured labour place to such an extent that all is well in the field of labour in South Africa. Our record of peace and of good co-operation compares favourably with any other Western country in the world.</p>

<p>He says that there is too much interference and too many Government corporations involved in the economy. But how else are we <span class="col_251-252" refersTo="page_0143"/>going to provide the necessary infrastructure in a developing country&#x003F; How are we to expand the railway network&#x003F; Where would our steel industry have been if Iscor had not been formed&#x003F; What would our position have been now in respect of the rising oil prices if we had not come up with Sasol and Sasol II&#x003F; What would our export potential have been if we had not come up with Saldanha Bay and Richards Bay&#x003F; But he, such a great economist in his own eyes, alleges that it is State interference which is bedevilling our economy.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, to crown it all, a man like him wants to compare us with Hong Kong. I find it strange that he did not also compare us with Monaco and Liechtenstein. After all, we expect more from him than that. We expect him to compare us with comparable economies with comparable circumstances. A scientist does not argue in this way. Then he goes on to say that we have bad management and that we should look at Hong Kong. I wonder, looking at the state of that party over there, to which country I should refer them in order to learn how an Opposition should be formed and injected with life. Zambia, or perhaps Idi Amin&#x2019;s country&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about unemployment. He said that this was the fault of separate development. Surely this is a <i>non sequitur;</i> surely it is not a logical conclusion. Unemployment is a problem which is being experienced throughout the world during the recession. Even the figures he mentioned are not quite correct because people who are not <i>bona fide</i> seekers of employment are also involved. But even the figures he mentions and expresses as percentages, do not compare so unfavourably with the unemployment figure in Japan, America and elsewhere. He does not give all the facts; he simply gives a few facts and then quotes them out of context. He mentions discrimination and says that we have done nothing. Then he brushes the new development in the sport policy aside as if it is nothing. He makes us laugh. Then he mentions the case of the hotels and tells us who really goes to the hotels. He acts as if it is only the Mount Nelson&#x2014;a five-star hotel&#x2014;whose doors are open. I can mention one, two, three and four star hotels whose doors are also open. [Interjections.] Then, in conclusion, he tells us that we are building walls. Yes, we are building walls, but there are doors in those walls. There is a growing exchange, which is steadily becoming more vigorous. There is discussion; there is consultation; there is growing contact. The refrain which was also audible in this hon. member&#x2019;s speech, is the call of crisis, the cry that separate development has failed and that we need a new plan, a new dispensation, a new strategy. Even though this cry is uttered by a confused and fragmented UP, by a party in liquidation, and even though the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who always reminds me of Shakespeare&#x2019;s wise words:</p>

<block name="quote">All the world is a stage, and all the men and all the women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts.</block>

<p>&#x2026; even though the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is in the forefront of the desperation brigade, and even though the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2014;the leader of a party who has drawn up a blue-print for the destruction of the White man&#x2014;complains, it is surely necessary, nevertheless, for us to give an answer; an answer which, as we know, will not fall on fertile ground with them. In spirit they have already capitulated. However, we give them an answer in which we once again try to underline the fundamental truth of the NP&#x2019;s policy and to indicate the alternatives clearly. Many answers have already been given and many aspects have been clearly illustrated. Against this background&#x2014;without repeating&#x2014;I first want to make the statement that the speakers on the Opposition side have been guilty of sketching a caricature of separate development, a caricature of what it is, of what it has already achieved and brought about and of the benefit it involves for White, Coloured and Black.</p>

<p>Separate development&#x2014;despite what the hon. Opposition wants to give out&#x2014;is a liberating policy. It is a policy which aims to guide peoples to full political self-realization, rapidly but on an evolutionary basis. It is a policy which has already succeeded in a relatively short time in creating meaningful rights, platforms, forums and power bases for every people and for every population group in South Africa. Every homeland leader and government constitutes living proof of this. The independent Transkei is an undeniable fact and the Cabinet Council&#x2014;something <span class="col_253-254" refersTo="page_0144"/>which they so often disparage, something which is still in its infancy&#x2014;is already affording the Coloureds a more meaningful platform and forum than this Parliament ever afforded them in the past. Separate development has already created and brought into being more political freedom for the average Black man&#x2014;for the Blacks in the city, too&#x2014;than is enjoyed by the greater majority of Blacks in the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>This brings me, in passing, to a very drastic statement made by the hon. the Leader of the PRP. In a prepared speech, with regular references to his written notes, the hon. member for Sea Point said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will only be safe from the ideologies when we have won the hearts and the minds of all South Africans, Black and White, for a South Africa which provides them with more opportunities and more security than the communists and Marxists offer.</block>

<p>What does this mean, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; In simple terms, the hon. member is saying two things here. Firstly he says that Marxism and communism do indeed offer security and prospects to the Black and Coloured people. Secondly he says that even the <i>status quo</i> in South Africa&#x2014;let alone the future fruits which separate development offers the Blacks&#x2014;offers the Blacks fewer advantages and less security than do Marxism and communism. The hon. member is thereby saying that the Marxists and communists are preferable to separate development. Does the hon. member believe this&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, then they are irritated. The hon. member is now shaking his head, but he should have listened from the beginning. At that time he was sitting and talking. If he had listened, he would have been able to follow my argument. Then those hon. members are amazed when we say that they are the party of evil and that they are dangerous.</p>

<p>I said that separate development was a liberating policy which created opportunities and prospects for everyone in South Africa. The Opposition&#x2019;s argument to this has throughout this debate been twofold. They said that this might be so, but that it fails for two reasons. The first reason why it fails, is that it is not acceptable to all and especially not to the urban Bantu. In the second place they say that even if the policy were a good one and even if we were to apply it as we say we shall, our time has run out, because it is already a few minutes before midnight. As to the question whether it is acceptable or not, apart from the arguments already advanced, viz. that there were only a small percentage of people involved in the riots, I want to put the following to the Opposition as a fact. In all the homelands except one, elections are held regularly. It is not our fault that an election has not yet taken place in the remaining homeland. Perhaps an election will be held there shortly. Whatever the case may be, the elections which were held in the other homelands were free elections. It was not only the Blacks who live in the homelands who participated in the elections. An effort was made to involve the urban Bantu who live in our cities, but who originally come from the homelands, in the elections and the urban Bantu did indeed participate in these elections in large numbers, in significant numbers. It was not a case of only a single party in every homeland launching an election campaign; there were opposition parties as well. Many of the opposition parties adopted the standpoint: &#x201C;Reject separate development completely. Reject all co-operation with the Government which adopted it as their policy, ignore it, rebel against it.&#x201D; The parties that won, however, adopted the standpoint that although they did not agree with everything and although they expressed criticism from time to time, they were prepared to co-operate within the framework of Government policy and accept the opportunities afforded them. I can therefore on a scientific basis make the statement that the urban Bantu have been consulted and that they have also expressed themselves as being in favour of co-operation within the framework of separate development. However, as far as their standpoint is concerned, the hon. members on the other side concentrate on certain loud-mouthed activists whom they think are the true spokesmen for urban Black opinion. In a democracy it is ultimately the ballot-box which decides and the ballot-box spoke against them in respect of the urban Bantu, but in favour of co-operation with the NP within the framework of its policy.</p>

<p>Separate development is not a static policy. As we progress, we are already experiencing <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0145"/>growing acceptance. There are many Blacks and Coloureds who were previously active opponents and even haters of the policy of separate development, but who now, to the extent that it has developed and they see that we are <i>bona fide,</i> have come to the fore and occupy responsible positions in homeland governments and other bodies like universities and corporations.</p>

<p>I now come to the time aspect. I believe that as the activists and terrorists here and elsewhere show their true colours, irrespective of the degree to which they now oppose our policy, the Blacks will become disillusioned and will see the fearful example of places like Angola, where anarchy has taken over. Then he will accept the peaceful solution which the White population offers him through the NP. I believe that as the Government proves its good faith by stimulating development, by creating opportunities, by improving training, by expanding education and eliminating discrimination, the Blacks and Coloureds will realize more and more that the differentiation which remains, is essential for the peace and progress of all and that it is not hurtful. The establishment of meaningful separate freedoms and their own worthwhile political structures, coupled with full political self-determination not only constitutes the ideal of this Government, but is what it is going to do and will bring about. The settlement thereof will ultimately prove the propaganda which is constantly being disseminated by our enemies to be false. Bringing about the involvement, with growing content and meaning of the urban Bantu with his fatherland in the political sphere, will prove that it offers them meaningful political self realization.</p>

<p>That hon. member said by way of interjection that even if we did all this, even if he accepted my arguments thus far, there was simply no longer any time left. I admit that time is running out. We are living in serious times and no one wants to deny this. No one on this side has ever tried to deny this, but it is just as true that over-hasty and panicky 14 point plans will very quickly put us just where our enemies want us. If we like the UP, were to act in so panic-stricken a fashion, we would end up in the same tattered confused conditions as they are in now as a result of their panic. If time is the essence of the problem, the time has come for us to discuss the time crisis. The NP realizes that the time factor is important and therefore it is taking rapid action, that is why it is trying to follow its policy through to its logical conclusions as quickly as possible, to implement it and to make it succeed; that is why it is still searching for ways and means to enable it to implement its policy as quickly as possible. We all know, and I can testify to this, how hard we have been working at this and how quickly things have moved over the past three, four years. Understanding on the part of the Opposition and the Blacks, Coloureds and Indians is, however, just as essential as the haste of the NP. They must understand that the only safe plan for all, namely separate development, needs time. It needs time, because it costs money, money which is not always so readily available. It needs time, because the Marxist onslaught on South Africa, which threatens us and aims to subject all of us, White, Brown and Black, to domination and terror, because that onslaught has a retarding effect on implementation of the policy, because it drains our labour resources and to a certain extent consumes our capital, which we could otherwise put to positive use. The policy needs time because there are certain priorities, because there are things which must take place in a certain order, for the sake of lasting success and order. Development of infrastructures, training and matters of this nature are not things which can be brought about in a day or a month or a year. Therefore, while we all have to make haste, it remains just as essential that those of us who are sitting here, and who want to give serious consideration to the future of South Africa, and the Press, which participates in a serious spirit in the debate on the future of South Africa, will also see that, while haste is necessary, we shall also have to retain our patience. Both are equally important. We need the balance of the Latin idiom: <i>Festina Lente</i>; make haste slowly.</p>

<p>This debate ultimately comes back once again to the fundamental difference between us and the Opposition. We say to them again today: It is easy to identify bottlenecks in separate development and to make long drawn-out speeches about them. They are <span class="col_257-258" refersTo="page_0146"/>fully entitled to do so and I do not reproach them for it, but when you have all finished doing so and have voiced all the problems, then all of you, particularly those of you who are considering forming a new movement, must look just as critically at the alternative of power sharing in a unitary state, whether or not you call it a federation.</p>

<p>Then we must consider the question whether we can find a peaceful solution to South Africa&#x2019;s political problems in one central body, elected on a basis of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, which is the ruling structure of a federation. The alternative does not hold out much hope for anyone; it holds out no hope for the White man and I shall explain to hon. members why not. In this 14 point plan, in the appeal made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Sea Point, we are asked to hold a conference and to sit round a table with all the people in South Africa. Before those hon. members can do so, they ask that we abandon our constitution and that we renounce all rights which we earned at great cost, in a long and difficult process. Should the hon. members go to such a conference, with our constitution under his arm and the power of Parliament as it is at present, such a conference like this will not be acceptable to anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River must sleep on this this evening, because he is living in a dream world if he thinks that the conference means anything to him other than that he would have to renounce all rights and would have to consider afresh how we were to reach a new solution together. The 14 point plan does not hold out any advantage for the Coloureds, because they, and many Black peoples, will find that their identity would stand to be threatened by a majority of one tribe. It has already been proved in other countries that a &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D; is not worth the paper it is written on, unless all show a spirit and attitude of wishing to uphold such a Bill of Rights. Nigeria, which massacred an entire people, has a fine-sounding &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D;. For this reason hon. members must not pin their hopes on point 9 or point 14, point 11 or point 12. Hon. members must know that if they forgo their power base, it will be Ichabod. If hon. members think that I am conjuring up spectres, I should like to know where, in a country with a heterogeneous population, with such far-reaching and deep-seated differences as we have, has sharing of power worked&#x003F; Yesterday, the hon. member for Pretoria Central clearly indicated that it simply does not work.</p>

<p>The Opposition spoke of strategy. I just want to say that we in the National Party are also aware of the value of strategy. This is why we have a strategy, a strategy which has been refined by years of thinking and self-criticism. It is based on practical experience, and has been shaped by years of debate in this House over many years. Our strategy is and remains the only reasonable and justifiable solution which ensures a safe future for the White man on the one hand, and full, true and meaningful freedom and citizenship for Blacks, Coloureds and Indians on the other. This strategy is based on the foundations which some hon. members still want to retain, but which do not appear in their 14 point plan. I have in mind, for example, the maintenance of identity, self-determination for all, the maintenance of law and order, fairness and balance.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I take it that the hon. member for Vereeniging will pardon me if I do not reply to what he had to say here this afternoon. Unfortunately, my time is very limited but, should my time permit of it, I should like to reply to a few of his arguments.</p>

<p>If at the end of the session of last year someone had told me that at the beginning of the next session I would have been expelled from the UP, I would have found it difficult to believe. However, if someone had told me then that I would be expelled from my party because I wanted to safeguard it against those who wished to destroy it, I would have said: Impossible! In my humble opinion a position of this nature is unique in the entire political history of South Africa. I wish to say nothing further in regard to this matter except that my hon. friends in the UP itself will have to ask themselves how such an impossible position was allowed to develop in a party that seeks to accept the responsibility of being the official Opposition. It was of course not easy for us to arrive at a decision that could lead to our expulsion from the party. Nevertheless, we took the decision because we had no faith in the viability of the new party envisaged by the leader of the UP. We did not believe that that party would be viable because it is totally <span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_0147"/>impossible to reconcile the reconcilable with the irreconcilable. Mr. Speaker, I regard the UP with its philosophy as I have known it over the years, to be totally irreconcilable with the philosophy of the PRP, which I understand fairly well, within the political spectrum of South Africa. As I have known the UP&#x2014;and my friends can criticize me if I am wrong&#x2014;it has stood for the right of the retention of group identity. That is what my party stands for. On the other hand the PRP is poles apart because that party stands for a unitary community, a unitary state. They will say that that is not true but I say that that will be the logical consequence of their policy. That is why I make this statement. I say therefore that it is impossible to unite people who are in favour of the retention of group identity and people who are in favour of the establishment of a unitary community. Those who try to do so are not only wasting their time; they are also guilty of a colossal political blunder, and that is why we could not go along with that effort. We could not go along because it is also clear to us that the mere attempt to achieve something of this nature has been sufficient indication that there are people in the UP today who are at least sympathetically disposed towards the idea of a unitary community. We felt that if there were such people we did not want to stand in their way. Let them establish a new party if they want but heaven only knows why they forbade me to retain my old party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch and I had a little chat the other day. He is an honourable man and I have a great respect for him as a person. I said to him: &#x201C;Van Zyl, you know that you and I cannot be in the same party.&#x201D; He then said to me: &#x201C;Tony, you are right.&#x201D; He agreed with me and I agreed with him. He is honest and I am also trying to be honest towards myself. I ask myself, Mr. Speaker, what he and I would achieve if we tried to give the people of South Africa the impression that he and I could belong to the same party. We should then be carrying on a bluff, something I cannot justify to myself. I do not care who it is who can justify this to himself, but I cannot, and for that reason I said: &#x201C;I cannot go along.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point gave an interesting reply. He was asked: &#x201C;Are you prepared to co-operate with the PRP&#x003F;&#x201D;, and he said: &#x201C;I am prepared to co-operate with anybody, including the devil, provided he believes in the same sort of South Africa as that in which I believe.&#x201D; That is the key: &#x201C;Provided he believes in the same sort of South Africa.&#x201D; I put it to the hon. member for Durban Point that he knows that he and the PRP do not believe in the same sort of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout launched another attack. He tried to create the impression&#x2014;I do not want to interpret him incorrectly&#x2014;that we did not want to go along with the effort because we were in favour of White leadership. I have already indicated that this is of course totally wrong as far as the true state of affairs is concerned. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said to us: &#x201C;Thank you and good-bye!&#x201D; I also want to say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; to him today because he has taught us a great deal. He taught us a great deal about tricks. However, he also taught us that tricks do not pay. I am also grateful for that. He must know this afternoon that I do not want to beat about the bush.</p>

<p>I do not want to try to avoid the issue of &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;. I want rather to put this aspect honestly as I see it. If as a result I have to lose my political platform, then so be it. That is how I feel about the matter. What do I understand by &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;&#x003F; Let me first look at the word &#x201C;mastery&#x201D; (baasskap). I need not discuss the question of mastery. We <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_0148"/>all know what &#x201C;mastery&#x201D; is. If I am a master then someone else has to do as I say or he is out. A leader, however, has other characteristics. A leader has leadership characteristics. One may in fact find this in mastery as well, but not necessarily so. However, if a leader does not have the characteristics of leadership he will never be able to lead. If he does not have the quality of leadership he will never lead. A leader leads only because he has the ability to lead. That is what leadership means to me. In terms of the principles of my party, White leadership has never to my mind meant &#x2026; physical force. To my mind it has always been a spiritual force in the population set-up of South Africa.</p>

<p>It is often asked whether White leadership is an end in itself. If it is an end in itself it may be an ugly thing. However, I say no. White leadership is not an end in itself. It is a means to a twofold end. The first step that I want to achieve by means of my White leadership&#x2014;and, as it happens, this is what the Government is doing at the moment&#x2014;is to bring about a new constitutional set-up in South Africa. They are busy with separate freedoms. If, for the sake of argument, I was in power, I would be busy with my federal system, but this would have to take place under White leadership, in the closest consultation, of course, with those people whom I hope to bring into the system. That is the first aspect&#x2014;to establish a new constitutional dispensation for South Africa. One cannot simply just go along and remove White leadership. Secondly, my friends and I believe&#x2014; and we stand firmly by this&#x2014;that civilized standards and norms must be maintained in this homeland of ours for as long as possible, if not for all time. We believe that at this stage the White man is the bearer of those norms and we also believe that we would be doing ourselves a gross injustice if we did not succeed, not in ramming them down the throats of other people but at least offering them to people so that, with our way of life as an example, we could also encourage these people to accept those norms. That is what I understand by &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;&#x2014;not physical force but a spiritual force which in my humble opinion is of inestimable value for the survival of order in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let me now, however, return to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Not only did he try to give the impression that this was the reason why we were not part of the new initiative but he actually dissociated himself and his colleagues completely from the idea of &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;. He was not only speaking for himself. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the leader of the UP in the Transvaal. He sits here as a frontbencher on the Opposition side. He said that this was not a principle of the party. He wanted, as it were, to have nothing to do with it. Neither did I hear any objection from that side.</p>

<p>Let me look at the facts as I see them&#x2014;if I am wrong, I am sure that somebody will assist me. In my hand I have a document with the heading: &#x201C;Die doelstellings en beginsels van die VP soos in November 1973 eenparig deur die Sentrale Kongres van die party aangeneem is.&#x201D; This is not a dead document that has a number of hollow points which can be interpreted in many ways. It is a living document, full of idealism, of the party in which I believe. What does this document say&#x003F; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tot bevordering van di&#x00E9; doel &#x2026;</block>

<p>The purpose which is referred to here is the establishment of a specific constitutional system.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; bind die party hom aan ses grondbeginsels.</block>

<p>Let us see what the fourth basic principle has to say. Although I know that principle off by heart, I want to read it out because I do not want to make any mistakes:</p>

<block name="quote">White leadership in the interest of all our people and as the sponsor and guarantor of orderly development in South Africa.</block>

<p>It goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Die VP staan verbind &#x2026;</block>

<p>Please note, &#x201C;committed&#x201D;&#x2014;it is therefore not an empty promise. We find there: &#x201C;We are committed.&#x201D; I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; aan Blankeleierskap nie in die sin van een groep wat baasskap oor &#x2019;n ander uitoefen nie &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is precisely what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_0149"/>&#x2026; nog in eie belang van enige gemeenskap, maar in die diens van alle gemeenskappe en vir die handhawing van ordelike politiek, ekonomiese en maatskap-like vooruitgang.</block>

<p>This is a spiritual force. If the hon. member for Bezuidenhout disagrees with me, I want to tell him: &#x201C;My friend, disagree with me if you must.&#x201D; If he speaks on behalf of the UP and his colleagues, I want to ask him: Where was he in 1973&#x003F; In 1975 we held a large national congress at which one could move any motion and get people to support it. The hon. member was not there in order to reject this resolution. That resolution still stands today. That is why I am not ashamed to say where I stand in regard to this matter. I just want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that if he wishes to create the impression that this is the reason why we have left the party, he is making a fatal mistake and should look once again at his own principles. Enough of that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River told us that the old dispensation was antiquated and obsolete and that we had to seek a new one. As yet I am unable to offer him a new dispensation but I want to tell him that if he has listened carefully he will already have heard a brand new note sounded on this side of the House, a note to the effect that we expect the Government of South Africa to govern responsibly and that we promise the people of South Africa that we will oppose responsibly. That is what we are prepared to do. We shall test the Government and the Government can test us. I want to say here today that when it comes to internal security, the Government can rely upon this group to stand by law and order. When it comes to defence the Government can rely on the fact that we will stand by South Africa and her interests and that we shall not exploit the matter for petty political gain. When it comes to a question of external security we shall stand by South Africa and we shall never exploit it for political gain. What is more, when it comes to a question of faith in my homeland, South Africa, we shall try to breathe a spirit of realistic optimism because we believe that lack of confidence is the root cause of all our problems. We shall try to inspire those prophets of doom who may perhaps really believe that we have problems that are insurmountable, but I want to say right away that the prophets of doom who condemn South Africa, not because they believe what they say but because they are seeking to break South Africa, will receive no mercy from this side of the House. We shall try to instil confidence in South Africa. In spite of her thousands of shortcomings she remains, in my humble opinion, one of the best countries in the world.</p>

<p>Whenever this party has to oppose something it will oppose responsibly, and we say to the Government that we also expect them to govern responsibly.</p>

<p>The first point to which I want to return is the fact mentioned by the hon. member for Vereeniging. For some years now we have been warning the Government in regard to the time factor because time for South Africa is marching on. We shall watch the Government in the future; we shall attack it unmercifully if, as in the past, it continues to overlook the time factor in South Africa. We shall attack the Government mercilessly in regard to malpractices, and just as mercilessly in regard to mismanagement and incompetence. We shall attack the Government mercilessly in regard to the shortcomings that exist in the policy of the Government in regard to racial matters, economic matters, and so forth. We shall attack them mercilessly. There will be no mercy because we expect them to govern responsibly.</p>

<p>I should like to say one final thing in regard to racial problems. I despair sometimes when I think of the racial position in South Africa, particularly when I listen to the debates here. For years now we have been denigrating one another, White against White. For years now we have been at one another&#x2019;s throats in regard to the non-White in South Africa. For years now we have been building up a conflict situation, a confrontation, White against White, in regard to the non-White in South Africa. I want in all earnestness to ask this House today: In the light of the fact that our colour position has been internationalized and is therefore no longer a local problem as it was in the year dot, can South Africa afford to continue in this way&#x003F; I think the time has come for us to take the interests of our fatherland to heart, for the party political leaders in South Africa to come together and say: Thusfar and no further; we must find one another. We shall have to work out a basis to <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_0150"/>remove the colour problem from party politics or else I say to hon. members: This will lead to the end of the country. I do not know how it can be done. The efforts of the past failed. But those were other times, other things, other days. In the light of the seriousness of the position today I honestly believe that every hon. member in this House has to do his level best not only to speak responsibly on matters of colour but also to do his level best to remove the burning problem, which so divides us Whites, from the party political sphere so that we can make of it a national problem instead of a party political one.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, circumstances might have stripped the hon. member for Maitland of his party, of his supporters and of his colleagues, but in no way did this diminish his oratorical powers. He still delivers his speech in the way he used to. It was, however, a sad moment for us to see this hon. member wash his dirty linen in public in this House. Surely this was not necessary. We would have been justified in expecting him to conduct this conversation somewhere else with the people concerned.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member passed up an opportunity to make a really positive contribution here. We did learn something about, <i>inter alia,</i> a special matter from the speech of the hon. member for Maitland. That was about the concept of leadership. The difference between the National Party and hon. members on the opposite side of this House as regards the concept of leadership is this. In the National Party leadership is crystallized in the actual leader. The fact that the leader is the head, but not the brain; that the leader is the inspiration, but not the soul, is interwoven in the leadership of the NP. Because the leader of the National Party emerged from the nation, the National Party will never be able to do what the United Party has been doing in recent times. The National Party is interwoven and integrated with the nation, with the electorate and with people. For that reason the policy of the National Party is directly aimed at, and integrated with, the people outside. That is why the National Party has no doubts. Unfortunately those people on the opposite side of this House are experiencing definite doubt.</p>

<p>I should like to read a quotation from a paper which has just come off the press, and I want to read it to the hon. member for Durban Point. It states explicitly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Natallers neem beslis &#x2019;n afwagtende houding in.

<p>The philosophy of the National Party is the acknowledgment of the fundamental right of every person, of every individual, in his totality as a human being in this country. It sounds so simple, but that is the gospel truth, because the people of this country are intimately bound up with their history, with the history of the nation to <span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0151"/>which they belong. It upsets us that members of the PRP want to run away from the concept of their being members of the White race. They want to get away from this concept. My contention is that we are an integral part of a nation with a history. We belong to a party with a history and a specific line of development Our party is not hidebound and verkramp, but it lives and grows and adjusts. We had architects who put the structure of our party on firm foundations. So there is no need for us to interfere with these foundations every day to see whether they are still firm. Those structures are solid and firm. The United Party, however, removes bricks from their basic structures. Therefore their building cannot remain intact. The history of our nation is part of our existence and we cannot escape that. We cannot and do not want to undo that, because that is our salvation and we must cherish it. A writer once said:</p>

<block name="quote">History is not made only by kings and Parliaments, by presidents, wars and generals. It is the story of people, of their love, their honour, their faith, hope and suffering; of birth and death, of hunger, thirst and cold, of loneliness and sorrow.</block>

<p>These are components which contribute to the basic nature and deep-rooted character of a nation. Therefore we do not view the past of our nation and the events of the Anglo-Boer War with bitter reproach, with the hatred which emenates at times from conversations from the opposite side. We are faithfully convinced that those were events which enriched our nation with great examples of people who did not lose courage. I believe we can learn a lesson from this. Those people who want to flee from this small band of Whites in South Africa today and who want to join the ranks of the non-Whites to seek their security there, are selling their good right of existence.</p>

<p>In essence the National Party is intent on serving the nation, and to be able to do this, its objectives seek to achieve the following: Firstly&#x2014;this is quite simple&#x2014;the development of peoples in this country; secondly, the granting, the maintenance and the protection of sovereignty; thirdly, the economic development of these peoples; and, fourthly, the participation of these peoples in internal and external spheres, government and talks within the framework of good order. When we make a further analysis of each of these components and we look at the development of a people, the question arises: What else is involved in this&#x003F; For one thing, the education of its youth is involved. Let us look at the Blacks only. In 1948, shortly after this Government came to power, there were 723 000 Black pupils. In 1975 there were 3 700 000 Blacks attending school. This progress, percentage-wise, is astronomical. Health services must be regarded as one of the components which ensures the growth of a people. It must be remembered that there were 6&#x00BD; million Blacks in South Africa in 1935, but that the number has grown to 17&#x00BD; million at the end of 1976. An increase from 6&#x00BD; million to 17&#x00BD; million is enormous, but this was accompanied by the improvement of health services and care as regards, <i>inter alia,</i> the birth of Black children. Good health services are available. There are doctors in this House who will get up in the middle of the night to assist at the confinement of a Black child. Farmers of Standerton will not allow one more baby to be born in the &#x201C;daub-and-wattle&#x201D; huts on their farms. They will rather take the Black woman to the maternity home where she will receive excellent medical care. The mortality rate of non-White babies has decreased to a minimum. Further attention is being given to economic prosperity. I want to stress one matter only; in 1966 the per capita income of the economically active Bantu in this country, domestic servants and agricultural workers excluded, was R372 per year. In 1976, 10 years later, it was R1 300 per year. This means an increase of 250% in 10 years. This is a splendid achievement.</p>

<p>I want to mention only two examples with regard to housing facilities for the various population groups. In the immediate vicinity of Cape Town there is the city of Atlantis, currently under construction, which will house approximately 80 000 people in the year 2000. We can also mention the Black town which is being built in the local area at Secunda, on Langverwacht. This will be the most modern town for the other population groups in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Every Black who is going to live there has already applied for electricity in his house. That is part of the purpose of our nation, of <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0152"/>the aspiration of our Government, to elevate the strata of our various population groups. The costs of that Black town will be 10 million rand, but it is borne by our economy. As regards further development of our economy, we only have to think of the Black entrepreneurs entering commerce, the Indian trade which has a proud record today. There are big Indian businessmen, Coloureds in industry, and estimates that 75% of the building industry in the Cape is in the hands of Coloureds has been given to us.</p>

<p>The issue is the maintenance and the protection of the sovereignty of our various population groups. Here we have clear examples of the sovereignty of the Transkei, acknowledged in its own right.</p>

<p>The Ambassador of the Transkei attended the opening ceremony of our Parliament in this Chamber. But not only that, the action of this country&#x2019;s White sons on the border of Angola is a proof of their endeavour to safeguard this country for all its population groups. We cannot get any better proof.</p>

<p>The economic development of our country and all its people is accompanied by pain, because our country as a whole, being part of the free Western world, experiences the difficulties of a shortage of capital. This country really does not intend to make a gift of R35 million only to have it on the scrap heap in two years&#x2019; time as is now the case in Zambia. The papers were full of that. That is not the object and the task of this Government; we must turn every cent over and spend it profitably. We want to develop a sense of responsibility in our people for the task with which we entrust them. I should like to quote one of our great industrialists, Dr. Anton Rupert, a level-headed businessman whose investment portfolios are selected in such a way that there is development and vitality in the different areas. He told a group in New York, as he would have told young people: &#x201C;Young man, go south!&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Young man, go west!&#x201D; He said, because of these reasons, that, in the first place, there was a positive growth in the population of the Republic of South Africa, while population growth in Europe was flattening out. Apart from that there is the enormous potential of this country, which will support approximately 54 500 000 Blacks and 18 000 000 Whites in the year 2020. We have the manpower, and apart from the fact that South Africa has the greater part of all the gold in the world, this country also has 90% of the platinum in the Free World, 70% of its chromite, 100% of the amosite in the world, 100% of the world&#x2019;s asbestos reserves and also the biggest known reserves of radium in the world. Apart from the aforementioned South Africa also has considerable reserves of iron ore, manganese, phosphates, titanium, antimony, coal, copper and uranium. The whole sub-continent of Africa offers tremendous possibilities for the further development of its natural resources. That is important for the progress of all its inhabitants and for good relations. I wonder what those hon. members will say if they know that one can stand on a certain spot in the Eastern Transvaal where according to a geologist, the coal-seam is 500 feet thick. One feels insignificant when one contemplates what the Almighty has given our people as their responsibility. We can prosper from such riches and apply them to the benefit of all our people.</p>

<p>Another component of our Government&#x2019;s objective is to bring our people to a point where they can participate in the international sphere. They must reach maturity to be able to participate internationally. I think we have achieved that objective because on occasion we bring our peoples to the various spheres and we guide them to that maturity. That is the task of our hon. Minister when he liaises with other countries. The contingents which go overseas include people of various peoples. Whatever we achieve in future will only depend on ourselves.</p>

<p>This Government can tolerate criticism and opposition. The Government may expect opposition, terrorism and encroachment on the border. We must take cognizance of these <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0153"/>incidents because they are realities. The Government has the right, however, not to expect a lot of hands-uppers in our midst. The hands-uppers are those people who do not want to go along with us as regards the full concept of what the work of this country entails. If we make a study of our history, we find that we have always had hands-uppers in our midst. They maintain that they also communicate with the other parties, the Blacks, but they do that as refugees. They cannot conceive of the character of a person who can stand firm and who can say: &#x201C;These are my borders and from here I will not move.&#x201D; We trust in the future of this nation and we want to connect this trust to the following three simple bases. In the first place the possibilities of our development are in our land which the Almighty God has given to us. In the second place we rely on the quality of our people. We are experiencing difficult years but it is in circumstances like these that the strength of a human being emerges. The difficult times in the history of our nation has always brought the best in the nation to the fore. This quality in our people is a great support to us. In the third instance we may have confidence in our development, because we have confidence in the leader of the National Party, our highly esteemed Prime Minister.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to react to the statement of the hon. member for Standerton, that we have no right to exist. What worries me is the way in which this Government is acting with regard to the existence of all the people in South Africa. The hon. member praised Government expenditure, but I hope he will listen when I come to the question of Government expenditure in Soweto. We are in very grave trouble and it is necessary to summarize it before I come to the main point of my speech. The Government has brought us to the point where we have had two years of dangerously low growth. We are likely to have a third, and the further outlook does not look any better. We have had inflation at an unacceptable level and it still remains above 10%. The Government&#x2019;s voluntary collective programme to fight inflation is simply a farce and it is perceived by the public to be simply not worth the paper it is written on. This arises from a string of price increases which the Government introduced. In the last couple of months the price of steel, electricity and petrol has gone up, all of which will cause a chain of further increases as they work their way through the system.</p>

<p>We have unemployment on a massive scale. At the end of December we had something like 19 000 Coloured, White and Asian people unemployed. When we come to the Black people of this country&#x2014;and the figures for the Coloureds, Whites and Asians are sad enough in themselves&#x2014;their position is nothing short of a disaster. The figures for their unemployment, we have heard, range from something like 600 000 to 2 million. What cannot be disputed, whichever estimate you take, is that the red light is already flashing, and far from dropping, the figures are continuing to rise.</p>

<p>The fourth problem to which the Government has brought us is that we have massive short-term debt obligations and a very dangerously low level of foreign exchange reserves. On the 20th of this month our gross foreign exchange reserves stood at some R689,5 million. Within that figure the gold element has of course not been revalued. The latest figure that we have been given by the Government for the foreign loans raised by the Government and by the Reserve Bank, which must be subtracted from the gross reserves, was R657 million.</p>

<p>It is a dark and forbidding scene, and let us be quite clear about this, whatever the Cabinet speakers may say to the contrary, it is going to get worse. The question we really want to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: How can our country, a land of enormous potential wealth, come to such a pass&#x003F; The answer needs to be learnt, not only by the people who sit on the benches opposite, but indeed by every South African, and it needs to be digested because for all of us South Africans the day of reckoning is close at hand if this Government does not change its ways. Those words are chosen with care for our choice is now quite stark.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the answer quite simply lies in the objectives of this Government. These are, as we have heard over and over again in this House, growth, full employment, an acceptable level of inflation, a strong balance of payments, private enterprise for Whites and apartheid or separate but equal development. The first five objectives are common to <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0154"/>most of the economies of the Free Western World except for the qualification placed on the fifth, namely the deliberate decision of this Government to restrict the benefits of and participation in the private enterprise system in our country simply on a basis of colour, a subject to which I shall return. The other countries of the Western world have had enough trouble trying to achieve those five objectives, but our Government has chosen to add the sixth, apartheid development, which simply makes its task impossible. Those six objectives cannot be achieved. It cannot be done. It is as simple as that, and therefore the choice which the whole of South Africa is looking for is either to abandon apartheid and the colour restriction on private enterprise or simply to take us willy-nilly into the laager. The choice is as stark as that. It is whether this Government is going to solve the problems of Soweto or whether it is going into the laager. To put it into economic terms, Mr. Speaker, it is whether they want to go into a vicious or a virtuous cycle.</p>

<p>We heard on Friday that every responsible person is alive to the fact that in this age of mass communication and interdependence no country or people can exist in isolation. That is indeed true. The fact, the reality, remains that we as a country can only move ahead at the pace we should, and indeed, to put it bluntly, we can only maintain a chance of peaceful co-existence here if we can attract capital from overseas. This is where the fictions and the illusions fall away, for this is where the crunch is. The present message is quite clear. If one looks at the figures for 1976, they are quite illuminating; they ram home the message. The total capital movement for the first three quarters of 1976 is as follows&#x2014;and I am now talking about South Africa: In the first quarter there was an inflow of R483 million; the inflow during the second quarter was R89 million and, significantly, during the third quarter there was an outflow of R12 million. Those figures understate the case because during that time this Government withdrew R157 million from the IMF, so the figures cannot be compared too easily with those of previous years.</p>

<p>If we are to show a growth rate of 4% during 1977 or in 1978, without assuming any improvement in our balance of payments, we will need something of the order of R800 million from overseas. If we were to aim at a growth rate of 5%, which is not an unreasonable figure for a country of South Africa&#x2019;s potential&#x2014;and in fact it is on the low side&#x2014;we would need R2 800 million from overseas. The writing is on the wall for all South Africans to see because if we are going to get that capital from overseas, then either this Government must change or the Government itself must be changed.</p>

<p>In the past there used to be an attitude amongst some people overseas&#x2014;and the Government had no control over this because they have no control over the attitude of foreign investors&#x2014;that money should not be lent to us in this country on the grounds that we should be punished or reformed. Although that, in itself, was a cause for worry, the situation is now much graver because now overseas investors in general, individuals, banks and other financial institutions, are refusing to lend money to South Africa simply because they no longer think our country is a safe place to lend to or to invest in. That adds a quite different and a quite new dimension to our inability to attract capital from overseas in the future. It is no use saying that other countries are in the same position, because the international capital market at this point in time is flush with money to lend. What happens when one goes to borrow for South Africa&#x003F; People overseas simply say &#x201C;no way!&#x201D; when it comes to a South African borrower who wants to use the money within South Africa. Whatever the hon. the Prime Minister may say, one cannot separate business from politics. There is nothing wrong with the potential of South Africa to create wealth within our land. Indeed, we are the envy of the rest of the world, and the human, mineral and agricultural potential which the hon. member for Standerton referred to is vast. On those grounds, we should be in a position, right at the top of the list, to attract funds. The message, however, is that it is the policy of this Government which must change. This is where the rules of the game have changed. It is no use hoping that the price of gold is going to increase continuously and sufficiently to remove the necessity for overseas capital.</p>

<p>The choice, as I have said, is Soweto or the laager, and let us make no mistake, life in the laager will be highly and increasingly unpleasant for all. It will become a self-justifying <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0155"/>and a self-destructive cul-de-sac just as Rhodesia has found it to be. No burnt earth policy of this Government can actually affect our land&#x2019;s matrix or potentially great wealth, but what this Government can do, and appears to be doing, is to negate and destroy the chances of Whites to participate, when the river of troubles is over, as full and welcome partners in the future prosperity of our land.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. The Government has struck no balance at all between defence expenditure and Soweto, and this despite the fact that the two are interdependent and quite inseparable. Does this Government really believe that the quality of life in Soweto is unimportant&#x003F; It apparently does, though those in charge of the Defence Force know differently. The evidence shows, as hon. members may recall, that the defence budget for this year is R1 350 million, and that it is likely to increase next year. For 1976-&#x2019;77 the deficit between the revenue, which is all raised from the inhabitants of Soweto, and the expenditure in Soweto&#x2014;and this is for the West Rand Bantu Administration Board, carrying out its responsibilities for the whole area, which includes Soweto&#x2014;is anticipated to be of the order of between R2 million and R5 million. That is one-seventh to one-third of 1% of what we spend on defence. That is the total expenditure on Soweto which is not earned from the citizens of Soweto. That in itself is beyond belief, but it lays bare one facet of the death wish of this Government in the sense that one can hardly construe how it is possible to build up a united South Africa or how one can convince people overseas that they should invest their money here.</p>

<p>There are only those two choices. We must either solve the problems of Soweto or go into the laager. However, that can only constitute a choice to those Afrikaner Nationalists, including the Cabinet, who are prepared to put their own interests ahead of that of the country as a whole. Let me put it plainly. This country can never afford another three years without growth, but the situation is actually much graver than that. We not only need foreign capital, because one cannot have growth without that; we have first to repay the debt we presently owe to our overseas creditors. There is a maxim in business which one ignores at one&#x2019;s peril, i.e. &#x201C;never borrow short to invest long&#x201D;. That is the way to bankruptcy. We are in that position, if indeed we can borrow at all at the present time. Let those members who sit in the frontbench opposite say what they will. Unless a change comes and unless we solve the problem of Soweto, we are not going to get the money, and every South African should contemplate the implications of that, both for themselves as individuals and for all of us as a whole.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I stand up to be counted amongst those South Africans who are very concerned about the situation in our country as it is being managed by the Government opposite. Other speakers on this side of the House have, during the course of this debate, identified the problematic areas causing us concern. They have identified the international situation, the racial situation and the economic situation. I propose, in the time available to me, to devote myself to comments on the economic situation, and I am glad that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is in his seat, although I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Finance is not present. I am very concerned about the economic situation in South Africa, not only in that it presents a problem in itself, but also&#x2014;as other speakers have said, and particularly as it was so ably put by my hon. leader&#x2014;because the interaction between the economic problem and the other problems facing us is a real interaction. Unless we have a strong economy, we do not have the basis for solving our other problems, particularly our racial problems.</p>

<p>I should like to say at this early juncture that to my mind there is no doubt whatsoever that the reasons for the poor state of our economy lie primarily in mismanagement by the Government. In the course of what I have to say I shall give examples of what I mean by mismanagement. Secondly, there is the slavish following of apartheid policies which has lowered the productivity of our country, in terms of which we have failed to use the resources which we have available in our country, which has been the cause of racial friction in our country, which has certainly been the cause of the world-wide unpopularity of our country, which has affected our trade, our financial standing and our ability to borrow abroad and, more important, which has been a big contributory factor to the third reason for the poor state of our economy. <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_0156"/>Here I am referring to the profligacy of spending which has taken place under this Government over the past years.</p>

<p>I should like to ask hon. members on the other side how one can describe the economy as being in anything but a poor shape when, in the first place, inflation continues well into double figures, a level at which it has been now for more than three years. I can remember the time when members on that side of the House&#x2014;inflation was then at a much lower level&#x2014;used to say that it was an imported commodity. We now number among the nations who have the highest rate of inflation in the world. We are now exporting our inflation. Inflation is causing immense hardship to the lower income groups, the pensioners and people on fixed income. The hardship they are experiencing is becoming increasingly intense. Inflation is causing our whole economic structure to become distorted. It is causing loss of confidence on the part of businessmen. It is also discouraging savings&#x2014;people do not have the incentive or ability to save. Furthermore it is changing our whole investment pattern so that, instead of investment money going where it should go to increase our productive capacity, it is going into other channels. This is becoming more and more a cumulative state of affairs.</p>

<p>We have had an anti-inflation manifesto in operation now for more than 15 months. That manifesto contains many of the correct ingredients for fighting inflation, but what hope of success has it when the Government comes along first of all with a huge devaluation of the rand&#x2014;that was in September 1975&#x2014; which pushed up the price of our imports by more than 20% and, secondly, when it comes along with a long series of increases in administered prices, prices of important commodities. When those prices go up, it does not merely have a rippling effect throughout the economy, but it acts almost like a tidal wave.</p>

</speech><speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Are you suggesting that the prices of administered commodities should not be increased&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall get to that. I am referring to commodities such as coal, steel, electricity, sugar, bread and milk. We are again threatened with the ridiculous situation of an increase in the price of butter and cheese while we have a surplus of those commodities. I simply fail to understand how one can contemplate putting prices up to get rid of surplus stocks. More recently still we have had a vicious increase in the price of petrol, an increase which is estimated to affect the cost of living by a full 1%. I maintain that the Government should be doing everything in its power to keep prices down, not to push prices up.</p>

<p>Yet, the Government puts an impost of two cents per litre on the price of petrol to finance Sasol II. It was not forced to do this. It did so voluntarily, thus making today&#x2019;s hard-pressed consumers of petrol subsidize tomorrow&#x2019;s consumers. It gives a substantial increase in the gross profit margin to petrol stations. I do not begrudge petrol stations that increased margin for one minute. What I do criticize is that the Government continues to smother competition between petrol stations by preventing them from cutting prices. I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that, if price cutting of petrol were allowed it would take place and would go quite a long way to counteract the harsh effect of the recent increase in the price of petrol.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, how can one describe the economy as being in anything but a poor shape when the balance of payments continues to cause concern, and how can it be otherwise when our reserves of foreign exchange are insufficient to cover five weeks&#x2019; imports and net invisible payments&#x003F; Even if the gold content of our foreign exchange reserves were to be valued in relation to the present market value of gold, those reserves would barely cover two months&#x2019; imports and invisibles. How can it be otherwise when we are still heavily dependent on a capital inflow to pay for our imports, a capital inflow which, as the hon. member for Johannesburg North has just pointed out, is becoming more and more difficult to obtain and is even then only being obtained on a shorter and shorter term basis and at a higher and higher cost&#x003F;</p>

<p>Most serious of all, how can one describe our economy as being in anything but a poor shape when it continues to slow down, when it continues to shrink&#x003F; The South African Reserve Bank in its latest quarterly bulletin anticipates that 1976 will be the second consecutive year in which the economy, as <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0157"/>measured by the gross national product, has shrunk. I maintain that the gross national product is the measure one should use in determining the growth or shrinkage of one&#x2019;s economy because it is the measure of what is available to sustain standards of living. To me this represents a critical situation.</p>

<p>We are getting further and further away from the economic development programme growth rate of 5,75% for 1977 which was estimated as being the growth rate required to absorb our growing labour forces. In fact, we are accumulating a sizeable backlog as far as our growth is concerned. A rate of very much more than 5,75% will be necessary if we are to catch up, and that, to my way of thinking, makes a complete mockery of the economic development programme because under present circumstances it is unthinkable that in the foreseeable future we will be able to improve on the rate of 5,75% in order to catch up that growth. Put in other words, this means that unemployment is increasing and is doing so in a cumulative way. This is already reflected in such figures as are available for unemployment, figures which, as the House knows, cover only Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics. Those are the only figures which are available from the Department of Statistics. Those figures have trebled since 1974. Although there are no figures available for Black unemployment, all the evidence, all the surveys that have been made on the subject of Black unemployment at present, point to a serious situation: Unemployment under the Blacks is numbered not in tens of thousands but at least in hundreds of thousands and possibly in seven figures. All this leads to a situation of lower living standards for the average South African, a smaller per capita real income. It leads to a position where many, and a growing number, are experiencing real poverty. When one has a situation of growing poverty, of growing unemployment, of unfulfilled expectations, one inevitably also has a situation of unrest and one has all the ingredients present for social and political disorder.</p>

<p>I find it quite tragic that in a country such as ours, a country which is so richly endowed with natural resources and the resources of production, and with skilled or potentially skilled people, we should find ourselves in this plight of deliberately having to underutilize the majority of those resources. Take for instance the position of housing. In the urban areas there is still the need for considerably more housing than we have at present, particularly for the Coloureds and the Blacks. We have available the labour, much of which is unemployed; we have the cement, the bricks, the sand, the stone, the timber, the hardware, the roofing&#x2014;in fact, we have all the components to build houses readily available, but we are not doing so because of the Government&#x2019;s past excesses and the need to slow down the economy. We have to do without this badly needed housing and in the process of going without it, we are exacerbating our social, political and racial problems. That is not the way to wealth; it is not the way to happiness. But that is the position which exists and, as I have said before, it has been brought about by mismanagement by the Government, by the extravagant waste of resources entailed in apartheid and by the extreme profligacy of Government spending and its use of scarce resources.</p>

<p>I do not question for one minute that South Africa could have avoided some degree of recession. Cyclical forces have been at work and the trade cycle is in a downward swing. We have an open economy and cannot insulate ourselves completely from what has been happening in the economies of our trading partners who have also been suffering recession. I do believe, however, and I believe very, very sincerely, that the intensity and the length of our recession have been and are still being greatly increased, firstly because, over a long period, the Government has allowed State expenditure to rise much more rapidly than the production of the country as measured by the gross domestic product. This particularly happened during the three years from June 1973 to June 1976 when Exchequer issues nearly doubled while the GDP went up by only 50%, and there was a real spending orgy. It is only recently that cutbacks in expenditure have been introduced.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this House adjourned last night I had started to make the point that, in my view, the intensity and the length of the present recession in this country were being greatly increased, firstly because the Government had allowed State expenditure to rise at a much higher rate than the GDP had risen over the last few years. Secondly, it had happened because it was State expenditure during 1975 and the first half of 1976 which was giving buoyancy to the economy, but which was at the same time stoking up inflation, whilst increasing the balance of payments problem, when the Government should have realized the fact at that stage that recessionary influences were at work, and should have started to pull in its horns. The third reason for this was because much of the excess expenditure to which I have referred, was paid for by deficit financing, in other words, by printing money and by increasing the money supply which, of course, was a highly inflationary practice which added to the rate of inflation. Fourthly, it happened because of stop-go practices, which did great damage to business confidence in the business world.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask this House how businessmen can be expected to have confidence when, in the second quarter of 1976, the money supply was allowed to expand by 18%&#x003F; But then the expansion of the same money supply was cut back to 2% in the following quarter. One simply cannot play yo-yo with the economy; not in that way. This is the sort of thing that leads to bankruptcies. Business confidence is a fragile commodity, and if it is cracked, it takes a long time to be restored.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that what I have said to this House adds up to a very serious economic situation, one that can be repaired only gradually, and one where the path to reparation is going to be a hard and a difficult one. I say this because recovery is going to involve changes in the whole Government philosophy, the whole Government ideology. It will require the abandonment of apartheid, the burial of apartheid. [Interjections.] There is no going back to the good old days. It is going to involve a fundamental change in the pattern of State spending so that State spending no longer takes a larger and larger slice of the cake and the private sector is allowed to grow faster than the public sector. It is going to involve a complete reassessment by the Government of its spending priorities with much more emphasis being put on labour intensive ventures, thus helping to create jobs, thus helping to relieve the unemployment position, thus helping to relieve the pressure of capital so that capital can become more and more available to the private sector where it can be more productively used and can increase the productivity of the country as a whole. Finally, I should like to say that I fully support the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I have no confidence in the Government. [Interjections.] I have no confidence in it because it has allowed the economic situation to develop into one of economic sickness when what is required is economic health, economic <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0159"/>strength and economic vitality to provide the foundation for social reform. I ask the House how the Black population can be expected to believe in a private enterprise system which, after all, is the epitome of a democratic system when that system, as it is managed by this Government, is subjecting them to ever-increasing prices, to a prolonged and severe recession and to all the miseries that are attached to unemployment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I came this House in 1961, I received a note from the late Dr. Eric Louw in which he congratulated me and gave me some advice. He advised me, amongst other things, to choose certain subjects and to make a study of them, and he went on to say that he advised me to steer clear of matters concerning the relations between Whites and non-Whites, because there were enough experts and clever people in the House who could speak on this subject. I do not know whether Dr. Louw thought I was not competent to discuss it. In any event, I followed his advice, and to this day I have seldom if ever made any reference in this House to the relations between Whites and non-Whites. However, I feel a need to deal with this subject today, because there are certain things which are bothering me. I am not referring to what is happening within the NP and the Government, I am not referring to the policy of the NP, but to the fact that some confusion has arised in the minds of the people of South Africa, including the people of my own party, as a result of the slogans and actions of our enemies. In saying this, I am not referring only to our political enemies on the other side of this House, but also to our enemies outside, of which communism is the most dangerous of all. People have been clamouring for change in this country, without ever having defined what the word means. Indeed, there is widespread confusion today about what &#x201C;change&#x201D; really means and about what the objectives should be when people say that change is at hand. I should like to refer briefly to my predecessor, Mr. Ben Schoeman, about whom an article was recently published in <i>Rapport.</i> According to the article, he gave a shrewd exposition of the matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Politieke gelykheid vir Wit en Swart sal tot die ondergang van die Blanke lei. Oor verandering s&#x00EA; hy: Dit moet gedefinieer word. Vir die linkse liberalis is dit niks anders as volle politieke regte vir die Nie-blanke nie; vir die NP is dit weer niks anders as die ontplooiing van sy beleid nie.</block>

<p>For this reason I feel a need today to discuss this matter and the speakers who took part in the debate before me will understand that I am not disposed to reply to their arguments. All the same, I should like to reply briefly to the speech made by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. He spoke of the shortage of loan funds from abroad and he considered this to be a matter of major importance. He and his spiritual associates are acquainted with a man called Zac de Beer. He is one of their spiritual associates.</p>

In the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 12 November last year, the following report appeared under the heading &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t invest in South Africa&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville wants to make excuses for him now and to say that he did not put it that way. If that is so, then the <i>Financial Mail</i> is lying. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I shall leave it at that, but this is the kind of problem which we have to contend with inside the country in respect of our political opponents. This is one of the reasons why South Africa is not achieving the success we should like it to achieve.</p>

<p>To come back to the subject of my speech, I should like to say that my basic approach to the political problems in South Africa is that the White man&#x2019;s right to political self-determination must never ben endangered. This is the basis of my political philosophy. In that connection I cannot quite agree with the hon. member for Maitland. He often speaks of &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;. I cannot quite agree with that. I do not want to dwell on this matter, but I just want to say briefly that your leadership lasts as long as the people you are leading are willing to keep you there.</p>

<p>For that reason I cannot give my support to the philosophy of White leadership. I prefer to say that the basis of my approach is that the White man&#x2019;s right to political self-determination must never be endangered. Sir, I am not the only one who has made this statement. It has been made by the hon. member for Edenvale as well. At the time when we had a commission of inquiry into the political rights of the Coloured people, he submitted a memorandum to the commission. One of the statements he made in it was the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die vraagstuk welke plek die Kleurlingbevolking behoort te beklee in die politieke raamwerk van Suid-Afrika en watter rol hulle in ons politieke lewe behoort te speel, hou myns insiens verband met die volgende faktore:</block>

<p>Then, as the very first factor, he mentions the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die noodsaaklikheid daarvan dat die politieke selfbeskikkingsreg van die Blankebevolking nie in gevaar gestel moet word nie.</block>

<p>I do not know whether this opinion is still held by the hon. member today. This was before he became a member of this House. He went on to say in his submission that there should be no discrimination on grounds of race or colour. I subsequently asked him a question in connection with this matter, because it seemed to me to be inconsistent to say that on the one hand the White man&#x2019;s right to political self-determination must be retained, but that at the same time there must be no discrimination on grounds of race or colour. I wanted to know from the hon. member how he could reconcile these two ideas. The hon. member replied as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is &#x2019;n baie goeie vraag, mnr. die Voorsitter.</block>

<p>I should like to read what he said on this occasion, for it has a very important bearing on the approach to the problem. He said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Ek het die woord &#x201E;Blanke&#x201D; gebruik hier omdat die Blanke ontwikkel het tot &#x2019;n eie nasionale organisme. Dit is daarom. Dit is insidenteel dat dit Blankes is. As daar enige ander groep was in Suid-Afrika wat in &#x2019;n vergelykbare posisie was as die Blankes wat hierdie politieke mag in die hande het en wat as nasionale organisme ontwikkel het hier in Suid-Afrika, dan sou hy in presies dieselfde situasie wees. Nou het ek toevallig die voorreg om lid te wees <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0161"/>van daardie nasionale organisme. In die lig van die geskiedenis van daardie organisme, hoe hy gegroei het en ontwikkel het in stryd, dan volg dit eintlik vanselfsprekend, want my uitgangspunt is dat ek nie bereid is om daardie organisme hier te sien ondergaan nie. Met ander woorde, ek het die woord &#x201E;Blanke&#x201D; gebruik met verwysing na die feit dat dit &#x2019;n nasionale organisme is wat in Suid-Afrika bestaan. Dat die Blanke &#x2019;n nasionale organisme is, betwyfel ek nie in my eie gemoed nie. Dat die Bantoe &#x2026;</block>

<p>This part is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in sy etniese verb&#x00E4;nde vir die grootste gedeelte op die oomblik nog nasionale organismes is, betwyfel ek ook nie. Ek verduidelik net die vraag. Die waarskynlike kontradiksie waarop hier gewys is, is volkome korrek.</block>

<p>I have read this part to the House, because it seems that the hon. member is one of the advocates today of those people who are seeking co-operation with the PRP. I agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s idea to a large extent, except that I am more realistic than to say that in spite of this there must be no discrimination on grounds of race and colour. I should just like to know how these ideas of the hon. member can be reconciled with the policy of the PRP. The hon. member for Houghton has conceded herself that she said that the result of her policy would be Black majority government. I have no action against majority government, but if someone tells me that he is in favour of Black majority government then I say he is a racist. Why does it have to be &#x201C;Black&#x201D; majority government&#x003F; Why can&#x2019;t it be simply &#x201C;majority&#x201D; government&#x003F; I am concerned about the situation, and this is why I am raising the matter here today. The idea that there is no alternative to Black majority government is rapidly gaining ground among the people in South Africa. The idea is propagated by the English Press, especially by newspapers such as the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Sunday Times.</i> This is why letters such as the one I am now going to read to this House are published in newspapers. This letter was recently published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> under the heading &#x201C;Change only a foot away&#x201D;, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The handwriting is) on the wall. The apartheid experiment has one foot in the grave and the other is poised to join it. Black majority rule is inevitable in South Africa as sure and logical as night follows day. The Afrikaner Nationalist must willy-nilly reconcile himself with the inevitable and must now set about energetically in preparing South Africa for it, perpetuating the capitalistic system and democratic government.</block>

<p>I do not know who he is. He cannot be anything but a Prog, but it is in consequence of that idea that I feel the urge today to discuss the matter. As I have already said, I basically agree with what Prof. Olivier said a few years ago, as quoted. However, I want to be more realistic and to say that we cannot continue the implementation of our policy without a measure of discrimination, discrimination in either direction and not necessarily in one direction only. As far as our Bantu policy is concerned, we are providing exactly what Prof. Olivier suggested here in his speech before the commission, namely the right to political self-determination, not only for the White man, but also with special reference to the Bantu population group in an ethnic context, as he put it. We have come a long way on that road and as far as the Bantu are concerned, it is a road which can enable us to eliminate discrimination to a large extent, and which is in fact doing so. I want to place on record today what Dr. Verwoerd told me in 1939 when we were holding a provincial election in Worcester. After the meeting we gathered in the house of Mr. P. A. Malan. There the late Dr. Verwoerd said in a conversation with me: &#x201C;Never before have I realized so clearly that our policy will lead to the elimination of discrimination. &#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am sorry. That is really too long ago! It was 1959. This is quite true, for we have come a long way with this policy, and last year, the very year in which we reached the culmination, the milestone, in the development of the policy of the development of separate freedoms, that we had the problems we did. Do hon. members think it was a coincidence that we had the riots during that same year&#x003F; Certainly not. It was part of a well-organized plan. During that year, when my colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, reached this milestone, for which South Africa should erect a monument to him, the enemies of South Africa tried more actively than before to hinder us in the implementation of a policy for which the Government has a mandate from the people. Of course, it suits the communists very well for us to be thwarted in the implementation of that policy. It is also the desire of the PRP as well as the Opposition that we should be thwarted in the implementation of that policy. Let me say to the credit of the PRP that they have already stated that they will not deprive the various Bantu peoples of the freedom they are being given. However, the UP has not said so yet. That party is still fighting us and has still not given any indication of where it would stand if it were to come into power one day.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the fact that the whole world is going through a difficult time, and South Africa has probably become the target of more communist attacks than any other country in the world. We are in fact living through a third world war, and I should like to refer hon. members to an article by Brian Crozier in <i>Conflict Studies</i> under the heading: &#x201C;The War called Peace.&#x201D; In it he writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The point of departure is that the third world war has been in progress for a long time, more precisely since April 1944.</block>

<p>He writes as follows about the date of April 1944&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This precise dating, which I accept, occurs in the first sentence of James Burnham&#x2019;s <i>The Struggle for the World,</i> 1947. It refers to the communist-led mutiny in the Greek Navy in Alexandria harbour.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s assertion that the third world war is being lost by the non-communist side is, however, not accepted. If it were, there would be little point in publishing this study.</block>

<p>I agree with that, but there is no doubt about the fact that we are indeed living in serious times. The charge which I bring against the Opposition, not only against the UP, but against the PRP as well, is that we are not afforded the opportunity in South Africa of implementing the will of the people. During the war, when the decisions of Parliament and, after the 1943 election, the will of the people were thwarted, people were put in jail and sent to concentration camps. Today, however, we have people in South Africa who enjoy the freedom to do everything they can, in spite of the dangerous position in which we find ourselves, to thwart that injunction from the people to implement a policy for the sake of peace in South Africa.</p>

<p>Last year I was quoted here by the hon. member for Newton Park as having said that as the gap between the levels of civilization of the various population groups was narrowed, it would become less essential to have apartheid, or call it discrimination if you like. I said that, and there is not the slightest doubt about it. However, I do not have time now to go into that. At the end of the Second World War, apartheid became essential. Because the various population groups had grown closer together economically apartheid became necessary to eliminate points of friction. Previously they had been far apart in spite of differences in the levels of civilization. As far as the Coloured people are concerned, now that they have attained a higher level of civilization, apartheid has naturally become less essential. Consequently, the necessary adjustments are made by this Government from time to time as they are required in the changed circumstances.</p>

<p>Therefore I say that we are not against change. However, I am against the use of this word &#x201C;change&#x201D; to mislead our people and to place them on a slippery slope down which <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0163"/>they slide at such a pace that they do not know where they might end up. I have said that I am sick and tired of the word &#x201C;change&#x201D;, precisely because of the reasons I have just mentioned. Recently, at a meeting at Despatch, I went so far as to say that it was a communist slogan. I want to refer once again to this article by Brian Crozier. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand, it is essential to add that nearly all the revolutionary changes recorded in the maps may be traced back to Karl Marx&#x2019;s injunction to philosophers to &#x201C;change the world&#x201D; or to the Leninist duty of all communists to educate and make propaganda in all countries.</block>

<p>That is what they are engaged in, and that is what I object to. [Interjections.] Therefore I consider it my task to warn the people. For years, a feeling of guilt has been instilled into the people of South Africa. Another thing which bothers me is the fact that there are people who are seeking confrontation. Our State President said in his opening address that unfortunately there were people in South Africa who believed that the Government should be overthrown, by violent means if possible, and that this was the only way of obtaining true political rights. But those people who are seeking confrontation are here, and the hon. member for Sea Point cannot escape censure. He is the man who has a close association with Gatsha Buthelezi. He and his lieutenants are the people who write his speeches and who tell him what to say. How does he identify himself with these words of his friend, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Afrikanerdom and Afrikaans culture was not likely to survive in South Africa&#x201D;, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi said here last night.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The future is a Black future and we Blacks want our future to begin now. We know there will be Whites in the future, but they will not be the determinants and the oppressors. They will be liberated Whites adapting to the Black man&#x2019;s world in a Black self-conscious continent.</block>

<p>Can he identify himself with those words of the people with whom he is constantly associating and co-operating&#x003F; What did he say at his congress in Port Elizabeth&#x003F; According to <i>The Daily Mail</i> he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore it was important to look at the nature of the South African society. The Whites had effective political power, wealth, lived in security and were treated with dignity, whilst the Blacks had none.</block>

<p>If these were his words, I say that this was a lie. This is not true. It is a complete misrepresentation and is aimed at encouraging confrontation in South Africa, if this can possibly be brought about by means of words. I should like to refer him to the words of Bishop Burnett, another spiritual associate of his. He passed the judgment of God upon South Africa because we practise apartheid. I do not have time to read it in full, but he said, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe we are seeing in the present turmoil the judgment of God on this policy, the policy of apartheid.</block>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Unless White Christians, in particular, admit the wrongs they have done to Black people and take action to redress them, there can be no possibility of healing in our land.</block>

<p>He is the man who passes the judgment of God upon South Africa because we want to seek peace within the various population groups, because we have had peace and quiet for 28 years. For this reason I say that we must be clear about the aims of the people who predict disaster and clamour for so-called &#x201C;change&#x201D;, and about what they consider this to mean, because it is causing confusion.</p>

<p>I have only a few minutes left. It would be quite fair to ask me: what about the future&#x003F; Where do we go from here&#x003F; If I may give a frank reply to that, I want to say that in the <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0164"/>future we must implement and develop the policy of the NP more vigorously than ever before. That is what the welfare of South Africa requires. We have come a long way already. As far as the Bantu are concerned, we must give them their freedom if they ask for it and if they are willing to accept it. In this way, the Transkei achieved its independence last year without one drop of blood being shed. Merely by signing a few documents, we brought about freedom and peace in the Transkei, and we must continue along that road as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>What about the Coloured people&#x003F; It is true that the end of the road for the Coloured people has not been clearly defined yet, but the Coloured people have come a long way already. We learn from figures in the Erika Theron report that in the post-war period of economic prosperity, the Coloured population group made greater progress and received greater benefits than any other population group in South Africa. Did this happen under the UP regime or under the NP regime&#x003F; Politically, the Coloured people have made tremendous progress. However, do not think we shall be able to satisfy Mr. Sonny Leon. We shall never be able to satisfy extremists. We shall have to decide where to draw the line. We have to make the adjustments within the framework of NP policy and in accordance with the change in circumstances from day to day. But we shall never be able to comply with the wishes of the extremists. For this reason I say to the Coloured population, to those who are reasonable and willing to meet us around a table and to speak to us, &#x201C;Have patience for a while. You have already come a long way, after all. You have made great progress.&#x201D; They used to do only menial jobs. Today, walking down Adderley Street round about 4 o&#x2019;clock or 5 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, one sees many well-dressed Coloured ladies and men walk past. They earn good salaries. In the courts one finds them as attorneys and advocates. Ten or 15 years ago this was not so. In the hospitals one finds them as doctors and in the universities as lecturers and professors. This progress they have made under the NP regime. Those opportunities have been created under the NP policy.</p>

<p>Sir, my time has expired. When I go to bed tonight, my prayer will be that the outside world, and especially White South Africa, should afford us an opportunity to implement the NP policy, for the welfare of all the population groups of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was interested to hear the hon. the Minister speak of the confusion in which he finds the South African public, as also of the fears and the dangers which many of them perceive. I was interested to hear him speak of the right of White self-determination, because these are matters which I myself wish to discuss today. I was also interested to hear the hon. the Minister admit that separate development could not succeed without a certain measure of discrimination being prevalent. In that admission which he has placed before us lies the seed of the failure of the policy of separate development. All in all I would say to that hon. Minister that I think he should stick to transport. He spoke of the rights and the wrongs of his policy.</p>

<p>I believe that there are, broadly, two ways in which an Opposition speaker can tackle a debate such as this. Both ways are compatible yet different. The first method is to discuss the rights and the wrongs of separate development, to approach this debate, which is irrevocably centred round racial affairs, from a moralistic point of view, criticizing the Government&#x2019;s actions, and its lack of action, on behalf of those who have no voice. Such pleas are powerful; they are powerful in their rectitude, but in my limited experience in this House they cut little ice in this earthy atmosphere. We represent an electorate, however, an electorate of South Africans, the vast majority of whom, like myself, have long since decided that their future and their fortunes are immutably bound up with the future of this Republic.</p>

<p>*As the hon. member for Rondebosch often puts it, there are those who stay and those who leave. Let us discuss for a few minutes our deep concern, of those of us who stay, at the problems confronting us.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The first question to which we would like to have an answer is this: Can this Government, powerful as it is, provide the road to a secure, a prosperous, a racially contented South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<from><span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0165"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I say that it cannot. And why do I say this&#x003F; Let me explain. In the first instance, with regard to the homelands which are lacking mutually satisfactory consolidation, land-hungry and the poor relations of this rich Republic: I predict that they will prove in years to come to be uneasy bedfellows. They will provide no balm at all for the legitimate aspirations of the vast majority of the non-White people in this country. Furthermore, this Government stands in deliberate and seemingly unending confrontation with the majority of Black Africans outside the homelands. As a result of this, the very basis of our existence is threatened. I would ask: Is that statement disputed, that the Government stands in confrontation with the vast majority of Black people in South Africa&#x003F; Because, if it is disputed, let me quote for your ears Dr. C. van der Pol, chairman of the Hulett Corporation, in his opening address a few days ago to the South African Institute of Race Relations. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our Black man rejects the free enterprise system because in his view it is only for the rich, the Whites.</block>

<p>He goes on to define what he thinks is free enterprise. Let me paraphrase his words and add a few words of my own. Free enterprise is the opportunity to obtain an equal education; the freedom to choose a profession or a trade; the freedom to sell your labour in the highest market; to spend, to invest, to buy and sell, to lose or to gain; the freedom to buy and own land; the freedom to set up your own business, trade or industry; the freedom to create work opportunities by employing other people, to live with one&#x2019;s family near to one&#x2019;s work; the freedom to manufacture products; and the freedom to bargain collectively, or otherwise for better working conditions. Finally, it involves the freedom to express political views and influence in the area where it matters, the area where one lives.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, how does this Government&#x2019;s policy measure up to those criteria&#x003F; Dr. Van der Pol&#x2014;and I quote him again&#x2014; puts it this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not suggest that these townships are full of people who take their orders from Maputo or Luanda. No, our Black townships are full of people who see no hope of ever being allowed to compete for their share of the wealth of the nation on equal terms, who are prepared to use violence and revolution to destroy a system in which there appears to be no place for them.</block>

<p>Now, if this is true and if Dr. Van der Pol&#x2019;s assertion is correct, the problem is fast approaching critical proportions. And yet, Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. the Minister of Defence when he said the other day: &#x201C;Ons is &#x2019;n volk wat nie wil sterf nie.&#x201D; I agree with the hon. the Minister of the Interior, when he said: &#x201C;We refuse to commit national suicide.&#x201D; I agree with the hon. member for Pretoria Central when he expressed his conviction that he could not support a viewpoint which provided no security for Whites in South Africa. But I ask hon. members whether this continuing impasse is not leading to an inevitable breakdown of our security, step by step nearer to that confrontation which will, in the long term, lead to the very national suicide which the hon. the Minister of the Interior cannot now contemplate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging asserts that the policy of separate development is the policy of freedom. He asserts that. But, Mr. Speaker, my question is: What use is his conception of freedom in a country in which the individual, the citizen, is becoming less free every day, in a country which has so vast an array of security legislation, of restrictive laws in operation that it is described by Prof. W. H. V. Dean, professor of public law at the University of Cape Town, as being a country in a permanent state of emergency&#x003F; How is it possible in a country where, for example, laws govern where a person may or may not swim, in which laws govern with whom we may or may not go to school or university, in which laws govern which theatres we may or may not visit, what books we may read, what areas we may reside in, whom we may love and whom we may marry, what seats we may sit in and where we may not sit&#x003F; What is the result of this&#x003F; What is the end result of this form of society&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let me ask that hon. member for Vereeniging who spoke of the policy of freedom: If he could not acquire a full education, if he could not freely choose his place and type of work, if he were paid a racially differentiated wage <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0166"/>for the work he did, if he&#x2014;being married&#x2014; could not own, or even perhaps occupy, a house, if he, for the major portion of his life, could not live with his wife or children, and finally, if he had no forum to which he could address his grievances, would he say that he was free&#x003F; That is what I want to ask the hon. member for Vereeniging. Or, would he meekly submit&#x003F; Or would he reject that system, that system which Dr. Van der Pol says many people in South Africa are rejecting&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am sure that we know the answer to that question.</p>

<p>What then must be done&#x003F; The hon. member for Sea Point has for the short term given a lead. He mentioned three points, three urgent matters, the implementation of which will contribute to our greater security. He said, firtly, that we should satisfy the legitimate land requirements of the homelands. He said that if we are serious about the policy of Bantustans and separate development, we must consolidate and satisfy the reasonable requirements of those countries in order to make them viable and want to take independence. He said, secondly, that we must recognize the urban Black man as permanent in the urban areas, and all that flows from this. He said, thirdly, that we must bring the Coloureds into the main stream of the South African economy and the main stream of our body politic. I do not believe these are final answers, but they are the beginnings of a plan which will do far more for the long-term preservation of our identity than all the security laws and restrictive laws that are on the Statute Book and will yet be placed upon it.</p>

<p>The final answer lies not in any White-devised policy&#x2014;not the Government&#x2019;s and perhaps not even ours. It will arise from a proper negotiation; not a consultation, but a negotiation, a joint decision-making, a real negotiation and not one based on <i>ad hoc</i> reactions and decisions. We may call it a conference or a &#x201C;Turnhalle&#x201D;, a getting together. It is there, at such a negotiation that an agreed solution may be found, not dictated, but jointly decided. It is only there and in such a manner that the free enterprise system may be preserved, no doubt by agreeing to share, because if we cannot share the benefits of free enterprise, we will not save it for ourselves. The hon. the Deputy Minister was very derisive about negotiation with, for instance, Sonny Leon and Gatsha Buthelezi. However, I say to him that if he refuses to negotiate with these people, he will in time, and sooner than he thinks, be forced to negotiate with the Mugabes of Africa, with the voices of darkness and of terror. No convention or conference can succeed if one group dictates who the delegates to that convention shall be. If we wish to achieve consensus which will result in a new order, free of subversion and conflict, it must be made possible for those nominated or selected by their people to be there and to be heard, whatever those persons&#x2019; situation may be at the time. Finally, I must point out that only by invoking fast short-term action and by embarking upon a long-term programme of real negotiation can the identity and the security of all our people be assured.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have followed the debate up to this point and, like others, I have also observed the inherent and fundamental divisions which exist between the various Opposition groups. The general and overall impression that they make on one is that it is really tragic for South Africa to have to experience the fact that there is nothing in the benches on the opposite side which can serve as an alternative to the NP. In general, Sir, I want to make the observation that this makes the responsibility of the National Party very great in the sense that it has to depend on its own abilities, its own ideas and its own vision to lead South Africa alone in a difficult world. Were the hon. members on the opposite side and what they propagate for South Africa to become a reality, we would find that South Africa was moving along the path of a Marxist dictatorship. We shall have to understand this.</p>

<p>I listened to the speech made by the hon. member for Hillbrow. He is not present here this afternoon but he lays claim to academic qualifications and it is said that he could even obtain, or is considering, a post at an educational institution. I want to give him some very good advice, Sir, which is, that it would be a good thing, whenever one draws conclusions or makes statements in the House, at least to co-ordinate and control the facts on which one bases one&#x2019;s conclusions. I do not want to dwell on his speech. He <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0167"/>accused the Prime Minister of supposedly having read businessmen a lecture and of having warned them against meddling in politics. I made a point of asking him whether he based his view on a newspaper report or whether he had read the speech. I am under the impression that he said he had read the speech. What did the hon. the Prime Minister actually say in that specific regard&#x003F; He began his speech and then made certain statements. Then he said: &#x201C;Flowing from the appreciation of the close links between economics and politics, it falls entirely within the legitimate activities of business organizations, as I have already said, to comment on the political developments in the country as far as these will impinge on the functioning of the economy&#x201D;. Surely the Prime Minister in fact identified that as the task of the businessmen&#x003F; When political events or policy standpoints have an effect on economic life and its progress, businessmen would be shirking their responsibility if they did not speak out or act against them. He then went further and warned them about something else.</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the hon. member for Constantia. Let me say at once that I cannot fault the factual analysis which he made of the course of our economy. I myself do not have any fault to find with certain conclusions which he came to, although I want to say at once that he did not have all the facts at his disposal. I am not reproaching him for this because they have not yet been published. If I compliment him on his factual analysis of the economic conditions in the country, I cannot pay him the same compliment with respect to his identification of their causes. I want to tell him that his superficial analysis of the causes is in direct contrast to the other analysis which he made. The fact is that the course of the economy in South Africa, for that matter the course of the economy in any other country in the world, is not just the result of internal events but is often the result of events in other countries, in the world at large with which countries are associated. What is more: The course of the economy is not only dependent on internal and external economic events. It is also dependent on political events in other countries of the world, on political considerations. The progress of our economy is intensely dependent on, and is intensely influenced by, the political aspirations and political ideologies of great powers. I now want to know in all seriousness whether the hon. members want us to bring the dispensation in our country into line with what those countries that are advocating change for us want&#x003F; Are the hon. members on that side of the House prepared to formulate the scope and direction of that change as their policy for South Africa&#x003F; I do not deny that injustices do occur in my country and I do not deny that there is fallibility because it comprises a diversity of people with specific prejudices in their lives. We cannot deny this fact. I am frequently of the opinion that South Africa needs a change of heart, of attitude and of patriots, in the face of what is threatening it in every sphere outside. Of course the interdependence of political events, both at home and abroad, and the course of economic life, is a well-known fact. To make out, as the hon. members on that side of the House are trying to do, that our economic problems in South Africa are attributable solely to the policy which is followed here, is a mistake, a mistake which, in the light of the seriousness of the situation for our country and for the world, cannot be tolerated. It would be as much of a mistake if I or others were to allege that our political problems must be attributed solely to external factors. For this reason I plead for perspective and I want to issue the warning, for the sake of the motivation of our people, that we will to an increasing extent find evidence of people who will attempt, under various and frequently favourably defined guises&#x2014;and such attempts are indeed being made&#x2014;to persuade the general public, the businessmen and the non-White population groups to participate in a process of rejecting our Constitution and of destroying our existing political dispensation, with its weaknesses&#x2014;-I admit that there are in fact weaknesses&#x2014;of changing our socioeconomic system so as to replace it with one in which there is no question of freedom, and to replace it with the philosophy of the redistribution of wealth, wealth which is not earned but which is taken.</p>

<p>This must lead to the essence of the struggle against South Africa, namely the nationalization of profits, goods and properties&#x2014;which is in the final instance what is at issue in South Africa&#x2014;and the putting of a Marxist dictatorship in its place. This takes place under the slogan &#x201C;change&#x201D; without qualifying or quantifying the direction <span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_0168"/>of that change. It takes place under the slogan &#x201C;a new dispensation&#x201D; without defining that term, without saying what it means. In this way people whom I believe are patriotic become instruments of the forces that want to destroy us. I wish I had the time to carry this argument further but I want to ask the hon. members whether the time has not come for us at least to admit to each other that South Africa is the target, irrespective of the reasons, of an international strategy and that our only adequate reply to this lies in the acceptance of a national counter-strategy, which means not only that each one of us should do our duty in our respective spheres, but also that collectively we should motivate our people for such a strategy. I do not believe that the majority of South Africans, the Coloured people, the Indians, the Black people and the Whites are in favour of the destruction of these values. I do not believe that the majority of our people are in favour of forfeiting of our dispensation. But I shudder and I am astounded when I think how great the powers of resistance of the Black and Coloured people have to be under this assault on their spirit, an assault which is led by the agents of revolution and aided by the agents of change. I am not prepared to shirk my responsibility in this House by failing to acknowledge these facts, and by not attempting to analyse the circumstances in which my country finds itself.</p>

<p>It is not an exaggeration if I tell the hon. members that this debate is most probably taking place in one of the most difficult economic and political situations that South Africa and the world have yet experienced. I believe that in this connection hon. members will agree with me that it demands some concrete action from us. I think the circumstances of the times demand of the Government, of everyone in the benches on the other side, of the businessmen, of the professional and academic world in our country, of our economists&#x2014;in fact of our entire population&#x2014;that we consider our goals, that we reassess the means at our disposal; and that we reflect once more upon the political and economic strategies within the limits of our means. Hon. members will recall that my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, stated the Government&#x2019;s economic policy last year. What was the highest priority in this strategy&#x003F; The highest priority was an effective Defence Force for South Africa because we must realize that the Defence Force&#x2019;s responsibility also lies in ensuring the safety within which the economy must grow and within which confidence must exist among those people who have to make all these things possible.</p>

<p>The second element of the policy was that we must maintain our economic strength by improving our balance of payments and strengthening our reserves, by curbing inflation and maintaining growth, so that, within our means and circumstances we could tend to the welfare of the underprivileged. If we want to take a realistic look at the state of affairs today, however, in the light of events since March last year, what becomes clear to us&#x003F; It is this: Added momentum has been given to our country&#x2019;s defence priority. The hon. members will certainly not wish to debate this point with me.</p>

<p>Then there still remains the second objective of the policy and that is to strengthen our balance of payments so that it can support our growth as high priority. It is for this reason that the strengthening of our foreign reserves is just as important. And although the inflation rate&#x2014;and I shall refer to this later&#x2014; dropped considerably last year and more specifically during the last quarter of 1976, so that it is below <i>9%</i> per year, we still do not have reason to be pleased with it. I agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this connection.</p>

<p>Let us take a look now at the third objective, which is economic growth. I do not differ with the hon. member for Constantia when he says that we have been experiencing a declining business cycle for the past two years. Nor do I differ with him when he says that there is cause for grave concern at the fact that it was the most serious one since the Second World War. Nor do I differ with him with respect to his allegation that we are falling behind in the pursuit of our economic goals. The relationship between international political and economic circumstances is of real importance in this respect.</p>

<p>I want to mention two facets which are the result of the low growth rate in 1975 and 1976. Some hon. members have already referred to them. In the first place I am referring to the extent to which our compulsory increased spending on defence places an additional, a greater burden on us when it <span class="col_303-304" refersTo="page_0169"/>comes to the financing of our defence measures from the dwindling national product, from a dwindling national per capita income of the population. Secondly, there is the fact that we are having to deal with increasing unemployment in the country.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Hillbrow alleges that, according to his information, it costs R25 000 to obtain the statistics on unemployed Blacks. In the USA the costs involved in obtaining these statistics is the most expensive in the series. It costs them R4,5 million per year. Is the hon. member prepared to apply the international definition to Black labour&#x003F; Why, then, does he speak in the House in terms of statistical considerations in a society which is not comparable to the one to which he refers&#x003F; Do you know, Sir, what I reproach him for most&#x003F;</p>

Mr. Speaker, you will not allow me to describe my reaction, but you will certainly be able to interpret my thoughts. And when these things happen the hon. member is prepared, in the face of all these things, to occupy himself with such frivolous and superficial matters. I want him to consider reading the report of the International Finance Corporation. In the light of the serious consequences of a continued low growth rate, superficially minded people will argue that it is now an ideal set of conditions to stimulate growth. The hon. member for Constantia at least knows that what we are experiencing at the moment is a classic example of conflicting economic objectives. He will not be able to deny this.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am still coming to that. I want to make the observation that if that hon. member, like others, had been prepared to advocate that we strengthen our country by eliminating waste, that we should not blow the limited assets we have through the carburettors of our motor cars, he would have made a contribution towards the security of South Africa. The picture I want to paint is a sombre one; I concede that. The picture I want to paint is in my opinion, however, a realistic one. There are rays of hope, such as the increased exports which could improve our growth. There are business cycles in the world and we are part of the world. Besides this, special features are present. I have already referred to them. For example, there is the intensity of the depression and of the inability to adapt in good time to changing circumstances. There are some other important factors too, viz. the events on our borders and the events in Angola and Mozambique. Even the events in Rhodesia have an effect on economic life in South Africa. Surely it has had an effect on the flow of capital between countries, and therefore on South Africa as well. I want to ask that we should all understand that we cannot have a fourfold increase in our import accounts for oil, and that we cannot afford, together with defence spending which must, of necessity, rise and a shrinking national income, to allow all the other luxuries as well. Then I ask: Why are the hon. members not prepared to tread this difficult path with us and to inspire our people so that they can realize that while we must practise survival politics, it means that we will have to adjust our standard of living to the country&#x2019;s total means&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is another important point to which I want to refer. That is to attribute the fact that the capital flow to South Africa has diminished, that it has changed in terms of conditions, and that it has changed in terms of instalments, solely to South Africa. To attribute these things solely to our country is surely untrue. Surely countries from which we traditionally obtain our funds have also been affected in the long term by recession conditions, to such an extent that it is estimated that their total ability to form capital is now only 40% of their previous potential.</p>

<p>I have little time left. In closing, I want to say that I think it is necessary for all of us in this country to come to a new understanding of what happened here, that we should not superficially brush aside the problems to which I have referred by simply placing the blame for them on the Government. I am prepared to help bear the blame. Sir, let us have our political differences. Let us have our differing points of departure on what is or is <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0170"/>not good for our country, even on a variety of political matters. But I am simply asking whether South Africa&#x2019;s interests do not demand at this stage that that politicking there on the other side amongst each other and against us, to come to an end. Can we not, in these times, at least stand together to motivate our people for the difficult times and tasks which lie ahead for us&#x003F; I think that, in view of the course of historic events, in view of our experience, those hon. members should cease their flights of fancy about political dispensations which will have no viability in the complex composition of South Africa&#x2019;s population. I want to ask the hon. member for Hillbrow whether there is apartheid in Angola. I want to ask him whether the winds of change which were to have meant freedom for Africa, did in fact mean freedom. I want to ask him in how many countries there are majority governments. I want to ask him to advocate a model for South Africa, to champion a political dispensation for South Africa which cannot mean only one thing, viz. the abdication, not only of the White man as such, but also of that which the White man means in South Africa in terms of political, economic and social systems.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the course of my speech I will be touching upon some of the points raised by the hon. the Minister who has just spoken, but I would like to say that he did suggest that we were wrong to ascribe our economic difficulties&#x2014;I agree with him where he said they were very sombre indeed&#x2014;solely to the political policies of the Government. Nobody ascribes them solely to the political policies of the Government. What we say is that the difficulties in which the country finds itself are gravely aggravated by the policies of this Government. I hope to develop that a little further in the course of what I have to say.</p>

<p>I listened with interest to the New Year broadcast by the hon. the Prime Minister, and I was impressed because of the candour with which he spoke of our situation in the year 1977, as he saw it. He painted a picture&#x2014;and I will use the same phrase that the hon. the Prime Minister used&#x2014;as sombre as any that I have seen or heard of in the time that I have been in this House. I believe we would benefit if we dwelt a moment or two on the salient features of that message. He said, firstly, that we in South Africa are a source of embarrassment and annoyance to the Free World. He said that, in addition, the communists had not lost their ambitions for the domination of the Free World and, indeed, of this sub-continent in particular. He said the communists had superiority in the world of conventional weapons of war. He said we were a convenient whipping-boy for the Third World and so enabled it to preserve its fragile unity. He said also that the Free World had shown that it was not prepared to stand up against the Third World. He said also that recent decisions of the United Nations had encouraged the communist world to think they could have a free hand to act as they pleased in this sub-continent. He said Angola had shown that Russia could do much the same in this sub-continent as she had done in Hungary as far as the Western World was concerned. Finally, he said&#x2014;and this, to me, is the most important aspect of it&#x2014;the reality of our situation was that we might have to defend ourselves alone against any onslaught by the communists, because the Western World would neither defend us nor give us arms.</p>

<p>Sir, that is indeed a sombre statement to make, and nothing that has been said from the Government benches so far in this debate, has led me to believe that the gravity of that situation has been fully appreciated by hon. members opposite. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;and let me say it again&#x2014;has publicly stated that we may have to face a communist onslaught alone, because the West, our traditional friends, will neither defend us nor give us arms. He said that not in a vacuum, but at a time when the newly elected American President is committed to negotiate with Soviet Russia for a treaty to limit the development of nuclear arms. This is the only sphere in which the West at the present time has superiority, and the principal power of the West is committed to negotiate to limit that. The hon. the Prime Minister said this at a time when Russia has a lead in conventional arms. The hon. the Prime Minister has said that events in Angola, South West Africa and Rhodesia have caused a lack of confidence abroad by businessmen in South Africa. Additionally, he has said that that lack of confidence, abroad and here, has been aggravated by the events in Soweto, Langa and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_0171"/>Sir, I could add to that catalogue of woe yet another one, viz. that, as far as I can judge it, the present weather conditions point to this year being a year of agricultural drought and depression. Now, let us accept the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s forecast in the terms in which I have summed it up. I believe we can do that, gloomy and sombre as it is, because, to a large extent, I believe, it is a correct assessment of the facts of today.</p>

<p>The question, then, is immediately posed to the Government: Is this country in a fit state to face an onslaught of communism alone&#x003F; That is the key question to the survival of this country at the present time, and that presents a second question, which is: What are the requirements for success here in those circumstances&#x003F; I believe, firstly, that one of the requirements for success is a well-trained and adequate army. I believe we probably have that, certainly in comparison with the other States in Africa. A second essential requirement is sufficient arms and equipment, and either the ability to produce those armaments, or an assured supply of replacements. We have a limited capacity in that regard, so far as I know, and should that war require heavy equipment, tanks, heavy guns and aircraft, the possibility exists, as the hon. the Prime Minister has indicated, that our supplies from abroad might be terminated. But what is perhaps, so far as I can assess the situation, the most important aspect of our capability to exist, is that we must have a population the majority of whom support the Government&#x2019;s prosecution of any war and who believe in the cause for which the country is fighting. There must be a preparedness to support the Government with a measure of enthusiasm and a firm belief in the righteousness of the cause for which their country is fighting. It was that alone that enabled Great Britain to survive in the 1940s and it is largely that spirit which has enabled the survival of the Afrikaner people in this country.</p>

<p>Let us look at our situation in South Africa in the light of that last criterion. As far as I can judge, there is very little difficulty in respect of the Whites of South Africa, but can the same be said of the balance of the people who inhabit this sub-continent&#x003F; What assurance has the Prime Minister, in these circumstances that I have outlined, that he can carry the balance of the population with him&#x003F; The key in our situation is those population groups which inhabit the large industrial and opolitan centres of South Africa, in fact, our industrial work force. They are, apart from the Whites, the urban Blacks, the Coloureds and the Indians. Two of these groups have mainly been involved in the violence and rioting which have beset this country for the last six months or more. The Government repeatedly says&#x2014;and it has been said over and over again in this debate&#x2014;that that violence was largely the work of agitators who, we are told, managed to stir up a largely contented population, and the inference goes further, against a benevolent Government. In the four minutes of his speech which he devoted to these matters, the Minister of Bantu Administration, who is not here, said precisely that. Sir, does that assertion bear a moment&#x2019;s examination&#x003F; Nobody can deny that these riots took place on a massive scale. They immediately spread from the point of initiation on the Witwatersrand to many parts of South Africa. They were quite obviously meticulously and carefully planned by a large number of people in a network all over the country. This was done despite the very considerable powers under the security legislation which this Government has taken over a period of more than ten years, and despite a large and highly efficient security police force which we have in South Africa. It succeeded, and this is significant, on a large scale, despite numerous deaths and injuries being suffered by the rioters themselves. It is quite obvious that the Government knew nothing of either the preparations or the immediate outbreak of these events.</p>

<p>The significant part of all this is that large numbers of ordinary people were prepared to face death or injury in these riots, and were prepared to destroy property under those circumstances. Can anyone in his senses say that that measure of success by the rioting groups could be achieved by a few agitators working on a contented population whose leaders were backing the Government, because that is the summary we were given by the hon. the Minister in charge of this group, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x003F; I say, &#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D; Nobody in his senses can accept a facile solution of that kind. Agitators there undoubtedly were. Unfortunately we live in an era when they will always be with us, but in the best communist tradition&#x2014;and the hon. the <span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_0172"/>Minister of Justice read it out to us from a document he had&#x2014;they exploited deep-seated grievances amongst the people that rioted. Many of those grievances were legitimate grievances, which made them even easier to cotton on to. If that is not so and if my argument is wrong, why was it only the urban Blacks and the Coloureds who were involved in these riots&#x003F; If it was an artificial creation of a few agitators, &#x201C;opstokers&#x201D;, as we are told by the hon. the Minister, why is it that the White children and students were not involved&#x003F; If it is so easy to agitate and incite an otherwise contented population, why were they not involved&#x003F; Just think, Sir, how much more serious it would have been had the Whites been involved in the riots. The reason is quite simple; it is because the teachers and the parents of the White children and students are largely a satisfied community, whereas the Coloured and the urban Bantu and their teachers and their parents were to a large extent not a satisfied community. That is why, Sir, it succeeded in the one respect and not in the other.</p>

<p>Why did it spread so quickly&#x003F; Am I to understand that this was organized and co-ordinated by school-children&#x003F; Of course not, Sir. I say again that it is axiomatic that the communist technique is to latch on to legitimate grievances and to build up riotous situations by those means. That is what happened in this instance.</p>

<p>Since the start of the riots, virtually nothing has been done or said by this Government to change the circumstances under which that violence broke out. How, in these circumstances, can the country face the possibility of a communist onslaught alone, as the hon. the Prime Minister indicated, with the slightest degree of confidence as long as this Government is in the seat of power&#x003F; Let us face the facts. Despite what we have heard said in this debate&#x2014;and this is important; I hope the hon. the Minister will listen&#x2014;the fact is that this Government does not receive the support of any significant group of non-White people in this country. The very leaders of these people who have achieved their positions of pre-eminence in terms of the policies of this Government, have one after the other indicated that they are using their positions not in order to further the development of the system, but in order to break the system down. They have said it over and over again, and they are the elected leaders of these communities. They are the leaders with whom the Government is in constant negotiation.</p>

<p>To sum up, Mr. Speaker, how on earth can you face a communist onslaught alone when you do not have the backing of the majority of your people, your industrial work force&#x003F; That, Sir, is the nitty-gritty of the situation in which we find ourselves at the present time. I say to the hon. gentleman, in so far as the Cape is concerned: How can you defend the Cape against such an onslaught when you have a sullen and seemingly disaffected Cape Coloured population to deal with&#x003F; There has been a material change in the attitude of the Cape Coloured people since this time last year. [Interjections.] If we do not accept this, we are bluffing ourselves. One of the tragedies of this debate is that of all the hon. Ministers who are responsible for the people who were involved in these riots, namely the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, his three Deputy Ministers and the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, only one has entered the debate so far, and that was the petulant pedagogue, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and he spent only four minutes of his speech dealing with his portfolio and with the riots that have taken place. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What is to be done in these circumstances&#x003F; I believe, as has repeatedly been indicated since the beginning of the debate by hon. members on this side of the House, that the Government&#x2019;s policies and attitudes must be changed, not in some unknown and undefined manner, as was indicated by the hon. gentleman who has just sat down, but along the lines we have indicated. The Government should introduce a system which will make the groups that I have referred to, proud to be South Africans, proud to support the Government of the day, and proud to support the free society and the free economy which we have in South Africa. Until we are assured of that support, we cannot be assured of our position here in so far as aggression is concerned. To put it more precisely, these groups must have a share in decision making and in government. They must feel part of the free enterprise economic system, they must appreciate and share in the benefits of that system and they must be prepared to defend the free enterprise system against communism. <span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0173"/>Quite simply, that means that they must prefer it to the communist economic system. It also means that they must be encouraged to become owners of land and property in freehold. This applies to the Coloured, the Indian and the urban Black. It is in this regard that the Government finds itself unable to move, and this, to my mind, is crucial. We must build up a class of property owners both in the urban areas among the urban Blacks and in the rural areas amongst the tribal Bantu. At the present time, as far as this continent is concerned, the White man is seen as rich and the Black man is seen as poor. Nothing fits better into the communist technique than this situation. The White man is not rich because he is in government in South Africa or anywhere else. He is rich because he understands and has mastered the free enterprise economic system. It is that system which produces wealth and not the fact of government. Socialism does not produce wealth. One cannot find a better example of that than Great Britain. Socialism merely redistributes existing wealth, but it does not produce it. It is the private enterprise system which produces wealth. The United States of America, Japan and Western Germany are proof of that. The role of government in the sort of society which I envisage, is merely to maintain law and order so that the private enterprise system can work and produce wealth. At the moment the Africans here and all over Africa unfortunately believe that they merely have to get Black rule, in other words, to become the Government, to automatically become rich and acquire wealth. That is the greatest fallacy in the world. One of the greatest criticisms that can be levelled against this Government is that in the 28 years for which it has been in power, it has done almost nothing to destroy the belief that to acquire wealth, one must become the Government and that once one has become the Government, the cornucopia will open and fall into one&#x2019;s lap. This Government has done almost nothing in that time to encourage the Black man to become a property owner, which is the basis of the free enterprise system, to understand and share in the benefits of the free enterprise economic system, and to be prepared to defend it against the socialist and communist systems. This Government has done almost nothing in that regard and it is the key to our survival in the present time. To this day nearly all the development in the homelands is done through large, socialistic corporations, and that I deplore.</p>

<p>Because of the seriousness of the times I have listened to this debate with great attention and I have sat here throughout. A number of things have emerged. Has it all been a bad dream, or have we lived through one of the most serious periods of rioting and destruction that this country has ever known&#x003F; If it is correct to describe it in those words, what do we get in the first major debate from the men who are responsible for our affairs&#x003F; As I have indicated, largely silence and a few petulant irrelevancies from the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. In situations of this kind&#x2014;and it is unfortunately the key to our situation&#x2014;what is the defence of the NP when all else fails&#x003F; Tragically, it is exactly the same today as it was in 1961 when I first came here and it was used on every occasion that I can recall when the NP was really in trouble. It has two legs and it presupposes that the NP has a proprietary right to the loyalty of all Afrikaans-speaking people. I say this to my friends, as the clergymen say, in all brotherly love, more in sorrow than in anger. The first leg of this defence, the final back against the wall defence of the hon. gentlemen, is that the members opposite are the chosen of the Almighty and that they have not yet completed the course ordained by Him for them. That was the punch-line of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s New Year message and it was the punch-line of the speech of the Minister of Information and others in this House. When I think of some of those who have graced the benches opposite in the years gone by, I often wonder why the Deity should have chosen them as against myself!</p>

<p>There is a second leg to this defence, and it emerged largely from the speech of the hon. member for Standerton. It goes along these lines: The hon. gentlemen opposite, to the exclusion of almost everybody else, are fearless, clean living, disciplined, god-fearing, upright, hard-working, principled people, as I say, more or less to the exclusion of all others. Consequently these characteristics will pull them through and these characteristics fit them for Government over and above all others.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is time that it was said that there are amongst others in South Africa, and certainly from amongst the group from which I stem, just as many people possessed of those qualities as there are among the gentlemen opposite. These are qualities of a pioneer stock and there are as many from that stock on this side of the House as there are over there. I would like to say this in view of the defence which has been put up and which, as I have said, is put up so often: I think that it can be fairly said of the English-speaking section from which I stem that they have just as much to be proud of in the way of the maintenance of standards, of identity and in courageous endeavour as any other section in this country. The sooner we accept that and the fact that we have a common destiny together in South Africa, the better we will solve our problems.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the total irrelevance of that type of call can be demonstrated in another way. In the years gone by wars were fought here and abroad largely between the Whites, and the non-Whites were to a large extent spectators both in the fighting and in the industrial development which supported the armies. That is no longer the case. In Africa today, it is not only the Whites who are involved in the wars, and success in war is no longer dependent upon the endeavours and resolutions of the Whites alone. Indeed, I think I have demonstrated that in South Africa itself we are now dependent upon the other races, both in respect of the armed forces and in respect of the maintenance of supplies for the armed forces, and if we cannot see it here, surely we have managed to see it in Rhodesia to the north of us. Everybody is involved, and that means that success in government today is not merely to win a majority in a White Parliament from a White electorate. Success lies in demonstrating to the country that one has the ability to meet the legitimate aspirations of all its people because all those people will be involved, not only in the fighting, but also in the support for the fighting forces. So one might very well be a representative of a minority, and minorities are not uncommon in Africa today. Pretty well every country is governed by a minority. The only difference is that they are Black and we are White, and perhaps we govern better. However, merely obtaining a majority at the polls from a White minority electorate demonstrates no more than that one has successfully pandered to the fancies and privileges of that electorate. It is no longer the gauge of success in South Africa of 1976. The gauge of success is not merely to win an election, but the ability to draw to one&#x2019;s standard the loyalty and support of all those who are necessary to carry out a successful war. That means that one must be able to draw on the loyalty and support of all races in South Africa.</p>

<p>If that is the standard of success as far as government is concerned, then I believe it can be said that this Government has failed. Does anyone imagine that Mr. Ian Smith would have survived for as long as he has in Rhodesia had he not drawn support not only from those who elected him but also from all others in Rhodesia&#x003F; I believe there is a lesson for us there as well. The position has been reached where the Nationalist Party can no longer go it alone, because if it attempts to do so, it becomes irrelevant, if it is not already irrelevant. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has pointed the way. He has pleaded for a new and broader based dispensation in this country, a dispensation which can draw people from all sections, from that side and from this side, to try to create conditions such that all races&#x2014;and as far as I am concerned this is a prerequisite in our present situation&#x2014;can be proud, firstly, of being South Africans and, secondly, of the fact that the Government of the day, whoever it may be, can, without looking over its shoulder, rely on the loyalty and the support, in both the fighting forces and on the home front, of all races if there should be a communist onslaught from abroad.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down said a number of things that are worthy of consideration and a number of things that were very contentious. At the end of his speech he took the liberty of saying that the NP had actually become irrelevant. Good heavens! Where is there a party that has become more irrelevant than the party to which that hon. member belongs&#x003F; That party has become so irrelevant that an English <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0175"/>language newspaper, in a leading article on 14 January, even before the occurrences on the grounds of which six members were expelled from the caucus, had something to say about it. The article reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the Leader of the Opposition, Sir De Villiers Graaff, moves his vote of no confidence, it will be a farce. No confidence in whom&#x003F; In the Government getting stronger and stronger, or in the Opposition, so weak and weakened that three parties with different principles and objectives are prepared to compromise themselves for the sake of 14 political platitudes&#x003F;</block>

<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Besides, by his very act of offering up the UP on a platter to the Progrefs, Sir De Villiers has given his own party a decided vote of no confidence.</block>

<p>It stated further that the spade with which the UP was being buried was wielded by Sir De Villiers Graaff himself. It is therefore not fitting for a member of the hon. Opposition to talk of this side of the House as being a party that has become irrelevant.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the New Year&#x2019;s speech of the hon. the Prime Minister. That was a message that was given in all earnestness. I think that the hon. the Prime Minister succeeded in making all sections of the population very keenly aware of the reality of the situation and the seriousness of that situation. However, it was not crisis thinking. I think those were very sober words, words that were intended to bring home to people the fact that if the worst were to happen&#x2014;not that we expected it to happen or that we were moving or working in that direction&#x2014;we should know that we would then have to rely only upon our own inner reserves of spiritual energy, military strength, economic strength and so forth. As I interpret the hon. the Prime Minister he did not however thereby intimate that we were heading for confrontation or destruction in a sort of fatalistic frame of mind. It is of course our aim, as far as we can, to gain the greatest possible sympathy and even support of Western countries. It is our aim to convince people to appreciate what the position in South Africa is and the problems with which we are struggling. But then, in the same breath, we also want to say that when people ask a price that is too high we are not prepared to pay that price. We are not prepared at the cost of our basic freedom, even of our lives, to get into step with a world that will be satisfied with nothing less than either national sucicide or capitulation in favour of a Black majority government throughout the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>If what the hon. member intimated is true&#x2014;that there is no appreciation on the part of Afrikaner Nationalists for the contribution that the English-speaking people have made towards the building up of South Africa&#x2014; then there are various things that are completely inexplicable. For example, what the hon. the Prime Minister has over the years, since he became Prime Minister, said to the English-speaking people, and also what his predecessor did to include English-speaking people in the Government and in the NP&#x2014;of course, within the framework of separate development for the various nations&#x2014;is inexplicable. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is not as much a joke to us as it apparently is to hon. members on the other side. They have nothing to boast about. There are also various other things that are inexplicable. If hon. members do not think that we saw possibilities in the development of non-White nations or did not have respect for their identity, they must just for a moment remember who the people are who over the years have made a very great contribution towards the evangelizing of the non-White nations as well. It would then be completely inexplicable that, for example in the case of the DR church, the Mother church has fewer adherents than the daughter churches which draw their members from the non-White nations. This is the case because we saw the possibilities for those people. If this were not so, the independence of the Transkei, the possibility of which we envisaged and co-operated towards the realization of an ideal, would make no sense. This is precisely the proof that we do in fact appreciate the value peculiar to a specific group of Black people who themselves appreciate that value which is peculiar to them. Otherwise it would not have made any sense. One could go on in this way.</p>

<p>I should like now to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s accusation that not much has as yet <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0176"/>been said about the disturbances, and should like to refer to a few matters he raised. I am sure he will pardon me if I do not reply to each little point he raised. I think that the hon. the Minister of Justice dealt with important aspects in connection with the handling of the disturbances. I do however want to state that if it had not been for the fact that we could rely upon the goodwill of by far the vast majority of Black people and Brown people, the disturbances could have assumed far greater proportions. Can the hon. member explain why it is that in Durban and in Bloemfontein there were either no disturbances or only unrest on a very restricted scale&#x003F; That, after all, is a fact we have to take into account. We were not dealing with a nationwide fire that had broken out. Of course, the situation was serious in certain respects. The point that I want to make is that if we had had to deal with a full-scale revolt on the part of all Black and Brown people, the picture there would have been totally different. That is why it behoves that side of the House as well as this side of the House to express appreciation to those law-abiding Black and Brown people who in the face of great provocation and incitement kept their heads, stayed calm and did their work or tried to do their work where they were not prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with that matter any further, but I am sure I will be permitted to say that we are not going to allow the hon. Opposition to forget how strange a world we see about us as far as they are concerned. There may perhaps be something to learn from this on the part of somebody who has not been in politics very long, namely, to realize that strange things certainly can happen in politics. However, there are certain matters which will remain inexplicable to the end One of these matters that will remain inexplicable to the end is that one can pretend that one stands by certain fixed, basic principles, that one regards certain elements in the world as enemies of one&#x2019;s party or of one&#x2019;s cause or of one&#x2019;s country, and then, when it suits one, turn around and embrace those same enemies as allies in a struggle against another political party. I shall illustrate what I mean. I think we may just as well write an epitaph for the UP. In fact, they themselves have undertaken to do so. We can add the RIP on the understanding that it does in fact mean &#x201C;Rest In Pieces&#x201D;! Another strange thing is of course that a party that seeks to disband, that no longer has the courage to live, has quickly first of all, before it dies or before its final disbandment, to expel a few of its children so that they cannot be present at its deathbed and perhaps shed a tear at its dissolution.</p>

<p>I am not going to allow the hon. member for Durban Point to get away scot-free just like that. This is another of the things that to my mind is inexplicable in this situation. The hon. member made a particular showing here, and it is to this member I am referring when I make the following quotation. When an hon. member sitting in the backbenches of the PRP was elected at Durban North, the hon. member for Durban Point cried great crocodile tears and actually made use of the discussion under the Vote of Defence in order to express his sorrow in this regard. He said (Hansard, Vol. 62, col. 6160)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before I turn to the Vote, Mr. Chairman, I want to refer to an event which happened yesterday, an event which I believe has serious implications for the very subject of this debate. This is that a majority of ordinary English-speaking South Africans, and I believe normal patriotic South Africans, elected to represent them in this House a member of the PRP. He joins a party which, for different motives, by different methods, and by absolutely legitimate means&#x2014;through the ballot box&#x2014;has nevertheless the same political objective as those who are the enemies of South Africa.</block>

<p>I am not quoting this for the sake of malicious pleasure; I am doing so because in a certain sense I am concerned about the fact that an Opposition which one really does not want to see disappear entirely is now following the road along which it is prepared to cast in its lot with people who at a certain stage were regarded as the enemies of South Africa; that it is prepared to cast in its lot with these people without there having been a conversion or a change of heart on the part of that party, a party that is hand in hand with <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0177"/>the enemies of South Africa, and that it is prepared to cast in its lot with those people in a common front against the NP. No governing party likes to see its Opposition making progress but I think&#x2014;and I do not say this tongue-in-cheek&#x2014;that I shall be truly sorry if the UP disappears from the scene in such a dishonourable manner&#x2014;if I may put it that way&#x2014;and becomes part of another constellation where it will be prescribed to by the people who it said were hand in hand with the enemies of South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me go further. When he was asked whether he was prepared to co-operate with those people, the same hon. member&#x2014;perhaps in a moment of anxiety or excitement&#x2014;said that he was even prepared to co-operate with the devil. Under specific circumstances, of course. I feel that I must warn that hon. member that he should know better the person with whom he wishes to co-operate; he ought at least to realize that there are people who know him better than that. To say now that he would even co-operate with the devil, if it were ostensibly in the interests of South Africa, is absolute nonsense. The hon. member must not pretend that he does not know the devil. In any case, I want to warn him to be careful. There are hon. members who do not know as much about the devil. Then there are also other hon. members who know the devil far too well to try to seek his co-operation.</p>

<p>I want now to address myself to the hon. member for Houghton. She is also something very strange in this House in relation to the things she says; at any rate, she strikes a very foreign note in this hon. House. In reply to a question by the hon. the Minister of Labour whether her party would be prepared to give recognition and free movement to Marxists in South Africa, we had an acknowledgement from the hon. member for Houghton, or words to that effect. Her reply was that the Marxists would be given the opportunity to put their point of view in South Africa. Am I correct&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member must not try to evade the question. We are dealing now with the Marxists. The hon. member is prepared to give Marxists the opportunity to put their point of view in South Africa. Surely there is no sense in giving people the opportunity to put their point of view and not at the same time also giving them the opportunity of organizing politically the opportunity of nominating political candidates for a parliamentary election. In principle therefore those people have the freedom, the possibility, the opportunity to devote their energies to coming into power in South Africa. Surely there is no fault to find with that sort of logic. I should like to recommend to the hon. member&#x2014;whether or not she will accept my recommendation is another matter&#x2014;that she read a work that was written by Anthony Harrigan and issued by the Nasionale Handelsdrukkery here in Cape Town. The title of the book is <i>Defence Against Total Attack.</i></p>

<p>I want to go a little further. The hon. member for Houghton read out something in connection with the language question but then she got off the subject as fast as she could. This was in connection with the language question as being the cause of the disturbances in Soweto.

<p>Before the hon. member accuses me across the floor of the House in regard to the use of Afrikaans as medium of education in secondary schools in Soweto, it will do her no harm to read that little report and study the evidence that has in the meantime been given before the Cillie Commission.

<p>There is something which to my mind is very strange. <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0179"/>I refer to something that I received in Parliament, and I think other members of Parliament have also received it. It is a circular headed: &#x201C;A message for 1977 to those in authority and to White South Africa&#x201D;, and it comes from the &#x201C;Ministers Fraternal of Langa, Guguletu and Nyanga, Cape Town.&#x201D; I wonder whether the hon. member for Pinelands had a hand in this. [Interjections.] The hon. member who spoke before me made an accusation against this side of the House to the effect that we, as it were, thought we had a high calling and that we were the elect, or whatever it might be. He should look at this pamphlet in order to ascertain just how people can take it upon themselves to say that they are speaking in the name of the Almighty, and then not just generally as part of their calling but in respect of the White people as the governing party in South Africa. This circular reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We address ourselves to those in authority and to the White South Africans generally. We do so in the name of Christ, who has come to save mankind and set us free.</block>

<p>Sir, before I comment in this regard, I want to make this further quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is tragically apparent that the Government presently in power still refuses to heed the things that make for peace.</block>

<p>I now want to ask these brothers this: Was the murder of Dr. Edelstein also in Christ&#x2019;s name&#x003F; Why do you assume the mantle of Christ to such an extent that not one small piece remains for another Christian belonging to another culture and nation, so that he should also be able to have a small portion of it&#x003F; Christ is being monopolized here by a &#x201C;ministers fraternal&#x201D; in order by this means to make the grossest accusation against the White people among whom there are after all a few Christians as well!

<block name="quote">In spite of all the upheavals, no significant changes have been made.</block>

<p>In other words, they had hoped that the riots and disturbances&#x2014;and in some cases they were worse than disturbances&#x2014;would have the desired results; in other words, here we have people, ministers, supporting the disturbances in the hope that those disturbances would achieve certain political results. I want to say to these brothers: &#x201C;I may perhaps have a mote or a beam in my eye, but before you refer to that mote or beam in my eye, just examine your own eye in order to see whether there is not perhaps a mote in it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>These same people then come along and say: &#x201C;Scrap differentiated education.&#x201D; I hope at a later stage, during the discussion of my Vote, to have the opportunity to discuss this matter in greater detail. Here we have people asking&#x2014;and one wonders at whose ehcouragement or inspiration this is taking place&#x2014; that differentiated education should be scrapped. Education that is aimed at the specific requirements of specific communities is apparently evil. This can only come from the liberalist circle where all people are treated equally, where there is no difference and where there is no question of communities. I should like to enter into a discussion with the hon. member in regard to communities and organisms and so forth because she only thinks in a holistic sense, and then she sells her apartheid in Houghton. Suggestions of this nature are completely at variance with the considered point of view of Unesco. This is a point of view which intrudes upon certain groups who feel that their identity is being threatened and who work towards ensuring that their education has a specific cultural stamp. This intrudes upon the point of view of our own Black people who occupy responsible positions in South Africa. If hon. members could have had discussions with us together with, for example, the Cabinet of Qwa-Qwa&#x2014;and they do not come only from Witsieshoek but from throughout the Free State&#x2014;and were to listen to those people when they speak about &#x201C;our culture, our nation, our children, our customs&#x201D; and object to the fact that their children are dominated in a school where, for example, the Tswanas are in the majority, they will realize that these people appreciate the fact that specific provision is being made for their children who have a specific cultural and national background. I have many quotations here but I do not want to weary the House with them. <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0180"/>If I do not complete my argument, Mr. Speaker, I promise the hon. member for Yeoville that I shall return to the question of the disturbances. I want to make this point in connection with education because, after all, we now have the allegation that the education of these people is inferior. They do not take account of the fact that all the prescribed books are selected and that care is taken that they are of an equal standard. Care is taken that the basic curricula are drawn up by inter-departmental committees in which Black people also participate and to which they make a contribution. They do not take account of the fact that the final matriculation examination is a standard examination. I said last year that the Senior Certificate of the hon. member for Pinelands is worth just as much as that which is obtained at a high school, or rather a senior secondary school, in Soweto. It is worth just as much, and <i>vice versa,</i> if you want to put it that way.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would very much like the hon. member for Houghton to raise that point again when my Vote is under discussion here. I should like to quote to the House what Chief Minister Mangope had to say about this system of education that was taken over holus-bolus from Europe. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unrealistic expectations were usually attached to it and it was not always fully realized that a foreign impulse can, at best, be a stimulant but that it can never in itself mean development in the full sense of the word. Our schools need a much closer contact with the society in which they are embedded.</block>

<p>This is the attitude of a Chief Minister who is now asking that his nation become independent on 6 December. I could go on in this way but I only have a few minutes at my disposal in which I should like to refer to the question of the language medium.</p>

<p>The policy of 50:50 in secondary schools is not simply a fad that has come into being in the &#x2019;70s. This has been the practice since 1955, and I can tell hon. members that at the start of the &#x2019;70s we made inquiries from Black school boards and carried out a survey. I am pleased to see that the hon. member for Yeoville is listening attentively because it seems to me that there are possibilities for him. The school boards consist of Black people and they expressed their opinion on the question of the language medium in secondary schools. What was the result&#x003F; 63% of them voted for a 50:50 dispensation, 32% for English as language medium and 5% for Afrikaans as language medium. In 1974 we made a survey in Soweto and had discussions with the principals of schools. I have here a note from the department to the effect that during those discussions it was decided at a local level in Soweto to have uniformity at standard five level as far as possible. What is of importance here is that in standard five a pupil is prepared for the secondary school. In standard five therefore one has to prepare for the medium that is going to be used in the secondary school. If then Afrikaans and English are going to be used on a 50:50 basis in secondary schools, as was arranged with those people, one has surely to make provision for it. The preparatory work has to be done in standard five, and the discussions took place because this would affect the change-over to a different medium in Form I. Arithmetic and Social Study were decided upon, the last-mentioned subject being an optional one. This policy springs from an agreement with Black people in Soweto and elsewhere and has been applied in such a way that these people have been able virtually to contract out of the agreement and to ask that they be given permission to drop the use of Afrikaans in all subjects if they do not have the necessary teachers or prescribed books. They have therefore been able to do this.</p>

<p>The result is that, at the end of 1975, the position in Soweto was that in precisely half of the 38 secondary schools not one single subject was taught through the medium of Afrikaans. Morris Isaacson is the leading one, and this is a school whose activities are well worth investigating. I think the Cillie Commission will give its view in this regard. The school is opposed to Afrikaans but there is not one single subject that is offered with Afrikaans as a medium. This was already the position in 1975 long before there was any question of disturbances and so forth. I have a great deal of information at my disposal and I shall be able to reply to hon. members&#x2019; <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0181"/>questions. There are at the moment 41 secondary schools in Soweto and of these there is only one in ten senior secondary schools that offers one optional subject in Afrikaans. Does this then look like a situation providing grounds for accusing this side of the House of having forced Afrikaans down the throats of children&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, one cannot necessarily agree with everything the Deputy Minister has said, although one may describe his logic as relentless, or as the French have it, one may say &#x201C;C&#x2019;est formidable&#x201D;, provided one is able to understand it!</p>

<p>&#x2020;I have been overseas since the last session and in recent weeks I have been in Rhodesia. My impressions overseas are that, in foreign eyes, our continued existence as a civilized State is indeed at stake. It is also my conviction that, given the opportunity, we South Africans have both the ability and the will to overcome the dangers that face us and to solve the problems if we stand firmly by our principles and by our right as a sovereign nation to do so. I must say, Mr. Speaker, that, undoubtedly, South Africa is the main target of the enemies of Southern Africa. South Africa, in their view, must be overthrown and must be turned inside out while Rhodesia and South West Africa are merely obstacles in the way of achieving the main target.</p>

<p>Who are our enemies&#x003F; Lenin said in 1920 that the expulsion of all colonial powers was vital to the achievement of world communism, and I am afraid to say that no matter how much we may protest, we are nevertheless regarded as the last of the colonial rulers by many countries and by many politicians throughout the world&#x2014;in my opinion, quite wrongly. What is the aim of the communists&#x003F;: World revolution leading to a despotic world government. Out of the First World War, came the League of Nations, and out of the Second World War, the United Nations. If, God forbid, there is a third world war then the one-worlders would thereafter aim to achieve their objective, namely world government, the last step in their master plan for world domination.</p>

<p>Who else are our enemies&#x003F; Those who wittingly or unwittingly support this communist aim. They are the international socialists and the liberals of the English-speaking world. They are, in the words of Lenin, &#x201C;the useful fools&#x201D; or&#x2014;the words that I prefer to use&#x2014;&#x201C;the willing tools&#x201D;. Liberalism has become the cover-name for any purpose destructive of nationhood, familyhood and religion. It is the hallmark of a permissive society where normal standards and decency are destroyed. These forces&#x2014; that is to say, a combination of these forces&#x2014;have combined to bring about our downfall and they back extreme Black nationalist movements as their instruments.</p>

<p>People ask, and they may well ask: What of the West&#x003F; Will they not help us&#x003F; In my experience we have friends, many friends; we receive much sympathy, and there is much goodwill towards us, but if you ask whether they will give practical help, the answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. We live in a fool&#x2019;s paradise if we think that the West will come to our aid. Whether we like it or not, the West simply do not appreciate the arguments that we put forward for our existence, namely the value of our strategic position and the value of our mineral wealth, because they do not wish to do so, or, if you like, because it is not expedient for them to do so. They can, nevertheless, rely on us to help them in their times of need, and they know it. They believe, however, that by taking the side of the Black majority in South Africa, they will win the ultimate favour of Black nations in Africa. I believe that they cannot be more wrong, because the communists can always outbid them. Let us not harp on the fact that the West is decadent, that the West has declined and that we are misunderstood. We know that this is the case. It is a fact that South Africa is regarded by the West as an embarrassment and even South Africa&#x2019;s policy of separate freedoms, like that opted for by the Transkei, is unacceptable to the West in their search for the favour of the Third World because those policies stem from us.</p>

<p>And what is more, the West is determined now to play a leading role in solving Southern Africa&#x2019;s problems for Southern Africa. Theirs will be an active and not a passive role from now on, in my opinion. That is why there is international political and economic pressure being applied to us by the West, and that is why Mr. Young, the United States representative to the United Nations, yesterday publicly announced a harder line to <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0182"/>be taken against South Africa. The interest in Africa by the West is of comparatively recent origin. The real interest in the dark continent is only about 20 years old. Twenty years ago Africa was under imperial rule but it was, in fact, no matter what one thinks of colonial rule, a continent of law and order. However, from 1960 until now we have witnessed Western liberalism assisting in the achievement of the aims of Lenin. The head of the Commonwealth, Macmillan, became the Chamberlain of the 1960s by shelving his country&#x2019;s responsibilities for keeping peace in its colonies when his &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; speech started a mad stampede to independence and Black majority rule. Macmillan, more than any other man, ushered in an era of metropolitan duplicity, betrayals and fiascos, in all of which the West, and Britain particularly, played the main role. A new Commonwealth has emerged in which the founder members&#x2014;the old established members&#x2014; have either acquiesced in the demands of their new partners or have been thrown out or silenced. State after state, lacking those material resources and the experience necessary to qualify them for statehood, have been stampeded into independence, votes for all, one man, one vote once, and then a free for all! Strong men are replaced by stronger men, and the last 10 years have become the decade of the rule of the gun in Africa. The new nations joined forces with the Afro-Asian block and the Soviet groups to take over the United Nations. I once heard it said of the United Nations that it should be called the Benighted Nations! I could not agree more because that is where the root cause of all the West&#x2019;s troubles lies and where threats and distortions and the buying of support reign supreme. Today, as we know, a simple majority is the rule of the day in the United Nations and Western vetoes are used with hesitation only after careful calculation of the cost in terms of support that might thereby be lost, no longer on a basis of principle. I would say that after the last couple of sessions of that organization, in which the relentless and vicious vendetta against South Africa has reached a crescendo, with the recognition of the ANC and the PAC as a sort of government in exile for South Africa, one wonders whether we should continue to be humiliated without even the right of a reply. There must be enormous hidden benefits if they can outweigh the apparent disadvantages.</p>

<p>Our neighbour, Rhodesia, is today under unbearable pressure. The liberal West, i.e. led by the United Kingdom and the United States, is trying to force Rhodesia to do its will, something that no other African country or combination or groups of African countries could ever achieve. Let us look at this small country. It is menaced on all its borders. It enjoyed 70 years of peace and steady growth till its turn came to resist a hand-over to those unfit to govern a 40-year-old self-governing dominion on the basis of merit. Had it not taken its independence, in exactly the same way that America did, does anyone really think Britain would ever have given it to her, except on the same basis that Mr. Crosland and Mr. Richard today wish for a settlement, i.e. on the basis of a hand-over to specified terrorist leaders. Nothing will satisfy such gentlemen, and others of their ilk in the rest of the world, except the total and abject surrender of everything White to everything Black, provided it is extreme and preferably Marxist. Mr. Smith said, only 11 years ago: &#x201C;We may be a small country, but we are a determined people who have been called upon to play a role of world-wide significance.&#x201D; I believe he was right. I believe we in South Africa are called upon now to play a role of world-wide significance. What is Rhodesia today&#x003F; It is the second most advanced industrial State in Africa, a well administered, modern State with little obvious evidence of racial tension although it is fighting for its life on the borders.</p>

<p>Indeed, to me there seems to be plenty of inter-racial goodwill and a willingness among the Black and White people I met in Rhodesia to try to find each other in the interest of peace, and not a seeking of war. It does not interfere with its neighbours. It seeks nothing from anyone other than a chance to do business as usual and to work out its partnership policies on the basis of advancement by merit and not by skin colour. Its Black population has in the last 70 years grown from 400 000 warring Black tribesmen to four million people as a result of the educational and medical services, the economic growth and prosperity and the law and order brought to Rhodesia by the very people whom the Western World now wishes to abdicate from their power and their responsibility. <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0183"/>Rhodesia has survived 11 years of unprecedented world malice, spleen and venom spearheaded by successive British Governments and the BBC and other English news media who in the last few days have piously pleaded that they want a &#x201C;fair and reasonable&#x201D; settlement but that Mr. Smith, who agreed to the Kissinger terms, now stands in their way&#x2014;and that after Mr. Smith had publicly accepted the Anglo-American proposals in the way that he did.</p>

<p>Who are defending the borders of Rhodesia&#x003F; I visited the borders of Rhodesia. That country is being defended by a Black and White army in which the Black Rhodesians predominate. Who is maintaining law and order in Rhodesia&#x003F;&#x2014;A Black and White Police Force in which, I understand, the Black police predominate, both in the townships and in the tribal trust areas. Against whom are they fighting&#x003F; They are fighting against gangs of terrorists trained in communist countries and in their African satellites and using weapons made in Russia, China, East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia&#x2014;exactly the same situation as that which we find on South Africa&#x2019;s borders where our young soldiers are fighting against the same enemy who are using exactly the same weapons. The Rhodesian security forces must be among the best in the world and there morale is certainly high.</p>

<p>All that moderate and reasonable Rhodesians of all colours whom I met&#x2014;and I met many of them&#x2014;are asking of us is that we, who are opposed to boycotts and sanctions, should carry on as before so as to give them the opportunity to work out their own destiny for themselves without outside interference. Just as it is in South Africa&#x2019;s own interests that law and order and territorial integrity be maintained in South West Africa so that the people of that territory can decide their own future, so it is imperative that Rhodesia should be given a further opportunity to find its own solutions in internal negotiation and not as a result of external war after the farce of Geneva, and, once again, in recent days as in recent history, apparent British intransigence&#x2014;shades of the Buccaneer breach of contract, shades of the Simonstown Agreement which was vitiated unilaterally by the British Government! To this end this Government has a very heavy responsibility as a peace seeker. It is in our interests that law and order and efficient government be maintained at all times in Rhodesia because, should those break down, the consequences will spill over into the Republic as has happened in the case of Angola and Mozambique. Besides seeking peace, South Africa can play, I believe, an outstanding role as a peacemaker and a peace-keeper. We are an African State. We know Africa far better than the British or the Americans will ever know it. Indeed, some of them have prescribed solutions for African countries without even visiting those countries. We in South Africa are no longer a small and insignificant nation or part of a larger group of nations: We are an individual nation; we are a strong nation; we are strategically important; and we are rich in our own resources.</p>

<p>The resources I refer to are not only material resources but also physical resources in the form of all the peoples making up South Africa. We have the military power to stand up for ourselves and only a major power could bring us to our knees. We are so placed that we can play a significant role in determining the future of Southern Africa and keeping peace in this part of the continent and, in doing so, not only can we determine our own future, but we can also secure it. We must be strong militarily and we must be strong economically, but we must also be strong in our belief in ourselves and in our belief in that which we stand for; and that applies not just to me and those of my colleagues who sit here in Parliament. All our people must share in the same resolve that we have to defend ourselves. They must also be given something they wish to conserve and preserve. When I say &#x201C;given&#x201D;, I mean that they must be allowed the opportunity to &#x201C;achieve&#x201D; for themselves and not just to receive a hand-out. All our people must be able to feel that what they have, is better than that which is offered them by someone else. In other words, I say that things must be done in South Africa with urgency to raise the standards of all our people and to raise their stake in South Africa. How can this be done&#x003F; I have been here for 10 years and in public life a little longer, but I have no hesitation in saying that the only way in which this can be done is by finding consensus among moderates here in this Parliament to do those things which are human and which our Christian consciences tell us must be done, if we are all <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0184"/>to share my conviction that indeed we shall one day overcome our dangers, that we shall solve our problems. In doing so, we shall be an example, not only to Africa, but also to the rest of the world of how different races, at different stages of development, can find a peaceful solution to enable them to coexist in close proximity to each other or else within the same constitutional State. A very heavy onus, indeed the initiative, must come from the Government, and, if it does, an echo will resound throughout the length and breadth of South Africa. The time has never been more ripe!</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Simonstown has been the third speaker from what I would call a &#x201C;maiden party&#x201D; in this House. As the maiden speech from a member of a maiden party I suppose it is traditional to congratulate him. He expressed strong views, and by having expressed strong views now he will certainly not create tension within his party. If he had done so last year, as in fact he did, he would have created tension within his party, because the UP has an innate ability to transform stepping-stones into stumbling-blocks. The UP must be pitied because with the tension that exists within it, they realize that they no longer have a useful purpose to fulfil and therefore appointed an ex-judge to liquidate their affairs.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, in a lighter vein, I should like to say that in bygone days already it was the aim of the Ossewabrandwag to destroy the UP. But now ex-judge Kowie Marais has succeeded in doing something which Hans van Rensburg and the Hon. John Vorster were unable to do.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I have here a quotation from <i>The Argus</i> of last night referring to the expected march of scholars in Soweto which was to have taken place yesterday. I want to refer specifically to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mrs. Suzman said that information she had received from sources normally in close contact with developments in Soweto</block>

<p>I would like to know what sources these are. Are these possibly sources that would change Soweto into Sovieto&#x003F;</p>

<p>If this is so that the hon. member for Houghton has any close contact with sources close to developments in Soweto, we can surely accept that the developments to which this article refers, are not developments of a normal nature, but are most probably developments of&#x2014;to use a mild word&#x2014;a disruptive nature. If she has close contact with sources of a disruptive nature, I would like to pose a question to her. Has she any information of actions which might be illegal&#x003F; If, in fact, she has such information, has she ever considered&#x2014;as a good South African&#x2014;to pass on such information to the relevant authorities, be it the Minister of Police, be it any other authority&#x003F; Has she ever considered informing the authorities of any preknowledge she might have of disruptive organizations and developments&#x003F; I doubt whether she has.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to know &#x2026; I am sorry the hon. member for Yeoville is not here at the moment, for I would like to know from him whether he too has any contact with these sources of information, and if so, what his attitude would be. Now, we have another aspect here. It is no longer just the PRP that we have to deal with. We have to deal with a possible new dispensation, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, a new dispensation, a working arrangement between the UP and the PRP. Now, I would like to know whether there is anyone in the UP &#x2026; Is the hon. member for Mooi River prepared to co-operate with members of a party that have close contact with sources of information in Soweto that possibly deal with subversive&#x2014; or, at least, disruptive&#x2014;elements&#x003F; If this is the type of new dispensation which the Opposition is moving towards, thank heavens that at least some of them had the courage of their conviction as members of the Opposition to break away from this new dispensation. We certainly do not require a strengthening of the Government. We have a strong enough party in this House. What we require, is responsible opposition. The question that I would like to pose to members of the UP, those members who appear to be enthralled by a Natal stand, is whether they, in fact, are in accord with this new dispensation, this working arrangement with the hon. member for Houghton, with the hon. member for Sea Point and&#x2014;I do not think I am doing him an injustice&#x2014;the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0185"/>who is in exactly the same group of thinking as the aforementioned members&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am quite convinced of one thing, and that is that the overall majority of residents of Soweto have not the least interest whatsoever in disrupting life in Soweto or anywhere. In fact, we have a good example when there was a reaction by Zulus who &#x2026; Mr. Speaker, I think I should remind the hon. House of the hit song of years ago: &#x201C;Give me five minutes more.&#x201D; [Interjections.] These Zulus, when they were reacting against some of the disruptive elements, were stopped by the police from taking the law into their own hands. They then pleaded with the police: &#x201C;Give me 10 minutes more&#x201D;. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should like to deal with some aspects raised by the hon. member for Sea Point. I see he is not here at the moment, but I think it is necessary to raise these issues nevertheless. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We advocate a radical redrawing of boundaries to ensure that there is a more equitable apportionment of land, resources and the domestic product.</block>

<p>I have no argument with &#x201C;the domestic product&#x201D;, but he said that there should be a more equitable apportionment of land and resources. I should therefore like to ask him or any other member of his party&#x2014;in fact, the hon. member for Johannesburg North might tell me&#x2014;whether the PRP believes in the system of private enterprise or does it believe in or prefer socialism&#x003F; If they believe in private enterprise, are they in accord with what Mr. Sonny Leon is reputed to have said&#x003F; He said that he is in favour of the nationalization of the gold mines so that the resources of the country can be redistributed in order that the riches of the country can be re-allocated for the upliftment of the non-Whites. I should also like to know whether this cry of a more equitable allocation of land and resources is merely a parrot cry of have they considered the practical implications thereof&#x003F; If they have considered the practical implications thereof, are they prepared to say that everybody must sacrifice their land for a redistribution of land&#x003F; I am convinced that this is nothing more than a parrot cry to serve the interests of the enemies of South Africa.</p>

<p>We see yet another development. In last week&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Tribune</i> we saw in a report that Chief Buthelezi is seeking a mandate for a new multi-racial alliance. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Chief Buthelezi is seeking a mandate from all branches of his Inkatha movement to form a multi-racial political alliance with the PRP.</block>

<p>It will be named &#x201C;PRPI&#x201D;&#x2014;Progressive Reform Party Inkatha. Just as an aside, I have been told by at least one leading Zulu that the Inkatha is very much akin to a Zulu Mafia organization and that anyone who does not agree with the dictates of the chief of the Inkatha, is threatened with physical violence. Yet, the PRP is prepared to form an alliance with this organization, not a working arrangement, but a political alliance and so much so that Chief Buthelezi says that they have been encouraged by the response of the PRP to this proposal. He added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The statement of belief contends that the country&#x2019;s resources and wealth controlled by the State belong to all and should be used for the greatest good.</block>

<p>I want to know whether this will be on a basis of nationalization or on a basis of free enterprise. The PRP owes this House an answer to that question. Mr. Speaker, he goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All men should join hands to enter into a partnership with the State &#x2026;</block>

<p>I do not know whether that is on the basis of Zambia&#x2019;s nationalization of the copper mines. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to effect the greatest possible redistribution of wealth.</block>

<p>He is speaking not of the gross national product, but of wealth. I should like to know again from the PRP: Do they believe in socialism and in nationalization&#x003F; Is that what they favour&#x003F; Are they prepared to tell Mr. Harry Oppenheimer that that is what they stand for&#x003F; If so, they must do so. They must be clear and concise.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke in similar terms on another aspect.</p>

<p><span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0186"/>*The hon. member said the following (Hansard, col. 58)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the true Opposition in South Africa, inside and outside Parliament &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member said quite clearly &#x201C;inside and outside Parliament.&#x201D; In other words, he was also referring to an extra-parliamentary Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I do not doubt for a moment that it will achieve unity even during this session, not as a loose coalition of irreconcilable elements, but behind and around clear objectives.</block>

<p>Is that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and a few of his cronies in the United Party, with the PRP and Inkatha&#x003F; Is that the clear-cut Opposition that is going to develop outside Parliament this session&#x003F; I find it amazing to see in which way the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has arrogated to himself already the leadership, because what does he say&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Allow me to add at once that I foresee that as soon as the new party has been formed, it will appeal to the Government of the day to arrange a constitutional conference for the Republic, on the pattern of the Turnhalle in South West Africa.</block>

<p>Then he adds a little bravado, almost like Mickey Mouse does after he has had a drink&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Government refuses to do this, the new opposition will simply act as the alternative Government.</block>

<p>Just listen to that Mickey Mouse! I should like to know whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout thinks in terms of an extra-parliamentary solution together with the hon. member for Durban North, the hon. member for Houghton, the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. captain of Inkatha. Is that the extra-parliamentary solution which will be seen in this session&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion I want to deal with the hon. member for Mooi River.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Much has been said on the subject of Afrikaner unity. The hon. member for Yeoville also referred to it. He said that the Prime Minister wanted to maintain Afrikaner unity at all costs. I want to make on thing clear. The Afrikaners cover the whole political spectrum in South Africa, from Bram Fischer to Beyers Naude to Van Zyl Slabbert to Japie Basson to Theo Gerdener to Myburgh Streicher to John Vorster and even to Albert Hertzog. What sort of Afrikaner unity is this that stretches from Bram Fischer to Albert Hertzog&#x003F; Has the NP ever excluded anyone from playing a full role in the political life of South Africa&#x003F; Surely the Government has been elected and must govern. It cannot for ever play games; it must govern. Therefore, on the basis of its election, it must continue. The hon. member for Mooi River believes that the Afrikaner has a mission to perform in South Africa, but he wants the Afrikaner to change his whole being, his whole identity. Why then, Mr. Speaker, is he not happy within the UP under the leadership of such Afrikaners as De Villiers Graaff, Japie Basson, Harold van Hoogstraten and Derick de Villiers&#x003F; Why was he so keen last year to rid his party of such Afrikaners as the hon. member for Bryanston&#x003F; Why did he allow such Afrikaners as the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town to hive off, because his hon. Leader was courting Afrikaners such as the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. member for Randburg &#x2026; &#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What does the hon. member for Mooi River mean when he says that the Afrikaner has a mission in South Africa, if he does not mean the Afrikaner&#x2019;s political make-up as led by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; He obviously means&#x2014;in a political sense&#x2014;the Afrikaner as led by the hon. the Prime Minister but then, like a chicken about to be hatched, he feels constricted by the shell around him. However, he hesitates to break out of the shell because he fears the unknown of the world around him. The shell has cracked, he peeps out and sees the sun but ducks back into the shell and shouts: &#x201C;Sun, you have a mission in Darkest Africa, but first you must undergo a change. You are too bright for me to join you in that mission.&#x201D; The Opposition must stop this game of playing off English against Afrikaner because we cannot afford it. The Afrikaner, in the very real sense, covers the whole political spectrum of South Africa, but <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0187"/>does the English-speaking South African play his full role&#x003F; It is not the NP&#x2014;and I am not Afrikaans speaking at home&#x2014;that prevents anyone from playing a full role in political life in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the hon. member for Kliprivier. Most of his remarks appeared to be of a personal nature, directed to various other members, some of whom are here and some of whom are not. I think it would be unprofitable for me to try to reply to these points on behalf of either those who are absent or those who are present.</p>

<p>Therefore I wish to refer to a subject which has been touched on at various times during this debate, namely the question of relations between South Africa and the West. Various remarks and comments have been made on the relationship which exists between Southern Africa and the West. This is a most important subject. It obviously lends itself to a great deal of patriotism, a great deal of defiance and to various remarks which could achieve great popular acclaim. However, it is also a subject which, to my mind, requires very close and careful examination. A lot of things have changed during the last year and a half. To merely continue making the same sort of noises about this situation and this relationship is not very helpful. I should like to start with some of the remarks which were made by the hon. the Prime Minister on the subject in his New Year&#x2019;s message. He said, for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If a communist onslaught were to be made on South Africa, she would have to face it alone. Recent debates in the United Nations &#x2026; have given us cause to believe that the Western powers had decided that their only chance of winning the Third World from the Marxists was to accede to their every wish.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All militants and Marxists will feel themselves free and invited to launch aggressive escapades against us in the coming year. The West has not only lost the initiative, is not merely on the defensive everywhere, but saddest of all, has lost the will to take a firm stand against the ever-increasing menace.</block>

<p>That is a point of view which, on the face of it, could command a wide degree of approval, I suppose, grim though the message is. There were other Minister who went on in the same way. The hon. Minister of Defence said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is die Leier van die Opposisie bereid, met sy nuwe party, om beleidsveranderinge aan te gaan wat dit vir Rusland moontlik sal maak om ons te aanvaar&#x003F;</block>

<p>He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nee, natuurlik nie! Hoe ver dink hy sal hy moet gaan voordat die Weste sal s&#x00EA;: &#x201C;Ons is tevrede met jou&#x003F;&#x201D; Het hy enige dokument aan die hand waarvan hy dit aan ons kan verduidelik&#x003F; Kan die agb. Leier van die Opposisie ons een enkele voorbeeld gee van iets waarmee die Weste tevrede sal wees&#x003F; Nee, hy kan nie want tans word daar aan die hele w&#x00EA;reld vanuit Moskou voorgeskryf, en die hele strategie teen Suidelike Afrika word vanuit Moskou bepaal en nie deur &#x2019;n geko&#x00F6;rdineerde strategie&#x2014;soos dit in die Staatspresident se rede staan&#x2014;in die Vrye W&#x00EA;reld teen Suid-Afrika nie. Dit is die die fout.</block>

<p>*Other remarks were also made. I do not wish to repeat them all, but the fact remains that it is being generally accepted on that side that the Free World, the West, has become weak&#x2014;&#x201C;soft&#x201D; is one word that has been used&#x2014;and that it is not prepared to protect Southern Africa against communist onslaughts, that the West is not really interested and that it wants to concede everything to Black countries and the communists and that the West has left us utterly in the lurch. I want to question whether this is really the case. It is true that we have problems, and I would agree with much of the criticism which has, for example, been levelled at UNO. Things are said there and resolutions are adopted there that are by no means realistic and that can in no way be reconciled with the realities as we know them. This does not benefit UNO, for it lowers its prestige because it can be seen that it still continues to adopt resolutions and does so with attitudes and politics which cannot really be reconciled with the realities in the world as it is now. I agree with that, but I question whether we <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0188"/>must deduct from this criticism, which we find disappointing us, that the West in fact has no role to play in Southern Africa and whether we should not look at the realities instead and decide whether the West is not perhaps going to play a role in Africa which is much greater and much more important than we are inclined to admit or accept at the moment.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, it is all very well to say that we stand here alone, threatened, deserted, a prey to communists, and that the West is soft and will give us no aid. If this is, in fact, true and a realistic view, we face a sorry future. If we stand alone and have to face a communist onslaught in its full strength, as has been seen in other parts of the world, and if the West has, in fact, abandoned us, we would have to use resources which would tax our essential needs to an extent which would deprive us of all hope of doing those things for our people which are essential if we are to progress into the next century. We will have to revise our whole external outlook and we will have to take a new look at our strategy. We will have to incur new expenditure and we will have to adopt a new kind of economy which will deprive South Africa and South Africans of all the hopes they have for increased progress and prosperity and, indeed, for increased racial peace in this sub-continent. These are the implications if it is indeed true that we stand alone against a communist onslaught and the West has no part to play and has no intention of playing any part.</p>

<p>I must say that I take a more optimistic view than that. It is terribly important that, in considering these matters, we should not merely be guided by sentiment and prejudice, but that our appreciation should be accurate and correct. The Government has misconceived the situation to this extent. If these views, which I have quoted, represent what the Government really thinks, and is its true analysis of the situation, I believe that there is a misconception and that that misconception is due to one essential fact which is that the price for Western co-operation is certain basic changes in the fundamental policy of this Government. Since it is unwilling to face up to those changes, however, it prefers to scold and accuse the West, to say that the West is unreasonable, to pretend that there is no conciliation and that there are no reasonable dealings or productive arrangements possible with the West because the West is demanding of the Government those things which it refuses to change.</p>

<p>What is the reality about the West&#x2019;s interest in Africa&#x003F; Since Angola, which was a watershed in our external relations, it has become perfectly clear that the West&#x2014;and here I am speaking of the responsible West, i.e. the countries we normally refer to as the Free World&#x2014;far from becoming less interested in Africa, and becoming disengaged in Southern Africa, has, in fact, come a good deal closer. What is the explanation for the presence of Dr. Kissinger in Southern Africa&#x003F; What is the reason for the renewed activity of the British Government, through Mr. Richard and others, in Southern Africa&#x003F; Why does Senator Mondale, when he goes on a European tour, to strengthen Nato, essentially, and to discuss the sinews of Nato, have, as one of the major items on his agenda, relationships in Southern Africa&#x003F; Why is it that in seeking approval for the appointment of Mr. Andrew Young, the new ambassador for the United States to the United Nations, one of the things he has to clear himself on before such appointment is approved by Congress is this question of relations with Southern Africa&#x003F; The fact is that Southern Africa has suddenly become a major issue for the West. It was never on the front burner before. It has been moved onto the front burner and the West is, in fact, keenly interested. Far from regarding Southern Africa as something to be ignored and left alone, and South Africa as something to be left to fight its own battles, the West is indeed seeking, in many ways, to get into the Southern African situation in such a way that it may exert pressure and influence in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Why is it doing this&#x003F; The fact is that the West, and America in particular, is involved in a global strategy. This global strategy is nothing new. The struggle has gone on for a long time, but since Angola something has happened concerning that global strategy. South Africa has become a part of that global strategy. I would like to quote what was said by Dr. Kissinger quite recently in a speech in Philadelphia. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">America&#x2019;s peace and safety rests crucially on a global balance of power.</block>

<p><span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0189"/>The United States, he said, could not remain indifferent to the trends in Southern Africa which have &#x201C;implications not only for the peace, independence and unity of Africa, but for global peace and stability&#x201D;. If America is involved in this degree, then quite clearly America is not going to let go of Southern Africa, and neither will the other Western powers because they, through their Nato alliances and the other combinations by which they resist the onslaughts of communism, will indeed support America in trying to ensure that a settlement is reached in Southern Africa which will firstly enable them to conduct their Southern African anti-communist exercise successfully and, secondly, which will enable them to conduct it in such a way that the manner in which they do so will not embarrass them in the other theatres of the world where this conflict is going on. There is talk in Washington of a containment strategy. There is talk there of various techniques or strategies by means of which one faces up to the communist threat. It is described in this way: In the first stage, where a situation of confrontation arises between the Free World and the communists, each of the major protagonists stakes out a claim. Each shows extreme interest. It may do this in various ways, for example, by visits of Secretaries of State, a Dr. Kissinger or a Mr. Podgorny, or by showing other direct interest in the area. It may back this up with military or economic aid and with speeches. It might even rattle the weapons it has. This is a kind of indication that claims are being staked. If in fact this confrontation continues to the point where it is likely to become highly dangerous and to draw the main protagonists, the East and the West, into direct conflict, there is then a withdrawal in terms of the agreed strategy between the East and the West that they will avoid ultimate conflict. They then also persuade their proxies, the people in the area, to withdraw and, in fact, to pull apart.</p>

<p>This is the kind of controlled strategy which is spoken of in Washington as being the way in which the East-West struggle is b&#x00E8;ing conducted. I do not say that there is an exact analogy in Southern Africa at the moment. However, the analogy applies in part. What I am saying is that the West is already practising a particular kind of strategy in respect of those areas of the world which they believe have become part of the global conflict of East versus West. In trying to win this particular conflict in this particular area of Southern Africa, as I say, we will see more of the West and not less of them. If we have complained in the past of lack of interest on the part of the West, of a reluctance on their part to immerse themselves in the affairs of Southern Africa, I think we may yet have cause to complain that they are too much with us. I think we will find that both the East and the West will be too much with us. We will have cause to hope and to pray that the West will in fact take a stronger line, a deeper interest in the affairs of this sub-continent and that they will not merely go away.</p>

<p>The fact remains that the West is seeking to deal with the affairs of this southern sub-continent on a basis which will avoid Black-White conflict. This is the essential, basic purpose. They are seeking to avoid Black-White conflict because such a conflict creates an advantage for their opponents. Black-White conflict creates the sort of situation in which the Russians, the communists, will thrive. Therefore, by definition, in order to prepare a pitch on which the communists cannot do well, one must somehow eliminate Black-White conflict. In attempting to do this, there is no question that the West will bring great pressure to bear on South Africa for reform and change. They will not do this because they wish to interfere in our internal affairs for some high moral purpose. International relations is a much tougher game than that. They want to clean up Black-White conflict situations in Southern Africa and they will stop at nothing to do it because they are determined to win the global conflict. This is why, when Mr. Young was approved as ambassador to the UNO, he in fact had to say that, if necessary, he would be prepared to take strong economic measures against us in order to clear up this Black-White issue. We may approve of this or disapprove of it. It does not really matter very much in international affairs whether one approves or does not approve and whether certain measures are fair or unfair. One has to deal with the facts as they are. This is the situation we now face.</p>

<p>I want to say that there is really only one realistic conclusion we can draw from all this. These things are happening; it is too late to wish them undone. Firstly, what we must do now is to make a realistic appreciation of <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0190"/>these things to understand what is happening and not merely to make these remarks about the West being useless, which we have heard from various parts of the House. The West is our only potential ally. Whether we like the West or not, whether the West is fair to us or not, or whether or not the West is always reasonable and votes against the resolutions we dislike at the United Nations&#x2014;and of course, we can express opinions on these things&#x2014;the fact is that the West is there, that the West is the only real antidote to a major onslaught from the communist world, and that we have somehow got to learn to live with the West. It seems to me there are two ways in which we can do this. The first is what is going on now, which is that we ourselves are not taking those initiatives which will eliminate Black/White conflict quickly enough; or if we are, the West does not think so. The West does not see evidence of it. The West is prepared to take steps, to apply pressures and in general to force the issue in this region of ours. The day is now past when South Africa, as the strongest power in this region, could itself take initiatives and persuade people to solve their problems. We are little more than a spectator in this game now. The East/West thing has taken over; we are just watching like spectators at a tennis match&#x2014;left, right; left-right. We really do not have a major part to play any longer. We certainly cannot expect to be more than consulted. We are certainly not playing a decisive role in this matter because the name of the game has changed.</p>

<p>To say these things is perhaps not popular, but these things must be said if we are to be realistic and to judge these matters correctly. We have then the option of seeing the West coming increasingly into our area, necessarily into our area because of the counter-threat from the other side. In this process, either under threat or by other compulsion, or because of necessity, we will have to come to terms with the West whether we like it or not. If we come to terms with them they will impose, directly or indirectly, modes of conduct, ways of Government, attitudes which we will not like. What South African wishes his internal policies to be dictated to him by an outside power&#x003F; Not one of us. The fact is that this is coming closer and closer and the situation is already arising where these kinds of pressures will be applied. I doubt whether we really have any answer to them. The alternative is that we do these things ourselves, of our own free will. Rather than let other people force modes of conduct and policies upon us, let us genuinely, realistically, reassess our position. Let us decide which things we have merely grown used to and think are essential to us. Let us decide which things we have merely grown used to and think are essential to us. Let us not be like the brontosaurus in the story of evolution. When the other animals learnt to fly and to crawl and so forth, the brontosaurus in his own pride and certainty&#x2014;strength, if you like&#x2014;did not adapt and the result is that the brontosaurus disappeared from the world. I would rather see that South Africans changed a great deal, even changed away from some of the things which are familiar and which they hold in affection, than that they should become extinct like the brontosaurus. This is perhaps a dramatic way of presenting it, but the facts are before us. The world in which we now live in Southern Africa has changed radically. It is no good saying the West is gone, the West is idle, the West has all these faults&#x2014;maybe it has, maybe it has not&#x2014;but the fact is that the West is the only other power in the world that has the strength to confront what is surely coming and what the hon. the Prime Minister and others have rightly predicted is coming, i.e. a major, growing influx or assault from the communist world. They are on their way. What are we going to do about it&#x003F; To say we will stand alone without the West and face the whole world without any support from the West is absolute, arrant nonsense and we all know it. If we stand we will either be destroyed where we stand or we will destroy ourselves in trying to do so because of the enormous drain it will create on all our resources. We therefore have no choice but to deal with this matter according to the realities. My purpose in standing up here is not to defend the weakness of the West, nor to apologize for the United Nations, whose actions I condemn; my purpose is to plead for realism in looking at the problems which face us, and for adaptations where necessary, of our own accord, before these things are forced upon us.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to react to the speech by the hon. <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0191"/>member for Von Brandis, because he spoke about the important far-away things in the international world outside. I should like to speak about the small, nearby things around us, and I should like to return to the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. It is a flabbergasting proposal, Mr. Speaker, I have underlined a few words in that proposal. He mentions &#x201C;no confidence&#x201D;, &#x201C;a crisis&#x201D; and the motion requests a &#x201C;new dispensation&#x201D;, &#x201C;a permanent, peaceful dispensation&#x201D;, &#x201C;new hope&#x201D;. One is surprised by the fact that, at a time like this, a motion of this nature can be moved by a party which has no confidence in itself, by a party which is staggering from crisis to crisis. I looked up the meaning of the word &#x201C;crisis&#x201D; in the dictionary. It says that it is a &#x201C;point of change&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, does it not indicate a crisis of the first water in a party which has been advocating pluralism for years, and which is now on the point of embarking upon a course which must lead to a &#x201C;common society&#x201D;&#x003F; A new political dispensation is mentioned in this motion. It is this very party which has advocated one political dispensation after the other in the course of years and has rejected each one in its turn; a party which speaks of peace but has found only discord in the search for that political dispensation; a party which mentions hope, new hope, in its motion, but which itself has come to the point where it has given up all hope so that nothing has remained for it but the dismal certainty that it has no answer to the problem of South Africa, that it has become irrelevant in South African politics and is on the point of disappearing. The UP can say to itself, to quote the immortal words of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout: &#x201C;Thank you and good-bye.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Why is the hon. Opposition in such a sorry plight today&#x003F; The Opposition is in this critical position today because it wants to attempt the impossible. These people believed&#x2014;and there were some of them who truly believed it&#x2014;that, hidden away somewhere, there had to be an undiscovered alternative to separate development. They went on a crusade in search of it, possessed by an obsession to find that alternative. There were times when the hon. the Opposition cried &#x201C;Eureka&#x201D; in triumph and in joy, like Archimedes of old, saying that they had now found that alternative, only to discover once again that it was still not the real thing.</p>

<p>The PRP is heading in the same direction. Not very long ago&#x2014;only about 15 months ago&#x2014;they changed their policy. I want to predict that this party&#x2014;if it exists long enough&#x2014;is going to hold a record which will surpass that of the UP as far as changes of policy are concerned. They are already on the eve of a new policy, a new policy which they are going to accept when their new party is formed. They take it much further than the UP. The UP has at least retained its name for more than 40 years. The PRP has changed its name twice already and is now forming a new party for the third time, as a result of which it will change its name once again.</p>

<p>The people outside ask how much longer the hon. Opposition wants to prolong this debate, the debate on its search, its futile search, for something which does not exist: An acceptable alternative to separate development. Driven on as if by instinct, the hon. Opposition has searched for that alternative. They have spent time and energy on it. They have appointed commissions&#x2014;the Mike Mitchell Commission, the Van Zyl Slabbert Commission, the Kowie Marais Commission &#x2026; they have come up with constitutional gimmicks. They have spoken of &#x201C;checks and balances&#x201D;, &#x201C;protective devices&#x201D;, &#x201C;bills of rights&#x201D; &#x2026; They have come up with a rich variety of federations. They have come up with qualified franchise in its various nuances. They have debated this alternative which they were seeking; they have argued with one another; they have split and formed new parties. What is the result of all this&#x003F; They are empty-handed today. It was a fruitless and futile exercise and a wild-goose chase. These people had to discover that there is no gold at the foot of the rainbow after all. All the energy wasted and time spent in searching for something which is not there simply represent the years which the locusts have eaten. The game was not worth the candle.</p>

<p>Now one wonders whether the Opposition will not show some realism and realize that in the eyes of the world, there is only one acceptable alternative to the policy of separate freedoms&#x2014;the hon. member for Parktown is extremely amused&#x2014;and this is &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. So far the hon. member for Houghton has been the only one <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0192"/>who has made vague movements in this direction. Even the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;and I accept that he is a very honest liberal&#x2014;is not prepared to stand for the policy of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. [Interjections.] In this debate there has been a discussion of the problems which are facing us. Indeed there are problems, but problems are there to be overcome. I believe, together with the hon. member for Simonstown, that we have the sense of calling, the will and the faith to surmount those problems. We are determining our priorities and at the moment we are giving preference to a physical and economic attempt to apply the policy of separate development forcefully, dynamically and consistently. This must be accompanied by a spiritual attempt in which we show the will, make the sacrifices and create the climate for carrying out this policy.</p>

<p>It is a vast programme which the Government has undertaken. It is a programme which can appeal to one&#x2019;s imagination and this is why the young people are behind us today. After all, it is a challenge, and young people want challenges. This is something which makes one&#x2019;s pulse race, something to excite their idealism and their willingness to make sacrifices. Our young people feel it a compelling and urgent task&#x2014;a task like that of no other country in the world&#x2014;to lead other people to the path of freedom which we have only recently found ourselves. Most of the speakers referred to Soweto as proof of the problem of our country. Conditions like those in Soweto are as contrary to our policy as they could possibly be. The population concentration in Johannesburg as a result of the discovery of gold also created other requirements there and industries were established. This resulted in more and more jobs in the secondary and tertiary sectors. An economy was built on very often cheap Bantu labour. Blacks from all eight our homelands converged on the Witwatersrand in their tens of thousands. People even came from beyond our country&#x2019;s borders in order to make a living there. We transported the raw materials to the PWV area, often from the homelands and the decentralized areas. After that workers were drawn from these areas to make a living on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>There was an ethnic jumble, which is as contrary to our policy as we could possibly imagine. A process of acculturation had begun. One had people without an identity, who became the breeding ground for the riots. This ethnic jumble of Johannesburg is our heritage. We remember very well the conditions which prevailed in places like Sophiatown, Martindale and others under the UP Government during the war years, when they converged there in their tens of thousands, when the Resettlement Council found them in those slum conditions. No less than 80 people lived on plots 50 by 50 feet and children did not know who their parents were. They lived in the most miserable conditions, where one would not allow a dog to live. This is proof of &#x201C;man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man&#x201D; which arose under this United Party Government. A process of acculturation started there and this formed the breeding ground for a condition which was highly inflammable. Therefore our priorities in this country are decentralization&#x2014;this is going to be the slogan of the decades ahead&#x2014; decentralization, decentralization and decentralization once again.</p>

<p>Every new factory which is erected in certain metropolitan areas and which is dependent upon Black labour, every additional load of raw materials which is transported to certain metropolitan areas, every new influx of Black workers to that area, will contribute to a social and political problem, which may become almost insoluble in the years ahead. In this way too&#x2014;and this is the dynamic programme which this Government is implementing&#x2014;every job which is created in the decentralized areas contributes towards a more orderly, more viable and more peaceful South Africa. We are shifting the economic activities from the metropolitan areas to the decentralized areas.</p>

<p>We need more than a fine structure. It is not difficult to sit in one&#x2019;s study and conjure up this fine structure; we need the co-operation of those people for whom the structure is meant. We must win the hearts of those people. We must make our policy acceptable to people and this is our greatest task and highest priority. The Government is going to succeed in this task. We are going to succeed in this psychological communication programme, of making the Blacks our allies and achieving consensus, as we achieved it with the people of the Transkei.</p>

<p>It is of much more than passing importance that in a time like this, when we are faced <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0193"/>with immense problems, the Government is at its strongest. The Press and the Opposition have searched frantically for a crack in the Government. I have heard that the actual expection is that a group may be drawn from the National Party as well for this new party. To me, this is the most unrealistic and the most ridiculous view one could imagine, because I do not know of any people like that. We are apeaking very frankly now. It is of more than passing importance that, in these difficult times in which we are living, the Government is at its strongest and the Opposition at its weakest. We do not say this out of malicious joy. We do not find it amusing to mock those people. Years ago, it was amusing, but it is no longer amusing today. This strength of the National Party at a time like this places an immense responsibility upon us, a responsibility which is placed upon us by the weakening of the Opposition. For the sake of a safe, peaceful, and prosperous South Africa, we shall have to accept that responsibility with courage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to what the hon. member for Port Natal had to say. He spoke enthusiastically and I am pleased that he enjoyed his contribution. However, I shall return to that hon. member&#x2019;s speech later.</p>

<p>Throughout the debate I listened to all the speakers on the Government side very attentively and with a great deal of interest in order to try and determine whether they are aware of the immensely important debate taking place in South and Southern Africa at the moment. I was not interested in bombast and rhetorical vagueness. The speech by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, for example, was characterised by this. Nor was I interested in playing the fool or in sophistic pseudo-arguments. We had a great deal of that. What I actually want to know is to what extent hon. members on that side of the House confined themselves to the actual debate, because the settlement of this debate is going to determine the future of White and Black in South Africa. The debate deals with one question only, namely what the role of the White man is going to be in South Africa and Southern Africa over the next ten years. This is the fundamental question asked by every White man in South Africa, irrespective of the political party to which he belongs or his political convictions. The same fundamental question is also in the minds of young parents who are sending their children to school for the first time, as well as in the minds of the aged when they ponder on the heritage of their descendants. This question was an entreaty of every South African, White and Black, during the six months after 16 June last year when they were waiting for the hon. the Prime Minister to give us the necessary guidance in respect of this problem. However, this question was largely ignored and evaded by the speakers on that side of the House, except for two speeches, namely the speech of the hon. the Minister of the Interior and that of the hon. member for Pretoria Central. I shall return to these two speeches in a moment. As far as this central question is concerned, one can divide the standpoints of the rest of the Government&#x2019;s speeches into two general categories. The one standpoint is that that side of the House expects of every White man in South Africa to fight to the death before the NP will be willing to give up any fundamental aspect of its policy. This was what was implied by what they said. Am I correct&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member whether he said that before we give up &#x201C;every aspect&#x201D; of our policy, or of any particular aspect&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>No. I said before they will give up any fundamental aspect of their policy, the Government will expect the White man to fight to the death. What fundamental aspects of the policy is the hon. the Deputy Minister willing to give up&#x003F; We must have clarity in this connection, because another standpoint is also being advanced together with this standpoint, namely the standpoint of the PRP. Then the Government asks the Opposition: What is your alternative&#x003F; These two standpoints testify <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0194"/>to an irremediable political ignorance. Nowhere in the world does one have the situation of a small powerless opposition being able to put a realpolitik alternative to a government. The realpolitik alternative is not put on this side of the House; it is put outside the House. The hon. the Minister of Justice had the extreme form thereof in his hands here in the House: the bomb and the grenade. This is what we have to find an answer to. We, as the Opposition, can suggest a compromise here between the obstinacy of the Government and the obstinacy of those arguments and can only hope that the Government will listen to us. If it does not want to listen to us, it still has to address itself to that debate. This is the true problem with which it is faced. Therefore, we as a White Opposition on the horns of this dilemma, have a contribution to make by pointing out the central questions at issue, the questions which have to be answered, and by providing answers to them.</p>

<p>However, the Government must not then evade those questions, because if the Government puts the price of its own position of power too high in the political market of supply and demand, then in view of the conflict situation we are in, violence is the only alternative. This is what we are already faced with. The central question is the very one which the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education asked, namely: &#x201C;What is the price of negotiation&#x003F; What is the price of the change which the Government holds out as a prospect&#x003F;&#x201D; One reaction to this question was: If violence and conflict must come, then let them come. This is what we have been told.</p>

<p>This is the role which has been prescribed for the White man for the next ten years, except in two speeches on the Government side. The hon. the Minister of Information and of the Interior was not present a moment ago, but his speech was one of these speeches and I should like to return to his speech. There was a hint of reconciliation and reasonableness in these speeches. The hon. the Minister of the Interior said that we were fallible, that we make mistakes, that we must avoid conflict and improve human relations. On the other hand the hon. member for Pretoria Central said that as long as the security and the identity of the White man was not threatened, all problems in South Africa could be settled or negotiated on the basis of consensus. Is this correct&#x003F; The hon. member said that as long as one did not threaten the security or identity of the White man, all problems &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, and sovereignty&#x2014;all the &#x201C;ty&#x2019;s&#x201D; you deal in. As long as one does not threaten them, all other problems can be tackled. These are encouraging words, but in this connection I want to quote the immortal words of the hon. the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;as a matter of fact he stole them from George Bernard Shaw&#x2014;who said: &#x201C;It is all just words, words, words!&#x201D; What does all this mean&#x003F; [Interjections.] Surely it points to an alternative other than the alternative I mentioned first, namely: &#x201C;We shall fight, struggle and disagree.&#x201D; This alternative says that the problem of the existence of White and Black in South Africa must be made negotiable. There must be negotiation. Therefore, two alternatives have come out of the debate conducted this week, of which one has been stated overwhelmingly and the other has been strongly stated by the Opposition but by some members on the opposite side, too, to a certain degree. The one says: &#x201C;Fight, struggle, disagree.&#x201D; The other says: &#x201C;We must negotiate.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Confrontation or negotiation, violence or negotiation: These are the only two possibilities which have been spelled out for the White man over the next ten years. [Interjections.] It is pointless to make a fuss about it, because it is the truth&#x2014;it is clear from the speeches. As far as this problem is concerned, the hon. the Prime Minister is a very lonely person, because he has to make the final decision as to which of these possibilities will apply to the White man in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister must tell us clearly which of these two will determine the immediate future role of the White man. If it is to be confrontation, he must tell the people of South Africa now, as Churchill did: &#x201C;All I can offer you is blood, sweat and tears.&#x201D; <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0195"/>However, if we are going to adopt the course of negotiation in the problem of the existence of White and Black in South Africa, there are a few cardinal questions which must be asked, and I should like to address these questions to the member for Pretoria Central and the hon. the Minister of the Interior. The hon. the Prime Minister is unfortunately not present at the moment. I want to ask them how they see the role of Parliament in this situation of negotiation&#x003F; The hon. member for Pretoria Central said that the Parliamentary tradition in Africa, as well as in South Africa has become obsolete.

<p>At the moment there is a Cabinet Committee which is inquiring into how we can change these things and it has been said in the Press that a report will be made on this. The hon. the Minister of Defence is serving as chairman of that committee. The other alternative which is being advanced is the question of a say at Cabinet level. If Parliament is no longer to be a forum for negotiation, there must be something else, viz. a say at Cabinet level for the various population groups. If one wants to call it a &#x201C;say&#x201D; or anything else, there is one golden rule which must apply in effective negotiations and that is that in effective negotiation there cannot be one-sided decisions. As soon as one has one-sided decisions, negotiation cannot take place. This is the difference between consultation and negotiation. When one consults somebody, one is free to accept or reject his advice. However, when one negotiates with someone, one must make a compromise with him. One must make an agreement. There can be no political settlement of a negotiation situation if there is one-sided decision-making for South Africa. Just ask the people at the Turnhalle conference. They discovered it the hard way. Does the hon. the Minister of the Interior agree with the hon. member for Pretoria Central that as long as the identity, sovereignty and security of the White man are not threatened, all problems are negotiable&#x003F; What does the hon. the Minister feel about this&#x003F; Then I ask the hon. member for Pretoria Central: If this is the case, how does he react to the proposals of the Leader of the PRP to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; Is more land negotiable for the homelands&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now quote De la Rey&#x2019;s answer, and I quote from the book <i>The Lion of the West</i> by Johannes Meintjies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Quietly, but firmly he rebuked Paul Kruger that they were all there to discuss their common cause and how best to serve it. And it was the duty of every man to speak his mind plainly. It was not right to impute to them cowardice because they differed from the violent proposals which had been made. Those who thought as he did had proved by a lifetime of service their devotion to their independence and to the interests of their country. De la Rey paused. There was a deathly silence in the hall. Then, in one of those flashes of rage that occasionally came to him, De la Rey looked up at the scowling face of Paul Kruger and said: &#x201C;I shall do my duty as the Raad decides,&#x201D; and then added, with cold contempt: &#x201C;And you!&#x201D; He looked the President straight in the eye. &#x201C;You will see me in the field fighting for our independence long after you and your party, who made war with your mouths, have fled the country.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Together with De la Rey I just want to say that we in these benches, in our very modest manner, have no patience with loudmouths either.</p>

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal briefly with something that was said by the hon. the Minister of Defence, and I quote: &#x201C;Die Leier van die Opposisie verontagsaam die betekenis van die dreigement teen die Republiek van Suid-Afrika. &#x201D; I do not believe that we do this at all. In fact, we are deeply concerned about the threat to South Africa. We are perfectly aware that the Russians have been imperialists since Catherine the Great, and anybody who reads a little in sociology or history today can see how dialectical materialism and Marxism are entering the very minds of Western thinking. Sometimes even we ourselves, who reject Marxism, find ourselves thinking in terms of a class struggle. We also see that the position in South Africa is exploited by the dialectical materialists. Some of us had the opportunity to see the film <i>Last Grave at Dimbaza,</i> and we saw quite clearly an attempt by the propagandists to depict a situation in South Africa of a classic bourgeoisie and proletariat struggle, in which the proletariat was Black and the bourgeoisie was White. All Whites were depicted as rich, successful, vigorous and athletic, with Black servants, while all Blacks were depicted as miserable, deprived, exploited, apathetic and complacent in their misery.</p>

<p>From 1906 until this decade we have not had an active imperial factor in Capricorn Africa. In the 1890s the imperial factor in Capricorn Africa was the British Empire, and to a lesser extent the German Empire of the Kaiser. The South African Republic was the <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0197"/>victim of British imperialism, and I do not believe that anyone would dispute that it was British imperialism which was the major factor in causing the Anglo Boer War. Before the Anglo Boer War the British connived at internal disorder. They organized the famous Jameson raid, or were involved in it, and they assisted the &#x201C;udlanders&#x201D; to cause riot and insurrection in the South African Republic, in fact a very similar situation to the imperial factor which is at present at work in South Africa, the Russian imperial factor. The point is&#x2014;the previous speaker perhaps emphasized it by his quotation&#x2014;that the Government of President Kruger gave a credibility to that unjustifiable imperialism &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; through their exploitation of the Uitlander question. It is not for me to postulate what would have happened in history. British imperialism was a powerful force. They might have found something else to exploit, but they exploited the injustice of the Uitlander question to justify their intervention in the affairs of the independent South African Republic. Many burgers, including General De la Rey, realized this at the time and they attempted to point out to Kruger that he could blunt the effect of British imperialism by dealing with this injustice. In exactly the same way the Nationalist Government is giving credibility to Russian imperialism in Capricorn Africa. In the Angolan affair we had a classic demonstration of how apartheid has made us untouchable even to our allies and those who desperately want our help.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there is anybody in this House who does not know of people&#x2014;if they themselves are not in the same position&#x2014;who are desperately worried, who are sick with worry, about this country. I believe that there are thousands upon thousands of people who are very deeply concerned. The thinking people and the people who read and travel, know that the Nationalist Government is the unintentional but most powerful ally of the Russians. I want to suggest four reasons for this. The first reason is that the Nationalists have polarized Black and White. They have contributed to creating confrontation in South Africa. The second reason is that the Nationalist Government have radicalized Black South African society. The present Government is not a conservative Government. It is a radical, revolutionary Government. It has cut South Africa to pieces; it has changed our traditions; and it has destroyed the whole fabric of South African society as it was before 1948. We must understand that the present situation in which we find ourselves is a direct result of the radical policies of the present Government. Furthermore, the Government has created a Black proletariat which fits perfectly into communist philosopy. The Government are the ones who describe Black people as being there for their labour only. They are the people who built hostels for migratory males, hostels which in &#x201C;Last Grave at Dimbasa&#x201D; are described as &#x201C;labour camps&#x201D;. They are the ones who have contributed to assist the Russians in their endeavours to create a Black proletariat in this country. They have deliberately avoided giving Blacks freehold title to land until recently.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Nationalist Government have tribalized White South African society. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Defence to explain himself. In his New Year&#x2019;s message he took a swipe at Lesotho and a few others. He obviously thinks that he, as Deputy Prime Minister designate, is going to have an opportunity to be Foreign Minister as well. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Afrikaner with tens of thousands of his English-speaking fellow-citizens would dig in more and more against any attempt to rob them of their land.</block>

<p>I want to ask him why he referred to only &#x201C;tens of thousands&#x201D;&#x003F; Apparently, he does not have to qualify the Afrikaner, but the English-speaking fellow South Africans he has to qualify. As a young man to an older man who has been in politics for a long time, I want to say to him: &#x201C;Hou op met sulke goed!&#x201D; [Interjections.] People in South Africa are becoming so concerned at the situation that normal conservative people who would qualify as high Tories in any other society, would be liberals by the standards of this Government because of the racial discrimination which is being applied.</p>

<p>The fourth reason why I believe that this Government is an ally of the Russians is that they have alienated us from Africa because <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0198"/>they have not understood the distaste which the Black man has for racial discrimination. The Black man does not expect a free Press and no detention without trial. He does not want a liberal society; he simply does not want to be judged in terms of his colour. This is something we have got to try to understand. I believe we can understand it if we recall a situation such as existed just after the Anglo-Boer War. At that time Milner could easily have said to the people: &#x201C;I have brought Scottish teachers here; I have given you a better education; I have taught you modern hygiene; I have given you money to build your farms&#x201D;. However, was that what the Afrikaner wanted&#x003F; Of course not. Man does not live by bread alone. Throughout this debate we have had speakers on that side telling us how much has been done, how four million people have done so much for twenty million people. I want to tell hon. members opposite that the more they do for them, the more those people will be aware that man does not live by bread alone. The Black man wants his human dignity respected. That is why it was so gladdening to hear the State President say that he respected the human rights (menswaardigheid) of every person.</p>

<p>I visited Kenya last month. By African standards Kenya is a fairly free country. Indeed, compared with other parts of Africa, it is a very free country. There we have a non-racial society in operation. There we see Black people who resent intensely and simply cannot understand racial discrimination. I spoke to many Black people there in influential positions and none of them want the White man out of South Africa. The thinking ones know that the White man is the key to the development of Capricorn Africa. What they want to get rid of is racial discrimination and the arrogance of the White man who always knows better.</p>

<p>I want to make an appeal to the Government. It is denying one of the greatest tribes of Africa its birthright, its duty and its calling. The Afrikaner people&#x2014;I am not talking about members of the Nationalist Party only&#x2014;have a contribution to make in Africa, a contribution which very few other tribes in Africa can make. But they must not make a God of their tribalism. The volk or tribe known as the Afrikaner is one of the first important significant tribes of Africa. I believe that these people are in danger of becoming irrational. I want to ask Dr. Mulder, our hon. Minister of the Interior, what he meant when he said: &#x201C;In die voortbestaan van &#x2019;n volk ken ons geen reels nie&#x201D;. As he holds a Christian world view and is consequential, one hopes that that means that all tribal shibboleths must be done away with in the struggle to find justice and righteousness in our situation, but if it means that means justify ends and that one&#x2019;s tribal, one&#x2019;s volks interest must be put above any other, I believe it is most unfortunate. I therefore do urge him to explain himself in this regard, because I believe it is inconsistent with the Christian character which one expects and knows that he claims. I hope he will give an explanation to the country, not least to his &#x201C;kerkraad&#x201D; and &#x201C;domin&#x00E9;e&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The NP Government is like a monkey which has its hand in a calabash and it is holding on to the pumpkin-pips of his blind ideology, is incapable of dropping that ideology, of pulling its hand out of the calabash and escaping into the freedom of this great country of ours. That is hy the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has taken the trouble to sacrifice the very structure of the Opposition, because he knows that we must not be party to the attitude of the monkey with his hand in the calabash who is going to be caught or shot because he cannot realize that he must escape from his blindness and enjoy a special freedom.</p>

<p>I therefore, have great pleasure in supporting my leader&#x2019;s motion of no-confidence in this Government.</p>
