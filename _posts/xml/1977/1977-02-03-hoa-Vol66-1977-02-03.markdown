<p>Mr. Speaker, if ever there was a rebuttal of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement that there was no crisis in South Africa, I believe it to be this Bill which we are now considering at Third Reading, because there is indeed no precedent in South Africa for measures of this kind, except in times of emergency, when martial law has been declared or when a state of war has been declared. Therefore, the very fact that the Government sees fit to come to Parliament with a measure of this kind is, I believe, a clear indication that South Africa has been in a crisis situation and, indeed, one might almost say, is in a permanent state of emergency. [Interjections.] I want to remind hon. members on the other side that when they were in opposition they opposed every single Indemnity Bill that was ever brought before this House, even though, as I have pointed out, the precedent has been that measures of this kind have only come before Parliament after a declared state of martial law or of emergency. I just want the House to listen to one or two quotations from Gen. Hertzog when the 1914 Indemnity Bill was discussed in this House. That was after a time of declared martial law. He said that the Bill &#x201C;would indemnify wrongdoers and protect them against claims which private individuals had against the State&#x201D;. He had the strongest objections to that. So, too, have we. He added that the Bill would &#x201C;indemnify any illegal act&#x201D;, and similarly, the Bill we are considering today will indemnify the Government against any illegal act, provided, of course, it is committed <i>bona fide.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Gen. Hertzog also talked of &#x201C;might becoming right&#x201D;. Well, if ever a statement applied to any government, it applies to the present Government in South Africa. I intend to move the same amendment at the Third Reading of this Bill that we moved at Second Reading, and that is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I am not impressed by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s objections to the procedure as far as this is concerned, and I am not particularly impressed by the objections which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana voiced when he made his Second Reading speech. Indeed, I find the actions of the Official Opposition <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0358"/>rather extraordinary, because the UP reiterated over and over again that they accepted the principle of the Bill &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member said he accepted the principle of indemnity &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; and this, Sir, is an Indemnity Bill. This Bill provides indemnity, and therefore the principle of the Bill is to provide indemnity. It is as simple as that. The hon. member, or one of his colleagues&#x2014;it might have been the hon. member for Griqualand East&#x2014;said that the UP did not object to what was in the Bill, but to what was not in the Bill.</p>

<p>Well, I must say that in all my years in this House I have never heard anybody use the explanation for voting against the Second Reading or the principle of a Bill that one is not objecting to the contents of the Bill, but to what the Bill in fact does not contain.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what in fact is not in this Bill&#x003F; What is not in this Bill is the right to compensation. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana moved an amendment, which he wanted included in the Bill, making provision for the actual right of compensation before a committee which would consider the claims of persons for compensation. Yet, Sir, if we did not have this Bill, if one voted against the principle of this Bill or moved that this Bill be not accepted, then surely exactly such a provision would remain in South Africa, allowing the right to claim compensation for wrongful actions taken by the State or any of its agents. It is therefore indeed the contents of this Bill that do away with the right of compensation. Now, it is true that the hon. the Minister and other hon. members on the Government side tell us that access to the courts of law is not being denied by this Bill. That is correct; access is not denied, but the only thing is that the cards are hopelessly stacked against the claimant, for he has to prove <i>mala fides,</i> something which everybody knows is virtually impossible, and it is made even more impossible by the fact that the <i>bona fides</i> of the action committed by the State or by any of its agents is in fact an assumption in this Bill. Therefore the claimant has to prove the opposite, and thus any act, as the hon. member for Sea Point pointed out, whether negligent or grossly negligent or wrongful, which is committed by the State or by any of its agents, is in fact condoned by this Bill as long as it has been committed in good faith, which is something one cannot disprove.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has told us that he is going to set up a committee headed by a judge, a committee which will examine the claims of what he calls &#x201C;innocent persons&#x201D;. Now, I want to say something about the proposed committee. I first of all want to emphasize once again that we on these benches welcome the setting up of such a committee to consider compensation claims as better than nothing, the giving of <i>ex gratia</i> amounts is no substitution for the right of access to the courts, access without the <i>bona fides</i> provision, which, as I say, makes the claimant&#x2019;s chances virtually nil. The setting up of this committee is what the then hon. member for Johannesburg North, Mr. Plewman, when an Indemnity Bill was being discussed in this House in 1961, a Bill which the UP opposed, called &#x201C;a sort of executive charity&#x201D;. Sir, in a way that is really what the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is asking for&#x2014;executive charity. We say that this sort of executive charity is no substitute for the ordinary right to go to the courts.</p>

<p>I want to spend a few minutes on the so-called &#x201C;innocent victim&#x201D; or &#x201C;innocent person&#x201D; concept. Such persons, it seems to me, are to be the only recipients of the executive charity. Innocent in terms of what&#x003F; That, surely, is the burning question. What criteria will be used to decide whether a person who is making a claim to the committee was innocent whilst the riots were on&#x003F; Let me give an example. Let us take the example which has occurred over and over again of a school-boy who joined in a demonstration, be it a demonstration against the use of the Afrikaans language as a teaching medium</p>

<p>The hon. member can <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0359"/>shout and scream, but that was the original spark. [Interjections.] It is not only I who say this; it was the original spark and the Government agreed. I am not saying it was the only cause of the riots by any means. Indeed, the evidence that I gave on behalf of this party to the Cilli&#x00E9; Commission says exactly that, i.e. it was a spark, but there could have been many, many other things. However, the language issue happened to be the spark. Let me return to my example: It could have been a school-boy taking part in a demonstration against Dr. Kissinger&#x2019;s visit, which also took place in this country after the unrest had started. A demonstration takes place and the school-boy is there. Some student shouts, &#x201C;Black Power!&#x201D; and some students throw rocks at the police who have arrived to disperse the demonstration which is illegal because it is out of doors and has been prohibited in terms of the Riotous Assemblies Act. Then the police shoot and the school-boy who is at the demonstration is blinded for life by bird-shot or is killed. Is such a person innocent&#x003F; Is he, if blinded, entitled to claim compensation since he did not, in fact, do anything with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm&#x003F; I should also like to know whether his parents or anybody else would be entitled to claim compensation if he was killed. We have no idea what sort of criteria will apply.</p>

<p>I want to ask again whether the criteria to be used will be ordinary common law criteria, the Riotous Assemblies Act criteria or the Police Standing Orders criteria. What criteria will be used by the standing committee as the criteria which are to be considered&#x003F; I want to point out at once that I took the good advice given to me by the hon. member for Umlazi and obtained an up-dated copy of Police Standing Orders from the Commissioner of Police. In fact, the relevant paragraph I read out is identical with the paragraph in the outdated orders. The paragraph deals with the conditions indicating when the police may shoot without being given an order by a superior officer. I admit that other paragraphs were different in their wording, and they certainly were not as eloquently worded as the original orders and they did not contain quite as many references to &#x201C;humane behaviour&#x201D;. However, they are virtually the same as the actual paragraphs that I read out. For purposes of the record, I must point out again that they do not contain the words &#x201C;when in doubt, do not shoot&#x201D;. I must say that the up-dated orders do not contain such an instruction.</p>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Minister what procedures are going to be used. Are people appearing before the committee going to be allowed to have legal assistance&#x003F; Are they going to be allowed to lead evidence&#x003F; We do know one thing about this committee. In fact, we know two things, because the hon. the Minister has told us. We know, because he has told us, and I quote, that &#x201C;this committee is not going to be Father Christmas&#x201D;, as if anybody ever expected it to be Father Christmas! We know too, because the hon. the Minister has told us, that pain and suffering are evidently not going to be one of the factors. The hon. the Minister has said that if somebody was &#x201C;skatryk&#x201D; he could not expect to get any compensation from the committee. I doubt very much whether the courts would take into consideration the question of whether a person is &#x201C;skatryk&#x201D; or not when they consider damages for pain and suffering. I foresee that people are going to have the greatest possible difficulty in getting anything, either out of the courts under this legislation or out of the Minister&#x2019;s compensation committee.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say two things. Firstly, it would have been rather nice if the hon. the Minister or any other single Government member had taken this opportunity to express sympathy and condolence with the people who suffered grievous injury or with the relatives of people who were killed during the unrest in South Africa. Not one of them took that opportunity.</p>

<p>We on these benches regard this as a rotten measure which will have far-reaching effects on the relationship between Black and White people in South Africa. We believe that it should be opposed in the strongest possible way. Secondly, I believe that this Bill need never have come before the House, or may never have come before the House, if the Government had taken steps to provide the police with proper, protective equipment at the beginning of the unrest instead of waiting until over 500 people were killed and more than 1 000 injured. I believe that it would have cut down on these fatalities enormously. Sir, the Bill would not have come before the House if the Government and the defunct <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0360"/>Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and his defunct Ministers, particularly the defunct Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, had taken timely steps to defuse the tension and burning resentments which were building up in the African townships from various underlying causes.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary at this Third Reading of the Bill and I summarize briefly the attitude of us in these benches in regard to this measure. There are two factors which have to be considered. One is the principle of indemnity, not the principle of the Bill as the hon. member for Houghton said. The other is the principle of compensation. Now, so far as the principle of indemnity in general is concerned, we accept the necessity for the principle of indemnity to be adopted where there has been large-scale violence and upheaval which necessarily had to be contained by the forces of the State. On this aspect we differ fundamentally from the PRP, who rejects the principle of indemnity <i>in toto.</i> The principle of indemnity is well known and well established, not only in South Africa, but also in Great Britain and in all the English-speaking countries of which I am aware. It has been accepted in South Africa in the recent past by Gen. Smuts, Gen. Hertzog, Dr. Malan and by the leaders of the Labour Party, both in the time of the 1913 violence on the Witwatersrand and the 1922 violence at the same place. The principle of indemnity was also clearly accepted and supported by Mr. Harry Lawrence in 1961, when he was the leading speaker on the then Indemnity Bill on behalf of the Progressive Party. He clearly accepted&#x2014;as an ex-Minister one would expect him to&#x2014;and supported the principle of indemnity. There is therefore a major departure from the standpoint adopted by all those gentlemen on the part of the hon. member for Houghton in this debate. Why does everybody, except the hon. member for Houghton, accept the principle of indemnity&#x003F; Why&#x003F; Firstly, because you cannot as a Government and as a responsible body expect your peace officers, who principally are the police and those officials who direct them, to go in fearlessly into a dangerous situation at the risk of their lives, unless they know that they will be backed by an indemnity. To put it in its converse: If you are not prepared, in proper circumstances, to accept the principle of indemnity in respect of your police when they have to operate in dangerous conditions, you are emasculating the power of the police adequately, to control a riotous situation.</p>

<p>We, as a responsible party, are not prepared to adopt that point of view. I must express my surprise that there are people in this House who are in fact prepared to accept that point of view. There is a further aspect on this principle of indemnity, namely that when involved in highly dangerous and riotous situations&#x2014;because errors of judgment can <i>bona fide</i> be made in order that the situation be contained&#x2014;one can indeed expect <i>bona fide</i> errors of judgment. Here is another reason why the principle of indemnity in this type of situation will and should be accepted by all responsible people. In the past that was the attitude which was in fact universally adopted. Inherent in the principle of indemnity, is that certain claims&#x2014;not the extreme types as suggested by the hon. member for Houghton, of gross negligence, because cases of gross negligence are almost akin to <i>mala fides.</i> Cases of this kind are not ruled out by the Bill, but would normally find their way to the courts and would not be barred by this Bill. But, Sir, there are cases where in the ordinary course a claim would lie which would be inhibited by this Bill, in fact by any indemnity Bill that one chooses to draft. I may say that in its terms, as far as the indemnity is concerned, this Bill is very little different from any other indemnity Bill that I have ever read. It is in respect of those cases and a variety of other cases of that kind that one requires, in addition to an indemnity Bill, proper measures for compensation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has conceded that there is an area where compensation should be properly paid. The hon. the Minister has, however, not clearly defined to this House the area in which he accepts that compensation should be paid, nor has he clearly indicated the type of case in respect of which he believes compensation should be paid. He has indicated the setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, but he has not told us its area of jurisdiction&#x2014;if I may use that term&#x2014;and he has not told us in any detail the method by which it will operate. I have indicated at an earlier stage, and I shall merely touch on it now, that we on these benches believe that it <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0361"/>is not sufficient for the hon. the Minister to state in general terms that he accepts that there is a field where compensation should be payable and that he proposes to set up a committee. I believe it should be done in far greater detail and with far greater clarity. It should be embodied in the legislation, in this Bill, as it was done in the Defence Amendment Act of 1976.</p>

<p>There are only two aspects of this Act to which I should like to refer. One aspect is that if the hon. the Minister disputes the amount claimed in terms of the Defence Amendment Act, then he is obliged to submit the claim to the committee set up in terms of the Act. Furthermore, there is laid down in clear terms in the Defence Amendment Act not only the composition of the committee, but also the method by which it will go about its business; that it can receive a written and oral statement, that it can hear evidence under oath and that it can hear argument from the persons or from their representatives concerned with the matter. Finally, what was most important as far as the Defence Amendment Act is concerned, is the fact that the hon. the Minister is obliged to give effect to any recommendation of the committee on compensation.</p>

<p>Having briefly referred to those aspects of the workings of the committee and its composition under the Defence Amendment Act of last year, I believe I have indicated sufficiently to the House that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement at the Second Reading in regard to compensation was wholly inadequate. I hope I have also said enough to indicate that it is not enough merely to have a ministerial statement. I do not doubt the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention, but the matter must be precisely defined and be included in legislation. It will be seen, from what I have said, that whilst we accept the principle of indemnity, we do not accept the Indemnity Bill which we are discussing at the moment because it omits an essential part of the whole process of indemnity and compensation.</p>

<p>For these reasons we do not support the measure at Third Reading and therefore wish to move the same amendment as I moved at the Second Reading, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Third Reading of the Indemnity Bill because it fails to set up machinery making provision for the payment of compensation to innocent victims who have suffered loss, damage or injury in consequence of action taken to control disorder and rioting and whose recourse through the ordinary processes of law might be barred by the provisions of the Bill.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with interest to the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Houghton as to why she would not support this legislation at the Third Reading. The hon. member referred to personalities, in our history, among others Gen. Hertzog, who, as a member of the then Opposition, opposed indemnity legislation in 1921. It is interesting that this hon. member should find a precedent in history for what they should do. That is the attitude of the hon. member, but what she did not say was that when Gen. Hertzog assumed the responsible position of Prime Minister, he and even others who succeeded him, acted in a quite different manner when they were faced with a situation such as the one the present Government and South Africa had been faced with during the past seven months. The precedent which the hon. member took from history can therefore also be quoted to prove that it is the responsibility of the authorities, when such a situation arises, to introduce a Bill which provides for the indemnity of the police and of Public Servants. The hon. member said that one must be in a state of war or in a state of emergency. South Africa is definitely not in a state of war. It is the prerogative of the State President to declare such a state if he regards a situation as being a state of emergency. I am prepared to concede that the situation in South Africa was serious at that time, but that is their decision and their responsibility. Why does one necessarily have to declare a state of emergency before action can be taken&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton: If a state of emergency had been proclaimed, would she have been in favour of indemnity&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, that is the test, because if one had had a situation where riots had been going on for months, <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0362"/>where the police had to take action and where one had to mobilize the riot police, it must have been a situation which assumed serious proportions.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We on these benches, Mr. Speaker, are obviously going to support the Third Reading of this Bill and we are going to do so for a number of reasons. The first reason is because the provisions of this legislation is nothing new and because we believe that it has become customary to give protection to our civil servants and especially to our police in the event of civil disturbances. Unless one is prepared to give legal protection to those who are responsible for putting out the fires and keeping senseless destruction to a minimum, and to those who must control the unruly and militant mobs, one will find that anarchy is the result. Those men and women who must control the situation&#x2014;as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has so rightly pointed out&#x2014; must have the confidence to do their jobs with efficiency. The hon. member for Houghton also made the point that as far as she could remember nobody has been prepared to express their sympathy with people whose relatives have lost their lives or with those who have lost property. However, I heard no word from the hon. member for Houghton, during that period, expressing her criticism of or antagonism towards people who are prepared to destroy or set fire to buildings, schools, libraries, etc.</p>

<p>*I know that hon. members on this side of the House&#x2014;as I myself have done publicly on various occasions&#x2014;expressed their sympathy with those people who lost relatives under these circumstances. We also associated ourselves with leaders among the non-Whites who asked that this situation in South Africa should be stopped. However, we did not have a squeak from the hon. member for Houghton then.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>This legislation does not exonerate anyone in the employ of the State who acts in bad faith and with malicious intent, but I refuse to believe that our police and our security forces would deliberately harm innocent people. I believe that it is their duty to act with determination against people who have revolutionary action in mind, and it has certainly been revealed, in the past eight or nine months, that there are people with revolutionary ideas in mind in this country. Nobody, however much he may be opposed to the Government or however much he may be aggrieved, frustrated or disappointed about the policies adopted by the Government&#x2014;and in this I include myself, who am opposed to the Government&#x2014; has the right to take the law into his own hands and to give vent to his feelings in an uncontrolled and violent manner. No one has the right to destroy schools and other buildings which belong to the community and to the State. It is unheard of that some people should enjoy so much freedom that they can also interfere with the freedom of others, especially the freedom of those who are law-abiding and who also detest violence and disorder, as I believe we all here do.</p>

<p>This Bill must serve as a deterrent to those who want to take the law into their own hands, to those who want to cause destruction and violence and who then want to claim compensation for any losses experienced in the process.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear during the Second Reading debate what sort of compensation committee we should like to see established. The hon. the Minister, however, has informed us that he will establish his own committee, a committee consisting of a judge, a magistrate and a practising attorney. We are prepared to accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s good intentions in this regard. We in these benches have no reason to doubt that his committee will act in anything but a reasonable and fair manner.</p>

<p>We believe the committee will do so and, therefore, any person who suffers loss innocently will have every opportunity to receive compensation. We in these benches will certainly do our duty and enquire from time to time from the hon. the Minister how his committee is progressing. We shall also be prepared to make representations on behalf of <i>bona fide</i> cases where people have suffered accidentally during the riots and disturbances.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we regard this Bill as being <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0363"/>in the interests of maintaining a peaceful South Africa. Above all, we regard this Bill as an expression of thanks to and confidence in those who have the unenviable task of maintaining peace and protecting the interests of all responsible and self-disciplined people in this country. Let people be against the Government and against the present policies in this country if they wish. However, there are those whose hatred and antagonism towards a particular regime is such that they resort to actions of destruction, actions which do immeasurable harm. Such actions can never be justified. As I have said, they can be against the Government and its policies if they wish.</p>

<p>*However, they should not allow their hate to go so far that they are prepared to harm South Africa through their actions. For that reason we support the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first instance I want to tell the Opposition that for reasons to which I shall return just now I am not prepared to accept the amendment they have moved. As far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, it is obvious that one cannot attach any real value to her actions and to her amendment. As far as the hon. member for Newton Park and his group are concerned I want to say that I do not actually know what one should call that group. Perhaps one should call them provisionally the &#x201C;South African Party&#x201D;. It would appear to me as though they are more or less fashioned on the pattern of the old Botha/Smuts South African Party. In any case, I want to thank them for their support of the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton said that there was no right to compensation. Of course, that is not so. I have already pointed out during the course of this debate that this legislation will give people the right to go to court with their claims. That right exists. However, the grounds of the claim have changed. The previous grounds were negligence while the present grounds are <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the police. However, the right and the courts are there.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is concerned I want to say that this Bill already makes provision for the right of people to go to court. However, let me first reply to the hon. member for Houghton. The compensation that we have in mind is in all cases where the State is not responsible in law and where persons have not participated in unlawful actions. This answers the question of the hon. member for Houghton as to whether a person who has taken part in an unlawful disturbance or march or attended an unlawful gathering cannot obtain compensation from the State. The reply is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. This compensation is not for people who have participated in an unlawful action in South Africa but for people in respect of whom the State has no responsibility whatever and who were not at all involved in the disturbances.</p>

<p>That makes no difference. It is only the people who were injured quite innocently who are involved here. This is an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. The reason why this has not been written into the Bill is obviously that it is purely an <i>ex gratia</i> payment that has nothing to do with the true principle of the Bill. I cannot give more information than that now. It is my intention to appoint a committee and I also intend to thrash out this whole matter departmentally and with that committee to discover precisely what has to be done, whether the committee feels that we should allow any evidence to be taken and how the compensation has to be paid. I intend subsequently to announce the names of the members of the committee in a Press statement and also to let people know to whom they have to write in order to obtain that sort of compensation. This will in all probability take place during the next few months. Hon. members are aware of the fact that the discussion of my Vote lies ahead of us, in a few months&#x2019; time, and we shall then have the opportunity of discussing other aspects of the committee in this House. For that reason I feel that I am in no way acting to the detriment of this House if at this stage I do not give full details in regard to how that committee will operate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to tell the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that in terms of the Defence Act the Minister is in fact compelled to agree to the amount of compensation awarded. I have already stated previously that <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0364"/>that compensation tribunal takes the place of the ordinary court, and this deals only with cases of <i>ex gratia</i> payments. At this stage I cannot say that we can commit ourselves to the payment of any particular amount. Everything will depend upon circumstances. I cannot imagine that we shall change any amount without due cause or without a full discussion of the facts. However, at this stage I cannot allow myself to be bound as the hon. member feels I should bind myself and as the hon. the Minister of Defence is bound in the case where the compensation tribunal is the only tribunal.</p>

<p>I want furthermore just to tell the hon. member for Houghton that the compensation that we have in mind is compensation to innocent people. I do not know whether those who participated in the procession and who have less blame than others may not also perhaps be able to obtain compensation. There are many bodies that are collecting money at the moment for the people who were involved in the disturbances. I just want to give the House a few examples in this regard so that the hon. member will know who these people are. On 16 June last year the South African Council of Churches established the so-called Asangeni emergency relief fund. This fund was established on the day on which the Council of Churches, from the nature of the news reports that they apparently received, deduced that the disturbances would be accompanied by loss of life and damage to property. That is the information as given to us. Comparatively shortly after the announcement of the establishment of the fund the South African Council of Churches contacted the General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, Dr. Allan Brash, informed him of the establishment of the fund and asked him to set the machinery of the international church body in motion in order to collect funds for the project. On 18 June 1976 the South African Council of Churches decided to set the target for the fund at R250 000. The South African Council of Churches decided on the name Asangeni for the fund in order to indicate their sympathy with the protesting students. The word means &#x201C;Come out!&#x201D; That is of course to say: &#x201C;Come out in protest against Afrikaans.&#x201D; As a result of the appeal of the S.A. Council of Churches for funds, the following round figures, <i>inter alia,</i> were received:</p>

<block name="quote">From mainly foreign sources: R147 637; From mainly local sources: R36 739.</block>

<p>These funds are, <i>inter alia,</i> applied by the S.A. Council of Churches to cover <i>ex gratia</i> payments for funerals, to study funds for alternative study facilities for Coloureds, and so forth. Besides this fund, the following organizations received financial support from abroad during 1976 for a variety of projects, chiefly also in order to cover the legal costs of accused persons in an ideological trial and to give assistance to these people and to their dependants. The Sumela trust fund whose purpose as an unregistered welfare organization was to finance the above aims received an amount of R95 078 from abroad for its aims from, <i>inter alia,</i> the British Council of Churches and the World University Exchange of Switzerland, the Church of Norway, and so forth. The Black Parents&#x2019; Association, with the aim of giving assistance to people who suffered damage during the disturbances, offer assistance in which the emphasis falls particularly on the so-called Black Power consciousness groups. They received an overall figure of R116 000, all from abroad, chiefly from Amnesty International, the Lutheran World Federation of Sweden and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to mention only one further example of the assistance that these people can obtain. The Sasol trial, as you will remember, that involved people who were concerned with Black consciousness and Black power, received an amount of R341 004 from abroad for the defence of accused people in that trial. This amount was received only for the defence of accused persons in one single court case. An amount of R21 502 was also received from a firm of attorneys in London for this purpose. The African American Institute&#x2014;whoever they may be&#x2014;contributed R221 502. The S.A. Council of Churches contributed R98 000. This brings the total amount for only this one court case to R341 004.</p>

<heading>PROHIBITION OF THE EXHIBITION OF FILMS ON SUNDAYS AND PUBLIC HOLIDAYS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#lloyd">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LLOYD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned yesterday afternoon, I had just quoted section 3 of Act no. 19 of 1895 to hon. members. It must have struck hon. members how comprehensive the provisions of the section in question still appear today. It must also have struck them what an impression of strictness, almost grimness, is conveyed even today by the provisions of the section in question. Reading the debates of those times, one does not find there the pink liberal arguments we heard here in the House yesterday, particularly from certain hon. members on that side of the House. Nor does one find there an argument larded and tinted with Afrikaner hatred against this type of legislation. One finds, though, that both the then Government in the Cape and the Opposition came close to not permitting an exception <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0366"/>such as the one which is in fact to be found in the section concerned. If it were not for the existence of the Salvation Army, no exception would, in any event, have been permitted. It is very clear that the legislators of 80 years ago were really in earnest in maintaining their principles and observation of the Sabbath. They placed a premium on their values and the protection of their values. In 1895 these people were not Afrikaners as we know them today; they would very probably have sat where the Independent United Party are sitting today. But nevertheless they did not hesitate to pass legislation to protect their own morals, norms, codes and traditions. We have already seen, in regard to the legislation on publications, that the hon. members of the Opposition&#x2014;particularly some of them&#x2014;stopped trying to protect even their own traditions a long time ago. As far as the Cape legislation is concerned one does not want to take this legislation too far, but section 6 of the Act in question even provides that when, as a special exception, an evening of music or singing was in fact permitted on a Sunday, three policemen had to be allowed to attend the concert free of charge. They had then to ensure that law and order were maintained. I can imagine that the hon. member for Houghton would have felt very unwelcome at such a music concert, due to her chronic antipathy to the police.</p>

<p>When I look at the Transvaal legislation, one finds a short section dealing with &#x201C;schouwburg-voorstellingen, publieke danspartijen en conzerten&#x201D;. All this was prohibited except for &#x201C;gewijde muziek, harddraverijen&#x201D;. The former would be punished&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste een maand of geld boete van ten hoogste vijftig pond sterling bij wanbetaling te vervangen door gevangenisstraf een maand niet te bovengaande.</block>

<p>It is therefore very clear that there were far stricter measures in force than are to be found in this Bill today. In the Free State, too, the conquerors clearly made provision for certain offences on the Sabbath in the Police Offences Ordinance of 1902. Here, however, the chief concern was billiard rooms and gambling. One sometimes wonders why provision was made for this because I can hardly imagine gambling taking place in Bloemfontein at that stage. Possibly it was to protect them from anything of the kind.</p>

<p>As far as Natal is concerned, we find that the legislation concerning non-observance of the Sabbath applicable there, only concerned two things viz. the purchase and sale of fish and meat before 9 a.m. on a Sunday. I do not think one can take it amiss of the legislators of that time for not thinking that Natal would ever progress so far in the sphere of culture that there would be concerts and film shows even on a Sunday. I therefore think that we should absolve them, because it was not their fault that legislation was not passed for Natal.</p>

<p>I now come to the final question, namely the question whether legislation such as this is essential. I want to dwell on two points only: in the first instance on the economic facts, and in the second instance, the traditional aspect of this matter. In view of the fact that we are living in times when one has to budget very carefully, I do not think any of us can understand why people should be tempted to spend money on entertainment on Sundays as well. I am not referring only to the admission fee one pays at a film show, nor am I only referring to the membership fees one has to pay to belong to a club in order to be admitted to such a show. When one looks at the drive-in theatres and one sees, even on Sundays, the long queues of cars which creep forward while we are trying to save as much fuel and energy in South Africa as possible, I cannot understand how we can condone anything of the kind or regard it as necessary or desirable. Since I am discussing the traditional aspect, I could point out that both English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people were in favour of similar legislation in the past in protection of the Sabbath. I believe that this is still the case today, because one still finds today that both English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people are in favour of this and are therefore in favour of this Bill as well. I want to quote a single example to hon. members. In a residential area within my own constituency there is a drive-in theatre. Within a radius of 2 km from that drive-in theatre there are three churches and five schools, including English-medium schools. Hon. members can imagine what dissatisfaction is caused, not only among the members of the congregation and the church councils, but also in the <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0367"/>community and the schools as such, because this drive-in theatre presents its film shows at the same time as the church services. I believe that the House ought to take cognizance of this, and I want to quote just one example of appeals which not only I, but many other hon. members, too, have received. This person writes in his capacity as head of a school of 800 pupils and a staff of 40&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek voel dit my plig om my kommer uit te spreek dat ons merk dat daar nou op Sondagaande filmvertonings by die Ster Inry-teater gehou word.

<p>It is on behalf of these people, on behalf of these parents and these children and young people that we want to thank the hon. the Minister for the fact that a uniform law is now being placed on the Statute Book, and for the fact that clarity has now, for once and for all, been obtained as regards this matter. Because a responsible Government must have the courage to introduce a measure when it is convinced that that measure is necessary, we in South Africa are obliged to support this Bill and I support it with pleasure.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would be inclined to agree with many of the ideas expressed by the hon. member on the other side, and I think many hon. members on this side will also agree with him. However, what we are really finding fault with here is the method. I suggest that what that hon. member is doing is to interpret the ideas of the people on the basis of his own point of view and not on the basis of the point of view of other people. However, I shall react to some of the points he mentioned here in the course of my speech. I therefore hope that he will not take it amiss of me if I do not do so immediately.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This kind of legislation raises a number of interesting issues. As I see it, this Bill before us embodies two principles or concepts. One is the principle of Sunday observance and the other is the way in which this is applied. I should like to deal with the manner in which this applied at the end of my speech.</p>

<p>The relationship between the Church and the State is obviously a difficult one, and in the Reform tradition, out of which the hon. the Minister of Justice and most of his colleagues come, it is one which is being discussed at great length. In fact, we even have a man in this House who obtained his doctorate on the relationship between Church and State. I am referring to an ex-&#x201C;dominee&#x201D;. We have another young ex-&#x201C;dominee&#x201D; who made his maiden speech on this issue. We also have an ex-lecturer from the University of the Orange Free State who made a maiden speech on a similar topic. So we are not without experts, in this House, on the relationship between Church and State.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that we have to think very carefully when we deal with legislation such as this, partly because, in spite of what the hon. the Minister of Justice says, this Bill does have some relationship with the Church. If we are going to make moral precepts into laws or crimes, we shall find ourselves in a very difficult position. If we are going to be consistent, why do we not make things like adultery a crime, because that is clearly forbidden in the Ten Commandments&#x003F; Furthermore, why do we not make things such as idolatry a crime&#x003F; To impose a R1 500 fine on anyone showing films, is to make disregarding Sunday a crime. We have examples of places where the communities enforce Sunday observance. Some of the members of the House may have visited a town called Staphorst which is in the polders of the Netherlands. Staphorst is a small town which literally enforces Sabbatarian principles. No one can live in Staphorst and drive around on Sundays. That is, of course, one community which has chosen to adopt the Sabbath principles completely. We have had suggestions from various people that any attempt to have legislation on social issues is, shall we say, priggish and that some people are <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0368"/>enforcing their point of view on others. I do not think that is a sensible view. Let us not be na&#x00EF;ve. We do not live in a vacuum. We have people of diverse competing points of view in our society, and the only way we are going to change things in our society is through pressure groups, through competing individuals. We know that from our caucus meetings, our committee meetings and this House itself. It does not help to talk about &#x201C;holy Joes&#x201D; or busybodies because quite honestly they are lobbyists. They represent some particular point of view, and lobbying and seeking to influence opinion-formers, lawmakers, party caucuses and congresses is a valid and very important part of our whole democratic process, even though we may disagree with the people who are doing the lobbying. Indeed, I believe we should encourage various points of view in our society. However, there are two problems which arise when we seek to pass legislation such as this. The one concerns the value system we are to use. As was said by the hon. member for Pretoria East, who has already left, how do we decide what the &#x201C;volkstradisies&#x201D; are&#x003F; How do we decide what our <i>mores</i> and our standards are to be&#x003F; How do we decide what should be of value&#x003F; I believe that this is what we have to understand.</p>

<p>There are various points of view. There is, for example, the Marxist point of view. The Marxists pursue their point of view very vigorously. Let me give an example of the kind of commitment a Marxist would have to passing legislation that would be the Marxist&#x2019;s equivalent of some of our Christian legislation of which this Bill is an example. I have here some of the slogans which are at present being published all over Maputo for the Frelimo Congress: &#x201C;Let us consolidate popular democracy, the base of socialism&#x201D;; &#x201C;long live the dictatorship of the proletariat, the highest form of democracy&#x201D;; &#x201C;long live the ideas of Marx and Engels&#x201D;; &#x201C;let us resolutely support the total liberation of Africa&#x201D;; &#x201C;down with colonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism&#x201D;; and so on. That is one point of view. Although we in the House do not agree with it, they pursue their point of view.</p>

<p>There is another system of values we know well, viz. the liberal or the libertarian view which is based on the humanistic position of Seneca that man is the measure of all things. This leads to relativism and existentialism and the despair, hopelessness and hedonism that characterize the West and are reflected in so much of the art, literature and films we have to deal with. At the same time it also provides a great measure of personal freedom, although we all know now of the famous statement that &#x201C;all men must be free, provided that they are free to be liberal&#x201D;. We may well decide that the personal freedom is not worth what comes with it.</p>

<p>Then there are also Christian views in society. Let us not be na&#x00EF;ve: Christians are commanded as a matter of their faith to express themselves on society. The South African Council of Churches is constantly telling us to do this, as is the Christian Institute. I notice, however, that they have said nothing about Sunday observance. The Scriptures make it quite clear that the Christian must also have a mind. He must have a Christian view of life and society and &#x201C;new wine must go into new wine skins&#x201D;. Paul put it very graphically when he said: &#x201C;Do not be squeezed into the mould of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your thinking.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In this House we stand in two great traditions. On the one hand there is the Dutch tradition of Groen van Prinsterer, Abraham Kuyper and perhaps now Dooyeweerd. On the other hand there is the British tradition. The British tradition never had any qualms about imposing its Christian viewpoint. It immediately abolished &#x201C;suttee&#x201D; the burning of wives in India. It opposes ritual murders, such as child murder. We oppose witchcraft. In the Bill before the House, as in other Bills, the same principle applies. Indeed, the history of Western democracy, and its strength, lies in its Christian roots. Ultimately, true justice can only derive its authority from God, and the value of man from the value of God. A famous British Prime Minister, William Pitt, said to the British people: &#x201C;You must seek to be governed by men who are governed by God, or else you will be governed by tyrants.&#x201D; That is true, because if we really believed in the sovereignty of God&#x2014; incidentally, the first of Kowie Marais&#x2019; 14 principles emphasizes this fact&#x2014;then we do not really need a Bill of Human Rights. If we, as men who stand in public life, really believe we exercise a trust from God, we look after every man&#x2019;s rights and interests. I <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0369"/>believe the Christian acknowledges that there is a causal relationship between honouring God and his standards and the happiness and/or prosperity of the individual or the community. It runs right through the Christian Bible that if you honour God, God will honour you, and if you dishonour God, you will be dishonoured. This was the whole theme of the prophets Isaiah and Amos. This is also much of the thinking behind the legislation we have before us. To suggest that the Christian has no right to pursue his view of life and society and to seek to have that embodied in legislation, is nonsense and I reject it. The Christian&#x2014;and his ancestors in religion, the Jews&#x2014;believes that God has given certain standards that must be maintained.</p>

<p>One of the problems is where we should draw the line as Christian people. Christians themselves disagree in their views of the Sabbath. There are those who are Sabbatarians and who stand mostly in the reform tradition, which is that Sunday should be a Sabbath, similar to the Old Testament tradition of the Sabbath. Then there are those Christians who hold the view that Sunday should be similar to the Sabbath, but that they should not be bound by that&#x2014;a middle position as it were. Then there are those Christians who in most cases represent Catholic traditions who seem to have a very relaxed attitude to the Sunday. I would say that most South Africans who are church-members support either the Sabbatarian view or the view that Sunday is a special day that must be set aside or, as my leader in Natal, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, put it, who perhaps share that slightly old-fashioned view.</p>

<p>In Natal we have had an interesting history of Sunday observance. In fact we are the only province which has not had a Sunday Observance Ordinance. I think this is partly because nobody ever thought it was necessary in the old days, because Sunday observance was generally held in high regard. We had the beginning of sport in Natal some years ago on Sunday afternoons, so as not to clash with church times and, in fact, in Natal there is no organized sport on Sunday mornings. The Durban Symphony Orchestra plays on a Sunday afternoon, in the same way that the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra plays on a Sunday evening at 8.45 p.m., therefore after the church services. Then we had the introduction of the showing of films. This was a change, because this was a deliberate attempt to commercialize the Sunday. It was a deliberate attempt to break down what I venture to call the customary law of Natal, which was that Sunday should be God&#x2019;s day. I believe that the film companies saw television on the way and then decided that they had to establish themselves with the Sunday viewing public to prevent incurring losses when television arrived. But this has been presented in Natal as though the showing of films has been going on for 50 years and any attempt to stop the showing of films was regarded as being a &#x201C;killjoy&#x201D;, a wet blanket, a reactionary attitude, which it was not. Indeed, if we like these leftist terms such as &#x201C;reactionary&#x201D;, it was the people who started showing films who were reactionary. There have been various specious arguments in the debate in Natal on Sunday films, e.g. that there are the Hindus who do not have a Sunday.</p>

<p>The Hindus, however, do not have any particular day of worship and I know that many devout Hindus appreciate the fact that there is one day, whatever day it may be, which is set aside in our country when they can have their religious services. The only genuine religious groups which are affected are small groups: the Jewish community, the Muslims and some of the other smaller church groups, such as the Seventh Day Adventists, etc. But I do not believe that they are being severely circumscribed by our Sunday laws.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you how we dealt with this matter in Natal. We had in my constituency in the borough of Pinetown an attempt to get Sunday cinemas going. In fact they started showing films on Sundays, but we approached the matter in a way in which I believe it should be approached, namely at local level. There was of course immediately controversy and the local newspaper played it up. I believed it was important that there should be a public statement from the most senior public representative in his personal capacity. I wrote a letter which was blazoned all over the newspaper. We then held a referendum&#x2014;the town council is a democratic body&#x2014;and the result of the referendum was very interesting. There was a very small percentage poll&#x2014;less than 20%&#x2014;which showed that most people were perfectly <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0370"/>happy with the Sunday position as it was and were not particularly interested whether cinemas were open or not. The people in favour of the cinemas won by a minute margin of about one percent. Quite rightly the town council took that as an indication that they should decide. I made sure that I lobbied various ministers of the churches by sending them telegrams and I know that people also contacted the council. The Pinetown council threw out Sunday cinemas. It then, if you do not mind, had to ask the police to prosecute because the cinema-owners were not prepared to accept the decision, which gives one a good indication of the kind of determination they have. Then, as a result of prosecution, they were turned down. I received a great deal of correspondence with regard to this matter. A lot of it was anti and some of it was pro. I want to read just one paragraph from a letter from a member of my constituency. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to assure you that if ever, when the NP might put forward a candidate, you may be sure of the support of me and my wife although we may previously have supported the NP.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this whole controversy in Natal there was dead silence from the Nationalist MPs, and particularly the few in Durban. It was possibly because they were nervous of the political implications of the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe we have to oppose this Bill. I might say that I was astonished at &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I should add, by the way, that the cinemas involved in the Sunday shows business in Pinetown have since encountered very serious financial problems. Of course, the people of Pinetown are convinced of the relation between showing films on Sunday and financial difficulties. I do not necessarily share their conviction; it is a superstition, if you want to call it that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park proposed that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. Well, I am astonished that he should suggest such a thing, and I believe it reflects very badly on the parliamentary competence of that party that they should want a Select Committee for a tiny little Bill dealing with such an unimportant matter; not only unimportant, but which only concerns cinemas. Mr. Speaker, to waste the time of a Select Committee with an issue of this nature, is to my mind most unfortunate, because this Bill is only a partial Bill. It does not deal adequately with all the other issues associated with Sunday observance, matters which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North raised. There are many things other than cinemas which are involved, and if we want to raise the whole issue of Sunday observance we should do it by means of a proper commission of inquiry. We have had that already. Not only that. In South West Africa, where they had it, it was found that people had to change their attitude to Sunday observance, because it is a very complicated matter. I am surprised that they want a Select Committee on films only. If they had proposed a motion asking for a broader investigation, it would have been different.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the second reason why we do not support this Bill, is because it is one of those &#x201C;permit&#x201D; Bills. This Government believes in the rule by law, by law in the breach. It is like job reservation: everything has to be done with a permit. I want to suggest that this is not a healthy principle in legislation.</p>

<p>The third, and major, reason why I find that I cannot support this Bill&#x2014;and my party cannot either&#x2014;is because it forces a central Government edict down the throat of local authorities. I believe that this should be left to local sensitivity. I accept that the hon. the Minister may well administer this legislation carefully and that magistrates will have authority to give permission, and so on. However, I believe that it should be put into law. Mr. Speaker, this is not the first Bill concerning Christian principles which we have had since I have been in Parliament. The very first Bill that had the whole Christian concept written into it, was the Publications Control Bill, introduced by the hon. the Minister of the Interior. Mr. Speaker, he realized that he ought to have local knowledge. That is why, in the new Censorship Bill, he introduced the concept of local committees, and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North has co-operated positively in getting the particular parochial point of view in Pietermaritzburg represented on one of those committees. Surely, it is an important principle which the hon. the Minister of the Interior recognized in that Bill. Now, why does not the hon. the <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0371"/>Minister of Justice do the same in this particular situation&#x003F; However, I want to sound a note of warning. I believe that most people in South Africa support Christian principles and many of them appreciate the fact that this Government has passed many Bills and has taken a stand on what they would describe as Christian or religious principles. This, however, demands consistency. It is a two-edged sword. Many people, religious people, are deeply disturbed by a Bill like this because they feel that it is straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel.</p>

<p>Somebody once said to me that in South Africa the people are very interested in all the hot-blooded sins, while the cold-blooded sins are ignored. The Bible has a lot to say to us about hot-blooded and cold-blooded sins. I borrowed this Bible from one of my colleagues who keeps it on his shelf; it is not as dusty as I thought it might be. [Interjections.] Unfortunately my Bible is at home. If we read in the Book of Isaiah&#x2014;I do not want to read it because I am sure that the hon. members know it &#x2026; [Interjections.] No, I know where it is, but we have had enough quotations from the Scriptures today. We can also read from Amos. [Interjections.] Let me read it to you, Sir, since hon. members seem to doubt my Biblical knowledge. I am reading from Amos, Chapter VI&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(they) that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall.</block>

<p>He goes further and asks these people why they care nothing for the fruit of righteousness and turn it into hemlock. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, have we not taken to us horns by our own strength&#x003F; But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, a house of Israel &#x2026;</block>

<p>The fact that the prophets emphasize all the time is that it is not sufficient to be pious. Piety is a good thing; it does not say that piety is wrong. The Lord Jesus said the same thing, i.e. that there is nothing wrong with being pious, but then one must be consistent.</p>

<p>When I was in Kenya last month with many Black Christian people, who were very interested in the whole South African situation, I found that they were deeply disturbed about the fact that much of what is done in this country, in the form of cold-blooded sins, much as they would have supported some of the ideas in a Bill such as this, was done by a Government and a party which claims the name of Christians.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for Pinetown has left the House in confounded confusion. I think we all appreciate that he has personal views that coincide with the Christian view. I have here the statement to which he referred, and which was published in the <i>Highway Mail</i> of 15 August 1975. The headline reads: &#x201C;M.P.&#x2019;s &#x2018;No&#x2019; to Sunday Cinema&#x201D;. The hon. member sent a statement to this newspaper and I would like to read some passages from it. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There seems a very curious point of view, that Christians should not propagate a Sunday as a special day for God, but rather retire to their little Christian communities and seek not to have any influence on society at large.</block>

<p>That is his one statement. He concludes by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope that all God-fearing people will vote against Sunday cinema and for the concept of Sunday as God&#x2019;s day.</block>

<p>Today, constricted by his membership of a caucus, he adopts a different attitude. I am reminded of Peter, who said one thing in the company of the disciples, while when he was in the company of other people, he said something different. Then he heard the cock crow.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, he opposed the principle of cinemas on a Sunday. He opposed the principle in that particular locality, because that is where it was at stake. It was a referendum in the local community. What was at stake, was a referendum in the local community. Let me deal with this aspect of whether it should be a decision of the local community, or a decision of the community as a whole. I would like to know, in view of his specific statement that there is a curious point of view that Christians should not propagate Sunday as a special day of God, but should rather retire into their little Christian communities, whether he now retires into his own little Christian community in Pinetown&#x003F; If people have moral principles, then they should also have the moral courage to accept the responsibility of taking decisions based on those principles when discussion takes place on those matters. The idea of leaving this whole issue to local communities is nothing but escapism from the idea of accepting responsibility for moral principles. To my mind the same applies to the suggestion that this first be referred to a Select Committee. I believe that this is an issue which this House has to deal with now and that we must accept the responsibility of voting in terms of our moral principles.</p>

<p>The Minister can. What I would like to stress here is that this is not a question of being against or for the idea of having cinema shows on a Sunday. The principle involved is the commercialization of cinemas on a Sunday. The hon. member for Pinetown also dealt with this particular issue. He said that there were other issues at stake, and asked: &#x201C;Why doesn&#x2019;t one impose one&#x2019;s view on adultery in legislation&#x003F;&#x201D; Adultery is not a question of commercialization.

<p>Of course I am not! [Interjections.] It becomes commercialized for many of my friends; I agree [Interjections.] the question of the responsibility of the State in regard to the question of commercialization comes into this aspect when it comes to brothels. If hon. members say that in the case of moral decisions it should be left to the local community, would any one of them have the courage to say that the question of allowing commercialized brothels should also be left to the local community, or do hon. members accept that they have a responsibility to the community at large in this regard&#x003F; It is the principle of commercialization that has to be decided here, and not the question of whether or not a community can show films when no entrance fee is involved.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the aspect of the hon. the Minister imposing the views of a section of the society on the community at large. It has been said that the hon. the Minister is imposing the will of a section of the community&#x2014;not only Christians, but specifically Calvinists&#x2014;on the community at large. The hon. member for Pinetown has already referred to the fact that throughout the whole history of Natal Sunday films had never been shown until the introduction of television. Why then try to create the impression that the hon. the Minister is now imposing his views in a bullying manner on Natal&#x003F; Certainly, there is no change whatsoever in terms of the history of this practice in Natal. Surely, hon. members must accept that in view of Natal&#x2019;s history there is no question of imposing a will that is foreign to Natal. Throughout the years Natal has had no commercialized Sunday cinemas. It is only now that this issue has been raised that we find the very lame excuse that it is because of the effect of television on cinema attendance.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have dealt specifically with this idea that people have their own personal views in regard to this matter. I accept that Mr. Hanekom and Mr. Van Lingen might have said something in the provincial council, but here we have the specific example of the hon. member for Pinetown saying something to his constituents, <span class="col_711-712" refersTo="page_0373"/>and then saying something else here in Parliament.</p>

<p>This is not a complicated Bill, which deals with many principles and points; it is a very simple issue. The issue at stake is whether we are in favour of commercializing Sunday cinemas. If Sunday cinemas on a commercial basis should be approved, then why not extend commercialization to the whole field&#x003F; Why not allow every single shop to be open on a Sunday&#x003F; Why should we then accept Sunday as a day of rest at all&#x003F;</p>

<p>*I am of the opinion that it will be no solution whatsoever to allow the local community to decide on this. Yesterday attention was drawn to the fact that many drive-in theatres do not fall within a municipal area. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana asked which authority has jurisdiction. He received the answer that it is the provincial authority. If the provincial authority already has to take decisions on drive-in theatres outside municipal areas, what moral justification would there be if they, as the chief authority in the province, were to take a decision in respect of drive-in theatres outside municipal areas, while the local authorities on the other side of the boundary could take a different decision in respect of drive-in theatres or cinemas within their area. Surely a principle is at stake in this matter and the principle is not the participation in entertainment. The principle is the commercialization of an entertainment industry on a large scale. Therefore I feel that if the provincial authorities would be prepared to take up a standpoint, they should take the decision. However, if they say that they are not prepared to take up a standpoint and leave such a decision to those areas with local authorities, while those who are outside, can do as they like, they are shirking their responsibilities just as the Opposition is trying to pass their responsibilities on to others. They do not have the moral courage to exercise their responsibilities themselves.</p>

<p>I know of cases where local authorities do have regulations prohibiting cinema shows on Sundays, while drive-in cinemas situated just outside the area of the local authority and not subject to their authority, screen films. Owners of drive-in cinemas inside the municipal areas, because they were subject to unfair competition, felt against their own principles that they were also being forced to continue screening films on Sundays. Where such screenings were prohibited, they tried to circumvent the law by forming a club and charging membership fees. This legislation will place everyone on an equal basis and it will not subject certain people to unfair competition in contrast to people outside municipal areas. If one has principles, one must also have the courage to take up a standpoint according to one&#x2019;s principles.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so far in this debate we have had a variety of interpretations and expositions of this Bill and of justifications for this Bill. We have just heard a new one, but I am still completely unconvinced. We have heard of commercialization and now on top of this we have just heard of the commercialization of adultery. This is a new idea to me&#x2014;because I have never heard of it before&#x2014;but there will probably always be something new from Klip River. We have heard about the desecration of the Sabbath and yesterday it was even suggested from the depths of a back bench that if we did not accept this legislation, we should have to&#x2014;I quote&#x2014;&#x201C;conform and capitulate&#x201D;; we should have to surrender to &#x201C;the permissive world which naturally wants to plough us under&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, can one be more foolish than this&#x003F; If one listens to some of the supporters of this Bill, one would swear that without this legislation everyone would be under an obligation to attend a film show on a Sunday and if anyone did, he would be on the road to hell. What can one do with people like this&#x003F; It is difficult to react to such twaddle, or, as we say in the Free State, &#x201C;nonsens&#x201D;. To oppose this Bill does not imply that one wants to desecrate the Sabbath or change its nature. All we want, is for the State not to interfere with the activities of the individual. It is not an argument for licentiousness. On the contrary, it is an argument for the individual and his community to use their own good sense in matters of this nature. Why does the Government not want to allow this&#x003F; No explanation has yet been given for this in the House, and I shall therefore try to do so.</p>

<p>My explanation may not meet with general approval, but I am nevertheless of the opinion that there are grounds for my argument. As I have already indicated, what we are primarily concerned with in this Bill is with the <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0374"/>question of the right and the freedom of the individual <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the State. The Afrikaner as an Afrikaner attaches great value to personal as well as group freedom. Indeed he is&#x2014;as some of my friends on the opposite side will know&#x2014;the product of a struggle for freedom, a struggle in which the individual played a very important role. Afrikaners take a pride in being regarded as &#x201C;children of the protest&#x201D;, protest against something which they do not like, or protest against any conflicting interests which restrict their freedom in any way. Moreover, the Afrikaner does not begrudge other individuals this right and this freedom. But what about the National Party&#x003F; It has a different approach, as the hon. member for Klip River showed us a moment ago. Unfortunately, the freedom of the individual is something for which the party has very little feeling indeed. He said a great deal about general freedom, about freedom for the people as a whole!</p>

<p>No. The NP speaks about the freedom of the people, but when it comes to the freedom of the individual, it stops short. Then it seems as if there is a growth in its throat.

They are in hot water! I maintain that in this Bill we have proof of how little feeling the National Party has for the freedom of the individual, because the party does not allow the individual to use his own judgment. After all, this is the ultimate effect of this Bill. It does not give the individual the freedom to decide for himself whether he wants to go to a cinema on a Sunday or not.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the whole issue. This is what it is all about. The State must decide; the hon. the Minister must decide; the National Party must decide. Here we have another question which evidently, as far as the NP is concerned, is not negotiable at all. The party will have its say, and one must accept this or you will get it in the neck&#x2014;one or the other.</p>

<p>Some of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own supporters sitting behind him want the Government to go very much further than this Bill. They want to interfere with the rights of the individual elsewhere. When are we going to get this&#x003F; How long must we wait before it comes&#x003F; Because the NP does not trust the individual, it always has to make a law to force the individual to do this or that. If this was not so, why have they come forward with this Bill&#x003F; Why does the Government not leave it to the individual to decide&#x003F; After all, hon. members on the opposite side will agree with me that there are many spheres in life in which the State has no jurisdiction whatsoever and ought not have any jurisdiction either. As I have said before, I maintain that the Afrikaner as an Afrikaner would not have made a law like this; he would have left it to the individual to decide, because this is a right which he does not begrudge himself and others. I simply do not believe that a majority of the White population in this country want this legislation. There may be a minority who want it, and they are the people to whom the Minister is listening. Why is he doing this&#x003F; It seems inexplicable to me.</p>

If, however, they were to be asked as members of the NP and the whip had cracked, my goodness!&#x2014;then they would be as quiet as mice and one would never hear anything from them again. We are told that every one of the party congresses of the NP decided that they want this measure. Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard of any resolution not being adopted by an NP congress once the whip had cracked&#x003F; So what value can we attach to this&#x003F; What expression is that of public opinion&#x003F; As I have said, this Bill will be rejected by the vast majority of Afrikaners.</p>

<p>There are other reasons why Afrikaners and thousands of non-Afrikaners want to reject this Bill. They know that one cannot try to turn a community or an individual into a moral one by means of legislation&#x2014; ultimately this is another of the objectives which the State has in mind with this Bill. In spite of what the NP may say or think in this case, legislation is for other purposes. One will not be excluded from heaven just because one went to a cinema on Sunday.

<p>When I was at school, one could not play any sport on a Sunday. Since that time all this has changed. Today there are many clergymen who are not opposed to sport on Sundays. They are on record. All they ask is that members of their congregation attend church at least once per day. After or before that they can do what they think best. The same principle holds good for film shows. Until recently in the Free State there was a law against fishing on a Sunday. Can you imagine, Sir, what would happen if someone wanted to implement that type of law today&#x003F; He would come to grief. Times and people have changed. It is just the NP which has not changed and which cannot understand these things. The whole conception of the desecration of the Sabbath has changed, not necessarily for the worse. There is a reality somewhere, which must be taken into account and we must reflect on these things in this House. Those who think that the church must be protected or saved by ensuring that it is not thwarted by film shows being allowed on Sundays, should rethink the matter. How many regular churchgoers will stay away from church just because they want to see a film on a Sunday night which they can see any other night of the week&#x003F; How <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0376"/>many of them&#x003F; Churches do not need this kind of assistance, support or protection. Their continued existence does not depend on this type of thing. Inherently the church is strong enough to survive. It has survived through the centuries; it is not going to be affected by petty legislation such as this. But on the other hand, this law can do a great deal of damage. We all realize that much more serious sins are committed on Sundays than going to a cinema. I shall not digress on this. The hon. the Minister will know what I mean, because a word to the wise is enough. Speaking of sin, I should like to refer to the opinion of a highly respected academic of Potchefstroom, Prof. J. D. van der Vyver, on the role of the State and the Church in this regard. Referring to the possibility of this type of legislation he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Legislation to prohibit the showing of films in cinemas on Sundays would most emphatically contradict Calvinist teaching. Prof, van der Vyver, head of the Department of Legal Philosophy at Potchefstroom, says that since early times South Africa has fallen victim to the notion that the State has a duty to preserve religious scruples.</block>

<p>Here is a man of high academic standing and he knows what he is talking about. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is evidenced by the variety of legal restrictions in the area of religious principles, including a series of Sunday-observance laws covering a wide range of activities, which if they were to be performed on a Sunday, would constitute criminal offences.</block>

<p>He went on to refer to what had happened in Durban and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This decision of the Durban Corporation is clearly in keeping with Calvinist doctrine requiring a hands-off policy to be preserved by the State in the area of religion.</block>

<p>What is the answer to a &#x201C;hand-off policy to be preserved by the State in the area of religion&#x201D;&#x003F; What do hon. members say now&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is one last matter which I should like to raise. Up to now I have confined myself to the commercial film industry, but there is something else to which passing references have been made. One of the serious effects which this Bill will have, is on the future of <i>bona fide</i> film societies. As my colleague the hon. member for Sandton indicated yesterday, it would be tragic if these societies were to cease existing. I should like to explain for the edification of the House that these societies must be distinguished from the film industry and Sunday film clubs. I am not referring to them now; I am referring to the film societies. They are voluntary and non-profit-making organizations which aim to advance the propagation of the cinematic art as a cultural and educational medium. For various reasons which you will appreciate, Mr. Speaker, the film shows take place on Sunday evenings. Of course, the Bill does provide for exemption, either in general, in a particular case or in cases of a particular nature. One hopes that exemption will be granted to <i>bona fide</i> film societies because most of them do good and constructive work, at least most of them. Exemption procedures are, however, highly undesirable in principle, and sometimes their operation is very cumbersome in practice, they are arbitrary and also cause uncertainty. One would prefer to see film societies continuing to make use of such facilities as they are able to obtain for presenting Sunday shows.</p>

<p>To summarize I should just like to say that I am opposed to this Bill for four important reasons. In the first place it is not in the public interest to pass legislation of this nature, <i>inter alia,</i> because it creates the danger of discrediting the law in the eyes of large sections of our community. This is a very real danger. The second reason is that I am convinced that this type of legislation is condemned and rejected by the vast majority of the population. It is unnecessary. In the third place it endangers the future of <i>bona fide</i> film societies and in the fourth place&#x2014; something to which we shall all have to give serious consideration&#x2014;this legislation will once again make South Africa a world exception. As far as my knowledge and information go, the showing of films on Sundays is not prohibited anywhere else on earth. In other words, Mr. Speaker, if we pass this legislation, we shall once again be making ourselves ludricous in the eyes of the world outside. This is a danger which we should try to avoid at all costs.</p>

<p><span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0377"/>Mr. Speaker, for this reason and for many other reasons which, because of the time factor, I am unable to mention now&#x2014;some of which have already been mentioned by the hon. member for Sandton&#x2014;I and my party cannot support this Bill. We agree with the amendment of the UP. We feel, however, that their amendment does not go far enough, and we should like to give it an extra dimension. For that reason I should like to move an amendment to the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end &#x201C;and further because the provisions of the Bill constitute a grave infringement of the personal rights of individuals and communities&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can summarize the speech by the hon. member for Parktown by simply referring to a joke about the little boy who had to go to church against his will. When he came back from church and his mother asked him what the subject of the minister&#x2019;s sermon had been, his answer was that the minister had preached about sin. When his mother asked him what the minister had said about sin, the little boy&#x2019;s answer was simply: He is against it.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to allege that that hon. member is in favour of sin. What I can say about him, is that he is against this legislation. The hon. member referred scornfully to what the Free Staters had to say but I think he has been away from the Free State for too long now and has therefore apparently lost all contact with the Afrikaner and his sense of values. If there is one thing of which I have become convinced in this debate, it is that there is a necessity for uniformity on this sort of matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klip River demonstrated very clearly what the net effect would be of the acceptance of the amendments which have just been proposed. It would boil down to the fact that we in this country could possibly create a situation in which increasing commercialization of Sunday took place and in which, within the same community, some cinemas would be closed and others open, depending on how and where the boundaries of the provincial or local authorities lay. The Government is not prepared to evade its responsibility and it will therefore honour its responsibility in this regard. The whole drift of the argument of the hon. member who has just sat down was one of a permissive spirit&#x2014;let everyone judge for himself! He adopted the same standpoint three years ago when we were concerned with legislation aimed at control of publications. Since he referred scornfully to the standpoint of the Afrikaner and to that of the NP &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member that were it not for that standpoint&#x2014;which he calls a narrow&#x002D;minded, &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; standpoint&#x2014;this country would not have had the degree of freedom for all its inhabitants that it has today. I shall return to a full analysis of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech at a later stage, but before I do that I want to refer to certain remarks uttered by hon. members opposite in the course of the debate.</p>

<p>It amazes me how often we find that members either do not listen to the introductory speech of a Minister or have not read the legislation properly. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, amongst other things, that the Bill did not alter the opinions of Hindus, Jews and other groups which he mentioned, in regard to the exhibition of films on a Sunday. However, the hon. the Minister stated emphatically in his Second Reading speech that it was not the task of the Government to alter people&#x2019;s opinions and that it was not the task of the Government to send people to church. That was out of the question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central said, amongst other things, that the Bill was drafted on the assumption that South Africa has a homogeneous community. This is surely not true. If it were true, provision would not have been made for the cases in which permission may be granted in accordance with clause 2(1). The hon. member also said that the Bill encroached upon the rights of certain religious denominations. Surely this is also untrue. <span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0378"/>The hon. member for Vereeniging replied conclusively to that and pointed out with reference to the case of Chatsworth, for example, that if the Hindu community, which has a specific viewpoint about this type of thing, were to approach the hon. the Minister with a request in accordance with the provisions of clause 2(1), it is quite possible that an exception would be made. Such an exception, however, would most definitely not be made within the White community, as the White community of South Africa has a definite view on matters of this nature. That is what it is all about. The hon. member for Durban Central threw up his hands melodramatically and said: &#x201C;It is a cruel Bill, people are forced &#x2026;&#x201D; One really does not even want to react to such statements. The culmination of his argument, the peculiarity of his argument, if I may put it that way, emerged when he said that according to sociologists, the most suicides take place on Sunday afternoons and Sunday evenings, apparently because people are lonely and do not know what to do. He then urged us not to accept the legislation for that very reason. It is the same sort of argument as the one of the man who says that he does not sleep on a bed because statistics show that it is the most dangerous thing on earth&#x2014;most people die on a bed. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Next I come to the hon. member for Newton Park. I am deeply disappointed in the standpoint which the hon. member has adopted. He has said that commercialization is already taking place because there are many businesses that open on Sundays.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North sang the same tune. He also spoke of the &#x201C;big-money business&#x201D; that goes on on Sundays. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana, as well as the hon. member for Sandton, also put forward the argument that because there is now an increasing tendency, and because it is a modern tendency, for certain business practices to take place on Sundays in the form of certain entertainments which are offered and for which admission is charged, we may as well conform and give up and not go ahead with this sort of legislation. I can still understand the hon. member for Newton Park advancing such an argument because he is not a lawyer. However, it astounds me that the hon. members for Umhlatuzana and Sandton should put forward this sort of argument. I should like to refer them to the very well-known judgment of the late Chief Justice L. C. Steyn in the case <i>Publications Control Board</i> v. <i>William Heinemann Ltd. and Others,</i> 1965, Vol. 4 of the S.A. Law Reports. On page 148 he says the following, after referring to certain sworn statements which had been submitted as evidence and in which there was reference to similar passages in recognized publications&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These affidavits, however, also contain statements to the effect that it has for a long time become permissible for a novelist to employ a frankness of language in giving detailed descriptions of sexual incidents; that the standards of the present-day community are such that descriptions of that nature have become accepted, provided there is no undue indulgence in sensuality, no unnecessary vulgarity and no exploitation of sex as the major or dominant theme; that honest and candid descriptions of sexual relations are accepted by the reading public as part of the normal pattern of fictional writing, and are no longer regarded as indecent or obscene merely because they deal with sex; and that contemporary society has for many years accepted that no subject should be barred to a writer, as long as it is handled sincerely and without undue vulgarity.</block>

<p>This is precisely the same argument as the one we received from that side: Because this sort of phenomenon exists in other spheres anyway, leave it alone; it is modem development, as the hon. member for Newton Park <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0379"/>said. Concerning this argument, the late Chief Justice Steyn said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case, the prevalence of similar contemporary reading matter, which may itself offend against the Act, cannot be the standard by which the effect or influence of a publication is to be measured for the purposes of the Act. It would be no answer to the prohibitions of the Act to show that what Parliament has thought fit to forbid is the very height of contemporary fashion. The tendency towards what might be said to approximate to a phallic cult amongst authors and their readers may have been, and probably was, the very reason why Parliament considered it expedient to pass this legislation.</block>

<p>The very fact that this type of phenomenon occurs, is not an argument. I want to go further, however, I want to agree with the hon. member that there is a modem development and tendency in this direction, but the very fact that the cumulative effect of all these things is depriving Sunday of its character, is a reason why we must introduce this legislation. We must start somewhere. Therefore, it does not help the hon. members on that side of the House to tell us that doing away with the exhibition of films for profit on Sundays is no solution if we neglect to do such and such a thing. That is not the argument at all. We could give attention to those things if it became necessary. In this regard, it is a matter of making a start, precisely because the cumulative effect of this type of thing on Sundays is in the process of depriving Sunday of its character.</p>

<p>I now come to the last argument of the hon. member for Newton Park, an argument which coincides with those of the hon. members for Sandton and Parktown. I am sorry that I now have to label them both with the same tag, but their arguments amount to the same thing. The hon. member for Sandton said: &#x201C;Personal freedom is infringed.&#x201D; The hon. member for Newton Park said that Sunday was the only day on which many people could enjoy entertainment. That was his standpoint. The hon. member went on to say that everyone had his own taste and view in regard to the Sabbath and desecration of the Sabbath. The hon. member said furthermore that since this was the case and since we wanted to encroach upon the freedom of the individual, we could not defend South Africa&#x2019;s standpoint because, according to the hon. member, if we wanted to join the ranks of the West, we would have to go along with the West. The people in the West do it in this way. I know a proverb which says: &#x201C;When in Rome, do as the Romans do,&#x201D; but if that Italian comes to South Africa, he must do as we do because we are not going to conform simply because he is used to something different. He must fall in with the character which this people in this country has worked out for itself. I cannot but label any other standpoint which the hon. members on that side of the House have adopted in regard to this matter as being in harmony with the permissive spirit of the times which is making an assault on us in the Western world and also in South Africa to an ever-increasing degree. I do not have the slightest doubt about it. I can understand the hon. members for Sandton and Parktown adopting this attitude, because they are trapped in the liberal spirit of permissiveness which will destroy all forms of discipline. We are living in a time when the corrupting conditions of permissiveness and degeneration are rampant. They are threatening the community and good order within the community. Freedom of the individual is a monstrosity; no one can do as he wants because we are living in an ordered society.</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely, because we are living in an ordered community. Our task is to preserve the distinctive, religious and conservative character of the South African community. That also goes for the distinctive character of Sunday as we know it and as the vast majority of the White population in this country&#x2014;I believe this is the case&#x2014;wants it.</p>

<p>We put a high premium on the freedom of communication, of speech, of publication and of entertainment. We do not do this however if it is contrary to the accepted religious and/or conservative national character. This is where I differ radically from the hon. member for Parktown. South Africa recognizes a certain atmosphere on a Sunday, no matter <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0380"/>what people&#x2019;s individual religious beliefs may be. One need not necessarily be a clergyman to hold a definite view in regard to Sunday. We cannot allow the spiritual and conservative disciplines of the South African community to be undermined. It undermines the spiritual and the moral welfare of South Africa and it weakens our resistance to the corrupting <i>Zeitgeist</i> of permissiveness and lack of spiritual preparedness because it rots away the inner values of our people. We must have no doubt about that and that is why it remains the function of the State&#x2014;in this regard I differ from the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;to ensure that violence is not done to these principles.</p>

<p>No one wants to encroach upon the vested interests of cinema owners. No one wants to deny anyone the right to see a particular film, not even on a Sunday; but if he really wants to see it on a Sunday, then he must do so in the privacy of his home or those of his friends. In this way we must implement the Christian philosophy. This philosophy certainly takes the other man&#x2019;s standpoint into account. No one is trying to improve people&#x2019;s morals and norms by way of this legislation. On the other hand, failure to take action may corrupt the good character and good morals of others. The Christian philosophy is not being forced upon anyone by this legislation; it merely recognizes the Christian philosophy of our people, so that those religious beliefs and philosophies may not be handicapped. We dare not harm those philosophies by our activities. The Church must not be hindered in the execution of its task simply because the State has neglected to take action. Therefore the legislation makes no attempt whatsoever to take the Church&#x2019;s task out of its hands. The legislation aims at allowing the nation to work unhindered at the preservation of the character of Sunday and this includes the work of the Church as well. Therefore, the legislation has no intention whatsoever of encroaching upon the religious freedom&#x2014;and this is an argument which has been put forward here&#x2014;of any sector of the population but, by implication, the legislation recognizes the character of Sunday as being in accordance with the view of the major part of the population. No one is being asked to accept the view or standpoint and the philosophies of a certain church; only general Christian standards in respect of one specific facet of Sunday, are applicable here. It prevents one facet of Sabbath desecration which is offensive, inconvenient and which can also, in extreme cases, even disturb the peace. Thus, it is not a matter of compelling people by Act of Parliament to accept specific ethical, moral or religious standards or beliefs. It is very interesting that on page 336 of the British Longford Report on publication control and pornography, Archbishop Temple says these meaningful words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To say that you cannot make folk good by Act of Parliament is to utter a dangerous half-truth. You cannot by Act of Parliament make men morally good, but you can by Act of Parliament supply conditions which facilitate the growth of moral goodness and remove conditions which obstruct it.</block>

<p>Nowhere is the freedom of the individual, in respect of his conscience, his freedom of belief and his religious freedom, implicitly encroached upon. I want the hon. member for Pinetown to realize this. The highest norm of the Christian philosophy and world view is to be found in the Scriptures and it is there, too, that it finds the framework for its actions. We do not apologize for this. It is this that the State and this Parliament must take cognizance of and it is in this regard that they have a function to perform. The hon. member referred to the learned professor from Potchefstroom. The same Professor Van der Vyver is supposed to have said&#x2014;he was quoted in last Sunday&#x2019;s edition of the <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State must see to this and the State must control that, the State must compel and the State must enforce. The State, the State, the State. We have actually fallen victim to a slave morality.</block>

<p>This is a terrible thing to say. It is furthermore alleged, as a result of this, that due to this very fact, bureaucracy and totalitarianism are the fate of this country. I think that the arguments in this regard are exaggerated and unfounded. Were I to weigh them against the consequences which a permissive community holds in store, a community in which everyone is left to himself and his own so-called conscience, I would rather choose the more restricted, more disciplined State <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0381"/>control. Permissiveness leads to laxness of morals and habits and eventually to the decline of traditions. What takes its place is licentiousness, immorality and indiscipline and then a decadent community has already come into being. If I had to make that choice, I would have no other choice.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Koedoespoort started his speech this afternoon by giving the clue to the intention behind this particular Bill. He ended up by trying to soften it a little bit when he said that he was convinced of the State&#x2019;s responsibility to create a moral atmosphere in which the people may live. Nobody will argue with that latter statement of his at all. What does it mean, however&#x003F; It means that it is the responsibility of the State to provide housing, the environment and all the necessary facilities and amenities for the people to be able to exist in a moral atmosphere where they can enjoy family life and the various facilities and amenities, but it does not mean that the State must then turn round and dictate to the people whether they may or may not see a film show. That brings me back to his opening words, and his opening words were that the longer he listened to this debate, the more convinced he became of the necessity for the State to enforce conformity. That is the clue to this Bill. It is an attempt to enforce conformity, and more particularly to enforce conformity on the wicked English-speaking people of Natal. I shall come back to that a little later. [Interjections.] Yes, that is what it is. The hon. the Minister cannot deny that he made that statement in June of last year. He cannot deny that he stated that this Bill was forced upon him by the people of Pietermaritzburg. He did make that statement last year and he cannot deny it. The hon. the Minister looks at me questioningly, but he cannot deny that he made that statement in June 1976. The hon. the Minister also knows that he did not go ahead with the Bill last year because he still had to face the Nationalist Party Congress in Natal. That is why he did not proceed with the Bill last year.</p>

What is the difference&#x003F; If hon. members speak about not doing things on Sunday for gain, I should like to put a question to the hon. member for Klip River who also raised this point.</p>

<p>*Does he want to send his children to the beach on Sunday, where they have to sit in the sun without ice-cream or cool drinks and where his wife has to go without tea all afternoon&#x003F; Does he believe that none of these things should be provided either&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;Because that is also done for gain. Then the hon. the Minister of Transport must stop his trains and his aircraft because they are all operated for gain. Then the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications must suspend the telephone service because that is a service which also operates for gain. Those services must also cease to operate on a Sunday, if we are to accept that these hon. gentlemen, who claim to be honourable and moral, are in fact genuine in their morality. I do not believe there is any genuineness in their morality at all.</p>

<p><span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0382"/>The hon. member for Vereeniging also spoke about television. He says that television is not affected by this Bill. We agree with that. The actual projection of television is not affected by this Bill, but it has been argued&#x2014;and I am not going to repeat the arguments&#x2014;that the SABC does the projection for a consideration and that action could morally be taken against them in terms of this Bill. However, what is the position with those restaurants, hotels and clubs which have installed television sets on their premises as part of a service offered by the restauranteurs, the hoteliers and the persons running the clubs for the benefit of their clients or members&#x003F; Are they going to be compelled to switch those television sets off on a Sunday&#x003F; Will the Wanderers Club and the Collegians Club in Pietermaritzburg be compelled to switch their television sets off on Sunday evenings&#x003F;</p>

I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us what he intends doing about those people.</p>

<p>Regarding this whole question of whether or not we should be permitted to show a film, a film in terms of the Bill, on a Sunday, I want to ask what is going to happen to all the hotel-keepers in holiday resorts who over many, many years&#x2014;this is not something that happened yesterday as the hon. member for Klip River tried to indicate&#x2014;have had shows for their residents on a Sunday evening.

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister through this Bill is going to make it more difficult to attract particularly young people to the church. I believe that the Bill contains a provision which directly infringes on the rights of the churches because no church or Sunday school will be permitted to show any film, which includes any slides, without a permit.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Why &#x201C;it depends on the film&#x201D;&#x003F; Now listen to the hon. the Minister prevaricate. He first of all says it does not affect the churches; then he starts prevaricating when I ask him a question. There is no question of whether there is a consideration or not. What sort of film does he think churches will show&#x003F; Is he casting aspersions on the type of film that he thinks the churches will show&#x003F; I am afraid this hon. Minister and the NP are now displayed here in all their nakedness. There is only one thing that they seek and that is conformity&#x2014;in the words of the hon. member for Koedoespoort.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at the history of this Bill. Why have we got a Bill like this&#x003F; Why has it been introduced&#x003F; The story starts in 1975, when the hon. the Minister warned the Durban city council against allowing the showing of films on Sundays in public cinemas. When they took no notice and it appeared that Durban would persist with this, the hon. the Minister leaned on the mayor and on the city councillors. Sir, it was said here by somebody that he blackmailed them and by somebody else that he bullied them. But I believe that he threatened to ban not only films, but all Sunday recreation if they did not agree to close their cinemas. This included the banning of all organized sport. The hon. member for Stilfontein is still pleading for that. They even wanted to stop us fishing. They do not even want us to fish in our beautiful sea in Natal. It was even extended to the point, as I said earlier, of banning the hiring or showing of home movies. Durban unfortunately acquiesced because that hon. Minister has the power; he is the Lord High Pooh-Bah with the power to do that. But, unfortunately for the rest of Natal, the people of Pietermaritzburg had more spunk. They refused to take steps to stop the performance of films on Sunday. Because of the intransigent attitude of the wicked English-speaking people of Pietermaritzburg, the hon. the Minister drafted his &#x201C;Never on Sundays&#x201D; Bill last year.</p>

<p>Then, because there was a NP congress coming up in Durban, shortly afterwards, he held it back; he did not proceed with it. So much for the courage and the &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; that the hon. member for Koedoespoort was talking about. What he is saying to us now and confirmed by my friend, the hon. member for Vereeniging, a little earlier, is that you can do it on Monday, you can do it on Tuesday or even on Wednesday, you can do it on Thursday, on Friday and even on Saturday, but never on Sunday. That is what he is saying to us&#x2014;never on Sunday. Go and buy it during the week, hire it during the week, do what you like on weekdays, but do not hire or buy it on Sundays. Do you wonder, Sir, why the Pietermaritzburg city council&#x2014;because of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude in 1975&#x2014;passed the following resolution on November 24, 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was resolved that the city council reaffirms its previously expressed views on this matter and that a telegram be sent to the Minister of Justice stating that while <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0385"/>the city council considers it desirable for Sunday cinema shows to be held outside of normal church service hours, the matters of attendance or otherwise should be left to each individual to decide, that is that there should be no legislation barring Sunday cinema performances.</block>

<p>This, incidently, was carried by 12 votes to one in the city council of Pietermaritzburg. This has been confirmed, as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North pointed out yesterday, by a telegram which the hon. the Minister received during the last few days, a telegram in which they reaffirmed that resolution. But then, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister also had something else from Pietermaritzburg. He has a petition which was sent to him, a petition with I do not know how many signatures, because I never got the final count. However, I have copies of some of the pages here. It is a petition which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the undersigned citizens of the Republic of South Africa, being aware of the threats to religious liberty contained in the Sunday Cinema Bill, at present before Parliament, do earnestly petition and appeal to the Minister to give heed to the letter accompanying these signatures, setting out the reasons why the said Bill should not become law, that it would also seriously interfere with the civil rights of a large majority.</block>

<p>The petition is addressed to the hon. the Minister of Justice, Mr. J. Kruger, House of Assembly, Cape Town. The signatures on here are not only those of English-speaking people. They do not only have English surnames. When one looks through them, one notices names such as M. van der Merwe, J. H. van der Merwe, J. H. Bredekamp, J. B. Venter, and so forth. There is even a Langley among them, believe it or not; there is also an Ackermann, a De Jager and a Steyn. Just look at them, Sir! [Interjections.] Another Venter, a Van Niekerk, and so it goes on, Sir. The hon. the Minister is in possession of that petition. Why does he not take cognizance of it&#x003F; Why does he not take any notice of it at all&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then of course, there was the comment by Mr. Barry Naidoo, the chairman of the Indian Local Affairs Council. Yes, Sir, we have those bodies in Natal. The rest of the provinces do not have them. We consult with the other races in Natal. We have had Mr. Naidoo&#x2019;s comment, which was read by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North yesterday.</p>

<p>The biggest disservice of all that, I believe, the hon. the Minister is doing us today, is by wasting the time of this House with this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister says I am wasting the time of the House. I am wasting the time of the House, I will concede, but only because this hon. Minister had the temerity to introduce this Bill. If he had not introduced this Bill I would not be wasting the time of the House. [Interjections.] Why do I say that the hon. the Minister is wasting the time of this House&#x003F; I say that because I believe that the hon. the Minister does not need this legislation in order to achieve what he is trying to do. We have in existence in the Republic three Acts which apply to the three provinces of the Transvaal, the Orange Free State and the Cape, Acts which completely prohibit the showing of any film for gain, or in a public place, on a Sunday. The hon. the Minister, in this Bill, is repealing the provisions of those Acts which pertain to the showing of films on Sundays. In Natal local authorities have the power to legislate against such showing. If it is the intention or the feeling of the people concerned that it is undesirable that films should be shown on a Sunday, they have the power to legislate against it. They do not only have the power to legislate to prohibit the showing of films on a Sunday; they also have the power to legislate to control the hours of showing of films, or the type of film, or any other conditions. They have the full power to control the showing of films on a Sunday. Many local authorities in Natal have taken the opportunity of doing so. Ladysmith, Newcastle, Vryheid, Durban and Pinetown, just to mention some, have already legislated a total ban on the showing of films in public on a Sunday, or for gain on a Sunday, within the areas of their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0386"/>I want to say to the hon. member for Klip River that when he attacked my friend, the hon. member for Pinetown, he really showed the depths to which he has sunk. Here we have a young man who has the moral fibre and courage referred to by the hon. member for Koedoespoort. The hon. member for Pinetown came out publicly and said to his local authority: &#x201C;I believe that you should ban the showing of films in Pinetown.&#x201D; He supported the city council all the way and in doing so went against the wishes of many of his voters, but on a moral stand he stood. Now, what is the position today&#x003F; He is taking exactly the same stand by saying that we have the right to ban it, we have banned it, we will stand by that ban and we do not need this Minister to ban it. That is what he is doing and I believe that every member in this House should admire him for the courageous stand which he took. However, at the same time, just as you have these local authorities which have decided, in their wisdom, that there should be no showing of films in their community, so you have local authorities such as Margate and Amanzimtoti who have allowed films to be shown, to the best of my knowledge, for the last 20 years or more. Again, the hon. member for Klip River shows his ignorance when he says that this is something new in Natal. There have been film shows in those centres for at least 20 years&#x2019; but there they have limited the hours. They do not allow films to be shown during the hours in which you normally expect a church service to be held. What is wrong with that&#x003F; Why should they not continue with that&#x003F; If the Pietermaritzburg City Council, by an overwhelming majority&#x2014;a larger majority than even the NP has in this House&#x2014;of 12 votes to one, decides that they will not legislate at all, it is their right to do so. I repeat what I said when I started: I believe this legislation is simply aimed at the people of Pietermaritzburg and other local authorities in Natal like it who decided that they would have nothing whatsoever to do with the Minister&#x2019;s threats to them when he said: &#x201C;You ban this or else I will wield the big stick.&#x201D; This is the big stick we are talking about this afternoon.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said: &#x201C;Yes that is all very well as far as the local authority areas are concerned, but what about outside the local authority areas&#x003F;&#x201D; He then referred to drive-in theatres outside the area of jurisdiction of local authorities in Natal. I want to say to him that I know of none and that I do not believe that the hon. member for Klip River, if he really applies his mind, knows of any either. The hon. member for Klip River, who was a member of the provincial council, must know that we have a body in Natal, known as the Development and Services Board, which used to be called the Local Health Commission, and which controls those drive-in theatres which are outside the area of any local authority.</p>

Are all those clubs going to have to apply for exemption&#x003F; Every single one of those members is going to be forced to conform in some way or other with this hon. Minister and his ideas.

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, I said to myself: Here is a man&#x2014;and he is a brother of Rev. Ian Webber, one of the finest parsons I know&#x2014;with civil war in his breast, civil war between his Christian convictions and political expediency. It is always a matter of great sadness when the politician gets the better of the Christian and when the politician wins this duel. The hon. member comes here and advocates a measure that can lead to the desecration of the Sunday, a measure which can cause people to stumble and can rob them of their Christian and moral values.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, the hon. member quoted a whole series of statistics to indicate to us that there is a majority of people who do not support this legislation. He said for example that the Pietermaritzburg City Council adopted a resolution to this effect by 11 votes to two. The hon. member for Sandton told us that only <i>5%</i> of the population supports this Bill. We dispute those figures. Those statistics are completely erroneous. Let us suppose, however, that it is correct that only 5% of our population support this Bill. A majority or a minority is a completely alien concept in theology. It is a concept which we use in politics and in sociology, but in religion, theology and ethics no mention is made of a majority of a minority. The validity of a divine edict does not depend on whether a majority of the people respect that edict. In the New Testament the most powerful language is used when the Sabbath is being described. The hon. member for Pinelands will be able to confirm that in the New Testament the Sabbath is called the Lord&#x2019;s day. This idea is so overwhelming and so vital that surely one has no alternative but to support this Bill. Therefore it is not a question of whether the hon. the Minister should have come to this House with this Bill. On the contrary. He would have been guilty of the greatest dereliction of duty if he had omitted to do so. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South also said that this Bill was aimed only at the English-speaking people of Natal. There were other hon. members who also said this. With that the hon. member suggested that as far as Sunday observance is concerned, our English-speaking citizens have a more liberal outlook, and that the Afrikaans-speaking people have a more rigouristic outlook. If we were to examine our traditions, we would find that the opposite is true. The dogma of the three Afrikaans churches is based on the three Formularies of Unity, i.e. the Canons of Dort, the Confessio Belgica and the Heidelberg Catechism. In the Canons of Dort there is no reference whatsoever to the Sabbath. In the Confessio Belgica there is a very indirect reference to the Sabbath, and in the Heidel <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0388"/>berg Catechism there is a very succinct reference to the Sabbath.</p>

<p>In the English theological world we find the fullest, most comprehensive, most rigoristic and most legalistic view of the Sabbath in the Westminster Confession. I do not have the time to quote from this now. This is the English tradition. A Reformed ethicist like Geesink claimed that it had a salutory effect on the Calvinistic world which did not initially share the strict view of the Sabbath as found in the English theological world. The church to which the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, belongs, is a branch of puritanism in which Sunday observance was extremely strict, stricter than anywhere else in the world. England also had the strictest legislation in respect of Sunday. In England there was legislation prohibiting horse-riding on a Sunday.</p>

<p>On 26 May 1975 the Provincial Council of Natal unanimously adopted the following resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this council requests local authorities to exercise discretion in permitting public entertainment on Sundays, particularly during the hours of normal church services.</block>

<p>Why did the Natal Provincial Council adopt this resolution&#x003F; The motivation was that, at that juncture, at the beginning of 1975, there were several local authorities that sporadically discovered that they had the right and the power to adjust their local by-laws in such a way that they were able to allow film shows on a Sunday. Apparently the Provincial Council was not satisfied with this state of affairs. There was no order, and therefore we find this very urgent appeal being made to the local authorities to respect the Sabbath. They also adopted this resolution because they believed, quite rightly, that it would be possible to induce people to adopt a certain standpoint by means of friendly persuasion, rather than by using the force of legislation. That was their standpoint, and it is still the standpoint of hon. members on that side of the House today.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central quoted what the Leader of the NP in the Provincial Council, Mr. Gert Hanekom had said, i.e. that he also held the standpoint that the local authorities should decide in this regard. I think it was a very fair standpoint which Mr. Hanekom adopted. He said that he believed that the Minister had first held the standpoint that it was possible to persuade local authorities. I know that a delegation from the Durban City Council went to see him and that he persuaded them to repeal a resolution they had adopted in respect of Sunday film shows. There is not a single legislature in this country which would resort to the force of legislation if it were possible to induce people to adopt a certain standpoint by means of persuasion. That was the standpoint of Mr. Gert Hanekom. As it happened, he was on a visit to the Cape last week. In fact, he was at my home, and I discussed with him the standpoint which he adopted in the Provincial Council in 1975. He admitted that that had been his standpoint, but added that in the interim so much confusion had arisen among the local authorities, that today he fully supported the Bill of the hon. the Minister. Unlike what happened in the past, we heard very little in the newspapers about this Bill which is being introduced. The only reaction from Natal which I read was a short report in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> of 26 January under the caption &#x201C;Sunday film ban draws a warning&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Natal senior MEC, Mr. Frank Martin, yesterday attacked the Government for reintroducing legislation to prohibit Sunday cinemas and said the province would continue its policy of not co-operating with the Minister of Justice, Mr. Jimmy Kruger.</block>

<p>Here we have a provincial council which made a friendly appeal to the local authorities. Those local authorities, or a large number of them, did not react to that appeal. It fell on deaf ears. They did not display the good judgment which this motion asked of them, and that motion was sent to each one of them. A total lack of discipline prevails, and there is no uniformity. We would have expected Mr. Martin to have reprimanded those local authorities on their lack of discipline, but instead he attacked the hon. the Minister who has come forward with a measure which will create order out of this chaos.</p>

<p>Why do I support this Bill&#x003F; I support it in the first place because it puts an end to a confusing situation. It is not conducive to <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0389"/>good order that, as is the position in Natal at present, one local authority may decide that there shall be no shows on Sunday, while a neighbouring town decides otherwise. Elections on this issue are continually being held, and there are local authorities in which a resolution was adopted with a bare majority of one. After the election the entire community was in an uproar. The main election issue of the candidates was that they were either in favour of film shows on Sundays or opposed to it. We are going to experience a constant see-sawing in Natal as councils rescind decisions.</p>

<p>The Bill is also essential because of the question of the drive-in cinemas which was mentioned, and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North referred to this matter. There are certain drive-in cinemas which do not fall within the areas of jurisdiction of local authorities, but which are controlled by licensing boards which receive their powers from the provincial council.</p>

<p>My most important reason for supporting the Bill is that I believe that it is our task to take preventive measures against that tidal wave of subversive forces which is bearing down so ominously today on the virtue and integrity of our people. It is depriving our people of their spiritual anchors, of their moral values and their most precious possessions.</p>

<p>When we have lost those things, we have lost everything. We should fear this more than any external threat, for if we have become rotten and weak on the inside, we can no longer defend ourselves against the external threats. It is true that when we detract from the Sabbath, we detract from the church, and when we detract from the church we detract from the family. When we detract from the family, we detract from the nation. This nation was built on spiritual foundations and if those-foundations are ever undermined, everything we have built up here over generations will collapse in ruins. I support this Bill for we are living in a time in our history in which we will be in sore need of those spiritual anchors. I think it must weigh heavily on the conscience of those people to come to this House and, in a frivolous spirit&#x2014;such as that which one or two hon. members have already displayed&#x2014;ridicule those values which are not only important to us, but which are everything to us.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to refer again to the debates in the Natal Provincial Council and to the standpoint adopted by Mr. Martin, the leader of the provincial council. It was a very strange view which he adopted there. On page 195 of the 1975 Hansard he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now, what right have we to tell these people what they should do all day on a Sunday&#x003F;</block>

<p>Oh well, that is also the standpoint expressed on the opposite side. But listen further to a man who says that we do not have the right to prescribe to people what they should do all day on a Sunday, and that we do not have the right to introduce legislation on this matter. Immediately afterwards he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As it is, we say to them &#x2026;</block>

<p>and the &#x201C;them&#x201D; to whom he was referring are the non-Christians. He was referring to the Indians. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; irrespective of where they are and who they are, there are four days that we regard as religious days in this province and these are Good Friday, Ascension Day, the Day of the Covenant and Christmas Day. On these days no business, no entertainment, nothing may operate. We do this at Exco level, continually. When we get requests for the extension of shop hours, we say: &#x201C;Yes, you can have it, but not on these days. &#x201D;</block>

<p>It was not a slip of the tongue on his part. On the following page he said the same thing again. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman, that although we believe that we shouldn&#x2019;t dictate to anybody how they spend their Sundays&#x2014;I said this earlier but I want to repeat it because I want no mistake on this afterwards&#x2014;we respect the religious susceptibilities of everyone and, in as far as those specific religious days are concerned&#x2014;i.e. Good Friday, Ascension Day, the Day of the Covenant and Christmas Day&#x2014;we as an executive committee and the Administrator do not allow any sort of activity on these days, other than, of course, the essential services.</block>

<p><span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0390"/>This is a man who feels incensed at the idea that there should be any infringement of those four religious days. I agree with him on this score. This Bill was also extended to include public holidays. May I have the attention of the hon. member for Parktown for just a moment&#x003F; The other day I enjoyed a programme on the Day of the Covenant very much indeed. There the hon. member for Johannesburg West acquitted himself brilliantly of his task, but then the hon. member for Parktown said a very strange thing. He said that he had heard of a clergyman who had said that the Voortrekkers did not have the right to raise the status of 16 December to that of a Sunday.</p>

<p>Yes, they were not entitled to commit their descendants to regarding it as a Sunday. The hon. member is a journalist. That is not surprising at all. If he could find a theologian who maintains that the Voortrekkers did have that right, it would definitely be newsworthy. I am saying this because I know of thousands of theologians who confirm precisely what he said there. After all, we do not have the right to do so, the Voortrekkers did not have that right either, the Church does not have the right, the State does not have the right to raise the status of any day of the week to that of a Sunday. We cannot do this to Good Friday, the Day of the Covenant, or any other day. The prescribed day in Scripture is the Sabbath, and that day alone. Of course one has respect for those other days and for what they signify, but one cannot raise the status of man-made days&#x2014;and they are man-made days&#x2014;to that of a Sunday. That is why one can feel as strongly about this matter as Mr. Martin felt, but then without such a casual attitude towards a Sunday, the day of the Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the longer I listen to the debate, the more I believe that the hon. member for Newton Park was correct in asking the House to appoint a Select Committee before the Second Reading to investigate this matter. I have just listened to a very interesting speech by the hon. member for Port Natal. I am no match for him when it comes to religious learning or to matters concerning the church. From the nature of the case he is a man who has an intimate knowledge of these matters. He described to us the nature of the Sabbath, and I have no fault to find with his description of how we ought to behave on the Sabbath. What troubles me about the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments, however, is why he is applying that view exclusively to film shows. Why does he ignore all the other things done on a Sunday&#x003F; We must remember that the hon. member supports the Bill. He wants to see the Sabbath the way he wants to see it, but only in respect of the showing of films. All the other things he ignores.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, there is something unsound about the argument which troubles me, and because there is something unsound about it, I want to submit that the hon. member for Newton Park had good reason for asking that this matter be properly investigated by other people.</p>

<p>The arguments advanced by the hon. member for Port Natal were not the only ones that were unsound. The hon. member for Koedoespoort argued very convincingly that if an Italian comes to South Africa, he must conform. He may do what he likes, but he must be sure not to attend a film show, for then he will be in trouble. He may play golf, he may go swimming, he may play cricket, he may watch soccer and he may even attend a film show free of charge, but he may not attend a film show if he has to pay for it. The logic behind that argument escapes me. That is why I believe that we should have this matter investigated further.</p>

<p>The hon. member lor Klip River said that we were trying to shirk our moral duty by requesting a Select Committee. Is that so&#x003F; If that is so, did the predecessor of the hon. the Minister of Justice also shirk his duty when <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0391"/>he appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the question of Sunday sport&#x003F; Did he shirk his duty&#x003F; That was another matter which was investigated to good effect. In that case, the question of shirking one&#x2019;s duty did not arise at all. The fact is that an attempt was made to obtain certainty and facts and that these were provided by people who knew more about the matter than we did.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown&#x2014;he is not here at the moment&#x2014;said he could not understand our wanting a Select Committee on such a small and simple matter as the showing of films on Sundays. Mr. Speaker, the matter is so simple that this hon. House has been discussing it for hours now. That is how simple the matter is! On the contrary, the matter is not simple at all. I find it a pity that a Bill of this nature has been brought before this hon. House and that the situation has arisen where members of Parliament and politicians have been playing with arguments and counter-arguments in an attempt to ascertain whether or not a matter of this delicate nature should become law in South Africa. For that reason I believe that the hon. member for Newton Park made a very sound suggestion when he asked the hon. the Minister for a Select Committee.</p>

<p>What are we trying to achieve with this Bill&#x003F; We are trying to achieve a pattern of behaviour for Sunday observance, as the hon. member for Port Natal said, a pattern of behaviour which will at least preserve the spirit of Sunday. We all agree with that. No one would object to the desire to have a Sunday of this nature in South Africa. However, how are we trying to achieve this&#x003F; We are trying to achieve a pattern of behaviour which will be suitable for Sundays by prohibiting the performance of certain acts. We are trying by means of a negative action to call forth a positive reaction from the people. We are telling the people outside: &#x201C;You may not eat of the fruit of that tree.&#x201D; It seems to me that when it comes to a matter such as this one, the more we say by way of legislation that the fruit may not be eaten, the more vulnerable the matter will be and the more unsound the argument will remain. It seems to me that what we need in South Africa is not a negative approach, not a negative action calling forth a positive reaction. What we do need in South Africa is a positive action to rectify the matter, and I say with the greatest respect that I do not think that action should be taken by the State. I have the greatest respect for the positive action taken by our churches to rectify the matter.</p>

<p>Suppose I am mistaken in my view. Why are we then to try and rectify the matter by prohibiting films and nothing else&#x003F; I have already pointed out that there is no difference whatsoever between wanting to look at a film on Sunday and wanting to go and play a game of golf.</p>

<p>I shall come to that. There is no difference whatsoever between looking at a film and playing cricket. If the one is a sin, the other must be a sin as well. To me it seems completely illogical to call the one fish and the other flesh. The only argument advanced by the hon. member on the other side is that the Bill refers to films shown for a consideration. I really cannot understand why the nature of the deed should be changed by payment. Whether a deed is good or sinful, payment or non-payment is not going to make any difference to the nature of that deed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I stand corrected; one pays very high fees for golf. I am glad to learn that the hon. member for Houghton also plays golf. I cannot see any difference in the nature of my behaviour whether I go to see a film free of charge or for an entrance fee on a Sunday. The commercial aspect has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of the act. If my hon. friend from Port Natal wants to be correct in condemning all the acts performed on a Sunday nowadays, saying that they desecrate the Sabbath, then I say to him: I may agree with you, but at least be logical: draw the line all the way through; tell me where I should stop in my behaviour. Where should I stop&#x003F; I find it difficult.</p>

<p>Another question I want to ask is this one; even supposing I am wrong again, and my hon. friend with his superior knowledge of Biblical matters, my hon. friend of Port <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0392"/>Natal, is in fact able to tell me where that line must be drawn&#x2014;is this to be done by the State&#x003F; Who is to draw the line&#x003F; Now, this is how the matter seems to me: I may be misinterpreting the Christian religion, but as an individual&#x2014;I am now speaking only as an individual; as a member of Parliament I have not been instructed by my electorate to take a stand concerning their conduct on a Sunday&#x2014;I have always accepted that an outstanding characteristic of the Christian religion is that it promotes tolerance, tolerance towards one&#x2019;s fellow-man.</p>

<p>And if one is to be tolerant in this matter, and the hon. the Minister is of the opinion that the State ought to do this, then I say no; one should rather bring down the question of force to the lowest possible level, so that the decision will be made, not on a high national level, but rather on a local level, and in this way one is likely to give offence to the smallest number of people. In this way one would be subjecting people to the smallest amount of force.</p>

<p>The whole issue is surrounded by quite a number of questions, questions I cannot answer&#x2014;to my regret. Even my hon. friend of Port Natal cannot give a satisfactory answer to these questions. I think there are many municipalities who would be only too glad to have the hon. the Minister take action in this matter. Do you know why, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; It is because they do not have the courage themselves to take a stand on the matter. Now the hon. the Minister will do the work for them. If we value democracy in South Africa, if we want to preserve in all its vigour the spirit of the decision of the people and of the community, then, I believe, the municipalities and local authorities must be placed in a position in which they will be forced, if necessary, to take a stand on this matter to the satisfaction of their people. However, I repeat that this is my personal view. I do not know whether I am right. I should very gladly read a report by people who have a deeper insight than I into the spiritual affairs, the sociological affairs, of our people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask all these questions because they are questions which have occurred to me. I ask all these questions because they are questions which are being asked by people outside as well. I ask all these questions because I know that we are living in changing circumstances. The nation of today is not the nation of yesterday, and it is no use trying to ignore this. Our Sunday legislation of today must be very different from what it was in the distant past. Things change. A nation must adapt itself, and our Church, too, is adapting itself. The Church is adapting itself very effectively, and I am glad to be able to say this. The Church is adapting to change, but is not changing its principles.</p>

<p>This what I like about the matter. That is why I say that in my opinion the positive action should be taken by the Church, and not the negative action by the State. However, because I am not acquainted with the facts, I believe that the hon. member for Newton Park argued his case with great conviction when he said that this House could not do better than to do what it did a few years ago when it said: &#x201C;We do not know whether we should allow sport on Sundays. Let us appoint a Select Committee. Let us appoint people with knowledge and with background and let them inform us. Then we shall know how to act.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the result of that was that this hon. House came to the point where it could not continue and where no decision could be taken. This may be the case with this Bill as well. For this reason I believe that the soundest step&#x2014;not a question of shirking one&#x2019;s duty, not for me or for the small number of people in this hon. house, but for all South Africa&#x2014;will be to ascertain the facts and then, if necessary, to introduce legislation in this hon. House if the people so prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South asked me, while I was sitting here, whether I had received a letter from the Methodist Church, a letter in support of the legislation which is before the House at the moment. I had received a letter with a letter-head of the <span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0393"/>Methodist Church. In the same way, I had received many other letters from church denominations. I have a pile of them. I did not read them all through again before the beginning of the discussion on this Bill.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. A. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always very pleasant to listen to the hon. member for Maitland. He referred to certain arguments and theological points advanced by the hon. member for Port Natal. It would perhaps have been better if the hon. member had read that speech first, before commenting on it. The hon. member for Maitland was concerned about why the hon. member for Port Natal had concentrated his arguments only on films when what was at issue was the observance of the Sabbath. However, that is all that is at issue at the moment. The hon. member wanted&#x2014;so it seemed to me&#x2014;to bring other matters, such as the practising of sport on a Sunday, into this as well. That is something which is not relevant at this stage and in this Bill. It is in fact a matter which has an entirely different history and which does not take place on the same commercialized basis. The hon. member also raised the question of tolerance. It is my conviction that one may sometimes be too tolerant of sin, and that one might be overwhelmed by it in the end. This afternoon I do not want to advance any further theological arguments&#x2014; perhaps I could discuss the matter with the hon. member himself.</p>

<p>Firstly I want to discuss the standpoint of the Opposition parties on the question of whether the central Government should remain aloof or neutral towards a subject of this nature, and should leave it to the local authorities or the local communities to decide on the control of films on Sundays. Firstly, this would mean that the State would not, then, be entitled to involve itself in the moral sphere. In other words, the State would not be entitled to take action in the sphere of pornography and repulsive reading matter, and we would then have to leave this as well to the Church or the local authorities. Secondly, we would have the position in every community that there would be people in favour of this matter and people opposed to it, which would constitute a source of great dissatisfaction and dispute in every community. I should like to tell the hon. members for Pietermaritzburg North and Pietermaritzburg South, who are not present here at the moment, that they are welcome to make inquiries, and that they will find there are thousands of people in Pietermaritzburg who are in favour of this legislation.</p>

<p>Thirdly I am convinced that this subject will, time and again, be one of the main issues at every local authority election, and that the question of Sunday observance, for or against, will permanently be dragged into a never-ending debate throughout the country, merely in order to create confusion and arouse feelings so that, in the end, what is in fact a scandalous debate will be conducted on the question of Sunday observance. A fourth point which has already been emphasized by members is that there would be no uniformity either.</p>

<p>We know, moreover, that the Opposition Press has never made a secret of the fact that they want to break the NP, and particular the Afrikaner as well, by opposing it, <i>inter alia,</i> on the question of its traditions and Church; in fact, wants to alienate them of that Christian outlook on life. They want to try to <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0394"/>make us ashamed of these things and to belittle them. We heard this kind of sentiment being expressed yesterday by the hon. member for Sandton. In my opinion the hon. member for Sandton galloped through this Bill with all kinds of disparaging standpoints. For him and his party what is at issue in the first place is simply the individual and his freedom and after that, if at all, God and His commandments. The PRP, I believe, is the party which will change the entire character of South Africa if it were to come into office, particularly the traditions of the country, but also the Church. I believe that this party and its principles will close the doors of the Churches in South Africa, except for those among these institutions which proclaim violence in the name of God, foment incitement and proclaim so-called freedom. My impression is that the PRP does not even recognize the uniqueness of Sunday. The whole issue, for the hon. member for Sandton and his party is&#x2014;I am quoting from his unrevised Hansard (Hansard 2/2, p. Z. 1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This whole matter relates to a question &#x2026; of personal freedom and the role of Government in that personal freedom.</block>

<p>Subsequently he also referred to &#x201C;Central Government infringement&#x201D;.</p>

<p>This Bill has nothing to do with the private and personal right of any individual to spend his Sunday on any form of recreation which he prefers, nor does the Bill place any coercion on the faith of any individual. It has nothing to do with the question of religious freedom, or otherwise, and it is in no way an attempt to force people to go to church, as the hon. member for Sandton implied. The hon. Minister made this very clear in his Second Reading speech, and I just want to quote this section by way of emphasis (Hansard, 2/2, p. J 3)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Church must be afforded the opportunity of fulfilling its task without hindrance caused by the fact that the Government allows certain practices.</block>

<block name="quote">In the second place, Sunday in South Africa is traditionally kept as quietly as possible, free of commercial activities, so as to afford everyone an opportunity to recuperate spiritually and physically and prepare himself for the task awaiting him the following week.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton and other members of the Opposition argue that rights are being rescinded. However, film shows on Sundays are not being prohibited. A person may still rent a film of his own choice for his own purposes and exhibit it at his home on Sunday, if he is so inclined, and if he really has a need to do so. Secondly&#x2014;I do not want to elaborate on this any further&#x2014;it is also possible in certain circumstances to obtain exemptions to the prohibition of the exhibition of films from the hon. the Minister or the persons to whom his power has been delegated. This has already been pointed out by several speakers.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Pretoria East that it would not be desirable to make business days of Sundays and hire out films. There is enough time during the week to do that.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the argument which is being used against us, namely that television, and therefore films, is being allowed on Sunday. Firstly, in reply to that, I want to argue that such films are not being exhibited in a public place. Secondly, television is not being commercialized, nor is there any question of a consideration. I am convinced that the argument advanced by hon. members that the licence fees for television may be regarded as a consideration is quite unfounded. Thirdly, there are no organized exhibitions. Fourthly, every individual has control over the utilization of his television set, for he may switch it off if he so wishes. However, he has no control over the film which he goes to see. Fifthly, I believe that the programmes presented on Sundays on television are to an overwhelming extent adapted to the character of the day, with a few exceptions. I should like to draw a few practical comparisons between the programmes offered on television on Sundays and those on the cinema screen. The S.A. Cine Club advertised two shows for Sunday, 29 January 1977, at 5.15 p.m. and 8.15 p.m., respectively. Our church service times fall within those times. In the five cinemas they were presenting: In Kine I <i>Date with a Lovely Girl</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 21. The hon. member for Parktown argued in favour of the young people in his speech. He asked: &#x201C;Where, then, should our young people go&#x003F;&#x201D; In Kine II the subject matter was: <i>Let the Good Times Roll.</i> In Ster Elite: <i>Rosebud</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 14. In Cinerama <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0395"/><i>Terror in the Woods</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 16. In the Ster Constantia <i>Drowning Pool</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 14. The membership fee is R1 per annum, but they charge an entrance fee of 75 cents per person.</p>

<p>On that same evening the following programmes were presented on television: Ligstraaltjies; Historiese Kerkgeboue; Met Woord en Lied; Tema met variasies; Die Nuus; Horizon, which dealt with excavations; a film version of a Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, and the Epilogue. To see whether it was not an exception, I looked up the previous Sunday&#x2019;s programme. For Sunday, 22 January 1977, the S.A. Cine Club advertised two shows, also at 5.15 p.m. and 8.15 p.m. In Kine I the films <i>Fat City and Stacey Keach</i> (Murder)&#x2014;no persons 4 to 16 years&#x2014;were presented. In Kine 2 <i>Forty Carats</i> (Comedy); at the Cinerama, <i>The Chase</i> (Thriller)&#x2014;no persons 4 to 18 years. In Ster Elite <i>Night of the Generals</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 12. In the Ster Constantia <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 10. For the same Sunday evening the Sunset Cinema Club advertised: <i>To Hell and Back</i>&#x2014;no persons 4 to 12.</p>

<p>At this stage I did not really have the hon. member for Houghton in mind, but the hon. member for Durban Point, for last week he implied that he was even prepared to co-operate with he devil. I wonder whether the hon. member for Durban Point would not be prepared to co-operate with the Church for a change. On that same evening, 22 January, the following television programmes were presented: Tick-tock Time; Cross-roads; Thy Kingdom Come; a quiz programme entitled &#x201C;Specialists&#x201D;; ballet; News Review; Bybelvasvra; Groot Veldslae van die Verlede and Lig van die W&#x00EA;reld.</p>

<p>I think these examples indicate clearly that at that very time when our ministers are preaching the Word of God from their pulpits, these films, most of which are not even accessible to our young people, are being exhibited. I am therefore very grateful for this legislation because I think there is a great need among our people and among our churches in this regard. That is why it will be welcomed and not only by the Nationalists or the Afrikaans-speaking sector.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat has indicated that there was perhaps no connection between the position as far as the Select Committee on Sunday Sport and Entertainment is concerned and the legislation which is before the House. I should like to indicate that the Select Committee which had considered the proposed legislation at the time did not only deal with Sunday sport, but also with entertainment. It had an extremely wide scope. In fact, the Bill that was sent to the Select Committee stated that &#x201C;no person shall organize, direct, control or take part or be present at any public sportsmeeting, entertainment, game contest or function&#x201D;. Obviously, that Bill covered an extremely wide field when it was introduced by the then Minister of Justice, who now happens to be the hon. the Prime Minister. Because the Bill covered such a wide field the Select Committee had to take into consideration the evidence from a large number of organizations, including all the major churches, in order to reach a decision as to what should be done in regard to the proposed legislation which was referred to it before the Second Reading. I might also mention to the hon. member for Klerksdorp that the schedule of that Bill seeked the repeal the same ordinances which this Bill now seeks to amend in regard to Sunday film shows. It had the same object of bringing about a situation of uniformity.</p>

<p>The whole question of uniformity in regard to Sunday observance is a contentious matter, a matter on which people have varied opinions. That is why it became increasingly obvious to the members of the Select Committee that in considering this matter, one would have to take into account the divergence of opinion concerning Sunday observance. This Bill is undoubtedly connected with Sunday observance and the hon. the Minister has virtually indicated that his object is to prevent commercialization taking place on a Sunday. I believe that is the main basis of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument as far as this Bill is concerned. We have listened to a considerable number of speeches dealing with the theological aspect. I do not wish to delve into that, but should like to refer to the South African Yearbook of 1975, which indicate under the heading &#x201C;Religion&#x201D;, that it is common knowledge that church attendance in South Africa is good, that it does not only apply to the rural areas, which are generally considered to be conservative, but that it is <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0396"/>particularly applicable to urban areas. It is particularly noticeable that in the cities young people fill the churches to capacity on Sundays. This same official yearbook, which is issued by the Department of Information, also indicates that as far as 1975 is concerned, 85,1% of all people in South Africa are members of a church or of a religious group. Of the White population group 93,8% claim adherence to the Christian faith. It would appear that up to 1975 the churches were not really subject to any great problems as far as their attendances were concerned. As far as bringing people over to the Christian faith is concerned, it would appear that a very large percentage of the country&#x2019;s inhabitants adhere to the Christian faith. Therefore, if there is in any way a threat to the churches which this Bill aims to eliminate, we should like to know what that threat consists of. If one look at the situation today, very few local authorities permit films to be shown on a Sunday. It would be interesting to have a survey as to the number of people who are in fact attending such shows. We know that there have been film clubs and film circles in the past. I myself attended a film circle some 15 years ago, and at the time there was no objection to these film circles, just as there has not been any objection from a large number of the people in South Africa in regard to Sunday cinemas, they do not wish to see this type of legislation introduced on a uniformed basis throughout the Republic.</p>

<p>That is the reason why I believe that this has some connection with the position, as far as the showing of films on a Sunday is concerned, with the times at which such films are shown. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister that films should not be shown at times when church services are taking place, such as Sunday mornings. It is also wrong that a cinema should have its shows at the same time that churches are having their services during the early part of the evening on Sunday, and such shows should be held at least after 20h30 in the evening on a Sunday.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister asks what will happen if they do not. I would like to know whether any attempts have been made to persuade them to do so, because the whole question of the timing of a function on Sunday is an important one and was considered in the 1960&#x2019;s, when it came to the question of professional football. I know, from a personal point of view, that in Durban there were strong objections to professional football being played on a Sunday morning. Representations were made to the authorities&#x2014;the local authority, the Football League and the Football Association&#x2014;and they immediately acceded to the request. Football games now take place on a Sunday afternoon, and as far as I know, there have been no objections since they have been taking place on a Sunday afternoon. It does indeed become a family affair because the children can attend their Sunday school and the parents themselves can attend the church service on Sunday morning and then the family can watch football on the Sunday afternoon at Kingsmead. I see no evil in that, and that is why I cannot understand why the hon. the Minister now wishes to bring forward a Bill with very wide powers. He has indicated by way of interjection that he does not intend implementing the provisions of the Bill so widely, but we have to read the Bill as it stands before us. The Bill is certainly open to wide interpretations, and the only outlet is the fact that the Minister or an officer of his department, at their discretion, can grant exceptions in certain cases. It will, therefore, be interesting to know what the hon. the Minister has in mind as far as the granting of exceptions is concerned. The question of how this matter should be tackled also arises, as does the question of whether the basis chosen, namely the local authority, is indeed a wise one to encourage. This is, in other words, the existing position as far as Natal is concerned. Here the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has quite rightly moved an amendment which, in effect, would allow the position to remain as it is.</p>

<p>Let us look at what took place when a similar matter, concerning sport and entertainment, was discussed. I served on a Select Committee in 1963, when that committee was unable to complete its work in view of the tremendous amount of evidence which had been placed before it. The hon. the Minister of Justice at that time reintroduced the Bill in 1964 and it was once again referred to a Select Committee. During that Select Committee&#x2019;s deliberations the United Municipal <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0397"/>Executive gave evidence. This was indeed a very important body to give such evidence. At that meeting they were represented by Mr. L. J. van den Berg, Mr. W. C. Dempsey, who, I understand, is now a NP Senator, Mr. F. Jooste, MPC, who is a NP MPC, and Mr. F. W. C. Buitendag. They said that the memorandum which they submitted to the Select Committee was the unanimous decision of the United Municipal Executive when they considered legislation of the sort which dealt with sport and entertainment. They then submitted the following as being their recommendation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the variations of local conditions and the variations of public opinion and traditions regarding Sunday observance in different parts of the country, this matter should be left as a matter for local legislation in accordance with the wishes and conscience of each community. Legislation for nation-wide uniformity is undesirable, if not impracticable. We ask the Select Committee, in the first place, to recommend that the Bill be discharged.</block>

<p>This is a very strong recommendation coming from members who represent the United Municipal Executive, and this is a very important aspect which the hon. the Minister should bear in mind, namely that these people requested that the matter be left as it was, particularly as far as Natal was concerned, and that it be done at local level. This also indicates that the local authorities, through the United Municipal Executive, have very strong views in regard to this type of legislation. It also indicates that there is a tremendous divergence of opinion amongst the people as to what should be allowed and what should not be allowed on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Other organizations who submitted recommendations to the Select Committee agreed that it would not be desirable to have uniformity as far as this was concerned. What is the position as far as the churches are concerned&#x003F; Obviously I am not going to quote from evidence given before the Select Committee by sporting bodies, as virtually every sporting body said that they should be allowed to have their sport on a Sunday if need be without hindrance. Others, such as the Rugby Board, said that it was not the code of their particular sport to have competitive sport on a Sunday. However, that was their decision and was taken by the sporting body itself. As far as the churches are concerned, there was a wide divergence of opinion. There was the church known as the Church of England in South Africa which was represented by their Bishop. This is a small church with an extreme view as far as this type of legislation is concerned. Indeed, the Bishop in his evidence said that we were raising a pagan race in South Africa. He believed that legislation prohibiting sport and entertainment on a Sunday should have the penalty of imprisonment without the option of a fine. This was the type of evidence we had to hear. It ranged to extremes as far as this church was concerned. We also heard evidence from other churches and other faiths &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister may well enjoy that suggestion although I do not suggest that the hon. the Minister should adopt it. The position, however, is that there are other churches, for example the Roman Catholic Church and others, which had a completely and utterly different point of view. Indeed, it is interesting to look at the evidence given, e.g. by the Anglican Church when they were asked what should be done, particularly as far as prohibition was concerned, in accordance with the teachings of Christianity. We must, of course, remember that this Bill is a prohibition law. Its name indicates that it is a prohibition Bill. They said they looked upon the spiritual well-being of people as being the responsibility of the churches. When they were asked whether they believed that legislation prohibiting sport and entertainment on a Sunday should be passed, they said the following, and I quote from page 89 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If laws are passed preventing these people from using Sunday for the purpose of recreation, they will be opposed to Christianity from the very beginning and so make the work of the church even more difficult.</block>

<p>So there are churches which believe that this type of prohibition legislation, as far as Sundays are concerned, would rather hinder the Church in its work than help to protect it, <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0398"/>which is the avowed aim of the hon. the Minister. I am merely quoting these points of view because these are the points of view expressed by the various churches when they appeared before the Select Committee. It is also interesting to see some of the other suggestions that were made about Sundays. The question was put to the person representing the Dutch Reformed Church before the Select Committee, and the question was: What would happen as far as the non-White people were concerned if one prohibited sport on a Sunday, since one realizes that this could be a problem&#x003F; On page 76 of the report on the Sunday Sport and Entertainment Bill, the person representing the Dutch Reformed Church said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some form of recreation must, however, be found to occupy the leisure time of these people, although it need not necessarily be organized sport. It is suggested that educational films should be shown on Sundays to occupy their leisure time.</block>

<p>So here we have the representative of the Dutch Reformed Church before that Select Committee giving evidence of his opposition to organized sport and suggesting that educational films could perhaps be shown on Sundays to keep people occupied in their leisure hours. I am merely indicating that this was the view that was held at that time by the people concerned. This is, I think, an indication that it was virtually impossible to find a formula or to draw up a Bill laying down certain prohibitions as far as Sunday is concerned. Indeed, I believe the Government itself has experienced some difficulty in this matter, as illustrated by the fact that this report is dated 1964. The report of that Select Committee brought out a decision based on a majority vote, a decision recommending to the Government that legislation on the subject of the committee&#x2019;s inquiry was desirable. It therefore recommended that the Government should introduce such legislation at an early stage during the following session and again refer the subject matter thereof to a Select Committee for inquiry and report. That was in 1964. To date, however, we have not had legislation on the lines recommended by that Select Committee, a recommendation made, as I have said, in accordance with a majority decision of that committee. This is, in fact, the first occasion now on which we have had an attempt by the Government to find some other means of prohibiting a particular Sunday activity. The particular activity the hon. the Minister wishes to attack is that relating to cinemas and films. As I said earlier, the legislation is couched in very wide terms. I think the hon. the Minister should not take it amiss, therefore, if people look at this situation and try to imagine what the implementation of this measure will mean. Obviously the Government, with its numerical majority, will pass this legislation. It will mean extra work for the department concerned because the department will have to issue permits and consider applications for consent to show films on Sundays in certain cases. We know that additional police will have to be employed. The police force is already divided up into various squads, and whether there is now going to be a film squad I do not know. However, the police force will be called upon to perform an additional duty to ascertain whether people are contravening this particular prohibition.</p>

<p>The word &#x201C;film&#x201D; in the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Includes any picture intended for exhibition through the medium of a mechanical device &#x2026;</block>

<p>Well, will people connected with certain cultural organizations, e.g. wild-life societies and clubs, who sometimes raise funds on a Sunday evening by having slide shows or showing films, have to obtain the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consent, because in terms of this Bill it would appear that that is necessary. Such people would then have to have consent. Then there are the various sporting bodies which sometimes also have film shows on a Sunday evening in order to raise funds. Such occasions are great family occasions. The family can be brought along to see the film shows, while at the same time the organizers are raising funds. These will consequently all be activities requiring permits because the showing of films on Sundays is apparently some kind of evil the hon. the Minister now aims to eradicate. However, I simply cannot understand the logic when one considers all the other things that are permitted on a Sunday evening. For example, a person who is resident in an hotel can have <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0399"/>intoxicating liquor. He can then go and watch a TV show in the lounge.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Well, if the hotel resident does not pay for watching the TV show, perhaps he may be allowed to watch TV. The present position may allow a person to watch a TV show in the public lounge if he does not have to pay an admission fee, but as soon as a film is hired and a person is required to pay to enter the lounge and watch the film, the persons showing the film will be committing an offence in terms of the proposed legislation. However, it is quite in order for people to sit in the lounge and drink for as long as they like. I am sure that the hon. the Minister, who was previously a Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, knows of the enormous problem of alcoholism we have in this country, yet no doubts are expressed about that. Drinking is permitted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad we have added a little spirit to the debate along these lines. The hon. the Minister has worded the Bill in extremely wide terms, and there are many people who are concerned about what the full effect of this legislation will be on their lives. It might be said that the hon. the Minister is not trying to curtail what people should or should not do on Sundays, but the very title of this Bill indicates that he does wish to see to it what they shall or shall not do on Sundays because, for a start, he will prohibit films on a Sunday. So there is the prohibition aspect as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Then I wish to refer to the attitude of the people. The hon. member for Stilfontein and others indicated in their speeches that they wish to see this whole Bill extended to cover sport, entertainment, etc. They want all such activities that one can engage in on Sundays stopped. The hon. member for Stilfontein is of course just speaking for himself and perhaps a few of his supporters in Stilfontein. Surely, Sir, there are a large number of other people living in the country who also have a right to certain freedoms, who also have the freedom of the individual in mind.</p>

<p>There was a Market Research of Africa survey undertaken in April 1975. In that survey the following question was put to a cross-section of the public: Do you agree or disagree that the Currie Cup and other pay-at-the-gate sport should be banned on Sundays&#x003F; Obviously, this is a matter that is of interest, particularly in view of the plea that has been made by hon. members opposite that the hon. the Minister should extend this type of legislation to include sport, especially pay-at-the-gate sport.</p>

<p>In addition, sport is obviously also classified as entertainment. It is interesting to see what the result of that survey was. The replies that were received show clearly that there is a traditional pattern in how people spend their Sundays. Different customs and traditions apply. The hon. members opposite made great play of the fact that there is tradition involved in how Sundays are spent. There is, of course, a traditional Sunday in the Orange Free State and a different traditional Sunday in Natal. Why not then let it be&#x003F; When the relevant question in the survey was put to a cross-section of the people, it was shown that the majority of the people in the Cape, Natal and Transvaal favoured Sunday sport while the Orange Free State turned in a massive 79% against it. As far as the Afrikaans-speaking people are concerned, it is interesting to see that 34% of them were in favour of sport being played on a Sunday. The survey indicated too that of the English-speaking people 79% favoured major sport on Sundays, 11% were opposed and 10% had no opinion. Therefore, Sir, when the hon. member for Stilfontein comes with the plea to extend this prohibition as far as Sundays are concerned, I do not think he has really taken into account the feeling of a large number of people in South Africa. We respect the feelings of hon. members opposite and we ask them to respect our feelings as well when it comes to a matter of this nature. After all, I <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0400"/>have never yet heard anyone in Natal asking the people in the Free State to have the same facilities available in the Orange Free State that are available in Natal. No one has asked them to do that in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the hon. the Minister is endeavouring, together with those who have supported him in this debate, to try to create the impression that they are going to be the great saviours as far as Sunday observance is concerned by prohibiting the exhibition of films on Sundays. I do not believe that this is going to be the case. It would appear from the figures I have quoted earlier from the official Year Book of South Africa that the churches do not require such protection. At the present time they seem to be able in their own way, viz. the spiritual way, to attract and hold people to the Christian way of life. I do not believe that, by making criminals of people who show a film on a Sunday by charging them in terms of the provisions and penalties laid down in the Bill, is in any way going to help the churches. Indeed, it could hinder some of the churches in their work. We believe that this matter should be left as it is and that is why I have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, viz. to allow the traditional way in which Sundays in South Africa are spent in terms of the law to remain as it is.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting to listen to the hon. member for Umbilo, who usually devotes a great deal of time and attention to the preparation of his speeches. However, the hon. member said that we did not respect the feelings of the representatives of Natal and in that respect, I believe, he is making a mistake. In dealing with this legislation, it is not a question of a lack of respect on our part for the feelings of others. The most important motivation for this legislation is in fact that we want to create a milieu or atmosphere on Sundays by means of which the Church will be enabled to do its work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo provided figures on church attendance in South Africa. It is a very good thing that church attendance is as good as is indicated by those figures. However, if the clergy feel that the increase in the attendance of film shows on Sundays is a source of public disapprobation, it is the task of the clergy and of the Church to draw the attention of the State to the fact that this matter is getting out of hand.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, I should like to say that I welcome this Bill. As far as my local community is concerned, I have received petitions, from church bodies and cultural organizations in particular, that something should be done in respect of film shows on Sundays. This has happened specifically as a result of drive-in bioscopes where motorists have started queuing early on Sunday afternoons, waiting for the premises to open. It was said that the films which were shown were religious films or films with a religious message, but these films soon became more and more secular. They attracted audiences from far and wide on the Eastern Rand. It was said that the film shows would be preceded by a prayer and also concluded by a prayer, but as the last sounds of those films died away, the cars had already begun to leave. The closing prayer was therefore accompanied by the roar of departing cars. Money was also collected at these film shows so that they later became a profit-making concern. Now I cannot understand why, under these circumstances, the Opposition does not want to allow the State to create an atmosphere on Sundays in which the Church can do its work.</p>

<p>It has been said that only a portion of the people have actually asked for this measure and that they want to force it upon the majority. However, the issue here is rather the interpretation of public opinion and we know that the Opposition has never actually been expert in ascertaining or interpreting the public opinion in South Africa. However, what are the facts in connection with Sunday legislation&#x003F; Why was it the accepted practice in Natal from 1838 to 1958 to introduce legislation in order to control Sunday activities&#x003F; Ordinance No. 1 of 1838, at the time of the Great Trek, has already been mentioned. At that time it was a British Government which was in power in the Cape and which introduced this legislation on the desecration of the Sabbath. It was only in 1930 that the Cape amended the Sabbath legislation in order to make it possible to sell newspapers and petrol on Sundays. This was in 1930, not long ago. I wonder whether this was not a mistake, especially if one thinks of the rubbish which some Sunday papers dish <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0401"/>up on a Sunday, for example the <i>Sunday Times.</i> In 1896 the Transvaal introduced legislation similar to that which had been placed on the Cape Statute Book in 1838. In Natal Ordinance No. 9 of 1939 introduced the same provision. Section 8(2) of the 1939 Ordinance of Natal allows the selling of bait for <i>bona fide</i> angling purposes except if one does it as a hawker. Nor was it allowed to take place in a shop. This was in 1939. In the Transvaal section 25 of Ordinance No. 14 of 1930 provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A butcher in kosher meat who satisfies the local authority that he keeps his shop <i>bona fide</i> closed from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday throughout the year and is duly registered by such local authority, may deliver kosher meat on Sundays before 9 a.m.</block>

<p>As far back as 1910, the appeal court ruled that a film show on a Sunday was an offence against the Transvaal law. In Act No. 19 of 1895 in the Cape it was laid down that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No place of public amusement shall on the Lord&#x2019;s Day be open to the public for the purpose of dancing or for any performance or exhibition, theatrical, dramatic, vocal, pictorial or the like.</block>

<p>If we refer to the legislation dated from after the Second World War, we find that in terms of section 5 of the Public Holidays Act, Good Friday, Ascension Day, the Day of the Covenant and Christmas Day are considered Sundays. No one may organize any races or dog races or any other public entertainment, contest or function where admission fees are paid. This was in 1950. Only the communist Sam Kahn raised his voice against this section because he did not believe that the Day of the Covenant should be considered a Sunday. Let us look at the gentlemen who voted for this clause at that time. They were Mrs. Ballinger, an arch-liberalist, Dr. Friedman of Hillbrow, Sir de Villiers Graaff, Dr. Albert Hertzog, Mr. Pilkington-Jordan, Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, Mr. Harry Lawrence, Mr. J. G. N. Strauss, a certain Mr. Japie Basson and Mr. Gray Hughes.</p>

<p>Then that Prog professor of Potchefstroom, Prof. Johan van der Vyver, to whom the hon. member for Parktown referred, made the allegation that this is a denial of the Calvinistic teaching. I should be pleased if the hon. member for Parktown would read that article, because in that same article he said that if the Afrikaner people were to disappear under certain circumstances, it would be just too bad. This is the type of man that that professor is. In the same article he also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">John Calvin himself also proclaimed that it was a function of State authority to be the watchdog of all ethical and religious virtues.</block>

<p>This is what he said in that same article. Now I should like to know why a Christian Government of a Christian State may not step in in order to create an atmosphere in which the Church can operate successfully on Sundays. Why was such an important matter quite in order from 1838 in the Cape to 1958 in Natal, but now, all of a sudden, it is no longer Calvinistic&#x003F; Or does it no longer suit the liberal lack of discipline of the leftist Opposition&#x003F; I think that this is the only explanation. If we in South Africa found it wise for a century and a half for the State to introduce legislation in this sphere, why has it now, after 1958, become odious for the State to introduce legislation of this kind&#x003F;</p>

<p>Prof. Van der Vyver emphasized that the State as such may not interfere as such in the private religious activities of its inhabitants, unless the activities are prejudicial to certain people. I think that this is the crux of the matter, that when one is causing a public outcry by showing these films on a Sunday, the time has come for the State to step in.</p>

<li>(1) is of the opinion that the Republic&#x2019;s present economic system, which is based on the principles of free enterprise and the pursuit, in a responsible manner, of the profit motive, is best suited for promoting the economic development of the country and the welfare of all its inhabitants; and</li>

<li>(2) notes with appreciation the steps taken by the Government to ensure the maintenance of this system within the framework of the broad national interest.</li>

</ol>

<p>The motion is clearly qualified, and although it is already clear that no difference of opinion exists in regard to the principle contained in the motion, it is nevertheless a very real matter, particularly in the light, if I may put it that way, of the emotional Press reports that appeared in this regard during the past week. During the session last year this subject was discussed on no fewer than 10 occasions and even in those debates there was in actual fact no difference of opinion. However, I must make it very clear that I want to emphasize the fact through the medium of this motion that the Government believes in free enterprise. I also believe in it and therefore I have moved this motion. But this is not the place of these emotional outbursts in regard to our economy, neither is it the time for them because in this period of economic recession remarks that have been made over the past while can do us a great deal of harm. This is a period during which we must remain calm and not distort facts when we talk about the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>However, before debating this matter this morning it is necessary to make a few remarks that can serve as points of departure for the purpose of debate. The first premise is that we are living at a time which is characterized by conflict between capitalism, or free enterprise, and the altruism or the process of equalization of socialism. In other words, we are living in a period of conflict between capitalism and communism. In support of my second premise I quote from the <i>Financial Gazette</i> which had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that South Africa is one of the least &#x201C;advanced&#x201D; countries in the march of the West in the race towards statism.</block>

<p>I think we can take this as our second premise. Thirdly, we are also a developing country and from the nature of things the task of the State in regard to the provision of capital is particularly difficult in comparison with the developed countries of the world. The last statement I want to make is that capitalism can only grow through the recognition of the profit motive and the rewarding of private enterprise. I believe that these four statements do in fact form the basis of our entire economic philosophy. We also take note of the fact that capitalism, particularly <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0403"/>during the 19th century, in its absolute form actually embodied the seed of self-destruction, which was what Karl Marx also stated in his book <i>Das Kapital.</i> The system has therefore to be adapted in order to withstand the assault of socialism and also for the sake of the requirements of our modern community and of capitalism and its survival. In its absolute form it can, according to Ayn Rand, be defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Capitalism is a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned.</block>

<p>According to this authoress the only part the State should apparently play in this absolute form of capitalism is the task of protecting the individual and his right of ownership. This state of affairs is of course completely out of the question in the modem State.</p>

<p>In fact, the State has much wider functions. I just want to mention a few of them. The legislative powers of the modem State are intended precisely to protect this system. In the second instance a central authority in the modem State is necessary in order to provide the infrastructure of a country. The State has also to provide security through the medium of its armed forces and the Police, and it has to make economically strategic provision for what cannot be readily supplied by the private sector. Furthermore, co-ordination in the State machine is also necessary in respect of every modem sphere, for example, community health services and numbers of other social responsibilities of the State which in our case have already to some extent been transferred to private enterprise. However, the system of capitalism remains the target of one assault after the other. The hon. member for Yeoville said last year that capitalism had in any case to handle the situation from a defensive position. Socialism is occupying one stronghold after the other; we cannot get away from this fact. Even the so-called bastion of capitalism, namely, the United States of America, also yielded to socialism recently in pursuance of certain election promises made by President Carter. He said, <i>inter alia</i>, that they would have to look at the profits of certain large companies with the view to &#x201C;a redistribution of wealth&#x201D;. That is a concept which we have also heard stated recently from that side of the House, although perhaps in another context. The well-known writer, Dr&#x00FC;ker, describes America, this bastion of capitalism, as &#x201C;the biggest socialist state in the world&#x201D; in pursuance of the position of power in which certain pension schemes in the United States of America find themselves. We have therefore to consider the matter against this background. In practice there has never been a completely free capitalist system, neither does one exist, and this includes South Africa. As with freedom of any kind, the State and the individual have to accept freedom with responsibility, otherwise it is not freedom, democracy or capitalism at all. The individual also requires the protection of the State against exploitation, undesirable commercial practices, monopolistic conditions, and in respect of credit control and welfare services. Free enterprise also requires discipline in this connection and here I should like to quote what the managing director of Trust Bank had to say in August 1976 according to <i>Die Burger</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In elke geval waar selfdissipline in gebreke gebly het, moes die owerheid die vakuum vul. Die opvatting dat dit altyd die owerhede is wat op eie inisiatief beheermaatre&#x00EB;ls en beperkings op die vrye optrede van die private sektor plaas, is in baie opsigte en in die meeste gevalle onregverdig. Ek wil die Stelling maak dat dit dikwels juis die private sektor is wat die owerheid versoek om maatre&#x00EB;ls in te stel en gevolglik in te meng, en tog is dit dieselfde private sektor wat dan kla of beswaar maak teen owerheidsinmenging.</block>

<p>I am convinced of the fact that a large number of people and undertakings in South Africa would welcome a freer economy. I am one of them. However, the State also has an extremely important political responsibility. Steps in this direction have therefore to be taken with the greatest circumspection. In my opinion certain economic specialists in the private sector have only a reasonably limited political insight, and I cannot therefore imagine how these roles could readily be reversed. The other side of the coin is that the experimental governments of Uruguay and others in the past which consisted of five consuls or experts, were dropped after a few <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0404"/>years because a political system is the truly tried system of government in the world. However, free enterprise is strongly supported in the motion that I have placed before hon. members today, apart from the morality of the fact that the individual who works hardest or displays the greatest measure of initiative, should receive the largest reward. Where unfortunately productivity has failed in the socialist states it is a fact that the people of the capitalist countries enjoy the highest standard of living in the world, and in South Africa the standard of living is one of the highest. It is, however, a prerequisite to enable free enterprise to flourish that the profit motive should be allowed to flourish as freely as possible and that the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; should not become a swear word in South Africa. Then, however, we must know that surplus capital must be used productively for the promotion of better standards of living, higher productivity and the provision of more employment opportunities for our people, and not in order to exercise political pressure. If we do not comply with these requirements free enterprise will unfortunately fail, as it has already failed elsewhere. There has to be stability, there has to be discipline in our economic system, there has to be responsibility and there has to be balance and co-ordination.</p>

<p>However, there are two questions that arise involuntarily to mind. The first is: Do we already have a form of socialism in South Africa&#x003F; The other question is then whether we have a form of creeping socialism. Critics of the Government make special mention of the State corporations, the various control boards, transport and communications systems that are supported by a growing bureaucracy, as examples in order to prove this statement.</p>

<p>However, what are the facts in this connection&#x003F; I want to take the steel industry as an example. In most countries of the world the steel industry is considered to be so strategically important that this industry is in fact nationalized or at least controlled, even in capitalist countries. From the nature of things Iscor came into being through the State in South Africa because, owing to historical considerations, the capital power of the private sector was in foreign hands in 1928. In spite of that, however, the State has since given a firm like Highveld Steel the right to enter into open competition with Iscor. This to me sounds rather like a process of de-nationalization, not one of creeping socialism. Iscor has, however, to survive because of its strategic position and in order to produce the non-profitable profiles to promote our national economy and also for the benefit of the private sector. However, the policy of the Government is to ensure that the activities of the State corporations do not clash with those of the private sector, particularly where Iscor, Sasol and Escom, for example, are not geared primarily to the profit motive. Where in fact the corporations clash with the interests of the private sector they are expected to withdraw. However, the position in South Africa is unique. These corporations were established chiefly because there have been times in our history when it was not possible to perform certain functions, and because the State did in fact have an economic development task, particularly during the depression period in the &#x2019;30s, to create employment opportunities for our people.</p>

<p>When we talk about the control boards it must also be said in this connection that there is one thing that free enterprise cannot offer and that is stability, particularly price stability. In terms of &#x201C;McCauley&#x2019;s Law&#x201D;, the law of supply and demand, considerable price fluctuation can be caused, particularly in respect of agricultural produce, and this is undesirable. The retention of bodies of this nature is therefore deemed to be necessary and they have therefore to be protected.</p>

<p>The accusation in regard to the transport system and the communications system in South Africa is to my mind really silly. There is virtually no railways system in the world that operates on a profitable basis.</p>

<p>The last charge against the State is in connection with the so-called &#x201C;bureaucratic monster&#x201D; that it has created in South Africa. The impression is created that the Public Service is simply becoming larger and larger and less productive. I do not wish to contend that there is no room for improvement, but let us look for a moment at the facts in this connection. If we make an analysis of all the economically active persons in the public sector in South Africa&#x2014;and this excludes the corporations&#x2014;we notice a gradual decrease in regard to State employment. In 1960 State employment involved 8,9% of the country&#x2019;s <span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0405"/>economically active people. In 1965 it was 8,8%; in 1970, 8,2%, and in 1975, 7,7%. This remarkable drop in State employment has taken place in spite of the fact that service organizations like the South African Railways and the Post Office are not included in these figures. In fact, during the aforementioned period, the Railways have reduced their staff from 3,8% to 3,6%, while the establishment of the Post Office has remained constant, and this in spite of far higher productivity in both the Railways and the Post Office.</p>

<p>The next question is whether we have creeping socialism here in South Africa. However, there is only one basis on which one can determine this, namely, to compare State expenditure as a percentage of the gross domestic product over a specific period. Over a period of 14 years, from 1960, this ratio rose by only 3%, in spite of enormous defence expenditure and the stockpiling of strategic material, <i>inter alia,</i> oil. This is a remarkable achievement. From 1975 to 1976, in spite of heavy Defence expenditure, it rose by only 1%.</p>

<p>The last question that arises is whether the State is in earnest in its intention to allow the private sector and free enterprise to flourish. In the limited time at my disposal I can only mention a few examples in this connection. It is remarkable enough that a serious attack has been made upon the State in regard to the whole question of television. What are the facts in connection with the television question&#x003F; It is stated that the Government should only have given permission for three manufacturers. I am just wondering whether certain bodies or persons should not have been excluded. But how does one reconcile this with the principle of free enterprise&#x003F; It is in fact directly in conflict with it. The State is committed to ensuring that price control is abolished to an increasing extent, with the exception of subsidized prices. The State is committed to give the private sector opportunities in South Africa to an increasing extent, but then we also want the co-operation of the private sector in this connection. That is why the Government thought fit to establish a permanent committee in regard to State competition which throughout plays the role of watchdog on behalf of the private sector. There are five members serving on this permanent committee nominated by the private sector. They are nominated by the Federated Chamber of Industries, Die Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, Seifsa, The Chamber of Mines, and Assocom. The recommendations of this committee go direct to the Cabinet. This therefore is a truly remarkable democratic principle as far as the private sector is concerned.</p>

<p>The whole question before us is therefore a matter of balance. The regulation of business activities in South Africa is, however, not completely satisfactory, and further analysis and improvements are indicated. Too little control can lead to irresponsibility, too much can undermine initiative and productivity. Free enterprise that does not take into account the demands of our times must fail, while free enterprise that is established on a responsible profit motive can promote the welfare of our country and of all race groups in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Newcastle first placed this motion on the Order Paper as a private member&#x2019;s motion, I asked myself what the underlying reason was. He is on record as saying, only last year the House devoted a considerable portion of its time during the Commerce and Industries Vote to the discussion of the free enterprise system and Government interference therein. When the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs replies to this debate, he has only to quote columns 8904-6 of his Hansard of last year because the circumstances have not changed. I asked myself whether it was purely coincidental that the hon. member for Newcastle proceeded with this motion, but then the penny dropped with the publication and attention given in the news to the book <i>Assault on Private Enterprise</i> by Dr. Wassenaar. Realizing the seriousness of the economic situation in South Africa and accepting the fact that the hon. the Minister is on record as having said again only yesterday that we are living in serious economic times, and accepting that this debate, being a debate on a private member&#x2019;s motion, will certainly not develop into a political debate, I cast the following scenario which I think will probably form the background for the discussion that is to follow. I see the Government as the accused, private enterprise&#x2014;and not the UP&#x2014;as the plaintiff, Dr. Wassenaar as the public prosecutor and Assocom, the Handelsinstituut, <span class="col_777-778" refersTo="page_0406"/>the Sakekamer and also Mr. Len Abrahamse as the witnesses.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. Minister will know that during my career I was a leader in Assocom, chairman of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce and also of an organization in the motor industry. Therefore I do not speak entirely as a layman. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I continue. The evidence that is given in this scenario is contained in this book. That is the last mention I shall make of this book, but I feel that there must be some reason for this debate being duplicated in this House.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is one with two definite legs, one stating principle and the other stating practice. I would agree with him that the principles enunciated are ones which we on this side of the House substantially go along with. On the subject of the endeavour to praise the Government&#x2019;s implementation of the principle in practice, I disagree entirely and I immediately move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraph (2) and to substitute:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;(2) expresses its strong disapproval of the failure of the Government to promote this system in practice.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>On the subject of the principle, let me say that the disastrous economic situation in which the country finds itself today is not because of the principles of free enterprise having been followed, but because of the breaking of the rules of free enterprise. The first breaking of these rules goes back many years when a previous Minister of Finance went on record as having said that this Government would bend the economy to suit its ideologies.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that the debate is taking place today between private business and private enterprise on the one hand and the Government on the other; it is not taking place between this side of the House and Afrikanerdom or even the Nationalist Party. In this world today governments in many countries are being accused of tendencies towards creeping socialism. Therefore I want to put forward the principle that my party stands for and then show where this Government has gone wrong. On the question of capitalism, we believe that the accrual of capital can only be achieved through the profit motive and that it is retained profits that make our economy tick. When the Government absorbs too great a proportion of retained profits, the redistribution of wealth is damaged and there is not enough to go around.</p>

<p>In order to describe the inroads by the Government into the private sector more graphically, let me ask whether any hon. member of this House would willingly take half a loaf of his bread and give it to the Government. Would any hon. member of this House willingly lend his new motor-car to the Government for four months of the year free&#x003F; Would any hon. member of this House, having a house with five rooms, willingly house four public servants in that house for two to three months of the year&#x003F; This is an encroachment into private enterprise.</p>

<p>Secondly, referring to the free enterprise system in the economic sense, we believe that economic freedom is total freedom, and one cannot reconcile the Government&#x2019;s policy of the grand concept of apartheid and other restrictive economic measures, which apply to such a large proportion of our people, with the free economic concept. Freedom is total and indivisible.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to some of the evidence. I shall quote first of all the evidence from commerce and private industry. I have quoted it previously, at the end of last session. This comes not from the UP but from the Afrikaanse Sakekamer and the Handelsinstituut. In <i>Volkshandel</i> of May 1976 we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Slaan kruipende sosialisme hok: Dit is tyd om emstig te besin oor die stadige ondergrawing van ons vrye ondernemingskapstelsel waarop Suid-Afrika se groei en welvaart gebou is en om <span class="col_779-780" refersTo="page_0407"/>privaatinisiatief en die winsmotief te stimuleer in plaas van hok te slaan.

Ons maak te veel wette om te beskerm en te beheer, sodat ons al groter slawe word van ons eie amptenary wat ons beheer en reguleer.</block>

<p>Sir, that comes from the Afrikaans private sector. May I quote a similar attitude which was revealed by the president of the Chambers of Commerce of the United States, when he asked: &#x201C;Can capitalism survive&#x003F;&#x201D; He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question I ask about the survival of our system is related to the continuing and projected growth of Government, growth of bureaucratic regulation and growth of competition between the public sector and the private sector. In my position I am exposed to literally thousands of businessmen from all parts of the nation and from all industrial sectors and from all sizes of companies. I must report that there is more fear, genuine fear, and concern about the survival of our system today than any time in my memory.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to go further and quote from a responsible overseas publication, <i>International Currency Review,</i> Vol. VIII, No. 6. Here they are discussing the difficulties in which our present economic system in South Africa has landed us.</p>

<p>This is what they say about South Africa, Sir. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pretoria&#x2019;s economic, social and political policies have to be condemned as being antiquated, perverse and counterproductive.</block>

<p>[Interjections.]</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as it willingly implements the designs of its forefathers. It wholly lacks imagination and foresight.</block>

<p>They go on further to indicate that if this Government is to get us back on to the road of economic stability, we have to do certain things. This comes from outsiders, Sir, but, they are important outsiders who influence the investment capital flowing into this country. This is what they recommend&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The abolition of the Group Areas Act, which restricts the movement of Blacks; the repeal of labour-restrictive clauses of the Environment and Planning Act, which stipulates the White/Black work-force ratios in urban areas; the removal of what is left of job reservation schemes; and the legal recognition of Black and racially mixed trade unions.</block>

<p>So, one sees that responsible thought has the same format as the thoughts of responsible business interests in South Africa. This article then goes on to indicate the real context of this debate when it says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What happened in 1976 &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is why we are having this debate now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; was that, probably for the first time this century, Government policy in South Africa was clearly seen to have become detrimental to the sustained prosperity of the whole population.</block>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s motion, of course, refers to the interests of the whole population. I quote further from this article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0408"/>Hence, for the first time in its 30 years&#x2019; rule, the Nationalist Government has been faced with sharp and vociferous opposition from the business community &#x2026;</block>

<p>And these are the writer&#x2019;s words&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. I accept that for the record. [Interjections.] May I say that although commerce in South Africa was disturbed, it reacted courteously to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s mild allegations. May I say, too, that the Prime Minister should realize that if commerce is not to interfere in politics, equally politics should not then interfere in commerce. For the sake of the record, it is a fact that the early definition of economics was &#x201C;the science of political economy&#x201D;. If private enterprise sees a situation developing where we are heading for a crisis confrontation, then it is duty bound to speak out. If we take a look at the present economic climate, where we have had the collapse of the Haak empire, the distress into which Rondalia has fallen, the collapse of Glen Anil as well as the trouble facing the Rand Bank, then I believe it is the responsibility of private enterprise to see that the Government policies which are creating this situation should definitely be opposed. I want to say that we on this side of the House go along entirely with private enterprise in its assertion that the Government, through its influence on private enterprise and its interference in matters which more correctly belong to private enterprise, is injudiciously meddling in the welfare of South Africa.</p>

<p>State corporations and public corporations have been mentioned. It is generally recognized that, whatever the rights or wrongs, the tremendous requirements for overseas capital by State corporations and public corporations are making inroads into that capital which is necessarily needed to be available if private enterprise is to prosper. Bearing in mind that in the forthcoming debates the hon. the Minister of Finance will possibly call for an amount of the order of R2 000 million of this country&#x2019;s money for the purpose of defence, which will be vitally necessary, let me ask this House where that money comes from other than from the pockets of private enterprise and other than from profits which are made and retained in private enterprise&#x003F; Anything that assists in reducing the availability of capital for private enterprise must therefore be seen in perspective. We cannot all be rich and we cannot have everything that we want. This country stands on its human resources, which we are not making the most of. It stands on private enterprise, which has achieved over the years the biggest advances, the biggest interests for every individual because of the fact that private enterprise has been allowed a relatively free rein in which to develop our economy.</p>

<p>Today the restrictions and the shackles in which private enterprise finds itself are seriously hindering our economic and productive efforts. I would say, with Mr. Len Abrahamse, that the cost to our economy and the people of South Africa caused by this Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid is so tremendously high that this country is denied its very right to exist, in the purchase of arms, because of the wasteful spending of money.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, having moved this amendment, I want to finish by quoting what I believe are words of which this should take account. We have to be seen, as private enterprise, to stand up and make ourselves heard against, not the NP in this case, but the Government which is leading us into these straits. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we sit back and do nothing, we may one day find ourselves in the same position as the Protestant pastor in Germany, who said after World War II&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The Nazis came for the communists and I did not speak up, because I was not a communist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak up because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak up because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I was a Protestant, so I did not speak up. And then they came for me. By that time there was no one left to speak for anyone.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0409"/>Let me conclude with this quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;So in closing, I ask you, for whom the bell tolls&#x003F;</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newcastle did this House a favour by broaching this subject once more. It arises, not only from the considerations mentioned by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, but also from the consideration of the particularly irresponsible talk of the PRP and other liberalists in regard to the so-called &#x201C;redistribution of wealth&#x201D; in South Africa. It arises from the als and organizations, particularly organizations, in their political campaigns to achieve their political objectives.</p>

<p>South Africa is a democratic State with the banner of &#x201C;free economy&#x201D; flying at its mast-head. South Africa is not only a democratic State which believes in free democracy, but also a State which abhors communism and rejects socialism. Consistent with that is the right to criticize and the right to differ. These two things are inherent in the democracy in South Africa. This side of the House most certainly believes in these things. We have stated this in season and out of season, both within and outside this House, this and the fact that we believe in the profit motive. I read the following in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 31 January of this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Interviewed yesterday by <i>The Cape Times</i> on his book <i>Assault on Private Enterprise,</i> which will be published later this week, Dr. A. D. Wassenaar rejected the call by the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, for prominent business speakers to refrain from public criticism of the Government.</block>

<p>Then he is quoted as having said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the current situation, I do not believe anybody has a right to ask businessmen to remain silent.</block>

<p>It goes further however. In the same report it is also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Referring to the economic system of Russia, he asked whether South Africa could not be considered a communist State with an Afrikaans economic dictatorship.</block>

<p>This is of course just as nonsensical as it is irresponsible, and all the more irresponsible if one sees it against the background against which South Africa is existing and living at the moment, and if one takes into consideration the threats which are being made against South Africa. I have said that this allegation&#x2014;the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens also referred to it by way of a quotation&#x2014;that I had allegedly forbidden businessmen to criticize the Government, is so untrue and so false that in truth it borders on a deliberate lie. What I said in this regard I said in public, in the hearing, too, of certain members of the Opposition who are sitting in this House today and who attended the meeting at which I spoke. On 18 October 1976 I made a speech before Assocom, and I want to quote three paragraphs from what I said on that occasion. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say, as a result of what happened elsewhere I must start off this afternoon by saying to you, so that in future there will be no misunderstanding, that I do not only happen to be Prime Minister of South Africa, but it also happens that I am the leader of a certain political party, a political party with certain policies, policies which I happen to believe in very sincerely, otherwise I would not be in public life. No doubt, many of you, if not most of you, disagree with me politically. That, of course, is your right. It is not only your right to disagree with me; it is your right to talk to me about the differences. It is also your right, if you so wish, to attack me as far as these differences go. That is the essence of democracy as I see it, but whilst on the one hand that is your right as businessmen, I think you will agree with me that you cannot ask me, now or in the future, to accept policies which have been rejected by the electorate and in which I do not believe.</block>

<p><span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0410"/>A far cry therefore from my having forbidden people to do so. In actual fact I acknowledged their right not only to discuss the differences; I also told them that they might attack me in respect of those differences if they so wished. After I had elaborated on these matters I went further and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Flowing from this appreciation of the close links between economics and politics, it falls entirely within the legitimate activities of business organizations, as I have already said, to comment on political developments in so far as these infringe upon the functioning of the economy. There are, however, different possible approaches to such comment, some of which are more likely to lead to constructive results than others. It is on these various ways in which business organizations can approach their comment on political issues that I want to offer you some thoughts on this occasion.</block>

<p>After I had elaborated on that point, I went further and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection I wish to make it clear, although I do not question the right of any businessman, as I have already said, or for that matter any individual, to hold and, within the limits of the law, to express his own views on the way in which our society should be structured, that I do question, and I think you will understand me, the propriety of using as vehicles for such viewpoints business organizations which have been constituted not for this purpose, but to represent the legitimate business interests of their members. It must be understood quite clearly that in South Africa the way to change overall, broad directions of policy, is through the political processes provided for in our Constitution.</block>

<p>I do not think there is anyone who can object to these statements or who can allege that I criticized or admonished businessmen for having criticized the Government and forbade them to do so.</p>

<p>I have referred to the falsity of the two points as they appeared in the report in <i>The Cape Times.</i> Following that&#x2014;and this is why I am participating in this debate&#x2014;a further report appeared in <i>Die Beeid</i> on 1 February, 1977, in which reference was made to what Dr. Wassenaar had said in this regard, and to subsequent comment. It states here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Wassenaar, 68, die besadigde aktuaris &#x2026;</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I do not think I am doing the hon. gentleman an injustice when I say that he laughed out loud at this word.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; wat voorsitter is van &#x2026; het die nuus oor die hele land gehaal met sy boek waarin hy, soos hy dit noem, die onbeheerde, ongedissiplineerde beheer oor die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie deur opeenvolgende NP-regerings, aangeval het.</block>

<p>Further on the report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die enigste antwoord, s&#x00EA; dr. Wassenaar, is dat die Regering met manne in die privaatsektor wat die kundigheid het, saamwerk. Sulke manne Kan die portefeuljes oor finansi&#x00EB;le en ekonomiese aangeleenthede in die Kabinet oomeem en moontlik nog verskeie ander portefeuljes ook. Hierdie portefeuljes moet buite die politiek gehou word.</block>

<p>The report also states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Wassenaar oor negatiewe reaksie: Ek het met die premier gepraat.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not discuss interviews which people have had with me unless the person who had the interview turns it into a public issue. Dr. Wassenaar has now turned this into a public issue, and therefore I have to discuss it. He did have an interview with me and it was not the only interview. This particular interview took place shortly after Dr. Diederichs had retired and had been nominated to become State President. He had an interview with me, and it was very clear, not only from what he told me at the time, but also from this report in <i>Die Beeid</i> that Dr. Wassenaar believed that Dr. Malan, Mr. Strijdom and Dr. Verwoerd had not amounted to much. Nor did he make any secret of his belief that Mr. Havenga, Mr. Louw, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges and Dr. Diederichs, i.e. successive Ministers of Finance, had not known what they were dealing with or what they were doing and that the departmental secretaries such as Dr. Holloway, Dr. Hennie <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0411"/>Steyn and Mr. Browne were not very competent people. Dr. Wassenaar made it very clear to me that if I wanted to amount to something, in contrast to my predecessors, I should sack Senator Horwood and Mr. Heunis, should dismiss them and appoint people from the ranks of the businessmen. His standpoint is&#x2014;and I am not doing him any injustice&#x2014;is that he has no confidence in members of Parliament, members not only on this side of the House, but on the opposite side as well. He has no confidence in members of Parliament. He is in favour of the American system, namely that one should draw one&#x2019;s Ministers from outside Parliament and not from among the ranks of the elected representatives. We then argued about this system and we also argued about individuals, and once again I am not doing him an injustice when I say that all the individuals were shot down in flames until only one remained. I then told Dr. Wassenaar that I would not accept the USA system and that I would appoint people to the Cabinet from among the members of Parliament who were responsible to Parliament and the voters of South Africa. I am not prepared to accept any other system. What Dr. Wassenaar&#x2019;s standpoint amounts to is that one should not appoint people who are answerable either to Parliament or to the electorate. This is such a fundamental difference that I definitely have no intention of adopting that system, and I informed him of this in no uncertain terms. Now I am in the same category as my predecessors, as far as Dr. Wassenaar is concerned.</p>

<p>An attack is also being launched on the officials. These people cannot speak on their own behalf, and I want to say here today&#x2014; and it is not necessary for me to say this in their defence&#x2014;that South Africa has over the years had officials at its disposal and, thank God, still has such officials at its disposal today, who are not only rendering the best conceivable service to South Africa, but who are comparable with the best in the world. I say, and I am saying this also in defence of hon. members opposite: South Africa has over the years had Governments and officials which created the climate in which the private sector in South Africa could flourish. Not only does one wish to express one&#x2019;s gratitude and appreciation towards the officials&#x2014;for that would present only half the picture&#x2014;but one would also wish to express one&#x2019;s appreciation towards the business of South Africa who have served South Africa in the past and are still serving this country as they are doing. I have always said this at all times both within and outside this House, and I should also like to mention this again here today.</p>

<p>Attacks were launched on the State corporations. Time does not permit me to say very much about this today. There are aspects at which one could indeed level criticism. I readily concede that. However, I just want to refer in passing to the fact that groundless references are constantly being made to bureaucracy. Surely the directors of State corporations are not Government officials. All of them come from the private sector. It is not Government officials who are responsible for the management or the policy of such corporations. One can only speak of bureaucracy if these matters are in the hands of officials and if those officials simply continue, without rhyme or reason, to do as they wish.</p>

<p>Surely one cannot have one&#x2019;s cake and eat it. Those same critics frequently reproach the officials with working according to rules and regulations, and then they talk of so-called &#x201C;red tape&#x201D;. We all do this, and in some respects it is true. However, if one does away with rules and regulations, and the officials may use their discretion as they please and give one decision today and another decision tomorrow, then one has bureaucracy. But one does not have bureaucracy when work is done according to rules laid down by this Parliament, by the Parliament, by the representatives of the people. Then such an allegation is sheer nonsense.</p>

<p>I want to repeat my statement. This side of the House has never yet denied anyone free criticism. Whether he is a Nationalist or whether he is not a Nationalist, he has a right to criticize this Government. A friend of mine informed me that he had examined the annual reports of Dr. Wassenaar&#x2019;s organization over a period and had not found a single word of criticism of the Government in those reports. If there had then been reason for criticism, surely he omitted to do his duty by not expressing it. It would not have been taken amiss of him. It was not taken amiss of him when he was opposed to South Africa becoming a Republic. Every person has a right to take up a standpoint. This is not taken amiss of one.</p>

<p><span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0412"/>I want to go further. I want to say that anyone may criticize this Government and it was not only in my speech before Assocom that I said this. This affords those people who are not members of the NP, like Dr. Wassenaar, where they cannot work through party channels, an opportunity to let the Government know what they think and do not think in that regard. I want to make it very clear that this Government, far from having suggested in the past that it was opposed to criticism, in fact a great many talks with the private sector.</p>

<p>Not only my colleagues, the hon. Minister of Finance, the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs and all the others who are involved in this, but I personally am also available to these persons, to listen to their criticism and to ascertain from them in what respect the Government is treading on their toes and in what respect the Government can make things easier for them. They have always had an open door and shall continue to have it at all times in future. In a report on Dr. Wassenaar in <i>Die Beeid</i> it is stated, however&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Wassenaar s&#x00EA; hy hoop om genoeg steun van Afrikaanse en Engelse sakegemeenskappe te bekom om die Regering te dwing om iets te doen.</block>

<p>My objection is not that he is criticizing the Government; my objection is that he is gossip-mongering instead of criticizing. There is a vast difference. One cannot react to gossip, but one can react to criticism. Having now made this appeal, I want to say this in short on behalf of the NP: Better people than he have tried to break this Government and bring it to a fall.</p>

<speech by="#enthoven_t_hooft">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN &#x2019;T HOOFT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find two very significant things about the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. In the first place I find it very significant that he should have decided to speak at all in this debate. Secondly, I found what he actually had to say very significant. He clearly was not interested in the motion before the House. He clearly was not concerned about the facts that there are banks collapsing, that there are more financial collapses than ever before, that we have the biggest financial collapse in South Africa&#x2019;s history on our hands at this very moment. He did not have a word of assurance for the country on this score. He was only concerned with the book of Dr. Wassenaar. That is all he was interested in. What did he say about the book&#x003F; Did he say anything about what is in the book&#x003F; I wonder if the hon. the Prime Minister has even read it. In this book is set out a clearly made-out case. It is not a new case. It has come up for discussion outside the House as well as inside it many, many times. All that has happened in the past is that occasionally perhaps the hon. the Minister of Finance would react. However, suddenly this book has appeared and, although it contains nothing new, the hon. the Prime Minister feels it is necessary for him to react. If one analyses what the hon. the Prime Minister said, his motivation is clear. All he wanted to do was to take this opportunity to get up and endeavour to assassinate the character of Dr. Wassenaar, to assassinate the character of the chairman of Sanlam, to assassinate the character of the man who inherits the illustrations mantle of Dr. Tienie Louw, to assassinate one of the pillars of the Afrikaner establishment [Interjections.] That is why he has reacted in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister could not care two ticks whether the case made out in the book is right or wrong. He is not interested in the economics of the country. What the hon. the Prime Minister is interested in is the politics. He gets up and speaks not on an economic issue, but on a political issue. We must analyse why this political issue is so important to the hon. the Prime Minister. What is the reason why it is so important&#x003F; The reason is that what Dr. Wassenaar, the chairman of Sanlam, has done is that he has broken the code. He has actually publicly criticized the Government. That is why the hon. the Prime Minister is endeavouring to assassinate his character today. [Interjections.] And why&#x003F; This is an interesting question.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN &#x2019;T HOOFT</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; the people of today are very unhappy. They are discussing amongst themselves the problems of the country and they are looking to the hon. the Prime Minister for leadership, but they are not finding that leadership. They are looking to the National Party and not finding that leadership. One person has now had the guts to come out in public and state his case. He will be the first of many more. This is the whole reason why the hon. the Prime Minister thought it was necessary to get up today and to endeavour to assassinate the character of Dr. Wassenaar.</p>

<p>What I really find tragic is that in this moment of our history, at this moment when we desperately need leadership, at this moment when our internal problems are such that we are virtually in a state of bloody revolution in South Africa, when we are threatened on our borders by the enemies of our country, when diplomatically speaking this Government is isolated by our friends in the West, and when our economy is heading for the verge of bankruptcy, when we look to the hon. the Prime Minister for leadership, what does the country get&#x003F; It finds that it has a leader at the helm who is nothing more than a petty, party-political hack. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>When one looks at the motion and in fact when one thinks about the way in which the Government has gone about the whole economic policy of the country, the one thing that has become absolutely clear is that the Government is suffering from a very severe case of schizophrenia. On the one hand we have heard from the hon. the Prime Minister, as we have heard from the hon. member who introduced the motion, that they see themselves as the champions of the free enterprise system. This is how they see themselves. But when one actually looks at the facts, they exert the strongest socialistic influence in the economy that one can expect. This is the schizophrenia that exists amongst the Government when it comes to the economy. If one looks at the motion we are debating, it actually proves this point. The motion states that the Republic&#x2019;s present economic system is based on two principles, one being free enterprise and the other the pursuit, in a responsible manner, of the profit motive. When we analyse it we see that this statement is actually and factually not correct. The Government may have convinced themselves that this is so, but anyone who actually looks at the situation sees that it is just not correct. The facts now show that 50%, or near 50%, of our gross domestic fixed investment is State-controlled. That is a fact; and 35% of the economically active Whites are employed by the State. These are two facts. This means that we have a mixed economy, a mixed economy on the same socialist model as for instance Britain, or Sweden, or Holland, or any other Western socialist mixed economy. However, in our economy there is absolutely no resemblance at all to that of, say, the USA or of Japan. What is more important is that our economy is becoming more socialist as the years go on. Every time we get statistics we can see that the degree of socialism in our economy is expanding. In the five years from 1970-&#x2019;71 to 1975-&#x2019;76 Government expenditure increased by 250%, and the share of gross domestic product consumed by the <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0414"/>Government increased by approximately 30%, from 22% to 29%.</p>

<p>Let us deal with that aspect of the motion which refers to the pursuit of the profit motive. The hon. member moves in this motion that the profit motive must be pursued in a responsible manner. What I gathered from his speech is that what he really means by that, is that there must be no exploitation of workers and no exploitation of the buying public. Here again we have a situation which is also patently incorrect. Anyone who is remotely aware of what happens in the South African economy is aware of the fact that Black people are prohibited from any effective participation in our economy. Our Statute Books groan under the weight of laws which effectively preclude the Blacks from competing freely in any meaningful way, either as employers or as employees in our economy. Our laws have created a permanent Black proletariat with not even a statutory right to bargain on a collective basis for the sale of their labour. Even worse, they do not even enjoy free mobility of labour. I cannot conceive of a worse form of exploitation than this.</p>

<p>If one adds to that, as the hon. member for Newcastle does, that this economic system is best suited for promoting the economic development of the country and the welfare of all its inhabitants, it really becomes absurd. What the economic system which this Government has entrenched has done, is that it has entrenched the difference between the &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and the &#x201C;have-nots&#x201D; in our society on purely racial grounds. It has convinced Black people that the free enterprise system is little more than a means by which the Whites enrich themselves at the expense of Blacks. This is the tragedy that all of us are going to have to live with.</p>

<p>Now we come to the second part of the motion, in which the hon. member who has introduced the motion asks us to express our appreciation for the steps taken by the Government to ensure the maintenance of this system within the framework of the broad national interest. Sir, that leaves me quite speechless. How anybody who is not either moronic or insane would want to maintain this system, a system which this Government has introduced into South Africa, is quite beyond me. In my opinion it can only lead to a total economic, political and social collapse, if the creeping socialism which is taking place does not completely destroy the free enterprise system first. There is also the huge powder-keg which we are sitting on, this huge Black proletariat which is condemned permanently by existing legislation which has the effect that they can have no participation on an equal level in our economy at all. If we think that we can survive these two dangers, we must admit that we can certainly not survive the enormous spending-spree the Government has decided to go on.</p>

<p>Various estimates have been made, but one estimate which seems to be current, is that over the next five years South Africa is committed to a capital expenditure of R25 000 million. I see a shocked look on the face of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs; I think he ought to do his homework. If he would do that, he would find out that it is as I have said. If this is really the case, where is all this money going to come from&#x003F; We are going to witness a fierce competition between the Government and the private sector, a firece competition for the very limited resources which we have at our disposal. Unfortunately the Government holds all the cards and the private sector cannot compete on an equal ground with the Government. By a mixture of increased taxation&#x2014;heaven knows, it is already far too high&#x2014;currency inflation, forced savings and Government loans and increased charges for goods and services provided by State monopolies, the private sector will be forced into astronomical debts which it will have to pay in order to finance the Government&#x2019;s excess expenditure. The regrettable thing is that the debt must eventually be liquidated. If it cannot be liquidated out of real earnings&#x2014; and at our present rate of inflation and our present rate of taxation there is absolutely no possibility that this debt can be liquidated out of real earnings&#x2014;then the only alternative is bankruptcy or hyperinflation. At the present moment we are seeing enough bankruptcies and there will be a lot more. I think it can be said with a fair degree of certainty that unless the opinion of people like Dr. Wassenaar is accepted, and accepted quickly&#x2014;the opinion of other critics of the Government who point this out must also be accepted&#x2014;we are going to see, in the not too distant future, whole sections of our economy going to the wall, not because they are bad companies, but <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0415"/>because the Government&#x2019;s expenditure will work itself through to an unbearable load of debt on that particular sector. When the Government eventually sees this happening, it will of course print more money and hyperinflation will come as well.</p>

<p>I earnestly should like to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens because I believe the Government is an absolute disaster when it comes to private enterprise, and in fact the whole economy.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. J. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there is one typical example of someone who has flourished under South Africa&#x2019;s capitalistic system, it is the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. The fact that he made such an attack on this system and that he, as a backbencher, flung the crudest insults at the hon. the Prime Minister which I have ever heard in the short time that I have been in this House is something which will cost him dear at some stage in his career. We shall take him to task for this one day. Who is he to accuse the hon. the Prime Minister of being a &#x201C;petty party-political hack&#x201D;&#x003F; I think it is the height of audacity and impropriety. [Interjections.] I should like to remind him in a very friendly way that the hon. the Prime Minister did not refer to this book one single time, but simply referred to newspaper reports on the book. For him to allege that the hon. the Prime Minister referred to the book shows that the hon. member did not even listen properly. He says that there is large-scale unrest and revolt in NP circles and even in the Church. We shall demonstrate to him where the unrest and distrust lies at the next election, because the greatest possible mistrust which the voters in South Africa can have is in the deceptive policy which is advocated by that party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, he says: &#x201C;We desperately need leadership.&#x201D; At the moment I think: &#x201C;We desperately need a proper Opposition as well.&#x201D; He says: &#x201C;We desperately need leadership.&#x201D; I should now like to demonstrate to him why the hon. the Prime Minister stood up here this morning. It was not so much to react to a few statements in a book; it was to deal with a matter which goes much deeper. Do those hon. members not realize that if we have newspaper headlines like &#x201C;Why South Africa is going communist&#x201D;, it constitutes an attack&#x2014;and everything which that involves&#x2014;on the strongest single argument which South Africa has had so far, namely to range itself on the side of the West, as an outspokenly anti-communist country, and therefore to have the right to appeal to the West for help&#x003F; This being so, is it not the duty of our leader, the highest person in our hierarchy, to put a stop to this tendency, and everything which will develop from it, immediately and with dramatic effect&#x003F; Publicity is being given to a book and an attitude which create a slanted impression, something which tells one side of the story and not the other, and does not make a single attempt to give the true perspective. This book has already had its effects abroad and has, in fact, already proved to be counter-productive. Instead of attempting a so-called rescue of the capitalist system in South Africa, quite the reverse is now being achieved, because it is a book which attacks not only the Government and the individuals who make up the Government, but the Afrikaner, who is not going to be ousted from these seats in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>In other words, it is a warning to foreign investors: &#x201C;Look, gentlemen, as long as the Afrikaner governs this country it will be heading for communism and there will be no future for your investments in South Africa. &#x201D; This is the ultimate effect, and it is counterproductive indeed. Furthermore, because of the special circumstances of our country, people who want to criticize find it very easy to fling all kinds of accusations at the Government. Even if the Government, which has been in power for so long, had, for example, increased company tax by a mere fraction every year, it would have been an astronomical figure by this time. It is quite different in other countries. There one can at least say that some of these measures are the responsibility of the Opposition because they too are in power now and again. In South Africa it is a completely different question. These and other perspectives are not reflected in this book, and these are the things which are going to damage South Africa, more than anything else. Now he comes along and says: &#x201C;We seek leadership.&#x201D; We have the leadership of someone who has the far-sightedness and the political feeling to identify these dangers which lie at the root of the survival of this nation and the existing order in this country.</p>

<p><span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0416"/>I support this motion enthusiastically, because I believe in the capitalist system absolutely. I reject with contempt any system which will cause one to work according to one&#x2019;s ability and to earn according to one&#x2019;s needs. I, together with members on this side of the House, reject it completely. In this way, too, it is very clear to anyone who gives any thought to these matters that there can be no question of an absolute capitalist system in the world today. It cannot exist. Judging from the evolution of government of modern States, it is, after all, very clear that the ultimate test is not what system one serves, but what is in the best interests of one&#x2019;s country. It is the ultimate test against which the Government tests its actions, and against which the private sector as well as every individual should also test their actions, because these three form the fundamental pillars of the capitalist system. Because there is such a basic interlocking between the political, the social and the economic spheres of life, this side of the House makes no excuse at all for what it has done in the economic sphere, something which the theoretical economist may have regarded as an offence against the capitalist system, but which complies with the highest requirements of the national interest. The Government has a mandate for this from the majority of the voters in this country. We make no excuse for this.</p>

<p>Hon. members made a great fuss about the percentage expenditure of the general government sector. How dare they condemn it out of hand&#x003F; I want to ask them: Has any optimum percentage been determined to indicate a good ratio for the distribution of Government and private sector expenditure&#x003F; There is no fixed norm of this kind. There is only one test as far as expenditure is concerned, and this is: What is in the national interest and what will serve the highest ideals of the country&#x003F; If one looks at the percentage distribution and tries to determine what the result would be of a decrease or an increase in State expenditure, both possibilities have certain advantages and disadvantages, and one must make one&#x2019;s decision in terms of the social and political demands made on the economy of the country.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few reasons why our expenditure for the general government sector is so relatively high. In this connection we are not alone by the way; high Government expenditure is the tendency throughout the West, and although this does not mean that the tendency is the right one, we must first examine our circumstances. There is a concentration of people in metropolitan areas. Instead of providing their own services as they used to do in the rural areas or on the farm, a great number of people have gathered here and collectively require certain services. The authorities do in fact provide su&#x00E7;h services and are forced to spend money in order to provide them. The demands made on these services, are becoming higher and higher, and in addition the cost of these services follows an exponential curve of cost increases as they are provided in the vast metropolitan areas. In other words, it is becoming more and more expensive to provide more and more services in densely populated metropolitan areas than in rural areas. Surely these economic facts are obvious to anyone. Furthermore, we are a developing country, and, as is typical of a developing country, we have an immense need for infrastructure, and this is provided by the State, as is the case throughout the world. A man like Dr. Martin van den Bergh, who can definitely not be considered a socialist, said that it has become the custom in the economic world of today for the State to provide the infrastructure where a sophisticated economy has to arise. In addition, the capital requirements of most infrastructure projects are such that we in South Africa in particular can hardly appeal to the private sector time and again to take them over.</p>

<p>In course of time, authorities have also come to play a different role in countries&#x2019; economies. It is very interesting, for example, to note that the percentage of economically active people in the agricultural industry and in mining is becoming smaller and that these people are changing over to the secondary and service sectors. Therefore it is very important for the Government to take note of such tendencies before it is too late, to anticipate the results correctly and then to create the right circumstances for dealing with them by taking certain economic and other measures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I should like to make a point in respect of agriculture. There is a great deal of criticism of the vertical integration which is taking place in agriculture, i.e. that control <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0417"/>over all sections of the industry is being centralized, from primary production, through to collection, distribution and, ultimately, marketing, and that it is therefore largely closed to the non-agricultural sector. Incidentally, it should be mentioned that this vertical integration is also taking place in certain public corporations. I do not want to allege that it is justified in all cases, as in agriculture; indeed, the Government is constantly ordering investigations in an attempt to curb the unnecessary annexation of other industries by the Government corporations. Recently I saw some of the reports which were submitted to the commission on the Marketing Act. Those people from the private sector who complain so much about agriculture being closed to them&#x2014;I am speaking specifically of Assocom, which the hon. member for Gardens made such a fuss about&#x2014;must tell me whether agriculture is not a typical example of entrepreneurship. We should take note of the risks and responsibilities involved and the management ability which is required. Why do these complainers not join this industry&#x003F; I suggest that they start at the primary level, with the manual work, or do they want to sit in air-conditioned offices, doing the marketing only and thereby claiming for themselves the cream of the industry&#x003F; It is perfectly possible for them to get their slice of the cake, too, within this system, if they want it so badly.</p>

<p>In South Africa there are enough opportunities for everyone, and I cannot think that there has ever been anyone in South Africa who had capital which he could not invest profitably anywhere. We have only to look at what can still be done in respect to the enrichment of minerals. We export 60% of our chrome ore and this earns only 30% of the total earnings from chrome ore, while after the alloying processes, 34% of this chrome ore earns 70% of the total foreign currency.</p>

<p>Must we now wait for the Government to create a Chromecor or something of that kind&#x003F; This is simply one example. There are so many spheres which the private sector can enter and in which it can invest its money. For this reason I believe that it is ridiculous to allege that the private sector should participate at this stage in undertakings like Iscor, Escom, etc. Why should we bring about a mere transfer of capital from the State to the public&#x003F; In a country which has such a need for capital, is the Government now to say that Iscor&#x2019;s shares are up for sale to the public&#x003F; If there are things which must be rectified in these corporations, other means than new ownership must be applied in order to rectify them. If not, the private sector could compete with the public corporation as far as prices are concerned.</p>

<p>The only conclusion which I could draw when I looked at this question of free enterprise and socialism was that neither the public sector nor the private sector nor the consumer can demand the best of all worlds at all times in a country like South Africa. The State must realize&#x2014;and it does realize&#x2014; that there are certain things which it cannot and should not do. So, too, there are certain things which it alone can do and which, indeed, it ought to do. In any event, that which the State accomplishes holds immense advantages and potential for the private sector. The State must realize that often its highest and noblest vocation lies not in doing something for itself, but in helping other people to do it as quickly and effectively as possible. Every official, and this does not only hold for officials of State, but also for officials in the bureaucracy of the private sector itself, who withholds his dedication and enthusiasm from the work which he does&#x2014;and how easy it is to do so for years without its being perceived, because it is so easy to drift along without ever doing anything productive&#x2014;must know that he is destroying prosperity or that he is an insurmountable stumbling block in the way of the creation of greater prosperity in South Africa. Every consumer who does not play his part in the economy of a capitalist system and who wants to pass his responsibilities on to the Stace, for example to protect him against exploitation, while he has not fulfilled his own role in choosing his purchases; every consumer who spends more than he earns; and every consumer who wants to use his vote to obtain maximum material advantage from our democratic system for himself, is committing an unforgivable offence against himself, against the system, and what is more: against posterity, to whom he is going to deny the system, because there is no more certain manner of undermining the system of free enterprise than for the consumer to pass his responsibility on to the State. Lastly, the <span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0418"/>private sector must also know that ultimately it must itself be the chief guardian of the economic system and that it is not, as the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens has once again suggested, the responsibility of the State as well. The private sector is the guardian and it must ensure that it keeps the confidence of the consumer. If it is going to shake the consumer&#x2019;s confidence by exploitation, by recommended prices and malpractices of that kind, which are so difficult to combat, it will eventually make the greatest contribution itself towards destroying the system which has so far provided it with the opportunity of enriching itself and maintaining a high standard of living. No pressure exerted on the Government by the private sector can ultimately preserve the private sector if it does not make a contribution itself. The rise of societies based on the so-called comsumerism throughout the world and in South Africa, too, is certainly the most pointed warning to the private sector. I believe that everyone has his responsibility in terms of this system. We are partners and we must assist one another and not scratch out one another&#x2019;s eyes. The ultimate goal must be: What is in the interests of South Africa and the continued and growing prosperity of every one of its inhabitants&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a long time since we had such an enjoyable and lively political debate on a private member&#x2019;s motion in this House. I must admit that the hon. member for Newcastle introduced something here which completely upset the hon. member for Florida. I missed the person who used to speak so calmly and sedately here in the old days. Today it was &#x201C;more heat than light&#x201D;. I must honestly admit that, when I heard how the hon. member for Newcastle introduced the motion, I asked myself whether this was a case of Paul, too, among the prophets. I also wondered along which road to Damascus this Paul had walked, having now seen the light and become converted so that he could persuade the NP to introduce a motion here dealing with the system of private enterprise. I have said so previously in this House, and say it again today, and I shall continue to say that the NP is a socialist party to the core. They cannot deny that. Any person who has read the book by the hon. member for Waterberg in which he carries on about the individual in the national context, will know that one cannot deny that. The whole idea of the individual in the national context, which is explained in that book, indicates a socialist concept of nation. That party never gets away from that. However, they come and beat about the bush here and profess to be the champions of the private enterprise system. This does not impress us at all. Everyone is talking about Dr. Wassenaar. I do not know the man and neither does he know me. I would not recognize him in the street if I saw him. Therefore it is not necessary for me to come here and defend him. But no one in the NP can rob that man of what he has done for his people and his country. It is of no use to come here and gossip about the man. He is a great man among his own people and it is not necessary for me to defend him.</p>

<p>&#x2020;However much the NP may protest, and they protest vociferously, they are a party which stands for the big State, the big tax, the big operation by the State at the cost of the private individual. The hon. member for Florida was getting all upset and worked up about that. The one thing that people have got to understand from the very beginning is that the State has money to spend only at the expense of the private sector. The State does not make a profit, the State does not trade and the State has no assets. The State exists only by reason of the tax it takes out of the hands of the private people, and it can take tax out of the hands of private people only when they make a profit. One therefore cannot help agreeing with the hon. member for Newcastle when he says that this must be based, in a responsible manner, on the profit motive. One accepts that there must be a responsibility on the State to regulate malpractices and so on to a certain extent. However, the purpose of the State is not to deprive the private citizen of investment capital or to compete with the private citizen in investment. I see the hon. the Minister is laughing to himself there so happily. Perhaps he is getting some advice. I know he needs it.</p>

<p>I take as my theme that the private enterprise system makes the NP&#x2019;s policy of apartheid impossible. For that party to associate itself with the system that it has attempted to introduce in South Africa, and to pretend that it can continue to associate itself with a system that has patently failed, while maintaining that it is a private enterprise party, is pure fallacy and nothing else.

<p>Let us hear the reason.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>All right, listen to the reason. Private enterprise is something that is built up in the cities. It is built upon the individual and consequently upon the combined initiative of all the peoples of South Africa. In fact, the motion before this House states:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is best suited for promoting the economic development of the country and the welfare of all its inhabitants.</block>

<p>How does one recognize the welfare of all the inhabitants when the stated policy of the Government is that a majority of the people within the boundaries of the State are in actual fact not there&#x003F; They are non-peoples. They have no representation and they have absolutely nothing to say about what is going on in the country. They are people who have an existence, but they are there merely as ciphers and factors. Their real existence, however, what gives expression to their participation in the economy and makes them part of the private enterprise system, i.e. their political rights, are to be exercised somewhere else. Let us understand where they are going to be practised. They are going to be practised in the homelands. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us that he sees the homelands as being more bastions for the private enterprise system. What is more, I hope he will try to demonstrate that, because it is obviously a fallacy. Those areas are poor in capital and will have to depend on investment. What have they got to invest in&#x003F; The whole pattern in Africa and in the world tells us that there are two ways of developing an area. One can either invest capital, or if there is no capital to invest, one can invest the people. That requires State intervention, a State socialism, such as being carried out in country after country throughout the world. There is simply not enough capital in the world to develop those countries to a satisfactory degree or fast enough. I think the hon. the Minister owes us an explanation. The people in those areas are an integral part of everything that is going on. They are part of the private enterprise system. Our future and the system depend on those people. If we do not keep those people on our side, the system cannot possibly continue to operate and will collapse.</p>

<p>Take a country like Malawi which is poor in capital. The President of Malawi, Dr. Hastings Banda, has said to his people: &#x201C;You may have just so much and no more. You cannot expect more services of different types because you cannot pay for them.&#x201D; I wish to refer to one of the questions the hon. member for Florida posed. This is not the time for us to determine a threshold across which the State may not go in intruding upon the income of private people and of companies. We must determine our priorities because I am convinced in my own mind that we stand <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0420"/>today in imminent danger of so depressing business activity and the entire business community in South Africa through taxation, that we are destroying the incentive that is the absolute source of the free enterprise system. It is the kernel of the whole thing. The individual must be able to get out and do things for himself. This applies to Black as well as Brown people. In fact, it applies to everybody. One must avoid getting to the point where one depresses incentive. As an hon. member asked: &#x201C;Will you lend your new car to the Government for four months per year free&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>I do not think there is anybody here who does not know people who say: &#x201C;I could go to work three to four days a week, I could even go to work seven days a week if I wanted to, but I am not going to do it because the Government, through taxation, is taking away more than it is worth my earning.&#x201D; Everybody knows of people who work two, three or four days a week in an advisory or a consultative capacity and who for the rest of the time play golf and enjoy themselves simply because it is not worth their while to work more than that under the present system. Surely it is time for us to determine our priorities and to establish a threshold beyond which the State cannot go. We must understand that it is essential for us in this country to cut our cost according to our cloth. If we want more, that can only come from increased growth and increased investment, and where is that to come from&#x003F; Last year the hon. the Minister of Finance said that the only growth in the economy last year was that generated by the State.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I said that the State played a very big part in it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there was zero growth in the private sector last year. Anyway, I shall accept that the hon. the Minister said that the State played a very big part. The point I wish to make is that State growth is something that is fuelled only by what is taken out of the private sector.</p>

<p>An urgent debate must be started in this country as to whether the private sector, by retaining money in its own hands for investment, cannot generate growth and wealth in this country far more efficiently than the State can do it. It is to reach out to the Black community that makes this so important.</p>

<p>At present we have in Soweto a revolution being led by young Black militants who are socialists and communists. If this system of ours is going to survive, it can do so only by the encouragement and building-up of political movements among the Black population who are going to be committed to this system which we are all praising here today and which we believe in, but which, as far as I am concerned, is merely a sham and a hollow farce as far as they themselves are concerned. You have to create in the minds of the Black people a real attachment and a realization that this Black middle class of people have got something to protect, and not only to protect; they want to see into the corridors of the future; they want to see door after door opening for their children. They do not care so much for themselves; they want to see into the future and know which doors will open in the future for their children. Now, how is this going to be achieved&#x003F; One of the questions with regard to Soweto that worries me is the total negative leadership that has come from those people, the students, that claim to be directing the revolution. The one thing that we want to see now is a responsible body of people among those Black people who will stand up for the private enterprise system, the system in which we believe and on which every single thing is going to be based.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The whole basis of what we are doing is to try to build in this <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0421"/>country a society which is based on norms which we have imported, norms which we see in other countries and which we are only too happy and pleased to be able to bring here and attempt to implement for our people. But I say to the hon. the Minister and I say it to this Nationalist Government, the time has come now that one of the most important things that the Economic Advisory Council and the hon. the Prime Minister can do is to look at this question and see whether in fact the private enterprise system can survive when the State is continually expanding its horizons.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister cannot contest that. Every single year a budget is presented here and every single department wants more money for more projects, for more this and for more that. It is a totally false situation in which we live. I know of no guide-lines laid down and there is nothing that has come from the Government during all the years that they have been in power, as the hon. member for Florida mentioned; after all those years we are in danger of grindling to a halt because the State is taking away from the private individual the money he should be investing. There is no more powerful liberatory force in the world than a free man investing his own money in his own time, through his own effort, who lives his business life 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He can do that far better than any State corporation which invests the money taken out of the pockets of the tax-payer and utilizes it for some other purpose.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida spoke about State corporations. I have mentioned this matter before to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. The IDC has bought its way into flourishing companies in the private sector. Surely, the whole project should be reversed&#x003F; There should now be a spinning off into the private sector of so many things. The part of the State should be&#x2014;as an hon. member quite rightly said, and I agree with him 100%&#x2014;to take the initial steps to start off projects. The State has got resources which the private individual has not got. But when these undertakings are moving and going ahead and becoming a real factor in the life of our country, why is it necessary for the State to hold them, and not only to hold onto them, but to add to them and create conglomerates inside the whole State apparatus which would far better be directed by private individuals and spread amongst the people at large by means of a shareholding, which means participating in the economy as a whole&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I was interrupted by the clock in full flight, I was dealing with certain points which I would like the hon. the Minister to answer. If I may, I want to sum up a few points. The question of the Blacks&#x2019; position in the free enterprise society that we are talking about, is one of them. I made the point that the students in Soweto had produced no responsible leadership at all. Up to this day they have been negative, and militantly negative, and it is clearly incumbent now upon responsible Black opinion in Soweto and other places to come out in favour of a free enterprise society. It is the part of Black leadership to do that, and it is the part of White political leadership to create the sort of political system in which that responsible Black political leadership and type of private enterprise can be exercised and can be lived to the full. I have said already that the NP, as I see it, is not the party which can make that possible. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In relation to that this is, I believe, the importance of what happened here earlier today when the advent of Dr. Wassenaar to this political debate was mentioned. The second point is that taxation is the key to investment. In my opinion the NP is a party which is far too committed to State growth at the expense of the private society. Thirdly, I have said that the control of taxation&#x2014;and I want to make this point to the hon. the Minister, because they may continue to be in Government for the next 28 years, which the Lord forbid, but it may happen&#x2014;is going to be the key to any future political dispensation in South Africa, and every single businessman in this country who is thinking about it, must be looking at his future wondering what that, and the future of his company, will be. That is not only the relationship to the present Government, but also the relationship between Black and White, the relationship <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0422"/>between Black and White as far as political power in this country is concerned. I have said before that one cannot enrich the Black majority by punitive taxation of the White minority, and anybody who is thinking about politics in this country, about change in this country, about a new balance of power, about creating opportunities for Black political power, cannot get away from the point about who is going to control taxation of the private person and possibly also of the companies. I believe this is an absolutely basic fundamental.</p>

<p>The reason why this party is moving on the basis of the 14 principles to a new dispensation is precisely because this is one of the points that will have to be solved. Where is power going to reside in the hands of people who can tax&#x003F; Who is going to be able to tax the business community, the Indian business community, the White business community, the Coloured business community and the fledgling Black community which is emerging today in the urban areas&#x003F; I believe this is something which has to be answered. We have to speculate about it. We have to think about it. If we are going to think seriously about the future of politics in South Africa, that is one of the questions we have to answer. I make the point because we are all talking about abolishing discrimination and getting away from discrimination. However, we shall only get away from discrimination in one way. That is by eliminating the prejudice and the fear which engenders discrimination. That can be done only by growth in the Black community to the point where he can see they have enough, where we can &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I thought for one minute that the hon. member would understand, I would spend more time on him, but I do not want to waste my time. I am talking to the hon. the Minister and I want to say that the way to wipe out discrimination, to eliminate it, is only by means of the private enterprise system. That is why we have moved the amendment. Our amendment says that this Government has failed to implement it, to carry it out, to put it into practice here in South Africa. The Government is moving more and more into the situation where the Black man is coming more and more into the market place. He is becoming more and more a factor in power. He is more and more a part of the scene, and if the Government is going to preserve free enterprise it cannot preserve it for White South Africa only. The Government has to preserve it for all the peoples of this country. It is to be preserved for us and for everybody, or for nobody. That is the challenge which that hon. Minister faces in replying to this motion, and that is the reason why we have moved our amendment, which I support.</p>

<p>I think it would be tragic <span class="col_811-812" refersTo="page_0423"/>if this institution were in fact prejudiced as a result of the injudicious utterances and opinions of certain individuals associated with it.</p>

<p>After all, it remains a fact that Governments throughout the world, and our Government as well, are from time to time and remain the subject of the accusation that they are adopting a course of creeping socialism. Surely it remains a fact that Governments throughout the Western World are being accused of increasing interference in the economic lives of their respective countries. Then the following pertinent question arises: What is the motive for this accusation&#x003F; Is the motive personal&#x003F; Does this accusation from certain groups in the country not represent a method of breaking the National Party Government by a method other than on the political platform&#x003F; This question the hon. members must answer for themselves. However, I do want to make this accusation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Does it not represent the fact the the predominantly English-speaking capital does not want to accept a NP Government in South Africa&#x003F; [Interjections.] I gave the hon. member for Mooi River his chance, and he may as well keep quiet now. Let us analyse for a moment the criticism which came from their ranks, alleging that the Government was treading the path of socialism and was socializing the economic life to an increasing extent. Surely the hon. member knows&#x2014;indeed, he said so himself&#x2014;that I have stated the Government&#x2019;s standpoint in this specific regard repeatedly. I think it is important for us to know that the latest message has emanated from an eminent businessman&#x2014;and did so in English. One asks oneself for whose consumption this was written. One asks oneself whether such action testifies to the true economic patriotism out of which that institution was born. Is it not important that the official standpoint of the Government should be reaffirmed through this House to see whether it is possible to neutralize to some extent the harm done to South Africa during the past week&#x003F; I think that that is our task in this country.</p>

<p>The fundamental approach has always been that the economy may best be served by means of the profit motive as incorporated in the private sector and in the objectives of the private sector; with the proviso&#x2014;and I challenge any member on the opposite side to dispute this&#x2014;that it is in accordance with the national interests of our country. The PRP and specifically the hon. member for Yeoville are those who are constantly launching attacks on this Government outside this House because it does not take adequate steps to protect the consumer against the exploitation of capital. Can one do that without tampering with the policy&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Government sets a great store by the private enterprise system&#x2014;I want to reaffirm this&#x2014;as well as by the contribution it has made, is making and still has to make to the economic development and growth of our country. After all, this Government took steps, long before those members participated in the debate, not only to formulate a theoretical creed, but also to ensure that the accusations which hon. members were making of increasing interference in and increasing competition with the private sector, did not come true. Are the hon. members not aware that the Government, on the advice of the Economic Advisory Council, established a permanent committee in respect of State competition&#x003F; Are the hon. members not aware of what the terms of reference of the committee were&#x003F; Guiding principles were laid down as to how the committee should function and these included the fundamental standpoint to which I referred. <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0424"/>However, these principles went even further, and indicated the following: Firstly, that the objectives of the State undertaking are in the first instance situated therein that it should create the opportunities for the private sector to produce the greatest possible benefit for the community as a whole. Secondly, if a State undertaking were, upon its establishment, or subsequently, to enter into competition with the private sector, the fundamental objective of the competitive activities should be of national importance. When these undertakings find themselves competing with the private sector&#x2014;that is to say, competing unjustifiably&#x2014;these undertakings are expected to consider the desirability of gradually, and without disrupting repercussions, transferring their interests to the private sector. If these State corporations were to transfer these interests today, in the prevailing economic climate, would it lead to the formation of new capital or would it merely result in a reallocation of existing capital&#x003F; Thirdly, any State undertaking that wishes to enter a new field of activity which by definition is not directly related to its principal objectives, cannot commence such an activity before it has been referred to the committee.</p>

<p>I am emphasizing that the Government not only reaffirmed its standpoint, but that it also took direct steps to ensure that a philosophy was carried into effect, and under these circumstances such an accusation is untrue and unwarranted. This committee is definitely a commendable institution, and I think hon. members will confirm this. However, I do not know how the accusation of creeping socialism&#x2014;an accusation which implies that a specific tendency must have manifested itself in our economic life over a period of time&#x2014;can be reconciled with the fact that to date only seven complaints of minor importance have been brought to the attention of the committee.</p>

<p>I think it is important that when we discuss this subject, which is by its nature a topical one, but also a complicated one, our terminology should be the same. The words &#x201C;capitalism, socialism and public sector&#x201D; are used in a very loose context. I concede that it is difficult to give a concrete definition of &#x201C;capitalism&#x201D;, but I think that for the purposes of our debate one may use it to indicate an economic structure in which private ownership of property and production factors are not only allowed, but also encouraged, and in which the market mechanism is used for the mobilization, application or utilization of our resources. In a broad sense &#x201C;socialism&#x201D; would, for the purposes of our debate, mean the opposite, for the emphasis then falls on the national ownership of property and production factors, while the State plan, instead of the market mechanism, is responsible for the mobilization and utilization of the resources. For my purposes &#x201C;the public sector&#x201D; includes the State, the provinces, the local authorities, the public corporations, the S.A. Bantu Trust as well as the social security funds. If we wish to discuss the subject in a rational way, we must find quantitative criteria against which we can measure, and then we must not have any confusion over the verbal concepts.</p>

<p>In spite of the positive attitude of the Government on the promotion of the interests of the private sector, the accusation and the cries of socialism are increasing ominously, and &#x201C;creeping socialism&#x201D; sounds like an expression with a totally new intensity. What I find perturbing is not the fact&#x2014;so I believe&#x2014;that there is no justification for these complaints, but the lack of understanding among the critics in this specific regard and the lack of insight into the problems of the economic systems we are discussing. If we listen to the arguments put forward by hon. members, we find that they are arguing from the standpoint that a system of pure capitalism and free competition as the ideal exists on the one hand, with socialism on the other, and they argue as though there were no grey area in between. As theoretical standpoint it is probably acceptable, but I want to contend that they are making certain fundamental errors of reasoning in this specific regard.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is argued as though capitalism, by definition, implies free enterprise. Surely we know that this is not true, and the hon. member for Randburg knows that it is not true because he has had experience of this. Surely he knows that free competition means freedom of suppliers and of demanders. Surely there is nothing implicit in the principle of private ownership and the pursuit of own interest, the basis of capitalism, which guarantees competition. It is a fact that in the country which is the exemplar of capitalism, the United States of America, <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0425"/>one finds the strongest and most effective anti-trust legislation which I know of. Why&#x003F;</p>

<p>&#x2020;Because capitalism has often an ugly side to its face and sometimes it requires plastic surgery to rectify the position.</p>

<p>*Let us examine our own situation. Is it not a fact that we do not have full competition in South Africa&#x003F; Is it not also a fact that competition in various spheres is incomplete&#x003F; Is it not a fact that there is increasing insistence upon the protection of people in such a situation&#x003F; The hon. members argue, in the second place, as though any form of State interference places the country irrevocably on an opposite course, towards socialism. This argument is not correct, and finds its origin in a failure to grasp what private initiative means.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members, as well as the author quoted by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said this, if the hon. member does not know. But what is more: The hon. members make a third error, and so do the critics outside. This error is to compare the tendency for State intervention in one country with that in various other countries without any qualification.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between the State and the private sector&#x003F; I get the impression that the image which the hon. members opposite, for motives of their own, as well as people outside would like to convey is that these sectors represent opposing forces, while their role is in fact supplementary and complementary to one another. The relationship between the public sector and the private sector in South Africa has a variety of facets which, apparently, are not always recognized by those who criticize the actions of the authorities. They are partners in the process, and the State is also a client of the private sector.</p>

<p>The State allows itself to be led, in the achievement of its objectives, by social considerations, as it has to do in any modem community. I want to emphasize that the premises and the objectives of the public sector in comparison with private enterprise are frequently divergent, and if we do not take this into consideration, we shall have no understanding of the subject we are discussing. What is the objective of the State&#x003F; It is sustained, stable growth with security of work opportunities and constantly increasing incomes, for the Black people, to which the hon. member referred, as well. I want to repeat this, because he raised it during the debate. He repeated an old accusation and said that the NP, in the formulation of its policy, put the economy at the service of its political ideology. I now want to put a question to him. Can there be any question of development or growth if no stability exists in relationships between groups and peoples in South Africa&#x003F; It is no problem to me to put the economy at the service of that very regulation of these intense or explosive relationships, for if we do not succeed in doing so, there will be no question of an economy which develops or grows. The objectives of private enterprise lie, quite justifiably, in its motivation, i.e. its profit motives, and it pursues its own interests, frequently in our society at the expense of the general interest and at the expense of other socio-economic considerations. Any Government which fails in its duty in this specific regard will not be worthy of the name of an effective Government.</p>

<p>When does the State in South Africa interfere in and when does it participate in private economic life&#x003F; There are various reasons and considerations which apply in this specific regard. It does so when it is asked to do so, for frequently the private sector requests State intervention. It asks for this when an industry has to be protected by means of import control. It asks for this in terms of tariff protection against foreign competition. It asks for this when it asks for assistance in order to ensure geographically balanced economic development by means of border area policy. Is that an evil&#x003F; Secondly the Government is provoked into intervention when exploitation by unscrupulous businessmen takes place, who represent a small minority of a population which is not always able to appreciate the advantages of the free market economy. Why is it necessary to place legislation in regard to trade malpractices on our Statute Book, with the support of hon. members opposite&#x003F; Is it not to eliminate that ugly facet of capitalism and to save the system and to purify it&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the committee will be appointed. The question of the hon. member for Constantia is an important one. He is the person who complains about price maintenance in certain subsectors. Is that Act not intervention for the sake of the general interest&#x003F; Is he not the person who asks me here when the report of the inquiry into monopolistic conditions will be available&#x003F; Is it not because he knows that there are evils in our system and that we have to take steps to preserve the system by eliminating the evils&#x003F; However, the Government also takes action when compelled to do so by national or strategic considerations. I want to ask the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens whether the private sector would, for national considerations, store strategic oil supplies without profit&#x003F; Would the private sector, for which he is an apologist, provide the financing for Soekor&#x003F; Would the private sector be prepared, for the sake of the defence of our country, to build armaments factories&#x003F; [Interjections.] If they want to, why not&#x003F; Atlas is frequently referred to as an example, but was Sasol not offered to the private sector&#x003F;</p>

<p>They pay for it by way of taxation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The taxation is not the point. It was offered to the private sector. There is a fourth reason why the State ventures into the sphere of the private sector, and that is when the private sector does not have the ability or the initiative to establish an undertaking or to carry out certain activities which are essential for balanced development in the long term for South Africa. Almost every day hon. members on that side, for reasons other than economic considerations, talk about the establishment of public corporations. What contribution have they made to the creation of infrastructure in South Africa&#x003F; What contribution have they made to extending the basis of our industrial development into the hands of the private sector as well&#x003F; I want to say that when we discuss this subject, we need not spare one another in respect of our standpoints, but we must not find it so difficult either to consort with the truth.</p>

<p>I want to ask a final question, which is this: Is the State going too far with its intervention in the private sector&#x003F; How do we measure this&#x003F; Of course it is very easy to make statements and to quote authorities who are attacking the Government for other reasons, without adducing the substantive evidence which can be quantified. I think it is necessary for us to have qualitative criteria which we can apply. I concede at once that it is not so easy to find these. However, I concede that errors have been made in certain cases where our people had to be protected by means of the instrument of price control which, in my opinion, will not have the desired effect in the long run. I am on record as having said this. Errors have been made and profit margins have been determined on low rates, which discouraged investment. However, this does not mean that this instrument should not be used, once again to neutralize the ugly manifestations of capitalism. But I want to tell the hon. member for Mooi River that, if we argue about this matter rationally, we can test it against four quantities. Let us consider what the result is. We must also bear in mind that, if the accusation is true, a specific tendency has to be revealed over a period of time. Let us take four quantities. Let us take the contribution of the public sector to the gross domestic product over a period of 15 years as the first quantity. Let us take the share of the public sector in the fixed capital supply of the country over a specific period as the second quantity, and the course of the provision of work or of employment by the authorities of the economically active population as the third quantity. Then we take the spending, or the percentage of the State&#x2019;s share in public consumer spending, as the fourth quantity. When we measure this, we also measure it against the responsibility which the State has in this specific regard. Now, what are the facts&#x003F; If one were to take these quantities as a criterion, three erroneous courses or errors of reasoning are revealed. The first error is that the South African economy is more socialized than the economies of the other Western countries. This is not true. The facts indicate the opposite. In 1960 the contribution of the State to the gross <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0427"/>domestic product was 23%. In 1975 the contribution of the State was still 23%. Is this an upward tendency&#x003F; Does this indicate an increasing intervention in or participation in the activities, economically speaking&#x003F; The second aspect is that Government expenditure has liaison advantages in certain directions for the development in the private sector. It is very interesting to consider the factor of employment, in regard to which accusations are being levelled at us almost every day. Let us consider the percentage of economically active people employed in the public sector, as I have just defined it&#x2014;this means not only the central Government but also includes all other authorities. Let us take 1960 as a base year. In that year 17% of the economically active people were employed in the public sector. In 1975 14% were employed in the public sector, and then those people are accused of inefficiency. I think we owe it to one another &#x2026; [Interjections.] These are not the wrong figures.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They are the figures for the entire population. I shall give the hon. member the figures for the Whites. The figures for the Whites have also dropped, and I shall furnish the figures again. As far as employment is concerned, I repeat that in 1960 17% of the total economically active people were employed in the public sector. In 1975 it was 14%. In 1960 31% of the economically active White population was employed in the public sector. In 1975, 28% was employed in the public sector. Now I ask the hon. member again: Is there an upward curve of participation, measured against the quantities I have mentioned&#x003F;</p>

<p>Thirdly we frequently hear the argument that as a result of the efficiency of private sector undertakings, we should hand over the S.A. Railways and Harbours and the Post Office in particular to the private sector. It is of course true, and I readily concede, that the profit motive could lead to the production of services at lower costs; that is a truth, but the other side of the coin is also true. If the provision of basic infrastructure had to be left to the private sector, with its motivation&#x2014; with which we all wish to agree&#x2014;it would surely lead inevitably to their producing those products which are able to bear the economic costs, and leave the others in abeyance. All one need to do is look at the development of the transportation system in America, which has to rely primarily on motor vehicles [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, by way of summary I should like, in the first place, to thank the hon. the Minister sincerely for the clear elucidation of Government policy on this very important matter. I think he did so with inspiration, and made a major contribution today in this debate. I think that a few matters emerged in this debate which are perhaps important. I think the first important matter here is that we should accept that capitalism in its absolute form simply does not exist. The second question which flows from this and which I deduced today, is that the capitalistic system will have to undergo certain adjustments if we wish to win the battle against socialism. We cannot win if capitalism cannot rid itself of its so-called &#x201C;ugly face&#x201D;. We must also accept that the private sector in South Africa has an adequate say, up to the highest level of Government, in respect of their interests. What also emerged clearly from this debate was that the Government believes in the right of free enterprise. We accept that there are grounds for improvement. This was made very clear here today. It is also the task of the Permanent Advisory Committee to consider the bottlenecks which still exist.</p>

<p>I am also particularly grateful for the participation of the hon. the Prime Minister in the debate. He succeeded in giving us a new perspective in respect of this matter. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s contribution was the most important aspect of this debate, because we then saw the matter against the correct background, and that is important.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House recognizes the need for a Bill of Rights to be entrenched in the South African Constitution guaranteeing the protection of the basic rights of individuals and minorities.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe one could reasonably have anticipated that a debate on the subject of private enterprise might be a very tranquil one, but one would have been wrong. On the other hand one could anticipate that a debate on a Bill of Rights might be anything but tranquil, although one hopes that this debate will be conducted in a tranquil atmosphere. The two, of course, have some relevance because after having listened to the hon. the Prime Minister this morning I thought to myself that perhaps there should be a provision in the Bill of Rights to protect the businessman who wishes to express his views and who wishes to pursue his lawful occupation. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>If we come to the motion that I have moved and can fairly say that the issue of a Bill of Rights is necessary and desirable, one immediately realizes that this is a matter which has been debated in South Africa for decades and by political scientists and by politicians for much longer all over the world. South Africa presents perhaps the classic situation calling for the constitutional protection of human rights. It is a country in which there are people of different colour, race, nationality, religion and language. Even the majority groups in South Africa have built-in minorities, and political power is exercised in South Africa by a power group within a minority over other minorities and even over a majority.</p>

<p>I cannot accuse the hon. the Prime Minister of saying something which is not true, but he should know that the statement he is now making is completely wrong. He should know that. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, if ever there has been a classic case in the history of the world for the protection of individual and group rights, that is South Africa.</p>

<p>The premises which I will advance during this debate can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the rational human being has, in fact, certain basic rights. I hope that will not be disputed. I think that even the hon. the Prime Minister accepts that. Secondly, such basic rights are capable both of definition and of listing. In other words, we know what these rights are and we are able to set them out. Thirdly, such rights have historically been repeatedly infringed. I do not speak about South Africa here, but about the world in general. There is no question that history does show a continuous infringement of human rights. Fourthly, that the mechanism to protect individual rights against the State and other groups and individuals can be evolved, and, I believe, should be evolved. Fifthly, we believe, and I specifically put forward this premise during this debate, that a Bill of Rights is the most satisfactory of such mechanism for the protection of these rights.</p>

<p>In the sixth place I believe that a Bill of <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0429"/>Rights will only provide adequate protection if recourse is available to a strong and independent judiciary. And then it needs to be said, in the seventh place, that both the Bill of Rights and the courts must be protected constitutionally so that they may not be amended, as far as the Bill of Rights is concerned, or impugned, in so far as the courts are concerned, by the executive or by simple legislative majorities which may be available from time to time. The eighth point I want to make during this address is that the validity of entrenched clauses in a constitution has in fact been accepted by South Africa&#x2019;s highest courts, and therefore it is possible to provide for this entrenchment in our law. The last premise, the ninth one, is that such entrenchment of a Bill of Rights is also possible under a federal constitution which offers further political protection to minorities, as well as to individuals.</p>

<p>If we now come to the concept of the rational human being and his basic rights, we find that this concept is found deeply embedded in Western history. These rights are sometimes called natural rights or moral rights which are the rights of all people in all situations. The Greeks, for example, accepted it. There is the very famous passage where Antigone says to King Creon, when asked why she has buried the corpse of her brother who was an alleged traitor against the King&#x2019;s ruling&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nor did I deem that thou a mortal man, could&#x2019;st by a breath annul and override the immutable, unwritten laws of heaven. They were not born today, nor yesterday. They die not, and none knoweth whence they sprang.</block>

<p>There was no Bill of Rights in the days of King Creon. King Creon contended, as was said many centuries later, in the famous Sir John Hampshire case, by Mr. Justice Berkeley, that lex was not rex, but rex is lex&#x2014;that, in fact, the king is the law. He said then, as so many tyrants had said before&#x2014;we have heard it so often, even in this House&#x2014;that, above all, anarchy must be prevented. That is sometimes used as the excuse by rulers for all sorts of action even if there is no anarchy.</p>

<p>If we look at this situation, the classical situation that Sophocles set out, how little has the politics of government changed through the ages&#x003F; The clashes between the authoritarian concept of the complete subjugation of the governed to the will of the governor, as advanced by Hobbes and Locke&#x2019;s theory, that the governed convey rights to the governor to exercise collective functions for the common good, but with the individual retaining his basic rights&#x2014;these clashes have continued throughout the ages. Great Britain is an example of a country that has had a long history of this struggle. The highlights were King John&#x2019;s Magna Carta, the Commonwealth of Cromwell and the British Bill of Rights which was subsequently passed. Other countries have similar rights, but one matter becomes apparent throughout. If once it is accepted that the rational being has basic rights, no amount of philosophy, no amount of writing and no amount of contention can protect such rights against a ruler who has the power to encroach upon them. What is needed is a mechanism which protects the individual against the ruler. A social contract between Locke&#x2019;s citizen and Machiavelli&#x2019;s prince is only of value if it can be enforced against the prince.</p>

<p>In a homogeneous State democratic government can be such a protection, as the citizen can remove the ruler by peaceful means. However, those who enjoy power often do not relish losing it&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Justice must listen&#x2014;and so, if elected by democratic means, they use their period of office to entrench themselves and juggle with the democratic machinery. Some African States are classic examples of this and, in the result, the only means of changing a Government is the <i>coup d&#x2019;etat.</i> This perhaps explains why the large number of coups since Africa&#x2019;s liberation from colonialism have taken place. In those countries there is no other way of changing the Government. There is no democratic machinery available to change the Government.</p>

<p>In a State which is not homogeneous, which has different races, people of different colours, religions, languages, or which covers a vast geographic area, ordinary democratic process, while desirable, is not by itself enough. One group will be larger than others, minorities will exist and, to this end, other protection is required.</p>

<p>One solution which is often advanced is federalism, as has, in fact, been shown in the <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0430"/>USA, Canada, West Germany and Switzerland, among others.</p>

<p>However, standing with this has been the concept of the Bill of Rights. The idea being that a law must exist which cannot be altered at the whim of the majority, which can be enforced against the rulers, and which gives the individual and the minority group a feeling of security and impresses on the Government and the majority that there are basic rights which cannot be ignored. Enforcement against the majority, against the ruler, is a major problem. This can be solved by a rigid constitution which entrenches a Bill of Rights, so that it cannot be altered or repealed by a simple parliamentary majority and a strong independent judiciary, which is necessary and which is similarly protected and whose function it is to enforce the Bill of Rights at the suit of the aggrieved individual or the aggrieved minority. There are many forms of entrenchment. The United States requires a two-thirds majority of Congress and a three-quarters majority of the individual States in order to alter their constitution. Switzerland requires a referendum with a double majority, i.e. of population and of cantons. Other countries use a second House constituted differently from the first House as a guarantee for minorities. We ourselves have in our constitution an entrenched provision, the validity of which was upheld by our Appeal Court in the famous Harris case. In the USA, Switzerland and Germany, judicial tribunals exist to act as the protectors of the minority and of the individual. The mechanism can thus be created and enforcement is possible.</p>

<p>Then the question must be asked: Why then is there objection to a Bill of Rights&#x003F; Firstly, one has the view of those who with a Bentham will say: &#x201C;Natural rights are simple nonsense&#x201D;, or who with a Burke will claim that human equality is, to use his words &#x201C;a monstrous fiction&#x201D;. With these one does not wish even to argue. Those who believe in the inequality of man and the absolute power of the sovereign to act at will at all times, cannot be persuaded by sweet reason as they normally have other motives. Yet it is one of their natural rights, the right of that &#x201C;monstrous fiction&#x201D;, that they are entitled to hold such views. Those who accept the existence of the rights, but argue against a Bill of Rights, are in a different camp, and even here one will have to examine their motives. Those in our Parliament who oppose a Bill of Rights, might examine the company they keep in such opposition. I hope that the hon. members will bear in mind the other types of persons who oppose Bills of Rights. Karl Marx opposed the concept of a Bill of Rights, as did other Marxist philosophers. Marx regarded the notion of the rights of man as &#x201C;a bourgeois illusion&#x201D;. I take it that the hon. member who makes so much noise has the same view. Karl Marx opposed individualism. He contended that man was a species being who would come into his own only when he ceased to think of himself in bourgeois terms as an individual with inalienable rights. That is why we oppose these concepts, because we believe in the inalienable rights of the individual. Despite this and despite Karl Marx, it is interesting that the Soviet constitution speaks of rights of the citizen&#x2014;it is only lip-service&#x2014;and contrary to what I have said about the need to have enforcement mechanism, fails to make any provision in this regard. The truth is that not all rulers can be trusted to allow basic human rights. The truth is that not all majorities can be trusted not to oppress minorities. Any minority, therefore, and any human being who values his basic rights, and any numerical majority which is governed by a minority group, must concern itself, not only with a definition of human rights, but also with the creation of lasting mechanisms in order to protect them. That minority group and that human being look towards a Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>I would now like specifically to pose the question: Why does South Africa need a Bill of Rights&#x003F; As I have said, I believe that South Africa is a classical example. In this concept we need to have a meaningful debate on what the definition of human rights are in South Africa. Even at this late stage in South Africa&#x2019;s history, we are still unable to agree in this House as to what is meant by discrimination. I believe that what South Africa needs is a debate on the rights of the rational being in this society. What is the rational being entitled to in the form of human rights in the society in South Africa&#x003F; Are the principles of the English Bill of Rights of 1688 applicable here&#x003F; Is the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789&#x2014;it was at the time of the French Revolution and it is still part of the French constitution as enacted <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0431"/>in 1958&#x2014;irrelevant in principle here&#x003F; Do we have the same philosophy here as was introduced by the ten amendments in the American constitution in 1791 and by the civil war amendments&#x003F; What is the real philosophy of this Government in respect of human rights&#x003F; I wish to pose the question as to whether we can come to terms with Africa if we do not by some unequivocal overt act&#x2014;not merely by words, but by an overt act&#x2014;make it clear that race will not be a factor on which any basic rights are denied to any individual in South Africa. If we claim to give the individual his natural human rights, how can we continue to restrict him in his personal relationship as we do in statutes that are on our Statute Book&#x003F; Other hon. members have already spoken this session about the race provisions of the Immorality Act and the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. In South Africa one is not entitled to go to a school with people of your own choice, even if you pay for it and do not rely on the State for money for schooling. These rights are being infringed upon in South Africa, rights which one should expect to be allowed to exist in any society. Let us take a look at a man&#x2019;s work ambition. Can we in South Africa say that there is no need for a Bill of Rights when we limit the rights of the rational being under the provisions of the Mines and Works Act, under industrial agreements with closed shop provisions which exclude Blacks from certain work, under apprenticeship and work reservation provisions of our law, under the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act, which restricts work opportunities and if under proclamations under the Group Areas Act the right of individuals to exercise supervisory jobs is in fact taken away from them&#x003F; These are some of the examples, and the question that needs to be asked, is whether a minority group with political power may use that power to bestow privilege on itself and deprive other people of the basic rights. I want to quote Mirabeau when he was in prison shortly before the French Revolution. He was a nobleman and not a man who was of the underprivileged. He spoke of the rights being of such a nature that it is impossible for humankind in any climate to preserve its dignity, secure its developments or to enjoy in tranquillity the blessings of nature.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, in South West Africa where the Whites are now under pressure, there is talk of a Bill of Rights and of protecting the basics. Must the White man in South Africa only call for a Bill of Rights when his position is in danger&#x003F; Must he not establish it as an act of faith and as a moral concept when he is in power, as he is in power now in this very place, so that when perhaps he no longer exercises complete undisputed political control, he in those circumstances may have protection for himself on those basic human rights. We in South Africa need a Bill of Rights not merely to do justice; we need it as a safeguard for our own future. South Africa has a precedent for a Bill of Rights in our own constitution. In the former Act of Union, we had both certain franchise rights and language rights entrenched and required a particular majority before it could be altered. The courts in fact supported it. Why then while we have an entrenchment today and a Bill of Rights in respect of one right, the language right, can we not have other human rights entrenched as well&#x003F; The challenge which must go out to the Government is whether they will not entrench in our constitution, in addition to the language rights, those basic human rights any rational being is entitled to exercise. A Bill of Rights is not a weakening of Government power. In times of emergency a Government can still act, and here I think the authority in the somewhat famous case of <i>Korematsie</i> v. <i>The United States</i> is clear on the point. Mr. Justice Black, delivering the majority judgment, made it very clear that in modem conditions of warfare, insurgency and disorder, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threat and danger. Power to deal with danger must not be confused with the lust for power <i>per se.</i> Machiavelli&#x2019;s prince was to be all powerful but Voltaire&#x2019;s prince was to be all powerful to do good but with his hands tied in regard to his ability to do evil. The difficulty as also in the debate that preceded this, was that lip service is not enough. To give an example, section 125 of the Soviet Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, assembly and demonstration. However, these pious provisions are meaningless to the oppressed intellectual and the suppressed liberal because there is no remedy available to him when that is taken away from him. That is why I argue that no Bill of Rights alone, without the machinery available <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0432"/>to the individual to enforce his rights, is adequate.</p>

<p>Revolutions, as history has shown, have often been followed by declarations of rights. We have the example of the American revolution where a declaration of rights came after the revolution. We also have the example of the French revolution where, immediately after the revolution started, a declaration of rights came about. We have the example in England, with the revolt in the Cromwell era and the English Bill of Rights which followed thereafter. What happens is that the revolution takes place, it is successful, and as a result of that a Bill of Rights comes into existence. We have a danger of unrest and of revolution before us. There is a danger of a minority, wielding political power, being deprived of it. Is it not the answer to give our people a Bill of Rights before these events become even more threatening&#x003F; I would commend to our Government that, instead of allowing history to develop in a way where it may perhaps repeat itself, it takes the lead and, in these circumstances, have the Bill of Rights before there is any real danger of revolution and that it sets the example, not because we are forced to have it, but because we want to have it. I commend for consideration the precedent of other States, of minorities without political power and the consequences that might flow from uprisings. If the Whites do not institute a Bill of Rights while they have the political power, will they be able to ask it from others when perhaps, one day, they might lose that political power&#x003F; That, to my mind, is the important question and an answer should be given to it during this debate.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to briefly list what I believe should be in a Bill of Rights. There should be protection against discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language and political views and religion. There should be guaranteed the right to life, to liberty, to security of person and enjoyment of property. There should be the protection against servitude, forced labour laws and similar institutions, of the right to nationality and citizenship, the right to freedom of information, freedom of association, the right to work, the opportunity to choose one&#x2019;s employer and the right to property, the right to family life, the right to enjoy culture and the right to equality before the law. I believe these are matters which every rational being is entitled to and no one should seek to deprive any rational being of this in the society in which we live.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member were seriously to believe everything he said today, particularly everything he insinuated today, then one can only come to the conclusion that this hon. member really does not know what is going on in South Africa or that he does not want to give credit where credit is due. In my speech I shall try to indicate that we need not pay attention to his appeal for a Bill of Rights in South Africa because everything he has asked for is in fact already incorporated in the South African legal system. However, before I start, the hon. member must excuse me if I say to him that I know him and that I know the undertone in his speeches and the speeches of people like him. There is always an undertone of fear to be detected in them. He must excuse me if I say to him that while he spoke, I could not help being reminded of what Robert Bums said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wee, sleekit, cow&#x2019;rin, tim&#x2019;rous beastie, O, what a panic&#x2019;s in thy breastie!</block>

<p>I do not believe that a meaningful discussion could really take place between the PRP and the NP in this House. I do not believe that we are really within hailing distance of each other, but for the sake of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion I shall nevertheless try to speak to him this afternoon. The Bill of Rights which his motion is about, advocates an entrenchment of the basic rights of individuals and minorities. However, he failed to indicate what he understood by the basic rights of individuals. He failed to indicate whether he acknowledged thereby the existence of a Communist Party, the right to murder, commit arson, rape and immorality. Apart from those rights, there are not many others for which he could in fact make propaganda. The idea of a Bill of Rights originated with the Bill of Rights of William and Mary of Orange in 1689 and constitutes a very minor subdivision of the British constitutional law. It came more than 400 years after the Magna Carta, and was followed, as the hon. member indicated, by the Act of Settlement and so on. This indicates that the British Constitutional Law went through a very long and difficult <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0433"/>process of development before reaching its final form in about the last century. As the hon. member rightly indicated, this was a very long and difficult process in England as well. It was easier in America. After the American Constitution came into being, they adopted their first ten amendments in 1791, in which the English basic rights, as we might call them, were in fact taken over unchanged. The first ten amendments also contained a definite specification of certain individual freedoms which the State might not interfere with. We in South Africa have also had, relatively speaking, a long history of constitutional development. We have had development from a Dutch DEIC refreshment post here to the point of free burgherhood, then the British occupation and subsequently the Batavian Republic, and then again a British occupation, until the Great Trek occurred, which once again concerned the freedom <i>inter alia,</i> of individuals, and then the development in Natal, Transvaal and the Free State, and eventually we had two wars of liberation in South Africa. I want to say that in the whole process of constitutional development, individual and national freedom figured strongly, more strongly than was the case in the British constitutional development. In South Africa the idea of freedom predominated. With the establishment of the Union of South Africa, later the Republic of South Africa, all these principles were ultimately combined in our constitution and other laws and were made part of the whole system of government.</p>

<p>I now want to raise two points. The first is that as regards international and constitutional law, South Africa is unassailably based on Western standards and norms, and that the constitution of the Union was in fact an act of the Mother of Parliaments, the British Parliament. From the time that the constitution of the Union came into being and was adopted in the British Parliament up to the present, nothing unconstitutional has been done by the governments of South Africa, absolutely nothing! What do we have in South Africa today&#x003F; We have the full heritage of the British, the American, the French and our own constitutional development which we have written into our own system. We have the end-product of centuries of legal development in Europe and Britain as regards constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, law of procedure and so on. Who introduced this to South Africa&#x003F; Who has done most to give effect to the idea of freedom and basic rights in South Africa&#x003F; It has been the Nationalist Afrikaners who have done so. The people who stand here today and advocate human rights are the spiritual heirs of those who originally refused these basic rights of Whites and non-Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to say straight out to the hon. member that a Bill of Rights in South Africa is unnecessary. There are two reasons why it is unnecessary. In the first place, all the basic rights of the individual are contained in South Africa&#x2019;s constitution, its statute law, its common law and in certain conventions. The second important reason is that experience has taught us that such a Bill of Rights is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>That is not my philosophy. I say it is the lesson of Africa.</p>

<p>*When these Bills of Rights are written, they usually contain a lot of vague generalities, like the blue book of the hon. member for Sea Point. They are so widely stated that one could drive a coach and six through them. If there is one thing we must avoid, then it is the blue book of the PRP and the 14 principles of ex-Judge Kowie Marais.</p>

<p>What are the rights, the individual freedoms, which the NP believes must be upheld in South Africa&#x003F; Like any other party, the NP believes in the basic rights of the individual and the freedom of the individual. But nor <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0434"/>does the NP, as a dedicated and responsible party, hesitate to say that individual freedom in fact also includes licentiousness&#x2014;political and otherwise. Freedom must be controlled and regulated for the sake of sound and meaningful development, for the sake of freedom, order and peace in the State. Everyone in South Africa enjoys freedom of worship. In South Africa there is freedom of the Press, there is freedom of trade and everyone is equal before our courts.</p>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Everyone in South Africa has the right to belong to a political party. There is only one party which is not allowed in South Africa and that is the Communist Party, and the reason why that party is not allowed is the fact that it does not in fact respect basic freedoms. There is freedom of language, religion, worship and culture. Everyone has the right to vote in his own group. The NP goes further and states that every group must be free to govern itself and it assists in this regard and builds on this foundation in accordance with recommendations dating from as far back as the Sauer Commission of 1947. Unfortunately I do not have the time to dwell on this at greater length.</p>

<p>What does the hon. member who introduced this motion, have in mind&#x003F; Unfortunately I have to go very fast now. The hon. member and those on behalf of whom he speaks, constitute a small vociferous faction in South African politics, a faction with no hope of ever getting into power in this country, either on the United Party or the Nationalist Party side. That is why they now have to make overtures in the hope of achieving a negotiating position in South Africa in an extra-parliamentary way by other means. [Interjections.] In addition they have once again capitulated to Black Power and at the moment they are prostrating themselves before Black Power. In fact they are adopting one of the most evil and dirty methods possible of isolating the Afrikaner from the other people in South Africa so that they can point to him as the scapegoat and so that, when what they are afraid of happens, they can also &#x201C;Biafranize&#x201D; the Afrikaner, and say, like that woman in Soweto: &#x201C;I am English,&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I am a Prog.&#x201D; I want to warn them and their people at the University of Cape Town to leave the Afrikaner alone. Basically, the Afrikaner and the English-speaking person in South Africa differ very little in their political views.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by quoting to the hon. member the words of an English-speaking professor from an English-language university. Unfortunately I do not have sufficient time to read enough of what Prof. De Crespigny said. I should just like to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Not surprisingly, Black leaders would never finally settle for less than complete control over such a society and Black control is hardly consonant with the protection of basic White interests, whatever constitutional safeguards there might be,&#x201D; said Prof. Anthony de Crespigny, head of the Department of Political Science at the University of Cape Town.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is much that is unjust in our current arrangements, but whatever the world may declare to the contrary, the policy of separate States for Africans is not inherently unjust &#x2026; However, this is a vastly better path to travel than the substitution of one form of misgovernment by another, the eccentric replacement of White by Black tyranny.</block>

Is that the correct point that he made&#x003F; I would ask him to tell me in what South African legislation is to be found the freedom of movement of the Black people of South Africa.

<p>I would say that there is in fact legislation quite to the contrary. When he makes that statement, I would ask him in what South African legislation will he find the freedom to buy and own land in the area in which he wishes to buy or own land. It will be found that there is legislation to the contrary. The freedom to live with one&#x2019;s family, near one&#x2019;s work, in one&#x2019;s own home on the land owned by one, is a freedom which is to be found totally legislated against. I would therefore say that that particular opening statement was unfortunate one. Not only was it unfortunate, it was palpably untrue.</p>

<p>Secondly, he said that everything in South Africa that has been done over the years has been done constitutionally&#x2014;like, for instance, the High Court of Parliament in the mid-1950s! That was the constitutional way in which the National Party Government tried to solve a problem which they had at that time.

<p>May I ask the hon. member whether the British Constitution does not allow for the &#x201C;packing&#x201D; of their House of Lords. It is in their legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not an expert on English law, but I believe that the British Constitution, which is, as I understand it, an unwritten constitution, can in fact be changed by majority measure. However, in that society which has developed in the traditions of democracy over hundreds of years, no single Government, not even the most rabid Labour Government, has attempted to change the constitution to the disadvantage of people who are not represented in the House at a particular time. I believe that those sorts of moves over the years by the NP Government give more and more weight to the argument that there should in fact be a Bill of Rights in South Africa, and that it should be linked to a constitution which cannot be tampered with.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would say that one basic question motivates nearly all the political parties in their racial philosophies and in their attitudes towards their policies, and that particular motivation is the question in a country such as ours, which is a unique country, of whether it is feasible to achieve a sense of common interest, where a majority of Blacks, Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;non-Whites all of them&#x2014;live together with a White population numbering some 20% of the whole, when the differences in the cultures, in the levels of attainment are vast&#x003F; Is it feasible to try to work towards a joint goal, to provide the foundations of a peaceful society of all the people living together&#x003F; That, Mr. Speaker, I admit to hon. members here, is an incredibly difficult question to answer. It is a question which is made even more difficult by foreign interference, by militant confrontationists here at home. The legitimate fears, and the not so legitimate prejudices of the Whites are, I believe, a retarding factor in this possible feasibility being translated into fact.</p>

<p>The strongest binding factor is the single economy which feeds and supports the people of the whole spectrum of South Africa. However, although economic considerations are vital, these are not paramount. I think now of one specific comment made in the Tomlinson Report, years ago. I refer to chapter 25, where it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0436"/>It should be pointed out that where the continued existence of a people is at stake, purely rational considerations &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is economic considerations and reasoned considerations.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; play a relatively unimportant role.</block>

<p>That is what Mr. Tomlinson says. So, it seems, Mr. Speaker, looking at all the facets and taking them into account, that partition in South Africa might possibly provide the shortest road to long-term peace. But this postulates&#x2014;taking into account, not so much the historical factors with which we have to do, but rather the factors relating to the numbers of South Africa&#x2014;a negotiated partition.</p>

<p>This postulates a fair and realistic division of the land resources. Such a partition with our complex economy, with the land demands which will be made in South Africa, would encounter, in my view, insurmountable obstacles. I have thought about it, as have many members over the years, very carefully, and I must admit that in our circumstances and in the long-term I can see in fact only one possibility as an alternative to a failing apartheid policy. [Interjections.] There is only one alternative which has the chance of ensuring our survival at this bottom-end of Africa. What is that one alternative I see&#x003F; I believe that it is a negotiated form of democracy, though it may be a federal one, a regional one, in its devolution of power, but it is a negotiated form of democracy which is not based on race. That is my sincere conviction. This conviction is bolstered by the knowledge that within 25 years we are going to have, living in South Africa, some 50 million people. Less than 7 million of those 50 million will be White people. In that even more modem world, that smaller and more hostile world, there is no way that we Whites can retain the privileges and the powers that the people around us here today enjoy. There is no way in which it can happen. In saying this I know&#x2014;I and my colleagues fully realize&#x2014;that as we stand here today no alternative to separate development is at this time possibly acceptable to a plurality of White people. Most particularly it is not acceptable in South Africa unless our fears, the fears of the Whites, relating to their identity, to the question of their survival, are allayed. They want to know what guarantee there is that the Blacks, on achieving a measure of power, will not use that power, for their own ends, to eclipse the Whites as a cohesive people. That is the fear. That is the problem. In an &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; society this fear is very justified, but in a society moving towards a real democracy the answer might, in fact, be a different one. When coming face to face with the stark reality of the present situation that we have here, what are the choices before all of us today&#x003F; They are to negotiate and to bring about, as soon as possible in the whole of South Africa, a form of democracy encompassing all colour groups. Or, if we refuse to do that, the other alternative is this: To plan now for an era of siege and hostility which will lead to eventual confrontation. It will be a confrontation in which we will stand alone. We will stand alone against 80% of our own population and against 100% of the rest of the world. The vision of that eventuality is, in my view, unthinkable.</p>

<p>What has it got to do with a Bill of Rights&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, perhaps I am approaching the matter in a somewhat slow way, but the point is to be made. We will inevitably need a new constitution, and just as inevitably that new constitution will come. However, in a non-homogeneous, racially divided country I agree with an eminent American jurist who said in 1942 in a case in Virginia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One&#x2019;s right to life, liberty, free speech, a free Press, freedom of worship and assembly and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to the vote. They depend on the outcome of no elections.</block>

<p>If it is known that regardless of numbers power over individuals and communities is limited, I believe that some of the tensions which prevail in our society will be dissipated. Now, having got this far, having rejected partition, and refusing to walk the road which leads to confrontation, while yet harbouring the fears which White people do have, there is only one avenue of approach, and that is to agree to set up a non-racial <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0437"/>democracy in this country. In doing so one must consider a rigid constitution, incorporating a comprehensive Bill of Rights to be interpreted, finally, by the High Courts of the country. There is no other way. The Bill of Rights must be comprehensive, including all and more of the subjects which have already been quoted as examples in this debate today, subjects relating to the social, economic, religious and political freedom of the individual and of the majority communities. Ample examples of this are to be found in the on-going constitutions of the Free World and are available to us. However, the Bill of Rights&#x2014;and this point has been made by my hon. friend who sat down a little while ago&#x2014;is of little value in a constitution which is easy to amend. Lack of confidence in Bills of Rights in South Africa undoubtedly amongst the people in the Government benches probably stems from the fact that the South African Constitution has not withstood the onslaught of legislative genius over the years. Nonetheless, I believe that it is both possible and feasible to frame a widely embracing constitution which is sufficiently strong to protect the provisions of such a Bill. Another essential point that must not be overlooked is that the judiciary must have the power to interpret the Constitution and to negative or remedy legislation or actions which are contrary to the provisions of the Bill of Rights or contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.</p>

<p>There are several working examples of this in the world. I believe Canada is not one of the least. I concede immediately that such a concept, i.e. the interpreting of the Constitution and a Bill of Rights by the judiciary, marks a departure from the principle that the supreme legislature is sovereign, and could, I also concede, bring judges into the political arena from time to time. This is a consideration which has not been overlooked.</p>

<p>No. I only have one minute left in which to complete my argument. Therefore, the continued independence of the Bench is absolutely vital to this concept.

In those circumstances only force of arms will decide the issues, but force of arms in South Africa could, I honestly believe within our lifetime and within the lifetime of members in this House, decide the issues very much to the detriment of everybody sitting around here today. That is why there is only one acceptable route to follow and that is one of negotiated change at a negotiated rate of change, a decentralized South Africa, a new and rigid non-racial constitution, a Bill of Rights entrenched therein, interpreted by an independent judiciary. I believe that the alternative to that is the road to oblivion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a Bill of Rights concerns human rights and the protection of human rights. A Bill of Rights is a method of protecting human rights in a country. The cardinal question, however, is this: Under the circumstances prevailing in South Africa, is a Bill of Rights an adequate method of protecting human rights&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton spoke about the political situation at a different stage, and I think that this is the crux of the matter. Both the PRP and the UP are advocating a policy which will in one way or another, give rise to a federal concept in South Africa&#x2014;&#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;&#x2014;a concept which they know&#x2014;and which they think the voters suspect&#x2014;will lead to a Black government in South Africa. Why is the image of the Bill of Rights suddenly being built up now&#x003F; Because those hon. members know that before they can put their policy into operation, before they can have the power in their hands and before they can begin the process which will lead to Black domination in South Africa, the White man in South Africa must first have security for his rights. It is for this reason that they come along with this political bluffing, that as long as one had a Bill of Rights one would have adequate protection of human rights and might as well waive one&#x2019;s political power. All this is an attempt to throw dust in our eyes. The Whites of South Africa, the NP&#x2014;and, since we are talking about him so much, the Afrikaner in particular&#x2014;will not allow themselves to be mesmerized by a Bill of Rights into voting to renounce their political power.

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member why a Bill of Rights is being introduced under his Party Government in South West&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member that a Bill of Rights will be introduced in South West Africa at the request of those people as a method of providing them with human rights. It is not being introduced by the Government. It is not this Government which makes decisions about those things. The aim of my speech is to show that a Bill of Rights is not an adequate guarantee under the circumstances in South Africa against the waiving of human rights.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville said that a Bill of Rights normally appears in a federal constitution. The idea of an inflexible constitution and the so-called supreme authority of the courts, sets one&#x2019;s mind at rest, and were there to be a sudden trampling upon rights, the courts would pass judgment on this and declare the laws of the federal government to be illegal, and the situation would be very nice. The heart of the question remains what guarantee we would have, if political power were at issue in such a community, and rights were ignored, that the ruling of the courts would be obeyed by the Government of the day. Constitutionally&#x2014;I stress the word&#x2014;the courts may in such a federation with an inflexible constitution, declare actions of the Government legal or illegal. Constitutionally, the courts can indeed protect human rights under a Bill of Rights, but what guarantee will we have that it will be enforced&#x003F; What guarantee do we have that the Government of the future would be prepared to accept the rulings of the courts&#x003F; Under the given circumstances&#x2014;as the hon. member for Waterkloof quite clearly stated&#x2014;a Bill of Rights could be barely worth the paper it was written on. I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville and the Kowie Marais&#x2019;s and so forth, to give us the guarantee that the government of the future will always adhere to the constitution of the day. If problems arise in a country, the fundamental question is: who has his finger on the trigger&#x003F; We have often seen it happen in Africa. Under such circumstances, a Bill of Rights might have no value.</p>

<p>Most African States began with a democratic constitution and a Bill of Rights. However, what has happened to them&#x003F; When Lesotho did not care for the outcome of the election in 1970, they suspended the constitution, Bill of Rights and all, and put the Opposition in gaol. I want to ask the hon. members how a Bill of Rights with an inflexible constitution and the supreme authority of the courts could have saved the life of the chief justice of Uganda&#x003F; I want the hon. member for Yeoville to indicate to us where in Africa a Bill of Rights has contributed towards protecting human rights. Where in Africa has a Bill of Rights made a contribution towards preventing the rights of majorities in any specific community from being trampled upon&#x003F; If the hon. member can answer that question for us, then we shall talk about the practical aspects of the problem. We on this side of the House are of the opinion that the maintenance of human rights is related proportionately to the morality and the level of civilization and development of the Government of the day. This occurs in a democratic framework such as the one in South Africa. It is my contention that we ought to have less faith in abstract concepts and laws such as Bills of Rights, and more confidence in the quality of our people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville told us about other countries in the Western world, but we are aware of the fact that a Bill of Rights works there. It works there because a Bill of Rights is part of Western constitutionalism. It works in tolerant political communities and it works in communities where there is an established parliamentary tradition. For political reasons, therefore, we reject a Bill of Rights as a protection of our rights. I want to point out that as far as a Bill of Rights itself is concerned, it does not always contain such wonderful rights which are effectively enforceable under all circumstances. It is not possible, when one has a Bill of Rights, for human rights to be trampled on unconstitutionally, but constitutionally it is also possible that there may be interference in the rights of people. Human rights are limited legally in the case of a Bill of Rights, chiefly by three things, viz. the rights of others, the requirements for the maintenance of State security and in the third place, the interests of the community in general. This is clearly stated in section 29(2) of the &#x201C;Universal Declaration of Human <span class="col_843-844" refersTo="page_0439"/>Rights&#x201D; of the UNO. If one considers how it is applied in practice, we can take a look at the Bill of Rights of Germany, in which the following is stated in section 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Everyone shall have the right to the free development of his personality.</block>

<p>That sounds very good, but then follows the proviso: &#x201C;Provided that it does not infringe upon the rights of others and does not offend against the constitutional order or the moral code.&#x201D; Section 2(2) of the constitution provides: &#x201C;Everybody should have the right to life and to the inviolability of his person. The freedom of this individual shall be inviolable &#x2026;&#x201D; Then this is tagged on at the end: &#x201C;But these rights may only be infringed upon pursuant to a law.&#x201D; It is a very wide concept which is being written into this Bill of Rights. I could quote many other such examples. When we look at the position in South Africa, we see that in South Africa a wide measure of protection is afforded human rights. My hon. friend from Waterkloof has already referred to this. The rights to life, inviolability of person, freedom, honour, good name and possessions are maintained in South Africa. In addition, we enjoy freedom of faith, freedom of worship and one&#x2019;s honour is preserved in South Africa. There is a Bill of Rights in America but quite often one has the impression that the American public media have a licence to drag a man&#x2019;s good name through the mud on the pretext of the public interest. The simple fact that there is a Bill of Rights does not protect one&#x2019;s honour. In South Africa, too, there is due freedom of speech. Absolute freedom of speech exists in Parliament and the radio and Press are free to publish what is said in Parliament. We also have in South Africa, and this has already been referred to, a free and independent judicial system, a refined judicial system which is one of the best in the world. However, we have a limitation&#x2014;and it is often passed off as a limitation on human rights in South Africa&#x2014;which stems from the necessity of security legislation in South Africa. The so-called limitations which we place on human rights and which stem from South Africa&#x2019;s security conditions are limitations which would still exist were we to have a Bill of Rights, because the Government of the day must, in any case, still maintain and guarantee the security of the State. It is imperative that the Government have these powers, because a collapse of State security would result in the wholesale flouting of human rights.</p>

<p>In South Africa, the limitations of human rights which stem from our security legislation are few, being only those which are called for by circumstances in South Africa. The extent to which human rights are upheld in the country is dependent on many things other than what is stated in law. It is therefore important to remember that we in South Africa do not have a homogeneous community but rather a heterogeneous community and wherever one finds a heterogeneous community, there is much more potential for conflict. Because there is more potential for conflict, one must resolve and defuse this potential for conflict. The only way to defuse it is to remove the basis of a power struggle and one can only do this if one has a division of political powers and not a sharing of political power. What is necessary for the preservation of human rights on an even greater scale in South Africa is the full implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy, because if the Government&#x2019;s policy is carried through to its logical conclusions, it will be possible to uphold additional human rights with security for everyone. I have in mind, for example, the full participation of all citizens in their respective governments by way of adequate voting rights. I also have in mind, for example, the movement of citizens within their own country because there will be no restriction on movement. I have in mind, furthermore, the abolition in South Africa of a great deal of separation based solely on colour. I also have in mind the reduction of the Government&#x2019;s essential powers which stem from its security legislation, because the potential for conflict in South Africa will have decreased. We on this side of the House, are convinced that what South Africa needs in order to uphold human rights properly, is not a rigid and inflexible Bill of Rights, while we still have with us all the possible conflicts in South Africa. What South Africa is more in need of, in order to attain its ideals and to preserve human rights in every way, is the realization of the Government&#x2019;s ideals through the full implementation of its policy at all levels.</p>

<p>I shall give the hon. member a chance to put a question in due course, but I first want to make a point. I agree with the hon. member for Pretoria Central on the importance of political power. However, what the hon. member for Pretoria Central forgets is that basic human rights have always been of crucial importance in our own history. In this connection I can refer him to Adam Tas and to what happened in this House&#x2014;particularly at the beginning of the last war&#x2014;when objections were raised to the illegal arrest of people at that stage. Unfortunately I cannot agree with the argument advanced by the hon. member for Pretoria Central. While dealing with the question of political power, he referred to the &#x201C;complete division of political power&#x201D;. I ask: How many times has it been necessary for hon. members of the Government to indicate how it is possible fully to divide power in respect of the Coloured persons, the Indians and the urban Bantu. At the same time the hon. member for Pretoria Central says he is in favour of the abrogation of segregation purely on the basis of race and colour. I cannot reconcile those two standpoints.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the crux of the motion, and I want to do so in a manner which to my mind is a responsible manner. But perhaps I could give the hon. member for Lydenburg an opportunity to put his question at this stage.</p>

<p>&#x2020; I want to associate myself with the motion proposed by the hon. member for Yeoville.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; has on various occasions expressed itself in favour of a Bill of Rights. In this respect I could quote from Hansard of 14 May 1951 (col. 6531) a statement by the then Leader of the Opposition. On that occasion he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And if it should happen that the United Party does not prevail in its fight in the law courts, if it should be held by the highest court in this land that the entrenched clauses are no longer in full force and effect, then the United Party will make it its business to see to it that a new entrenchment will take the place of the fundamental provisions in our constitution; and, Sir, not only a new entrenchment and not only to go into the ways and means to bring about a new entrenchment&#x2014;the United Party will furthermore take steps to see that a new Bill of Rights is written into the constitution of the country.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to detail the points he thought, should be included in such a Bill of Rights. That was 25 years ago. In addition the hon. member for Bezuidenhout the year before last introduced a private motion which was not debated in this Chamber. It read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House request the Government by way of legislation to introduce a South African Bill of Rights which can be supplemented from time to time, but which will at least acknowledge and declare that in the Republic the objective will be no discrimination on the ground of race or colour on the part of the Government and which will guarantee to each individual fundamental human rights.</block>

<p>In addition this party has consistently proposed that a Bill of Rights should be included for South West Africa, which is, indeed, exactly what has taken place. Furthermore, the party has endorsed the 14 principles of the Marais Committee which, <i>inter alia,</i> provide for a Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>The concept of a Bill of Rights has a long and interesting history in the history of mankind. As you well know, Sir, it started off as a manifestation of the laws of nature. Then it was superseded by a more humanistic approach to it. Particularly important for us is the development that took place in this regard in the British legal system. The Magna Carta of 1215, especially section 29 of it, represented a particularly important development in this respect. It aimed to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the State, against the individual&#x2019;s rights to property and his right to personal liberty and it asked for guarantees in terms of the principles of justice and right to all. This was followed by the Petition of Right in 1627 and then finally, by the Bill of Rights of 1688. What was important, is that in the development of Britain&#x2019;s common law, which forms a basic part of our own legal system, a large number of basic human rights were included and protected. Our legal system is part of the British common law system, which thus still forms an essential part of our own legal system. Therefore, I cannot understand why hon. members on the other side object to the concept of basic human rights, because they do in many respects form a basic element in our own legal system.</p>

<p>The American Constitution was actually the first written legal document in more modem times in which fundamental rights and freedoms were entrenched. As you know, Sir, it all started off with the Declaration of Rights of the state of Virginia in 1776. If I may take the liberty, I should like to read out what the declaration said. It said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</block>

<p>These principles were the forerunners of the American Constitution and the Bills of Rights <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0442"/>entrenched in the American Constitution by way of the first ten amendments introduced in that constitution and eventually also in terms of the 14th amendment, which made it possible to apply these basic human rights also internally in the various states of the United States.</p>

<p>It was particularly after the Second World War that we found general acceptance in the whole outside world of the need to protect individuals against the arbitrary exercise of the power of the State in a large number of countries. The basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany as promulgated in 1949 is but one example of that. In that basic law, article 1 provides for the protection of human dignity, article 2 for the rights of liberty and article 3 provides for equality before the law. It states that &#x201C;all persons shall be equal before the law&#x201D;. Article 4 provides for the freedom of faith and creed; article 5 provides for freedom of expression; article 6 provides that &#x201C;marriage and family shall enjoy the special protection of the State&#x201D;; article 7 provides for education; article 8 provides for freedom of assembly; and article 9 provides for freedom of association, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to this basic law in the Federal Republic of Germany there is the declaration of independence by the State of Israel on 14 May 1948. The law of Israel does not include a Bill of Rights, but in the declaration of independence of 1948 it is stated very clearly and explicitly that the State of Israel will rest upon foundations of liberty, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; that it will maintain complete equality of social and political rights for all its citizens, without distinction of creed, race or sex; that it will guarantee freedom of religion and conscience, of language, education and culture; that it will safeguard the holy places of all religions, and that it will be loyal to the principles of the United Nations Charter. Then as far as the Arabs as a group are concerned, the declaration states that &#x201C;even amidst the violent attacks launched against us for months past, we call upon the sons of the Arab people dwelling in Israel to keep the peace and to play their part in building the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its institutions, provisional and permanent&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The same principles were embodied in the constitution of India in 1949, and in the Nigerian Constitution of 1959; in 1960 Canada produced a Bill of Rights, an &#x201C;Act for the recognition and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#x201D; Time does not allow me to go into detail, but I want to say that after the Second World War a Bill of Rights had become something that was regarded in many States as essential in order to protect the individual against the arbitrary exercise of the power of the State. In addition, apart from the geographical limitations we have since 1949, two more general declarations of human rights were made. One was the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which was accepted in 1948. Later we had the convention of the EEC providing for a Bill of Rights for the 16 member States of the European Community. In South Africa itself, apart from our whole background and tradition of British common law, we had in the South Africa Act two entrenchments, viz. the equality of Afrikaans and English and, secondly, the entrenchment of the political rights of the non-Whites, Africans and Coloureds, in the Cape Province. You know the history, Mr. Chairman, I shall therefore not give details.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of the recognition of basic human rights, there are certain fundamentals. The one is the concept of equality; in other words, that neither on the basis of sex, marital status, religion, ethnic origin nor race should there be a difference between people in the enjoyment of basic human rights.</p>

Race in South Africa affects the question of marriage, sexual intercourse, employment opportunities, salaries and wages, taxes, residence, occupation, trade union rights, the settlement of labour disputes, travel, education, access to the courts, statutory crimes and contraventions, political rights, separate amenities&#x2014;in fact, the whole apparatus of apartheid. We cannot get away from the fact that what is accepted in the outside world in terms of a Bill of Rights, i.e. that there should be equality before the law, regardless of race, colour, sex, marital status, etc., is not applicable in South Africa. There are other substantive rights which we have abrogated in South Africa and which, in terms of other Bills of Rights, are regarded as essential fundamental freedoms, e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of association, freedom of protest, freedom to own and carry weapons and in addition to the substantive rights, there are certain what one might call processual rights, rights flowing from the concept of the due process of law, which are also fundamental human rights, which we have abrogated in South Africa, whatever the reasons may be. I do not have to go into the question of arbitrary imprisonment, the exclusion of the courts, the limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts, the onus of proof, the fact that a person should be prosecuted only once for the same basic offence, the right to legal representation, the right not to incriminate oneself, legislation with retrospective effect, and the discretion of the courts to determine the nature of the sentence.</p>

<p>In the time still available to me, I want to say that I believe that in view of our situation in South Africa a Bill of Rights has become essential. Such a Bill of Rights will have to do two main things. The one is to protect the individual, no matter whether he be White or Black, no matter what political persuasion he may have, against the arbitrary exercise of the power of the State limiting the freedoms and liberties and the rights of that individual. Furthermore, regardless of what groups are involved, we will have to create a system which will provide adequate protection for the groups which make up the plural society in which we live, and through the constitution guarantee the maintenance of the identity and the preservation of the cultural rights of those groups who want to maintain their identity and their rights.</p>

<p>In many of these Bills of Rights&#x2014;and I presume that it will be essential also in our own country&#x2014;there are basically two limitations to the complete and unrestricted applicability of such Bills. These two limitations lie in the concept of firstly, the <i>salus publica,</i> in other words, the interest of the public at large&#x2014;and, secondly, the principle that you may only exercise your rights to the extent that it does not injure the rights of others. In other words, Mr. Speaker, your rights end where the rights of the other person start. These are two basic essentials, and I do not propose that it will be possible to have a Bill of Rights unless we have these limitations. However, that is not the point. What we need, is a declaration that these are the principles on which we want to build our State and on which we want to build the relationships among the various individuals and groups in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the last instance, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that a Bill of Rights, important as it is, can only survive if it is contained in the hearts of people. It is only when people believe that that Bill of Rights reflects what they want for themselves in terms of basic human rights, that we can hope that a Bill of Rights will really be maintained under all circumstances. In addition, I want to reply to the hon. member for Lydenburg. A Bill of Rights can only be maintained if it is adhered to at all levels of government. A Bill of Rights which aims at securing the rights of individuals and the protection of minority groups, can only be maintained effectively if the crucial structure within which that Bill of Rights operates, is such that all the groups are adequately represented at all levels of government: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. That is the only way in which it will be possible to prevent the kind of situation where a single group, White or <span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0444"/>Black, can utilize the machinery of political power to abrogate the basic fundamentals and principles of a Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, under these circumstances, I can only state that I believe that justice in South Africa, that the interests of our country, demand that we should very seriously consider, while we are still in a position to do so, introducing a Bill of Rights that will guarantee to individuals, regardless of race or colour, certain fundamental freedoms, a Bill of Rights that will serve to protect all of us against the arbitrary exercise of power by the State, and which will provide for the adequate protection of minority groups by involving all the groups in South Africa in the political structure at all levels of government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. GREEFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in discussing this subject today, I should like to pose four questions. The first question is whether there is any need for the motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville this afternoon. Secondly, I want to know whether this is not being provided for by the existing political and legal order of our country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greeff">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. GREEFF</person>:</from>

<p>Thirdly, I should like to know whether it is not obviously a recognized principle of democracy&#x2014;and we have taken over that system in South Africa&#x2014;that such rights are being guaranteed and protected in South Africa. In the fourth place I should like to know whether the Constitution of our country should be burdened and over-burdened with a measure of this nature.</p>

<p>During the course of my speech, I shall try to deal with and answer these four questions. I believe that the hon. member for Yeoville will agree with me when I say that the concept of &#x201C;basic rights&#x201D; is closely associated with the freedom of the individual. This statement definitely does not need any motivation. However, it immediately brings me to the question whether the individual in South Africa is not free after all. Surely, he is allowed to form his own ideas. He is allowed to develop those ideas. He is allowed to exercise his own choice concerning his profession and the work he wants to do in this country. [Interjections.] In short, what it amounts to is that we say to the individual in South Africa: Here is South Africa. Choose what share you want in this country. Develop it and at the end of your career, give an account of what you did with those opportunities.</p>

<p>The only prerequisite is that the individual should act in such a way as to maintain the good order which is indispensable to any orderly community and, furthermore, that he should readily recognize the rights and the right to exist of his fellowman. I am therefore asserting that the basic rights of the individual are properly recognized and protected in South Africa, that he enjoys the freedom of an orderly democracy in South Africa, and that the very Government which is in power at the moment protects, and will protect him with essential measures, when it appears that the individual is in danger of losing his rights and freedom due to disorder.</p>

<p>This brings me to the second question, i.e. whether the motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville here this afternoon is not being provided for by existing political and legal order. It is clear that in his motion the hon. member for Yeoville insinuates that the rights of the individual in South Africa are being infringed upon in an unfair manner and that minorities in South Africa are being steam-rollered, are simply being ignored. This is obvious from his argument. This is why he wants to introduce entrenched provisions into our Constitution.</p>

<p>The example he uses, the train of thought of his whole argument and of those who spoke in support of him, does not substantiate his case. The measures which are introduced from time to time by means of legislation&#x2014; and I am not only referring to legislation enacted by the present Government, but also by former governments in South Africa&#x2014; have been introduced in order to protect rights and minorities. The State is compelled to regard it as its duty to see to the interests <span class="col_855-856" refersTo="page_0445"/>of all its people. If it appears that there are certain developments indicating that the interests of individuals in South Africa are in danger of being undermined, it is the duty of the State to ensure that the individual is afforded the necessary protection through certain measures by means of legislation. Here I want to warn against our possibly reaching a stage where we regard restrictive measures as a continual infringement upon the rights of individuals and the interests of minorities. These measures are taken by the legislator in order to provide protection and are motivated by the principle of &#x201C;live and let live&#x201D;. Therefore, I want to suggest that our existing political and legal order already provides the machinery which affords the necessary guarantee envisaged by this motion. It is not the task of the Constitution of a country to provide for the guaranteed or absolute rights of the individual.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville referred to security. With respect, I suggest that the security of the individual should rather be sought in the sense of justice of the people and of the community in which he lives. This will afford him the required security. Furthermore, it must be sought in representative and responsible government.</p>

<p>In which way should this security be afforded to the individual&#x003F; I shall mention only three ways: Firstly, the influence of public opinion which manifests itself every day. If certain things are done which run counter to the interests of the individual, public opinion is there to keep a watchful eye on the matter. Furthermore, and this is important for the people on the opposite side of the House, it depends on the watchfulness of the Opposition. Such an Opposition must, however, be effective and not be fast asleep. It must be an Opposition which should at least have a policy as an alternative with which they will be able to unseat the Government. If that Opposition and its policy are rejected in one election after the other, that Opposition must realize that, in order to be effective, it will have to change its policy and effect changes in order to protect the rights of the individual in this way. Lastly, the individual can enjoy that protection and security through the courts which have been instituted, and through the decisions of those courts.</p>

<p>I now come to the third question which I posed at the beginning, namely whether the rights of the individual in our democratic system are being guaranteed sufficiently. Here I should like to mention that, since the last World War, various Western countries have tried to give expression to the concept of &#x201C;basic rights&#x201D; and the concept of &#x201C;human rights&#x201D;. This led to such definitions assuming an important part of the principle of the rule of law. For example, in 1951 the United Kingdom recognized and confirmed the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights, but did not in any way recognize its enforceable jurisdiction. The European Convention was not incorporated into the British constitutional law, and the argument advanced in this respect, according to the authorities I consulted, was that there was no need for the declaration of human rights, as embodied in the European Convention, to form part of the constitutional law of England. On the contrary, it is interesting that this is emphatically stated by Hood Phillips in the third edition of his book <i>Constitutional and Administrative Law</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In fact, the view is taken that what the British Constitution lacks in formally guaranteed rights, is more than compensated by judicial remedies which are in practice effective against both the executive and private individuals.</block>

<p>If we consider further the facts of the parliamentary system and its development, we come to the final principle, i.e. the sovereignty of Parliament or, to put it more clearly, the legislative sovereignty of Parliament as we know it in South Africa. The motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville this afternoon makes me think that he is afraid that there may be a recurrence of what happened in the 18th century in the English legal system, for example, when Mr. Justice Coke declared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0446"/>When an Act of Parliament is against common rights or reason or repugnant or impossible, the common law will control it.</block>

<p>For example, Blackstone also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No human laws are of any validity if contrary to the law of nature.</block>

<p>Fortunately we had the development which brought about legislative sovereignty for Parliament. Today, in the Parliament of South Africa, we have the opportunity to debate Bills, exchange opinions on them and to reflect on them. When such legislation is finally ratified by Parliament and the Senate and signed by the State President, it has the force of law and the courts have no power to express themselves on the validity of the law. What the courts can do, is to interpret the law as laid down by the legislator, but the law is and remains valid.</p>

<p>I now come to my last question, which I shall deal with briefly, due to lack of time. I just want to mention that I do not see any reason at all for the motion which is before the House to be incorporated into our Constitution. I do not see any reason why our Constitution should be burdened with it. If it is felt that rights are in danger of being violated, provision can be made for this by means of ordinary legislation in Parliament, and the Opposition can see whether it can play its role as it should. If it is taken into consideration that there are certain principles which regularly keep an eye on legislation, I want to make it clear that there is no reason why this cannot be done by means of ordinary legislation. I just want to mention briefly: Firstly, there is public opinion, as reflected by the Press and in other organizations. Secondly, there is the fact that the Government is expected, while it is in power, constantly to carry out the policy it advocates during an election. Thirdly, regular consultations should take place with groups before the legislation is accepted. People specializing in certain directions, ought to see to it that legislation is formulated accordingly. I therefore conclude by saying that I do not see any need at all for entrenched provisions&#x2014;a Bill of Rights&#x2014;to be inserted into our Constitution. I believe that the basic rights of the individual and of minorities are being sufficiently protected by means of the existing, well-tried measures in our country.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Aliwal made a reasoned contribution to the debate, but I have difficulty with his argument. He states that the circumstances which could possibly have prevailed under a Bill of Rights already prevail in South Africa. If that is the case, why, then, can there be an objection to converting this into a Bill of Rights in any event so that people can be aware of it&#x003F; I think that this is fair because these things do not exist in fact&#x2014;there are certain gaps and deficiencies&#x2014;there is some evasion of the implications of a Bill of Rights in the constitutional framework of South Africa.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to come back to the hon. member for Pretoria Central, because I found once again that he made a number of most interesting statements about Africa and discussed Africa as if South Africa did not form part of it.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>He did speak in those terms, particularly in the part about the &#x201C;finger on the trigger&#x201D;, but I shall come to that again. What does such a Bill involve&#x003F; It reflects the rights and obligations which the interest groups in a society believe ought to be protected. To a certain extent one could almost say that it constitutes practical proof of the minimum degree of consensus necessary in that society for any degree of co-operation among the various groups. What such a Bill in fact says is that if such a consensus is not possible, there cannot be co-operation in that society. That is why it is essential to eliminate certain misconceptions concerning the constitutional function in place of a Bill of Rights. A Bill of Rights is not a prerequisite for consensus. Many of the hon. members opposite argued this afternoon <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0447"/>along the lines that such a Bill of Rights was a prerequisite for consensus. That is not the point at issue at all; such a Bill of Rights is the result of the consensus achieved. If such a consensus cannot be achieved, then in the nature of the matter, there cannot be any such Bill of Rights. It is fallacy to say that a Bill of Rights can bring about consensus. This has never been achieved anywhere in the world. However, if one states that one is trying to achieve a consensus among the various interest groups in the society with regard to the rights and obligations which these groups regard as important, and they then come to such a decision, only then is a Bill of Rights a possibility in that society.</p>

<p>A second point is that a Bill of Rights <i>per se,</i> as a constitutional measure, cannot be carried into effect. It must be seen within the context of a broader constitutional framework.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pretoria Central kept saying this afternoon that this side of the House was supposedly arguing that a Bill of Rights would solve the problem. We never said anything of the kind. We said that it was an essential element in the constitutional set-up in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>No, he did not convince us. After all, at this very moment I am trying to show him that we did not say it. A Bill of Rights simply cannot be regarded as the only guarantee for the rights of people in a society. It is true that it is an important and essential element, but it needs constitutional entrenchment and protection, not only in the constitution, but also in the courts of law, while the police and defence force must also uphold it. The third point, Mr. Speaker, is that in a heterogeneous society like South Africa&#x2019;s, one cannot have such a Bill of Rights established unilaterally. That is impossible. Due to the nature of the meaning of a Bill of Rights, it is impossible for it to be compiled unilaterally by a specific group. That is why, due to this very point, the point made by the hon. members for Pretoria Central and Aliwal makes no impression at all. We cannot say that, from this situation, a unilateral decision can be taken in this Parliament concerning what the real nature of protection should be for all the heterogeneous population groups of this society. This has nothing to do with a Bill of Rights. This is the basic difference between the argument of this side of the House and that of that side.</p>

<p>This brings us, then, to the next question: Is such a Bill possible for South Africa&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Is it necessary&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I am not asking whether it is necessary, but whether it is possible. This is a practical and not a normative question. The hon. members opposite have themselves already stated that it is quite unnecessary and undesirable. I want to put another question: Is it in any way possible&#x003F; In South West Africa there are people who think that it ought to be so. They think that it may be possible, too. They are trying very hard to talk to each other in order to come to an agreement on what the nature of such a Bill should be. There are Afrikaners there, too. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Pretoria Central: Is that group of Afrikaners allowing itself to be &#x201C;mesmerized&#x201D;&#x003F; Are the hon. members for South West Africa being &#x201C;mesmerized&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. Minister of the Interior says: You cannot talk about South West; South West is an entirely different situation. There we have a mandate area: here in South Africa we have a sovereign State. After all, we cannot compare the two.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that that is a territory under mandate whereas this is a sovereign State, has absolutely nothing to do with the internal regulation of the various population groups. [Interjections.] Wait, just give me a chance. If the various population groups in South West Africa decide that they should sit <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0448"/>around a table to talk&#x2014;whether it is a territory under mandate or a sovereign State has nothing to do with that&#x2014;do you say that they are being pressurized by the UNO&#x003F; [Interjections.] Of course! I agree. They are sitting around the conference table there in order to conduct discussions with each other. South West Africa has a heterogeneous population. South West Africa had a minority group which governed and administered it for years. Just like South Africa, South West Africa has a division between rich and poor. Just like South Africa, South West Africa has a disproportionate rural and urban economic development. All the essential elements which can lead to conflict, as the hon. member over there says, are to be found in South West Africa, just as they are here. There is no difference.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>That choice does not rest solely with that hon. member and his party. This the people in South West Africa have learnt. After all, they had that situation for years. When they found that they no longer had that choice, they asked: What must we do&#x003F; We must talk. What did that talking lead to&#x003F; To a joint statement of intent. What does a joint statement of intent say&#x003F; We acknowledge that there are differences and problems of conflict in the society, but we must come to an agreement, because if we do not do that, what is the alternative&#x003F; The alternative is confrontation and violence. The violence is menacing our borders. Just like South West Africa, we are being threatened by external violence. Just like South West Africa, we must reach a settlement with the people here. We must decide here whether we are going to confront or not. I find it interesting to come once again to the speech by the hon. member for Pretoria Central. In his previous speech in this House he wrote off the parliamentary tradition as unsuitable for South Africa. In this speech&#x2014;it is stated in Hansard&#x2014;he writes off a bill of rights as a basis of consensus. If the hon. member is so concerned about consensus, what other constitutional mechanism does he have in mind&#x003F;</p>

To the extent that one divides it, one is surely sharing it with someone else. This matter of division and sharing of power is nonsense. It is just make-believe. Just because that hon. member does not want to say that he does in fact agree with us, he thinks up a new concept. An important question is this&#x2014;and I should also like to put it to the hon. the Minister: If we here in South Africa believe that we must bring about a consensus and achieve co-operation among various population groups, that we must produce a joint statement of intent, how can we believe that parliamentary tradition is worth nothing&#x003F; How can that side of the House believe that a bill of rights is meaningless, and not worth the paper it is written on&#x003F; &#x2026; and tell that to the South Westers!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the point I am really trying to make is that if we have reached the situation in which the Whites in this country have to acknowledge collectively that this is the only so-called solution to our problems, then confrontation is going to be the only way. I do not believe that that is what they are saying, and if that is not so, why, then, can they not accept the simple and convincing arguments advanced by this side of the House.</p>

<p>In terms of academic argument yes, but the fact of the matter is that whatever may be created&#x2014;this is the underlying theme in this argument&#x2014; must be the result of joint decision-making. It cannot be the result of unilateral decision&#x002D;making. This has been the source of political conflict throughout Africa and the world. If we think that we are going to cut that knot by ignoring it and persisting with unilateral political decision-making then we are living in Lotos Land; then we are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have sat and listened to an interesting debate, a debate which may perhaps not always have been aimed at the &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D;. Nevertheless, I listened with interest to what was said, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. member for Yeoville. He obviously wants something to be added to our constitutional position by means of a declaration of human rights. I do not think it is unfair that before we consider adding a declaration of human rights we should first see what we have and probably first of all make sure of what we want to change in regard to our fundamental rights, if we have any such rights. We have undergone a constitutional development here in South Africa since the day in 1652 when the White man came to this country. This took place first of all under the Dutch Government, namely, the VOC, and afterwards, in line with British constitutional thinking and its development. Everything was tempered by and adjusted to the Roman-Dutch Law which is part of our legal processes. This development has therefore not taken place over a short period; its foundations have been laid here in South Africa, slowly but surely, in order to bring us where we are today in a sovereign Parliament that is fashioned on the pattern of British constitutional thinking. Our legal sovereignty is vested in this South African Parliament and nowhere else. We have also fashioned our fundamental rights on the British pattern, precisely the same provisions, with this exeption that over and above this we have the Roman-Dutch legal concepts. What are these fundamental rights&#x003F; They are that a man is completely free in every facet of his life, for example, in regard to speech, assembly and all the others that were mentioned by the hon. member. A person is therefore completely free within his community but is subject to certain restrictions. That is our constitutional position. To what restrictions is one subject&#x003F; One is subject to those laws that have been made lawfully by one&#x2019;s constitutional authority, one&#x2019;s sovereign Parliament. If one&#x2019;s Parliament has passed a law&#x2014;it makes no difference how that law affects one&#x2014;then it is correct in law that no matter what one has by way of freedom will fall into line under the law of that Parliament. One has to do this because that Parliament represents one&#x2019;s community&#x2019;s joint will, and Parliament has been placed there by that community. Before hon. members make any interjections in regard to the non-Whites, let me say that I shall be dealing with this matter just now. This Parliament represents the sovereign will of our people, and that is why it is correct for them to allow their rights to be restricted by a law that has been passed properly and constitutionally by Parliament. Another limitation that exists is the rights of other people under the common law; therefore, rights which it is not necessary to have passed by Parliament. We all know about this as a result of our background and because of our cultural heritage.</p>

<p>In times of danger it is also our right to take extraordinary steps, through the medium of our lawful Parliament, to place certain powers in the hands of the executive. The executive then receives permission to restrict rights by way of an extension of this Parliament because there is a position of danger. This is set out very clearly in our law, and is expressed as follows in the <i>South African Law Journal:</i></p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0451"/>It is accepted that every State is entitled, in exceptional circumstances, to take exceptional measures to preserve its own security.</block>

<p>This is absolutely fundamental to our legal system and is based on the old Roman law mentioned by my hon. friend opposite, namely, the principle of <i>salus populi suprema lex.</i></p>

<p>These are the three restrictions that one has in respect of one&#x2019;s fundamental freedoms. Who looks after these freedoms that one has&#x003F; It can be one&#x2019;s common law position or one&#x2019;s judical position. The independent courts that are appointed in a manner that is laid down in the constitution&#x2014;once again by the common will&#x2014;look after them. Through the medium of our common will we establish a Supreme Court for ourselves that is independent of ourselves but which is not above ourselves, and which also stands under the sovereign authority of this Parliament. However, it is independent of this Parliament and it has the right to interpret laws in its own way. That is what our whole structure looks like.</p>

<p>I listened with great interest to what the hon. gentleman wanted to give us. I want to refer to points 5, 6 and 7 raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Harry, listen for a moment!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes", the hon. member would do well to listen to me for a moment. He is very fond of telling other people that they should listen to him; I think that on one occasion he also called my name out. I want him to listen to me now for a moment as well. The hon. member asked what mechanism we have to introduce in order to maintain our fundamental rights. Our courts have to look after that aspect of the matter and our sovereign Parliament has to determine what our rights are. That is what we have, but apparently the hon. member is not completely satisfied with it because he mentioned a number of aspects that have been passed by this Parliament completely lawfully, and which he regards as being basically a lack of freedom. That is wrong because the sovereign Parliament has passed them. In any event, that is how the hon. member feels about them and he now wants to know how they can be changed. The hon. member said that a mechanism, namely, a declaration of human rights, should offer protection in this connection. The hon. member contended that this was the best machinery for that purpose; Parliament and the courts are now no longer the best machinery for doing so. Those two institutions have now to take a back seat because after all now we are going to have a written document. The hon. member went on to say: &#x201C;It will only be possible with a strong judiciary.&#x201D; In other words, the Bench has now to receive more power than it has at the moment. A greater right than the sovereign Parliament has now to be built into the Bench so that it can tell Parliament: &#x201C;You have now intruded upon the basic fundamental rights of the individual and therefore I say, I who am the Supreme Court, that this cannot happen. &#x201D; That is what it amounts to. In his next sentence the hon. member said: &#x201C;Both the Bill of Rights and the courts must be protected against the executive.&#x201D; In other words, this Parliament as a sovereign authority is no longer good enough and must be limited in its executive authority which was itself set up by this Parliament. The hon. member now wants the courts to be given this right: in other words, this authority has now to be transferred to the courts of law. I have already said that our basic rights are precisely the same as those of the British. The people who say that the law is unjust or that it affects a Black man, a Brown man or a White man unjustly should listen now to what Sir Ivor Jennings has to say in this respect in his <i>The Law of the Constitution</i> (Fifth Edition). He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this sense &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is also talking about basic rights&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the right of assembly is a liberty, a freedom from restriction. It arises from the <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0452"/>tautologous principle that anything is lawful which is not unlawful. There is no more a &#x201C;right of free speech&#x201D; than there is a &#x201C;right to tie up my shoe-lace&#x201D; or if there is a right of free speech, there is also a right to tie up my shoe-lace. The question to be discussed in each case is the nature of the legal restrictions. The &#x201C;right&#x201D; is the obverse of the rules of civil, criminal and administrative law. A man may say what he pleases provided he does not offend against the laws relating to treason, sedition, libel, obscenity, blasphemy, perjury, official secrets, etc. He may form associations provided he does not offend against the laws relating to trade unions, friendly societies, religion, public order and unlawful oaths. He may hold a meeting where and how he pleases so long as he does not offend against the laws relating to riots, unlawful assemblies, nuisance, highways, property, etc.</block>

<p>He continues in this vein and, if hon. members will permit me, I should also like to make a quotation from Prof. A. S. Mathews. This is a gentleman who may perhaps be regarded with even greater respect by hon. members opposite than Sir Ivor Jennings. In his thesis entitled &#x201C;Law, Order and Liberty of South Africa&#x201D; of 1971 at page 31, he has this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since it is obvious that no right can be absolute &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any theory associating the rule of law with the guarantee of basic liberties must expressly recognize certain qualifications upon those liberties.</block>

<p>One cannot do otherwise. The question is now whether a declaration of human rights is the correct solution. We have history to act as a guide and we also have examples about us that may help us. Let us see what the writers of constitutional law have to say about a few of the basic rights that are embodied in a declaration of human rights. We have a declaration of human rights of this nature in the American Constitution, which is an inflexible Constitution. It was laid down in that Constitution because the states were all independent. Subsequently, they formed a federation and did not want to forfeit any rights that were not defined. They then said that those rights should be defined and that they would then be satisfied. Mr. Speaker, I say with respect that in many respects these people have written themselves into a corner. What does Sir Ivor Jennings have to say in this regard in <i>The Law of the Constitution</i> on page 258&#x003F; He says&#x2014;</p>

<heading>CHANGING IDEAS OF WHAT IS FUNDAMENTAL</heading>

<block name="quote">The second difficulty is that what are regarded as fundamental rights by one generation may be considered to be inconvenient limitations upon the legislative power by another generation.</block>

<p>This also holds good for the judge because he is also a person and not a god. After all, he has not come down from Olympus in order to uphold a declaration of human rights for us. He is a person just like you and I, Mr. Speaker. He also moves with the times. His declaration of rights must be written in 1977, according to my hon. friend opposite, but the judge may eventually be living in the year 2077 by which time conditions will have changed as well as the spirit, thought and ideas of the people. However, he will then have to interpret what his forefathers have laid down for him in a declaration of human rights. We will then have this position, and I want hon. members to hear what Jennings has to say further in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For example, the 5th and the 14th amendments to the Constitution of the United States prevented the United States Congress and the legislatures of the states from depriving any person of life, liberty or property &#x201C;without due process of law&#x201D;. This has been used by the Supreme Court <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0453"/>to limit very seriously the enactment of social legislation dealing with such matters as hours of labour, minimum wages, and workmen&#x2019;s compensation. This is due, perhaps, as much to the beliefs of some of the judges of the Supreme Court as to the framers of the Constitution. It is nevertheless clear that the provisions of a Constitution drawn up before the development of modem industrial society are likely to lead to such complications.</block>

<p>I should also like to quote what Mr. Justice Hiemstra had to say in an article entitled &#x201C;Constitutions of Liberty&#x201D; (1971 S.A. Law Journal). On page 45 he has this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are some provisions in the Bill of Rights which Americans must have regretted by now &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is an article that was written many years ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The &#x201C;right of the people to keep and to bear arms&#x201D; &#x2026;</block>

<p>Yes, just as I did in Parliament. They, however, had the right to wear it outside, and they could wear it in a holster on a belt. It was the man who was quickest on the draw who held the law in his hands. What does Mr. Hiemstra have to say&#x003F; He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are some provisions in the Bill of Rights which Americans must have regretted by now. The &#x201C;right of the people to keep and to bear arms&#x201D; seems too dangerous in these days of indiscriminate killings. It is well known that the American Constitution can be altered only with a majority of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress plus ratification by three-quarters of the state legislatures. Yet they have saddled themselves with the accused&#x2019;s right to trial by jury, which is the prime cause of the dubious reputation enjoyed by American criminal courts. Defending counsel often rely on histrionics and showmanship to impress the lay jury more than on reason and defined arguments directed at the trained and balanced mind of the judicial officer. In civil trials the jury is one of the main causes of backlog which in some States is as much as six years. Yet the people have elevated the jury to the position of a sacred cow. The same has happened in regard to the phrase in the Fifth Amendment: &#x201C;That no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to bear witness against himself.&#x201D; Numerous of the writings contain the plea &#x201C;amend the Fifth Amendment&#x201D; because the supposedly sacred privilege against self-incrimination has become a refuge for many who are not as noble as the principle behind which they wish to shelter themselves. It is a rule completely destitute of any rational foundation.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there you see the dangers that are inherent in a declaration of human rights of this nature. The question arises to one&#x2019;s mind: In our state, South Africa, what is the problem experienced by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x003F; Why has he made this attack upon the results of certain legislation that has been passed by this Parliament in its sovereign capacity, and why has he put forward these juridicial ideas that seek to upset that sovereignty&#x003F; After all, that is what it amounts to. He is breaking down the sovereignty of Parliament and transferring it to the courts. I make so bold as to say that it would appear to me&#x2014;and I want to apologize to the hon. member in advance if I am wrong&#x2014;that this is the thinking of the minority of the Whites in South Africa who no longer see their way clear, in those parties, to take over this <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0454"/>Government. There is enormous frustration there, and I can understand it; this is the frustration of people in perpetual opposition. These people say that sectional Afrikanerdom or, as they call it, &#x201C;the tribal affiliations&#x201D;, have now become so strong that they can never break through the wall. They now come to light with all sorts of clever ideas to try to break down the sovereignty of Parliament, and to transfer that sovereignty to the courts which they&#x2014;and I say this with respect&#x2014;are now elevating to the position of a sacred cow. That is why the hon. gentlemen approach me every day to ask for a judicial commission. A judicial commission can fix everything. One would swear that the judges have also come down from Olympus, that they are no longer people and cannot therefore subscribe to incorrect points of view. However, as I say, this attitude is based on the frustration that these people experience.</p>

<p>I also want to indicate what I suspect. I am of course going to give the hon. gentleman time to reply to me; he can do so with pleasure. My further suspicion is that the hon. gentleman has used this as a precursor to his party&#x2019;s policy, because a declaration of human rights is inherent in a federation. A federation is a dispensation consisting of independent units which then meet in a federal Parliament where each has to relinquish some of its rights and has to give those rights to the federal Parliament. The tendency will then be to want to know whether the minority right, or whatever right it might be, is based in a declaration of human rights. This party has recognized the fact&#x2014;and I think my learned friend will agree with me in this regard&#x2014;that the logical consequence of the policy of those people is in effect one man, one vote. For that reason he and the hon. the Prime Minister had words when he spoke about the &#x201C;White minority&#x201D;. He said this because he was thinking in terms of race; in other words, in terms of a White/Black situation. However, what he is not prepared to recognize is a situation of nations where our White people will in reality be in the majority in this country. That is what the hon. the Prime Minister meant. [Interjections.] No, it is quite right. It is the largest national group in Southern Africa. In any event, let us be very honest with one another this afternoon. I am quite prepared to be honest across the floor of this House. After all, we cannot be otherwise. At any rate, it is this group that has the power in its hands so that any other situation in South Africa can only arise as a result of what this group determines. We come now to the answer to the question of the hon. member over there. Tie asked: But what of consensus&#x003F; I say: Very well, I talk; I am prepared to talk, to talk with people about their rights and talk about schemes. However, people cannot simply ignore the fact or negate it that we are the sovereign Parliament and that we make the laws that are enforceable. After all, that is how a state is constituted. There is a sovereign Parliament where laws are passed that are enforceable, and that is what we have. Of course, we are prepared to talk to people on the basis of trying to convince them. However, just before I deal with our policy, allow me to take my ideas in regard to the policy of my hon. friend a little further. The hon. member for Houghton and another hon. member said that eventually the Blacks would be in the majority in a common Parliament.</p>

<p>He has two things in mind with federation. [Interjections.] Of course, I talk of nations; he talks of races although he knows that on a racial basis the Black/White ratio is four to one. Therefore, with his party&#x2019;s system of a free vote for all&#x2014;that is to say, all the race groups in South Africa&#x2014;one will have four Blacks here for each White, is that not so&#x003F; [Interjections.] Wait a moment; just give me a chance. However, he says now: No, look here, the interests of my group may perhaps be affected in such a situation; we must therefore try to establish a federation. The whole attempt at federation is to break down the numerical majority of the Black race groups and to reduce their voting power to that of the Whites. That is the idea behind the federation plan. He wants to know that personal freedom&#x2014;because he will then regard himself as a minority race group&#x2014;will then be laid down in a fundamental document, a declaration of human rights.

<p>Let us look at our policy. There are two basic things that are considered in our policy. Who started homelands in South Africa&#x003F; Did we&#x003F; No. The British started them. This was a British constitutional development. Initially, there was a group of protectorates within the Republic. Then, by means of their constitutional development and in the light of the &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; of Macmillan, the British gave those people their freedom; in other words, they established independent homelands. South Africa is now accused of being out of step. No, we are the product of British constitutional thinking. We also have territories which are historically those of the Black man and we are doing precisely what Britain taught us to do. We are also engaged in giving them their freedom. However, what <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0456"/>does this mean&#x003F; It means freedom together with peace. We say: &#x201C;Freedom for the nations,&#x201D; and those people can live out their lives as homogeneous groups in those specific areas. The hon. member for Rondebosch spoke about a heterogeneous community. We want to remove the heterogeneous aspect so that we can live in a homogeneous community where we can live in peace.</p>

<p>Do not start bringing politics into the discussion. As soon as the hon. member for Sea Point finds himself on uncertain ground he runs to the swimming bath. We are giving these people their freedom within the pattern of constitutional thinking throughout the whole world in order to make them happy and in order to establish homogeneous nations. However, I am the first to admit that there are still a great number of problems along this road although there are a hundred times more problems on the road of federation and the declaration of human rights than there are on this historic road, a road that is being enlarged upon further in terms of the pattern of our history and our constitutional life. There will be development as there has been in Britain as well, constitutional development, from 1215 when they wrote their first declaration, throughout the struggle against the kings and the power of the kings to the position that has been reached today. That is the way South Africa&#x2019;s constitutional road is running, but it is a road of peace, love and constructive effort.</p>

<p>In the few moments still left to me I want to explain our dilemma in South Africa. We do in fact have a dilemma. I have noticed this dilemma on many occasions. It is that our friends on the other side of the House have never been able to sit quietly, to think about the matter and to say: &#x201C;Strip yourself of your prejudice towards the Afrikaner. Get rid of your prejudice in respect of the Afrikaner so that you can sit in your chair this evening and say to yourself: I do not hate the Afrikaner; I am not afraid of the Afrikaner because he is a good person. He is with me in South Africa and I am always able to co-operate with him.&#x201D; There is a further matter. Let us be honest with one another. Will the hon. member for Sea Point mind giving me a few more moments&#x003F; I am dealing with a motion moved by a member of his party; it is not my motion. The hon. members belonging to that party should sit down and say further: &#x201C;Let us accept the fact that the Afrikaner does not seek to oppress the Black man. Let us forget all the liberal stories we get from Soweto and all that type of gossip. Let us look at the position through Africa spectacles and ask ourselves: Should we develop a brand new federation with a declaration of human rights or should we give this separate development, these separate freedoms, problems and all, a chance&#x003F;&#x201D; They berated me when I said the day would come in South Africa&#x2014;and I want to say it to them once again now&#x2014;when they would take separate development, warts and all. I admit that there are problems. All that I am asking is that the Whites should at least show some unity, that the Whites in South Africa should say: &#x201C;Let us give the thing a chance.&#x201D; Let the Whites say to us: &#x201C;We will come to Parliament and we shall oppose these people but we shall oppose them on the basis of how and when; how we should proceed in order to bring this about, how soon we should do it and how we can draw plans to succeed in doing it. Let us stand together to complete this great task in Southern Africa. It is our historic task so let us do it.&#x201D; But we just come along here and talk piffle. We talk about declarations of rights that do not form part of our constitution and which now seek to deprive us of our sovereignty. Give us a chance. That is all that I ask the Opposition. Give the policy of the NP a chance. I also want to ask them to accept the good faith of the Nationalist, to accept the good faith of the Afrikaner. I want to ask them this as well: Support us in completing this great task of Africa and let us solve these problems.</p>

<p>I want to conclude now because I want to give the hon. member an opportunity to reply to the debate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes that are still available, I want to reply very briefly to the debate. Firstly, I would like to thank the hon. member for Edenvale for his support of this motion. [Interjections.] I also want to say that I do not believe that a case has been made out against a Bill of Rights. The tragedy about the hon. the Minister of Justice is that he was speaking in exactly the same way, using the same words that were used by the Nationalists in South West Africa only a very short while ago. Yet, eventually, the Minister will have to come in exactly the same way&#x2014;and I hope it will not be too late&#x2014;and will have to sit down and negotiate on the same kind of terms as they are now doing. What we are trying to do is to warn the Government of this dilemma in which they are. The tragedy about what has been said here today is that, in so far as we are concerned, we are people of hope because we are committed to negotiate and committed to dialogue. They, on the contrary, are people of despair because they are the people, as symbolized by the hon. member for Pretoria Central, who says the only answer is to sit with your finger on the trigger. [Interjections.] That, I want to tell you, spells disaster for South Africa.</p>

<p>I briefly want to talk about the supremacy of Parliament. In order to enable Parliament to be supreme, it must be the governing body of all the people. This Parliament is not the governing body which is elected by all the people of South Africa. This is a White Parliament of White people elected by Whites. As the hon. the Minister himself has said, he has the power; he makes the decisions; he decides what should be done. Then, of course, one cannot say that this is a body representative of all the people of South Africa. With respect, there, are some things which this Parliament should not be allowed to do by a simple majority. Those concern the basic human rights which every rational being is entitled to. That is why a Bill of Rights is essential here. Why, may I ask, is English and Afrikaans entrenched in the constitution of South Africa&#x003F; Why is it&#x003F; Why should it be unique&#x003F; Why should other basic rights also not be included in that&#x003F; This, in fact, is the weakness of the whole argument. The truth is&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister knows it&#x2014;that he sits on the edge of a volcano. For some 28 years he has asked us to give him a chance, but for 28 years he has made an unholy mess of it. Yet he wants us to go on with him on a path that leads to destruction. Our job is to warn him. Our job is to put him on the right road. He asks that we must help with separate development. If it were a possible solution for South Africa, we would be the first to help. But it is not a possible solution; it is not a moral solution, and it is one that is not acceptable. If they want to partition South Africa and come with an honest partition proposal, then that is another story. But they do not come with an honest partition proposal, but with a proposal by which they want to ensure that everything that counts in South Africa is retained for only one section of the population and they want to do it by force. That force can only lead them to destruction, and the tragedy is that it is not only leading them to destruction; it is leading all of South Africa to destruction, every White man. That is the tragedy of the policy of the NP. That is the tragedy of the whole thing. In leading us along this road, it is not only they who are going to be destroyed; it is the Whites of South Africa as a whole who are going to be destroyed; it is the Black man in South Africa who is going to be involved in a confrontation with us all. That is the tragedy of NP policy, and that, in fact, is what goes wrong when it comes to this Government and its proposals.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know, the Part Appropriation Bill makes provision for the appropriation of a lump sum for the continuation of existing services in the financial year which is due to commence soon. In fact the amount which is now being requested is merely an advance on the main appropriation and authorizes the expenditure of the State in the new financial year until such time as the main appropriation is passed by Parliament later this year.</p>

<p>The advance requested in this Bill amounts to R2 922 million, of which R2 872 million relates to the State Revenue Account and R50 million to the SWA Account. The application represents the expected spending by departments during the first four months of the financial year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall as usual give a full elucidation of the economic position when I introduce my budget on 30 March. However, there are a few aspects of our economy to which I should now like to refer briefly.</p>

<p>Over the past year our balance of payments has consistently been our greatest economic problem, but I am pleased to be able to inform this House that a considerable improvement has already taken place. The deficit on the current account of the balance of payments in the third quarter of 1976 was only approximately half of the deficit during the first and the second quarters, and in the fourth quarter there was a further considerable decrease in the deficit.</p>

<p>This improvement in the current account was attributable in the first place to a drop in our imports. At a seasonally adjusted annual rate imports decreased from R7 681 million in the first quarter, and R7 652 million in the second quarter, to R7 160 million in the third quarter of 1976. This decrease is primarily due to the Government&#x2019;s strict fiscal and monetary policy, as well as to the import deposit scheme which was introduced in August last year.</p>

<p>Exports have increased encouragingly from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of R4 238 million in the first to R4 454 million in the second and R4 939 million in the third quarter of 1976, and in the fourth quarter exports increased even further.</p>

<p>The value of our gold production dropped in the third quarter of 1976 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of R2 187 million, compared with just over R2 400 million in the first and second quarters, primarily as a result of the low level of the gold price between July and September of last year. Since then of course there has been an appreciable improvement in the gold price.</p>

<p>I think we may be very satisfied with the course of the gold price in recent months. Gold has shown that, despite many unfavourable factors, it still occupies a strong position. The gold market has demonstrated that it is able to absorb the IMF gold sales, as well as considerable sales by Russia. The so-called restitution of a portion of the IMF gold to its member countries last month had only a slight effect on the market because the world realizes that the central banks which receive gold will not readily dispose of that gold.</p>

<p>Looking ahead there are several favourable factors for gold. Firstly, there is the fact that the IMF gold auctions will in future take place at shorter intervals and in smaller quantities. This is in accordance with representations we made to the IMF, although I would have liked to have seen even shorter intervals. Nevertheless, this ought to help to eliminate, to a great extent, the nervousness caused by the first IMF auctions.</p>

<p>Secondly, the amendment of the Articles of <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0459"/>the IMF, which is expected to come into operation by the middle of this year, makes it lawful for central banks to buy gold at a market related price&#x2014;instead of at the present unrealistic official price&#x2014;and I expect certain central banks to avail themselves of this opportunity to consolidate their gold reserves.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the amendment of the Articles of the IMF will make it necessary for us to introduce legislation to place the gold marketing and valuation arrangements of the Reserve Bank on a new basis. At present the Reserve Bank buys the gold at the official price of R29,75 per ounce, and then sells it back to the mines at the same price, which then receive the price for which the gold is sold on the private market. This procedure will have to be changed so that the mines receive the higher prices directly from the Reserve Bank. In addition the question of the valuation of the gold reserves of this bank will also receive attention. The necessary legislation will be introduced later this session.</p>

<p>With the revaluation of the gold reserves of the Reserve Bank a considerable profit will occur in the books of this bank. The Chamber of Mines has requested that this profit, or a portion thereof, be transferred to the gold mines. I have given thorough consideration to this request, but cannot support it.</p>

<p>Until March 1968 the gold price on the private market was kept very close to the official price. The principle central banks saw to this by selling gold on the private market from their reserves whenever necessary. In March 1968, however, the central banks of the major industrial countries ceased to buy or sell gold on the private market. This entailed that the price on the private market was allowed to deviate from the official price; subsequently the former price exceeded the official price by a considerable margin.</p>

<p>Now, it seems fair to me that the gold mines should receive the actual selling price for all gold produced by them since March 1968, but that any revaluation profit on gold which was already in the possession of the Reserve Bank at the time, lawfully accrues to the bank. But the gold reserve of the bank is lower now than in March 1968; in other words, the mines have already received the benefit of the private market price, not only on all gold produced since March 1968, but even on a portion of the gold reserves at that juncture. Consequently I have informed the Chamber of Mines that I shall not be able to comply with their request.</p>

<p>In terms of the Currency and Exchanges Act any profit or loss on the gold held by the Reserve Bank shall be for the account of the Government. Thorough consideration will subsequently be given to the question of the utilization of the revaluation profit, but it is clear that care will have to be taken to ensure that, as far as possible, the profit is not utilized in an inflationary manner.</p>

<p>I return now to the prospects for the gold price.</p>

<p>A third favourable factor for gold is the possibility of renewed inflation and exchange rate problems abroad. On this point it is difficult to speculate, but the expansionistic programme of the new American administration is at least creating the expectation in certain circles that something of this nature could happen.</p>

<p>The present position, as well as the prospects for the current account of our balance of payments, is therefore encouraging. Consequently I was able to announce the discontinuation of the import deposit scheme last week. This scheme served a useful purpose, particularly in order to clamp down on imports until the fiscal policy set out in the 1976 budget could become really effective. However, it was always regarded as temporary and I think that the basic fiscal and monetary measures will now be sufficient to keep imports in check.</p>

<p>The position on the capital account of the balance of payments is less favourable. The net capital inflow decreased from R483 million in the first quarter of 1976 to R89 million in the second quarter, and in the third quarter there was a net outflow of R12 million. The indications are that a net inflow occurred again in the last quarter. In fact, I think it will be a significant inflow.</p>

<p>The disappointing figures for the second and third quarters were primarily the result of a considerable outflow of short-term private capital. To an extent this outflow was attributable to the drop in our imports and the consequential net payment of trade credits; this is a normal phenomenon when imports drop. The slow growth rate of our economy and the relatively low level of private investment was also a factor. The political problems of Southern Africa, and particularly the <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0460"/>one-sided and exaggerated reports in the overseas media, were undoubtedly an important cause of the drop in the capital inflow, and unfortunately we cannot expect the confidence of foreign investors&#x2014;particularly those who do not know our country very well&#x2014;to be restored overnight.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to infer that no foreign capital is at present being obtained. In the first three quarters of 1976 the private sector showed a net inflow of R635 million in long-term capital, of which more than one-third was obtained in the third quarter. During the present financial year, i.e. from 1 April 1976, the Government has obtained new foreign loans to an amount of R246 million, apart from the amount of R291 million which was drawn from the IMF.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we must expect that the capital inflow in the coming months will be relatively modest. In view of the need to build up our foreign reserves and to pay off certain short-terms loans, it is clear that the present conservative fiscal and monetary policy should be continued.</p>

<p>In respect of inflation the latest figures show a considerable improvement. As an annual figure the seasonally adjusted consumer price index for the fourth quarter of 1976 was 9% higher than in the previous quarter&#x2014;the lowest increase for more than three years. This is gratifying, but of course is still not sufficient.</p>

<p>Several factors should be borne in mind here. Firstly, increases in certain administered prices have to be allowed from time to time. This is simply unavoidable, although I can give this House the assurance that such adjustments are considered very carefully. Secondly, there is the fact that the price and wage provisions of the collective campaign against inflation terminate on 31 March&#x2014;and here I wish to express the hope that after this date the greatest measure of control will continue to be exercised in the determination of prices and wages. Thirdly, there is the possibility, to which I have already referred, that inflation may subsequently revive overseas.</p>

<p>A favourable factor in respect of inflation is the present relatively low level of capacity utilization in our economy. Then, too, I want to emphasize that all the provisions of the collective campaign against inflation, except for the price and wage provisions, continue to remain in operation.</p>

<p>It is clear that, for the sake of the struggle against inflation too, the present strict financial policy should continue to be maintained.</p>

<p>This conservative policy, together with foreign factors such as the recent depression overseas and the drop in the gold price, has of course contributed to an inevitable drop in the growth rate of our economy. Nevertheless, and in contrast with many other countries in recent years, the real growth rate of our gross national product in 1976 was still positive, although relatively low&#x2014;approximately 1% according to provisional estimates.</p>

<p>Of course this low growth rate has implications for employment and unemployment in South Africa. The number of registered unemployed persons&#x2014;Whites, Asians and Coloureds&#x2014;rose from 11 492 in December 1975 to 22 581 in December 1976. As a percentage of the total labour force in this category unemployment is still very small&#x2014; approximately 1,2%. As the hon. House knows, official figures for unemployment among Black workers are not available. [Interjections.] I have seen various estimates or speculations in this regard, but they are so divergent that one can hardly rely on them, except that I am sometimes very doubtful about the excessively high estimates. The most scientific estimate that I am aware of indicates an increase between mid-1975 and mid-1976 of 38 000 in Black urban unemployment and 62 000 in Black unemployment in the rural areas outside the homelands, which, under the circumstances, does not appear to be excessive.</p>

<p>It is important to note that employment is still increasing. The seasonally adjusted index of employment in the non-agricultural sectors shows an increase from 115,3 in December 1975 to 116,8 in September 1976.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, there is no shortage of critics of our present economic situation or of the Government&#x2019;s economic policies. [Interjections.] In particular, much publicity&#x2014;I would say excessive publicity&#x2014;has been given to criticisms recently expressed by a gentleman who, though undoubtedly eminent in his own field, is perhaps not equally noted for the balance or moderation of his views on national economic affairs. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister, as well as my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Economic <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0461"/>Affairs, dealt effectively with some of his criticisms in this House last week, but I should like to make some further brief reference to them, and to the views of other critics, this afternoon.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment underestimate the difficulties of our economic situation. We have a balance of payments problem; we have a growth problem; and we have an inflation problem. [Interjections.] But we should look at the situation in perspective, in the context of a world plagued by economic problems which, in some countries, are of crisis proportions. And we should compare like with like; that is, we should see our position in the perspective of the situation in countries in a similar stage of economic development.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I was about to say, when I was once again interrupted, that I am dealing with facts relating to South Africa.</p>

<p>In its annual report the IMF publishes statistics for a group of countries which it calls &#x201C;the more developed primary producing countries&#x201D;. Perhaps one or two members on the Opposition benches who are so vocal, might even have seen these. In addition to South Africa, this group comprises Australia, New Zealand, Spain and a whole number of the smaller and less industrialized countries of Europe. For this group, the growth rate in 1975&#x2014;the latest year for which statistics are available&#x2014;was 1,6%; ours was 2,25%. For most of the industrial countries, I might add, the growth rate in 1975 was negative. For the group which I have mentioned, the rate of inflation in 1975 was 16,7%; ours was, at its highest, 13,5%. The latest available figures show that inflation in Australia, New Zealand and Spain is still far above South Africa&#x2019;s level, and in fact half the industrial countries of the world have inflation rates in excess of 9%&#x2014;many of them far in excess of 9%. As regard unemployment, it is well known that this is still an extremely serious problem in Europe and in North America. The balance of payments on current account of the group of more developed primary producing countries deteriorated from a combined surplus of 1 billion U.S. dollars in 1973 to a deficit of no less than $14 billion in 1975&#x2014;two years later&#x2014;and most of these countries financed their large deficits in part by heavy borrowing on the international financial markets. The recent substantial devaluation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars shows that the balance of payments problems of important countries in the group are by no means solved.</p>

<p>The troubles of other countries give me neither comfort nor reason for complacency, but they do serve to place in better perspective the gloom-and-doom prophecies of those who see only South Africa&#x2019;s problems and blame them all on the Government-myopic critics who see only the mote in South Africa&#x2019;s eye and not the beam in the eyes of other countries.</p>

<p>I should also point out that South Africa not only has to cope with problems similar to those experienced by other countries in the group of more developed primary producing countries; we also have particular or peculiar problems of our own. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! If I am not mistaken the House will devote 12 hours to debate these matters and I should therefore like hon. members to listen to the hon. the Minister without interrupting him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would mention specifically the fall in the gold price since the end of 1974, the effect of political events in Southern Africa on the confidence of some foreign investors, and the need to increase very substantially our expenditure on defence. It is, indeed, a tribute to this Government&#x2019;s economic and financial policies that, despite these additional adverse factors, our economic situation compares favourably with that of other countries in a similar stage of development.</p>

<p>The soundness of our financial policies is further illustrated by the action of the IMF in permitting South Africa to make substantial drawings on the Fund. Such drawings are only granted when the Fund is satisfied, after a thorough study by its staff, that the country&#x2019;s policies are likely to lead to a substantial improvement in its balance of payments. Apart from the import deposit scheme, about which they could not be expected to be particularly enthusiastic, the IMF mission which visited South Africa last July were in full agreement with the Government&#x2019;s financial policies and had no hesitation <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0462"/>in recommending that the drawing be granted, and last November the IMF was prepared to grant a further substantial drawing under the so-called compensatory facility.</p>

<p>Even more important, the most recent trends, as I have already indicated, show that we are definitely on the right track. The current balance of payments is improving, inflation is diminishing, and if we persevere with our present policies the rest will certainly follow in good time.</p>

<p>According to Press reports, the critic to whom I have already referred described the 1976 budget as &#x201C;a tragedy&#x201D;, and argues that this budget, though necessary, was the result of Government overspending since 1972. So the 1976 budget was a &#x201C;financial tragedy&#x201D; because those immediately preceding it overspent! I ask the House: What sort of argument is that&#x003F; This overspending he apparently ascribes to the fact that, as he puts it, &#x201C;the Treasury was bitten by the gold bug&#x201D;. I must emphasize that I have had to rely on newspaper reports since I have not had an opportunity to read this critic&#x2019;s book. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This is of course not a new criticism, though I cannot recall that any of the critics who are now so wise after the event forecast at the time that the gold price would fall to the extent that it did in 1975 and 1976. But that is by the way. Is it really true, however, that Government expenditure was allowed to increase to such an extent during the past few years as to cause serious problems to the economy&#x003F;</p>

<p>The best way to judge this, I believe, is to relate Government expenditure to the national accounts. Expressed as a percentage of gross domestic expenditure, consumption expenditure by general government&#x2014;which includes all public authorities but not their business enterprises&#x2014;increased from 12% in 1970 to 13,1% in 1972, then declined to 12,3% in 1973 and 1974, then rose again to 13,8% in 1975.</p>

<p>I suggest that these figures scarcely seem to justify the charge of profligate Government spending. It must be remembered that the past two years have seen a tremendous but unavoidable increase in spending on defence. If defence spending is excluded, the relative percentages are 9,7% for 1970, 10,8% for 1972, 10,3% for 1973, 10,1% for 1974 and 10,3% for 1975. Again, these figures scarcely support allegations of unbridled Government spending. They also include many items which, for special reasons, have shown large increases in recent years, such as expenditure on homeland development and on strategic stockpiling.</p>

<p>What about capital expenditure&#x003F; Again, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic expenditure, the gross domestic fixed investment of public authorities varied from 8% in 1970 to 10,8% in 1972, 8,9% in 1973, 8,4% in 1974 and 9,7% in 1975. The percentages fluctuate and there has been a slight tendency to increase, but again they hardly support the impression of a reckless slide towards socialism.</p>

<p>Figures for the public corporations show a more definite upward trend. As a percentage of gross domestic expenditure, the gross domestic fixed investment of these corporations rose steadily from 2,6% in 1970 to 4,6% in 1975. There were good reasons for this increase. Most of the public corporations furnish basic infrastructure services or, as in the case of Iscor, a basic product for private industry. Nevertheless, I would agree that in this case this is no doubt a trend which we shall wish to watch in the future.</p>

<p>In general it is true that, over a long period, the State&#x2019;s share in the South African economy has increased. This is a worldwide trend, and is certainly not confined to countries which are socialist or near-socialist. It is to be expected that, as national income increases, there should be a greater demand for the so-called &#x201C;collective goods&#x201D;, such as are generally supplied by public authorities. We all want better schools, better hospitals, better roads, more efficient telephones and all the other amenities of modem living. It is not a sinful drive towards socialism or communism which causes this expansion of State activity, but the understandable and, in many cases, perfectly justifiable desire to the people themselves.</p>

<p>To return to the 1976 budget, this was, in fact, widely acclaimed, both inside and outside South Africa, not as a tragedy, but as a realistic response to a difficult situation arising from, firstly, the need for a very considerable increase in defence expenditure&#x2014;indeed about 40% in one year&#x2014;and secondly, the substantial decrease in the price of gold, by far our most important export. &#x201C;What I like best about this budget (i.e. the 1976 South <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_0463"/>African budget)&#x201D;, said a world-renowned banker, at a dinner in Europe which I had the honour to attend last April, &#x201C;is that it is a professional budget&#x201D;. I think that it is appropriate for me to say that here today.</p>

<p>Another criticism which has been made, if newspaper reports are correct, is that our tax system tends to discourage private enterprise and production. The object of all taxation, clearly, is to divert resources from the private to the public sector, and it is hence very difficult to devise a tax system which does not, in some measure, impinge upon production. In South Africa, however, we have gone very far&#x2014;some would say too far&#x2014;to modify our tax structure so as to minimize this effect. I need only refer to the substantial initial and investment allowances, the exporters&#x2019; allowance, the Bantu workers&#x2019; training allowance, the beneficiation allowance and many other provisions of the Income Tax Act.</p>

<p>One final point. The Government is criticized for being hypersensitive to criticism. This is, of course, to put it politely, not true. Any Government in a democratic country must expect criticism and it is its right and duty to answer this criticism. The fact that I have today dealt patiently and at some length with a number of criticisms&#x2014;most of them very wide off the mark&#x2014;seems to me to be a sufficient answer to this charge.</p>

<p>I should like, in conclusion, to deal with the Glen Anil case and the Government&#x2019;s involvement therein.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year the Government was approached by representatives of a consortium of banks. They drew attention to the difficulties of Glen Anil, the involvement of the banks and the possible wide-spread repercussions if the company were liquidated or placed under judicial management. The consortium submitted proposals, which were subsequently modified in some respects, for Government assistance in a rescue operation. Because of the importance of the matter, the Government did not wish to dismiss the proposals without careful consideration. On the other hand, because of the important principles involved, a thorough investigation into the position of the company and the banks was necessary. The banks therefore agreed to a moratorium, which was subsequently extended to 15 February 1977. To meet its other current liabilities, however, the company required cash, which the banks were not prepared to advance without a Government guarantee. As an interim measure, therefore, I agreed to such a guarantee up to a maximum of R5 million, in order to keep the company alive until the Government could complete its investigation and come to a decision.</p>

<p>The position was then fully investigated by the Reserve Bank, and I wish to express my appreciation of the thorough and expeditious way in which the Bank carried out its task&#x2014;an extremely complicated task, if I may say so.</p>

<p>In short, the bank consortium&#x2019;s proposal was that the Government should guarantee the banks&#x2019; claims against Glen Anil, which amounted in all to a very considerable sum&#x2014;indeed, of the order of R100 million. In return the banks would extend their moratorium and would cede to the Government the existing security loans. There were a number of other provisions, but it is not necessary to go into detail here.</p>

<p>In weighing up the proposal, the Government had to take into account the possible effects of Glen Anil&#x2019;s failure.</p>

<p>Firstly, there were the possible losses to the banks and to other financial creditors of Glen Anil. Fortunately, it appeared from our investigation that only one bank, Rand Bank, would be placed in serious difficulties. The exposure of the other banks is in total considerable but is well within their capacity, especially as many of their loans are covered by good security. Nevertheless, the situation could have a ripple effect on other banks and especially on the smaller South African banks. Secondly, we had to consider the possible losses to purchasers of plots who had paid some instalments to Glen Anil but had not yet taken transfer of the land. According to my information there are about 4 000 such purchasers involved, excluding the so-called &#x201C;bulk buyers&#x201D;. Thirdly, the possible effects on the property market and on general business confidence in South Africa had to be taken into account.</p>

<p>These are important factors to which the Government gave very careful consideration. On the other hand, there were weighty arguments against the Government&#x2019;s acceptance of the bank consortium&#x2019;s proposals. Firstly, it appeared from our investigation that there was no certainty at all that, even with the large-scale Government assistance proposed, <span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0464"/>Glen Anil could be saved. There was also a strong possibility that additional cash injections would be required to meet the company&#x2019;s current liabilities. Secondly, it seemed questionable to grant a Government guarantee to certain creditors, namely the banks, while leaving others unprotected in the event of Glen Anil&#x2019;s eventual failure. Most important, it would create a most dangerous precedent to risk the taxpayers&#x2019; money to shore up an ailing company, and it would be difficult to resist similar demands by the creditors of any other property company, or indeed of any concern which might in the future get into financial difficulties. With reluctance, therefore, the Government decided that it could not accept the bank consortium&#x2019;s proposal.</p>

<p>One of the first consequences of this decision was that Rand Bank had to be placed under curatorship. As I have explained, the other banks involved appear to be in no danger. Nevertheless, because of the possible ripple effect on public confidence in other small banks, I deemed it advisable to issue a statement last Wednesday to reassure the public that, to the best of our knowledge, the position of all other banks is sound. I hope that the public will act with responsibility so as not to create unnecessary problems, particularly for the smaller banks. May I also express the hope that the Press, and particularly certain newspapers, will act with due responsibility regarding this very important matter.</p>

<p>In order to preserve South Africa&#x2019;s credit standing abroad, it was also regarded as advisable for the Reserve Bank to guarantee the obligations of Rand Bank to foreign creditors. Most of these obligations consist of guarantees issued by Rand Bank for external obligations of the bank&#x2019;s clients, and it is unlikely that these guarantees will have to be implemented to any extent. The Reserve Bank requires a Government guarantee to back its own guarantee in this instance, and the necessary legislation will be introduced this session to empower the Government to issue such a guarantee.</p>

<p>Finally, the Government will have to implement the R5 million interim guarantee to those banks which advanced money to Glen Anil to keep it alive while the Government was investigating the position. The actual amount advanced was much less, i.e. approximately R1,4 million, and this amount will be requested in the Additional Estimates.</p>

<p>This has been a most unfortunate event, and my sympathy goes out to those who, in one way or another, have lost money thereby. I believe, however, that the effects need not be as wide-ranging as some people fear. The banking system, I repeat, is to the best of our knowledge sound, and even in the case of Rand Bank&#x2014;as also of Rondalla Bank, which was earlier placed under curatorship for other reasons&#x2014;it can reasonably be expected that, given time and good management, depositors need suffer no loss. Care will have to be taken to avoid the disruption of the property market by the sale of Glen Anil&#x2019;s properties, and I hope this can be achieved. The action of the Reserve Bank in respect of Rand Bank&#x2019;s external obligations has, I understand, already created a most favourable impression overseas.</p>

<p>I wish to stress that a very heavy responsibility rests upon the banks&#x2014;eight in all&#x2014; which lent money on such a scale to Glen Anil, and not only the Government, but I am sure also the public at large, will closely follow the measures they take to minimize whatever losses may ensue from this unfortunate affair.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are difficult times for our economy, as for the world economy. But I firmly believe that we are on the right road. The trends are right, and that shows that the policies are right. I am confident that, long before I present the next Part Appropriation Bill, the South African economy will have shown solid and substantial improvement on all fronts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I always find this Part Appropriation Bill which is presented to this House every year and asks Parliament to approve the spending of a huge sum of money, in contemporary terms, to be one of the less satisfactory pieces of work we have to do in Parliament. I say that because in fact we are being asked to sign a blank cheque for the huge sum of R2 922 million without being given any idea of how this money is to be spent, without knowing how the total of R2 922 million is going to relate to the total expenditure in the main Budget for next year and without knowing how a huge sum of money such as this is to be <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0465"/>financed. In other words, in dealing with this Bill, we are working in the dark.</p>

<p>I fully realize that, owing to seasonal and other influences, to draw conclusions from the amount to be voted in the Part Appropriation Bill is a hazardous occupation. But it has not escaped my notice that the amount asked for this year is a full 25% higher than the amount asked for at the equivalent time last year and that in recent years there has been a consistent relationship between the total of the amount asked for in the Part Appropriation Bill and the total of the Budget. That relationship has been in the vicinity of either way of 29%. If this relationship is maintained this year, we can look forward to a main Budget in the vicinity of R10 000 million. That figure is a conclusion which, as I say, I draw with reservation, but I still draw it with no sense of comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that I am pleased to note that on this occasion he has taken the opportunity of giving this House a fairly comprehensive survey of the economic scene. He has dealt with the position of gold, the balance of payments, inflation, growth or rather lack of growth in the economy, the employment or rather the lack of employment situation, State participation in the economy and other subjects. I believe that the step which is contemplated to revalue the gold in the hands of the Reserve Bank is a wise one, one we will certainly support as it is one we have recommended on previous occasions. But there, Mr. Speaker, I would say my pleasure with the hon. the Minister ends. [Interjections.] I believe that the hon. the Minister in his survey of the economy, has tried to place all the numerous weaknesses in the economy in the most favourable light, and in doing so, he has not been objective and in many cases has given the wrong impressions. He has omitted from his survey what is propably the most important economic factor in the present situation, namely our political situation, which has such a direct bearing on the economic situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are all questions which we on this side of the House will examine during the course of this Second Reading debate, and in order to enable us to consider the matter further, I move&#x2014;</p>

<heading>PROHIBITION OF THE EXHIBITION OF FILMS ON SUNDAYS AND PUBLIC HOLIDAYS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have found it interesting to listen to the 22 speeches already made on the subject of this Bill. At this stage it is clear, too, that misunderstanding still prevails among some people in regards to the legislation, misunderstanding which I shall illustrate later on. Speakers on the Government side pointed out that it was the aim of the Government, of the hon. the Minister, to prevent the commercialization of Sunday, commercialization which can be furthered to a large extent by the free exhibition of films on Sundays.</p>

<p>Speakers on the Opposition side advanced the argument that if film shows on Sundays were prohibited, caf&#x00E9;s may not be open on Sundays either. In my opinion these are not comparable cases, since caf&#x00E9;s are regarded as service establishments. Caf&#x00E9;s render an essential service to the public. People who have to obtain bread, milk and other foodstuffs on Sundays, obtain them from caf&#x00E9;s. A bioscope which exhibits films on a Sunday cannot be regarded as a service organization. On the one hand they provide for the entertainment of people and on the other they aim at the profit of the owner, and if bioscopes are permitted to open on Sundays, it can be expected that shopowners will in the future argue that they want to open their shops on Sundays since bioscope owners are allowed to do business on Sundays.</p>

<p>This could also give rise to hotel owners insisting on opening public bars on Sundays, since bioscope owners are free to operate on Sundays. This, however, is where the misunderstanding occurs, since this legislation is not aimed at restricting the privacy of people. Just as anyone who chooses to do so is free to have a drink on a Sunday afternoon in the privacy of his own home or that of a friend, but not in a public hotel or bar, in the same way this legislation will see to it that people may not attend a public bioscope on Sundays. But people, like members opposite, will however be permitted to see their own films <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0466"/>in the privacy of their homes; no one will prohibit them from doing that. A lot was said about the fact that much of the population would be opposed to this legislation. In fact, an Opposition speaker found that only about <i>5%</i> of the population was in favour of this legislation. I want to point out to him that he is quite wrong. The three biggest Afrikaans churches in South Africa have a little over 2 million members, <i>viz.</i> well over half of the White population of South Africa. The leaders of those three churches and the leaders of smaller Afrikaans churches in South Africa have expressed themselves in favour of this legislation and unhesitatingly objected to the exhibition of films on Sundays. To my knowledge, only one random test has been carried out by way of referendum among a local community in South Africa to find out how they feel about this matter, and this was in Pinetown, Natal, which, I think, is probably up to 80% English-speaking. Those people decided by a majority of votes that bioscopes should not be open on Sundays.</p>

<p>One of our newspapers, <i>Die Vaderland,</i> conducted a snap survey in Johannesburg last week on how the public felt about this Bill, and the report was entitled &#x201C;Rather church on Sundays than bioscope&#x201D;. Let me quote some of the people he interviewed: Mr. J. A. Human, a member of the Methodist Church&#x2014;please note, a member of an English church&#x2014;said&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is what our people in general feel about this legislation. A few Opposition speakers have maintained by implication that this legislation is a so-called &#x201C;Afrikaner law&#x201D;. I want to tell those gentlemen that if they want to regard it as such I shall not object, because the Afrikaner has certain principles and certain customs which he wants to uphold, and because the Bill arises out of those principles and customs, I want to say that we shall continue doing so. If necessary the Minister will introduce more legislation of this nature in the future to ensure that Sunday will continue to be a day of devotion in South Africa and not simply another day like Monday to Saturday in other parts of the world. I know that we in South Africa, Afrikaners and many English-speaking people, would like to see Sunday in South Africa retaining its character as we have known it up to now, and are insistent that this should be the case. If people want to describe this Bill as an Afrikaner bill, I want to say&#x2014;and the PRP can go and tell this to their kindred spirits at the University of Cape Town, who asked last week: &#x201C;Afrikaner, waar gaan jy heen&#x003F;&#x201D; that the Afrikaner knows where he is going. As long as the Afrikaner knows where he is going, we shall introduce such legislation when necessary because it is good for them and for us&#x2014;for everyone who has South Africa&#x2019;s interests at heart. I was in my constituency this weekend. My people in my constituency unhesitatingly support this Bill. We want to congratulate the the hon. the Minister and say: &#x201C;Thank you very much!&#x201D; We are grateful to him for having introduced this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down, unfortunately laid great stress on the fact that this Bill was being described as an Afrikaner Bill. He laid stress on the fact that this Bill was described in this way. I think it is very unfortunate. Let me say immediately that when he refers to the Methodist Church of <span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0467"/>South Africa, he should be clear on one thing: it is not an English-speaking church. The majority of its members speak either Xhosa or Zulu and a great number of them speak Afrikaans. I concede that there are many people within the Methodist Church, and many other churches of different language groups and representing different cross-sections of language groups, who would actually support this Bill. That is not the issue on which I want to concentrate now. My hon. colleagues from Sandton and Parktown have already referred to the irony of a protracted debate on this Bill against the background of burning social, economic and political problems. I must say, listening to the debate on the Bill, it seemed to me quite remarkable that with the state our economy is in and the consequent problems flowing therefrom, we should spend seven, eight or more hours debating this rather trifling Bill. It is beyond my comprehension. It seems to me&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister has emphasized it as well&#x2014;that there are two major points in this debate, a debate which has become remarkably obscure: in the first instance, the nature of the Sabbath itself and Sabbath observance, which should be seen as two quite distinct aspects, and secondly, the role of the State in relation to Sunday observance, the Sabbath and the Church in general. Just so that there can be no mistake&#x2014;and I address my remarks particularly to the hon. member for Aliwal, who in his speech stressed the idea of the Ten Commandments and made that one of his major emphases&#x2014;let me point out that the seventh day of the week is the Jewish Sabbath. The Old Testament refers specifically to the Saturday rather than the Sunday. It was to be sanctified by complete abstinence from work and marked by the doubling of the daily sacrifices and special gatherings for worship.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. The point I wish to make to that hon. member, and indeed to the members on that side of the House, is that if they want to stand by the Old Testament with regard to the Sabbath&#x2014;and that is exactly what the hon. member said, and many echoed his words&#x2014; they should be put against a wall and executed, because the punishment for contravening the Sabbath was nothing less and nothing more than execution. Therefore, I think we must be very careful when we stress the fact that the Sabbath was observed in a particular kind of way according to the Old Testament. I think it is worth recording the fact that those who belong to the Christian tradition do not celebrate the Jewish Sabbath as it is referred to in the Old Testament. Therefore, one cannot take what is applicable to one type of Sabbath in the Old Testament, and impose that on a Christian Sabbath, because the two are very different. This has been a controversy which has raged over hundreds of years so much so that there is a definition concerning Sabbatarianism, namely the excessive strictness in the observance of the divinely ordained day of rest. In its most rigorous form it is a peculiar development of the English and the Scottish reformation, being unknown on the Continent even among Calvinists. This is what intrigues me, because one would have imagined that someone like the hon. member who has just sat down, who laid great stress on the Afrikaner&#x2019;s character, his views, his beliefs, his culture, his religion and the fact that he was going to see to it that what was good for him, was good for the rest of us, would not be taken in by the English and, least of all, by the Scottish. I want to ask the hon. member why they follow the English reformation and the Scottish reformation so blindly; he knows that they are not to be trusted! I am amazed that this House has been allowed to be influenced so very badly by the English reformation and by the Scottish reformation and that they have left John Calvin a long long way behind. One could speak at great length about the quality of Sabbatarianism, but one does not have that kind of time.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that the majority of members accept that Sunday has a specific and special character, namely that it is set apart for worship, recreation or recreation but there is a wide range of opinions concerning what it means to indulge in recreation. It seems to me that we have already moved away considerably, every one of those hon. members on that side of the House included, from the rigid interpretation of the Sabbath, as it is found in the Old Testament, and was found in the 19th century. I submit that there is a considerable difference between the <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0468"/>attitudes of those who belong to different denominations and even those who live in different towns. For example, I do not think one could compare Cape Town with Koedoespoort in this connection. I should imagine that the people of Koedoespoort live in a different kind of way from the people who live in the heart of Cape Town. [Interjections.] I shall leave it there, because one should not judge Koedoespoort only on its representative in this House. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Finance has said that the Government is not sensitive to criticism, but there is &#x2026;</p>

<p>That hon. Minister is the most sensitive man on that side of the House and he has every right to be sensitive, because with his kind of reputation I would also have been sensitive. [Interjections.] I assume that the hon. the Minister will be given a chance to reply and therefore he should keep quiet and think about the Sabbath for a while. The point I am trying to make is that matters concerning the way in which one approaches the Christian Sabbath, should be left to the Christian churches concerned with the matter and to the individuals participating in those churches.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word about John Calvin, because he figures so very prominently in the life and the ethos of many of those who are on that side of the House, and indeed in the lives of some of those on this side of the House as well. John Calvin makes it very clear in his writings that the Sabbath is &#x201C;only the shadow and not the substance&#x201D; to use his exact words. He goes on to say that the &#x201C;false prophet&#x201D; who lays stress on a day rather than on an attitude. In his <i>Institutes</i> (Book 2, chapter 8) Calvin specifically warns against Sabbatarian superstition. Regrettably so many hon. members on that side of the House have not taken Calvin&#x2019;s warning seriously enough. They have disregarded that warning and have now become superstitious in relation to the Sabbath. In his writings he stresses that it is more important to stress a positive quality of devotion to God which is &#x201C;not confined to a single day, but extends the whole course of our life&#x201D;. Here he is strongly supported by the Helvetic Confession of 1566, and I am quite sure that the hon. member for Port Natal will agree with me when I say that this is perhaps one of the most important, if not the most important, confessions in the Reform faith.</p>

<p>The Helvetic Confession stands very close to Calvin&#x2019;s point of view. If you, Mr. Speaker, read the book <i>The Humaneness of John Calvin</i> by Richard Stauffer you will find that on one occasion a very prominent divine, by the name of John Knox&#x2014;who will be familiar to some in this House&#x2014;visited John Calvin to find that he was out playing bowls. It happened to be on a Sunday and he was very shocked by this. However, I think John Calvin had every right to do this although in that time, of course, it was regarded as a very great scandal. But the next Sunday he stopped playing bowls and went yachting instead! Therefore there is much more to John Calvin than most people realize. What is more important for the purpose of this debate is that Calvin and the Helvetic Confession have strong support in Scripture for their attitudes. For example, if one reads from Isaiah, and I actually have the correct quotation in front of me, one will find the following words in chapter 1: Away with your incense and oblations, your prayers and your Sabbaths; it is an iniquity in my sight, but rather learn to do well, seek justice and relieve the oppressed. These are the words I would like hon. members to hear, because if they would only concentrate on the true Scriptures instead of isolating certain fragments from it, they would not make so many mistakes. Just in case I am accused of doing the same thing, let me develop my argument a little bit and allow me to give hon. members a few other quotations. The prophet Amos condemns those who make a great show of their religion on Sabbath and who then contradict this during the week. He cries against those who observe the Sabbath: &#x201C;Let justice rather run down as the waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s absolutely right. If one moves from the Old Testament to the New Testament one will find that Jesus Himself was strongly critical of the Pharisaical attitudes of those who <span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_0469"/>stressed custom, days, hours or specific clothes. He likened them to &#x201C;whitened sepulchres, white on the outside with death on the inside&#x201D;. He said&#x2014;and surely this is what should guide us&#x2014;that &#x201C;Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath&#x201D;. Paul, later on, wrote that &#x201C;Christians should not judge one another&#x2019;s observance or lack of observance of the Sabbath&#x201D;. He stressed the fact that it is &#x201C;the Spirit that gives life and the letter of the law that killeth&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I have tried to explain this because it would seem to me that there is a great lack of biblical understanding on that side of the House whereas the biblical witness should be prominent when we look at the whole question of the nature of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>I want to go on and to talk about the role of the State in relation to the Sabbath and Sabbatarianism. According to the Scriptures, the State was ordained by God and therefore stands under God as a servant of God, having a specific responsibility to prevent religious persecution, and more positively to allow freedom of worship. The hon. the Minister and many of his colleagues have stressed that in preparing this Bill for this House, there have been a number of requests from churches and from individual members of churches. However, one would wish the Government to be a little more consistent in relation to its response to requests from the churches. For example, there was the outcry and there were the arrogant statements made by the Provincial Administrator of the Cape when the churches wanted to extend the privilege and opportunity for education, in church schools, to people of all races. Then suddenly the Church was condemned and blamed, and the Government did not respond and refer to the long list of names and denominations. Then it was an entirely different matter. [Interjections.] Then we had these arrogant outbursts condemning the Church. That hon. Minister is always slightly critical, if not overly critical, of much that the Church does and stands for, in South Africa today, in relation to the policies of his own Government.</p>

<p>Then, too, what about the infamous church clause which the State introduced but never implemented because the Church rose up against that clause&#x003F; In succumbing to this kind of pressure from some churches, and some church members of a whole variety of denominations, I believe the Government is forcing this House into nothing less than a vote of no confidence in the Church. It is saying&#x2014;and if this House passes this Bill we shall be saying the same thing&#x2014;that the Church cannot cope and has not the assurance and confidence in its own message and its ability to sway and convince rather than to coerce and to compel. So the real question is not whether the Church should observe the Sabbath because that, I think, we accept; no one quarrels with that. The real question for me, however, in this debate, is whether the Church should seek to impose its convictions upon society at large, and I emphasize the word &#x201C;impose&#x201D;. Of course the Church has a responsibility to try and persuade and convince, but if the Church seeks to impose its convictions upon society, and uses the State as an instrument to do this, I believe that it is contradicting its very nature. For the Church to agitate for such legislation as appears before us today, would be for it to confront the world in a theologically incorrect manner. Instead of appearing as the bringer of good news, and as a community that seeks to serve the world, it will come over as a threatening, limiting, depriving, legalistic and judgmental establishment. It would then be reverting to what I can only describe as a theological perversion; it would be a false witness, and this is very dangerous to the cause of Christ and his Kingdom in the world. No one is asking for the churches to be closed down in order that film shows can be patronized. No one is saying that we must now decide between the Church and movies. It is a question of people acting out of personal conviction, and not the other way around, i.e. being compelled to believe something that other people have experienced. The Church must not be seen as something which is negative and restrictive because then its watchword becomes &#x201C;Thou shalt not&#x201D; instead of rather &#x201C;Thou shalt&#x201D;. I believe we are doing a grave disservice to the Church when we attempt to make it conform and seek to impress or impose its convictions on society at large. This can only be counter-productive for the life and witness of the Church. The hon. the Minister has made the point that he is seeking to make it possible for the Church to do its work. I say that by this Bill, however, he is doing just the reverse. Religious law, in a sentence, should be observed <span class="col_905-906" refersTo="page_0470"/>out of religious motivation, and should not be compelled by civil legislation. Finally, it has been stated several times during the debate that South Africa is a Christian country. That, of course, is not true. South Africa is not a Christian country. There is no country in the world that is Christian <i>per se.</i> There is no such thing even as a Christian Government. There is no such thing in the world as a Christian Government. There is only an opportunity for a country to declare that its basic philosophy is determined in terms of the Christian faith. That is very, very different from saying that a country is a Christian country.</p>

<p>If the argument is that there are certain basic Christian principles which the Government takes into consideration as it seeks to introduce legislation, I must ask whether in the final analysis, when we begin to take account of a Government&#x2019;s or country&#x2019;s claim, we judge a country or a Government and its policies in terms of its attitude and approach to the Sabbath or in terms of its treatment of all the peoples within its borders.</p>

Surely, if we are going to follow John Calvin, if we are going to follow the New Testament Witness, the emphasis should be placed not so much upon the observation of a particular day in a particular kind of way; rather, the final test and criterion is: What are we doing in our attitude and in our policies to all the peoples of this land&#x003F; One need but mention a single example; that is all that is necessary. Today we read in <i>Die Burger</i> that, despite the response to a question put to the hon. the Minister on Friday, there is really no change in relation to District Six. [Interjections.] I shall come to the point in a moment. When I was a young man I used to go to a church in District Six, a church that was really flourishing. It was regularly packed to the doors.</p>

<p>Let me say that as a direct result of the Government moving people, without their having any choice in the matter, because they happen to have skins that are brown, that same church is a shell of the glory it knew in former days. If one really cares about the witness and the work of the church, I want to say that the real test is what we are doing in our attitude towards and control of people. If we are going to accept the Christian faith as the determinant, I think we must change this Government as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the Bill, I believe it is the thin end of the wedge. I believe the church ought to persuade its people as to how they ought to live and not compel them by using legislation which puts them at the mercy of an arbitrary approach. Furthermore, I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and also the further amendment to that amendment by the hon. member for Parktown.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that we have all found the theological talk of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, to be very interesting. The part I found to be the most interesting was his remark about John Calvin that he did not consider the playing of bowls on a Sunday to be a mortal sin. I hope that all the bowlers in the House will bear that in mind. However, <span class="col_907-908" refersTo="page_0471"/>where I do not agree with the hon. member is where he said that this Bill was a trifling one. I am afraid that I cannot consider it in that light. It is not the prohibition of films on a Sunday that I consider to be the main objection in this Bill, but the principle of interference with the rights of the provinces and the local communities to decide what is best for them and for the people. I have become very confused listening to the speeches so far in this debate, particularly those emanating from hon. members on the Government side, and with the arguments that they have advanced, the platitudes offered and the moralizing which we have heard. Some of them sounded like evangelists out to save the souls of the wicked, probably the weak people of Natal. Many of them sounded like stem parents who were very worried about their children and that their children might want to do those things they wanted to do when they were young. Some of them sounded like self-appointed moralists, looking for the beam in their neighbour&#x2019;s eye. Others sounded like missionaries on a commission basis, trying to see how many people they could convert from the &#x201C;flicks&#x201D; to the half-empty churches on a Sunday night. I am afraid they will starve if they are going to rely on the commission they are going to earn from this because closing every place of entertainment on a Sunday is not going to send an extra person to church. I believe that people go to church because they feel they want to go to church; they enjoy going to church and they enjoy worshipping their Maker. All the laws on earth are not going to make them go back to church.</p>

<p>I believe that the arguments offered so far only bring one to the conclusion that this Bill is not one that is wanted by the Government, but it is one that is wanted by the hon. the Minister. I would like to look upon it as a private member&#x2019;s Bill, the hon. James Kruger. I feel that this hon. Minister is feeling frustrated because his threats have been disregarded and have not had the desired effect. He now wishes to show that he is the boss. Every reason that this hon. Minister has given sound hollow, particularly his last one where he said he was introducing this Bill to prevent people from making money derived from disturbing the holiness of the Sabbath. He talks about the Christian Sabbath. As the last speaker has pointed out, it is not the Christian Sabbath that is an issue. After all, this sounds very much like minority rule.</p>

<p>Welkom is the centre of the Free State. Perhaps the hon. the Minister feels that the showing of films on a Sunday night is having a harmful or demoralizing <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_0472"/>effect on the people, but why then does he not tell us what ill-effects it is having. Has it caused outbreaks of violence, noisiness, rowdiness or hooliganism around these places&#x003F; I do not think so; otherwise the hon. the Minister would have said so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to represent an area where this so-called evil has been perpetrated for more than 20 years. I remember, when I first went to Margate, and saw they were having cinema shows on Sunday evenings, how shocked I was&#x2014;I who came from the Free State&#x2014;because I could not understand how they got away with it. [Interjections.] All I can think, is that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, who we then thought was &#x201C;kragdadig&#x201D;, was probably far more tolerant than he and had more common sense. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I must go by what hon. members on the other side have said, Margate must be the wickedest place in the Republic. [Interjections.] I am sure the hon. the Minister knows that this is not true. The local people do not frequent the cinemas, and I myself have never been to a cinema on a Sunday. However, although the locals do not frequent the cinemas, they nevertheless feel that visitors must be catered for. This brings me to the crux of my argument. I feel that tourist resorts, particularly coastal tourist resorts, deserve to be differently treated from any other type of community. Films have been shown at Margate, with the permission of the town council over many years, the only condition being that film shows should not take place during normal church hours and that the films shown, should be of such a type that they should be subject to no age restrictions. In this respect we have had the exhibitors themselves co-operating. We have always had films of a religious, a semireligious or of a cultural nature, and I know of no harm being caused by any of those shows.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein, I think, spoke about Pinetown. However, I have to point out that Pinetown is a different kettle of fish altogether. Pinetown is a settled residential community, and they have the right to decide what their residents want to do. By the same token, we of Margate have the right to decide what our visitors wish to do and whether they should be allowed to do so. This blanket legislation, Mr. Speaker, is foolish.</p>

<p>One cannot use the same legislation to cover all the requirements of all these different people. I believe anyone here who has spent a Sunday evening at a coastal resort knows exactly how boring and how dreary a place that can be, particularly if one stays at a hotel or at a boarding-house. What does one do after church&#x003F; Does one wander around the town&#x003F; After all, it is not everybody who has access to the homes of friends, it is not everyone who has the privilege of visiting people. Therefore, people have to be given some form of entertainment.</p>

<p>I have a home of my own where I can remain and where I can amuse myself.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has already been said that people can sit in a hotel lounge on a Sunday evening and watch the television programme. I am sure many hon. members on the other side find the television programmes on a Sunday evening very exciting, however, not all of us, I am sure, are ballet or opera lovers. [Interjections.] Holiday-makers usually have money to spend, they want to be entertained, they have no Monday morning worries next day and do not have to go to bed early. Often they have young children, children who are normally bored with their parents&#x2019; company and tend to become a handful. Consequently, they too welcome this sort of entertainment, whether it is at the dining-room table in the hotel, or whether it is a cinema show after church hours.</p>

<p>What is the alternative&#x003F; Can the hon. the Minister think of any alternative&#x003F; I have seen that, where people have nothing better to do, they loiter around the streets doing a bit of window-shopping. The young people congregate at street corners, usually in noisy groups. Ultimately, they organize beach parties where they start drinking and smoking&#x2014;often dagga&#x2014;and many evils result from that. [Interjections.] Such parties eventually break up with people fighting and chasing around town on noisy motor cycles or in sports cars with blaring exhaust systems, making a general nuisance of themselves and constituting a hazard to everybody else on the roads. What is the other alternative&#x003F; Midnight shows! This is what we get in an effort to <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_0473"/>circumvent the law. Then there is a noise in the middle of the night, motor-cars chasing around at two or three o&#x2019;clock in the morning and causing a nuisance. [Interjections.] An hon. member on the opposite side referred to home movies. I am opposed to home movies, and I am sure the hon. the Minister is too.</p>

<p>There is no control over home movies. The type of films which are hired by private people is, in many cases, not suitable for showing to young people. Many of these films are violent and full of sex. Nevertheless they are hired and taken home where they are shown to children irrespective of age limits. I do not think that this is such a wonderful alternative. The hon. the Minister is putting money into the people&#x2019;s pockets who let out home movies, because henceforth they will have no competition. At the moment they are suffering because they have to compete, but the competition will be removed and their business will boom. I am sure that the hon. the Minister knows as well as you do, Mr. Speaker, that a prohibition achieves nothing. Once you forbid something, then people really want it. Forbidden fruit is by far the sweetest.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister should realize that he could have achieved his object far better by persuasion, by reasoning or by discussion. That is what he achieved with the Durban City Council, or did he not&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I also believe that this is not in line with Government policy. The Government tells us that its policy is to decentralize, to give more power to the provinces because it is in line with the policy of separate development. However, by means of the legislation they are taking away powers from the provinces. In this respect I should like to quote what Mr. Frank Martin, the leader of the Natal Provincial Council, said when this motion was being debated on 9 June&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We all know, Mr. Chairman, that the Government has made the direction of their policy known to everybody over the years, and it is a policy of separate development. Now I want to say&#x2014;why are we not allowed to develop separately&#x003F; Not on the basis of different colours of skin&#x2014;on the basis of every Province being different in outlook, in habit, in cultures, population diversities and in many other ways. After all, Mr. Chairman, isn&#x2019;t this what Union was all about originally&#x003F;</block>

<p>Why can the hon. the Minister not realize that in matters of this kind it should be left to the community&#x2014;not to the province, but to the community&#x2014;to decide what is best for them&#x003F; I would commend the following words of the leader of the Natal Provincial Council as well&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question of whether certain places of entertainment or recreation should or should not remain open on certain days is not the issue involved. I want to repeat, Mr. Chairman, the issue is whether the local communities should decide for themselves, not whether this or that is a good or a bad thing. We are not arguing about that. We on this side of the Council regard such issues as a matter of conscience to be decided by local communities themselves. We have felt strongly over this for as long as I can remember. They in turn, Mr. Chairman, will be checked by their own electorate if they should ever do things against the wishes of their own people. Now that to me is how our democratic society should operate. Any small area that takes a decision that is violently contrary to the wishes of their own people will be dealt with at the very next election.</block>

<p>After all, that is common sense. All this legislation will achieve&#x2014;I am certain of that&#x2014;is to encourage more bitterness and more talk of secession. I cannot believe that there was agitation or an outcry for this legislation &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<p>I am not aware of that because I am not a member of the NP.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I am certain that the agitation of which that hon. member has just spoken, came as a result of the pressure of certain groups who call themselves Christians. They try to propagate a brand of Christianity which I compare with the Christianity of the Spanish Inquisition. I reject that sort of Christianity. Where is the leader of the NP of Natal&#x003F; He has not taken part in this debate and has not been here. Why does he not tell us whether this is what the NP in Natal wants&#x003F; I know what he is doing; he is playing Pontius Pilate, washing his hands of the whole affair. The hon. member for Durban Central told the House about the way the NP leader in the Natal Provincial Council spoke about this Bill and the way he feels about it. I can do no better than to quote from Mr. Hanekom&#x2019;s speech.</p>

<p>*I only regret that the quotation is in Afrikaans, but in Natal we feel that it is not necessary to translate our Hansard. It is also a waste of money. Mr. Hanekom asked himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; wat het (die agb. Minister) gemotiveer om uiteindelik met hierdie wetsontwerp in die ander Plek te kom&#x003F;</block>

<p>Mr. Hanekom said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Provinsie waar hierdie saak die meeste aandag geniet het in die pers en elders, is ongetwyfeld die Provinsie Natal. Maar nou is dit so dat ons eintlik in hierdie Provinsiale Raad van Natal by monde van my Agbare Vriend, die Lid vir Newcastle verlede jaar reeds &#x2019;n positiewe stap in verband met hierdie aangeleentheid gedoen het. My Agbare Vriend het &#x2019;n mosie ingedien waarin hy gevra het&#x2014;of waarinhy die Raad gevra het&#x2014;om &#x2019;n beroep te doen op die plaaslike owerhede van Natal om omsigtig&#x2014;&#x201C;discreet&#x201D;&#x2014;te werk te gaan in verband met die ontheiliging of heiliging van die Sabbat. En daardie mosie is eenparig deur die agb. lede van hierdie Raad aanvaar. Die mosie het dus so gelui dat&#x2014;ons versoek die plaaslike owerhede van Natal om by die inwerkingstelling van hulle plaaslike verordeninge versigtig te werk te gaan sodat hulle nie mense se gevoelens kan kwets nie, dat hulle nie onverantwoordelik moet optree nie. Maar die wese van daardie mosie was dit, mnr. die Voorsitter; dat ons almal in hierdie Raad, ook my Agbare Vriende aan die ander kant van die Raad, seer sekerlik daardeur met die Agbare Lid vir Newcastle saamgestem het dat daar een of ander vorm van beheer oor Sabbatsontheiliging moet wees. Ons het ons nie uitgespreek oor die manier waarop die beheer moet plaasvind nie, maar ons het by implikasie deur ons mosie ges&#x00EA; dat ons di&#x00E9; feit dat daar beheer op een of ander manier moet wees, erken. Daarom het ons die mosie aanvaar. Die ander beginsel &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central has already quoted from Mr. Hanekom&#x2019;s speech with regard to the other principle.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This proves, Mr. Speaker, that that provincial council, including the NP members of that provincial council, showed a sense of responsibility in this matter with regard to the Sabbath and the individual liberties of everyone of the people in Natal. The hon. member for Port Natal&#x2014;I see he is listening&#x2014;stated that Mr. Hanekom, whom he had seen a few weeks ago, has since changed his mind. I must accept what that hon. member says, but I cannot accept his reasoning that Mr. Hanekom changed his mind because certain local authorities have not co-operated. That is what I understood him to say. I wonder why that hon. member did not tell us in which way these local authorities did not co-operate, which local authorities failed to co-operate, if they have shown a disregard to the hours of showing films or if they have shown a disregard of the types of films to be shown. If this is so, is it not true that there is a session of the provincial council due in a week&#x2019;s time and, <span class="col_915-916" refersTo="page_0475"/>surely, if Mr. Hanekom feels so strongly about it, that he can then raise it in the provincial council&#x003F; I doubt, however, if the matter will be raised.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there is any justification for this piece of legislation. I believe the hon. the Minister has introduced it only because of the one Kruger Day that has been taken off the Statute Book. He now wishes to replace it with 52. I have great pleasure supporting the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon the hon. member for South Coast participated in the discordant choir on that side of the House, which was surprising because we are used to something better from him. I am really shocked that this is the best contribution which the hon. member could make on legislation of this nature. The hon. member told us that the children would have to hang around on street comers and would have nowhere to go if the cinemas were closed on Sunday evenings. However, it has been testified here that those film shows advertized for Sunday evenings have age restrictions from 4 to 18 or from 4 to 21 and I wonder what will become of those children now. The hon. member also says that the cinemas in Natal, specifically those in Margate, do no harm to the people who attend them and that so far no harm has been done. In that respect he confirmed a remark made by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana when he said that the people in Natal observed the Sabbath no less vigorously than the people in the other provinces. I do not know whether this is the case, because I do not know the people of that province very well. However, I should like to read what a clergyman had to say about this matter. A certain Bishop Bradley said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I served in the Cape for 14 years and on commencing my work in Natal, I found a vast difference as regards the religious outlook of the people of these two provinces. I feel that the difference between Sunday in the Cape and Sunday in Natal is largely to blame for this.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those of our church who work with young people are struck by the fact that, in</block>

<p>Natal particularly, we are raising a pagan race. I fear for the future of our young people because in Natal so many young people have no Christian background or knowledge of the Bible.</p>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>No, you have had your chance. I should like to return to the remarks which the hon. member for Pinelands made earlier today in respect of this very Bill. I listened to the hon. member this afternoon and it almost seemed to me as if I was listening to a false prophet. I really wonder whether that hon. member and I still read the same Bible. This afternoon the hon. member addressed a request to the World Council of Churches. I think that he would feel at home in the ranks of that World Council.</p>

<p>During the past week we have heard a chorus from those benches to the effect that the local authorities should be allowed to control this type of legislation, to decide themselves what they want to do in this connection. In respect of this matter the hon. member for Pinetown was even prepared to bend his principles to such an extent as to remain true to his Christian conviction and duty in Pinetown, whereas here in Cape Town, for the sake of political expediency, he is prepared to vote against the Bill which affirms this principle. This is the height of equivocation, because after all, a principle remains a principle. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana, who is a senior frontbencher of the Herstigte United Party, moves this amendment, and this indicates precisely what the present position in Natal is. However, it is extremely unsatisfactory and, indeed, we have evidence that it does not work.</p>

<p>This is why the hon. the Minister is being inundated with appeals in this connection. In spite of the local ordinances which exist in Natal, they apparently do nothing to implement them. Let us see what a former town clerk of Durban, a Mr. Howes, said when a question was put to him while giving evidence before the Select Committee of 1964 in connection with this matter.</p>

He replied: &#x201C;The council maintains a police force to enforce its by-laws.&#x201D; In spite of this, however, they do nothing&#x2014;there has never been a prosecution which this man could remember. This is what is done in Durban at the moment.</p>

<p>This is just the point; this is how the hon. member does it. One wonders whether this is not the manner in which the hon. member wants to do it in the future too. Actually there is no control. The hon. member for Umbilo also referred to the question of uniform legislation in this connection. In support of his standpoint he quoted the evidence of a representative of, <i>inter alia,</i> the United Municipal Executive before the Select Committee of 1964, a committee of which he was a member. The section which he quoted, does indeed support his standpoint, but he did not read far enough because on the following page one finds that the following evidence is also given on behalf of that same organization&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present position as regards Sabbath-breaking is difficult, because every province has its own laws. It may be good if the matter could be dealt with on a national basis:</block>

<block name="quote">He went on to say&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">The responsibility should not be placed on the local authorities.</block>

<p>The hon. member therefore did not give the House the whole truth in this connection because he ought to be aware of this since he was a member of that Select Committee. I can go further and quote what another member of the same organization, a Mr.</p>

<p>Jooste, testified in this connection on pages 19 to 20 of the report. He said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not fair to place the onus on individual provinces to make regulations by means of ordinances in order to combat desecration of the Sabbath &#x2026; That is why it is not a matter which should be assigned to the provincial and local authorities so that they have to implement legislation to counteract desecration of the Sabbath. I think that it is a matter that is of importance to the whole of the Republic.</block>

<p>However, the hon. member goes on to quote the evidence given by the representatives of certain churches. He quoted it in support of his standpoint against the Bill. For example, he reads to us what the Very Rev. King, one representative of the Anglican Church, says in his evidence on page 89 of the report. However, once again the hon. member does not read far enough, because on page 90, the same Rev. King says <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This does not, however, mean that I am in favour of cinemas and shops being open on a Sunday, as this would make large numbers of people unable to attend church</block>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the testimony of people of the Church of England in South Africa, and simply dismissed them as people who had an extremist view on the matter. However, let us look at what these people said and also, who they are. On page XXVIII of this report among other things the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the undersigned, ministers of religion, respectfully call upon you to take whatever steps are necessary to move the Government of the Republic of South Africa to bring about uniformity in all the provinces with regard to Sunday observance laws.</block>

<p>This request is signed by 36 clergymen, <i>inter alia,</i> seven additional clergymen, i.e. Bishop R. C. Bradley, Bishop of the Church of England in South Africa, D. P. Myburgh, minister of the Duth Reformed Church, A. L. de Villiers, Moderator of the General Assembly <span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_0477"/>of the Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa and J. Poorter, President, Natal Baptist Association. The hon. member also refers to the standpoint of the D.R. Church in this connection, and once again quotes only what suits him. However, I shall quote what else was said in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We feel that it is undesirable that a law should be applicable only in three of the four provinces. We thus urge that, if the Bill is passed, it should be made uniformly applicable throughout the Republic.</block>

<p>Then, on page XXXIV of this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the Republic safeguards freedom of religion to its subjects and does not try to favour one faith above another, it is, as a servant of God, nevertheless called upon:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to honour the Sunday in its own province in affairs and activities of State;</li>

<li>(b) to protect the Christian day of rest by legislation so that it may not be desecrated;</li>

<li>(c) to enable its subjects to observe the Sunday properly.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">If the State were to allow business concerns, industries, factories and places of entertainment to carry on as usual on Sundays, it would be extremely difficult for the people to observe this day in accordance with Divine decree.</block>

<p>He also used the name of the Roman Catholic Church in this connection, and he said that they adopted a completely different standpoint. I now quote what the Roman Catholic Church says, <i>inter alia,</i> about this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State authorities in a country professedly Christian &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now the hon. member for Pinelands comes here today and tells us that there is no country or Government that is Christian. I think that he should go and speak to these learned clergymen about this matter.</p>

<p>To continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State has the duty and the right of maintaining a standard of public morality, i.e. the open observance of the ethical standards of living. But in this it must take the lead from the spiritual body, namely, in the South African circumstances, the churches.</block>

<p>However, the hon. member for Pinelands also just dragged up the matter of attendance at private schools. In this matter, however, we must listen to the church, because it is a matter which lies within the province of the church. Therefore it has nothing to do with the matter relating to schools which was dragged in here this afternoon. Furthermore, Dr. McCann, also of the Roman Catholic Church in South Africa, says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No cinema shows are held in the Republic on Sundays and I am extremely grateful for this because I feel that people should make their own entertainment on Sundays and not attend cinema shows.</block>

<p>This appears on page 70 of his evidence. These extracts which I am reading here, are the true evidence. They are not statements fabricated by politicians who see the matter differently and who are trying to work up a group of people so that they will vote for those politicians at the next election. This is the evidence of responsible churches, evidence of the representatives of the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church in this country, churches whose members number many millions. However, it is also the testimony of the Dutch Reformed Church and other Afrikaans churches whose White members, in 1964, already comprised 52,4% of the White population in South Africa. This <span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_0478"/>is the testimony of these people. The hon. member for Vereeniging also referred to this at the beginning of this debate.</p>

<p>When we consider this, and listen to the arguments of hon. members opposite, we are, after all, entitled to ask whether these people are the &#x201C;Holy Joes&#x201D; whom the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North mentioned in a mocking and derogatory manner. I wonder whether the people of his church know of his standpoint on these matters. I hope that someone will discuss this matter with him and ask him whether this is what he thinks of Christians of other faiths in this country. Judging by his obstreperous statements in this connection, I think that it is not only in the political sphere that he has lost his way. Or does it concern the <i>5%</i> to whom the hon. member for Sandton, who is not here this afternoon, referred&#x003F; Does it concern the high priests who want to prescribe and dictate to the people, or the minority to whom the hon. the Minister is now listening, the minority to whom the hon. member for Parktown referred&#x003F; After all, if this is their standpoint, they are uninformed. If they are not uninformed, then their behaviour borders on maliciousness in their attempts to get at the NP on a matter like this.</p>

<p>The standpoint which I put forward here, is the responsible standpoint of many millions of Christians in South Africa. I want to ask: Must the NP, the Government and the hon. the Minister simply ignore this and not take note of it&#x003F; It is my submission that should the hon. the Minister do so he would indeed be ignoring the standpoint of the majority of people in South Africa, and would therefore be guilty of not listening to the majority of people in South Africa.</p>

<p>Christians throughout South Africa cannot object to this legislation. Indeed, they will welcome it. A Christian will not see any infringement of his freedom of worship or privacy in this matter. To him the observance of the Sabbath is already a commandment which is not to be debated. It is quite unthinkable that people who allege that they are Christians and who pass as Christians, can make such a fuss and debate at such a fuss and debate at such length a commandment which we as Christians have had for a very long time. It is unthinkable that a person who professes to be a Christian, can stand up in this House and argue that we must not accept this Bill because it will make us ridiculous in the eyes of the world. I can think of nothing better with which to be ridiculous in the eyes of the world than this very type of legislation. We as Christians welcome this Bill and we want to give our very strong support to the hon. the Minister in this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to most of this debate. I think I have listened to practically all that has been said. The hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, quoted to us the opinion of various church leaders as expressed some 14 years ago when they gave evidence before a Select Committee of the House. Bearing those in mind as also the points of view of members of the House who have forsaken the pulpit for Parliament and now address us in the House, I come to the conclusion that in dealing with this particular subject matter here is so much conflict of opinion that it comes down in the end to the question of how Sunday is observed by the individual. That, I believe, is our concern in legislating. A person who wishes to use his Sunday in the classical sense, in the accepted Christian sense, should not be interfered with or impeded in conducting himself in that manner by the actions of other people. Only to the extent that the actions of other people interfere with his freedom to so conduct himself, should legislation be considered.</p>

<p>Sir, looking at the Bill before us, I can find no logical or acceptable reason for it, nor can I find the objective of this legislation. I realize that the hon. the Minister has been under pressure. I should imagine that he has been under pressure more from political angles than from church angles in regard to the introduction of this measure. The hon. the Minister admitted quite frankly&#x2014;in this he is correct&#x2014;that he did not see it as his duty to persuade people to go to church. He said further that he did not want to tell people what they should do on Sunday. <i>Per se,</i> the exhibiting and viewing of films on Sundays is obviously not an evil in itself. The hon. the Minister in this Bill provides for permits. He says that he will grant permits in general and in a particular place and in cases of a <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_0479"/>particular nature. Certain hon. members on this opposite side who have spoken in this debate&#x2014;I refer particularly to the hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. member for Meyerton&#x2014;spoke on this measure as though it were a prohibition on the showing of films in public or in public places. That is not what is in the Bill. This Bill as it stands is not restricted to the showing of films ih places of public entertainment, theatres or halls; it covers private clubs and it even covers the viewing of films in private homes in certain circumstances. I myself would be guilty of having gained admission to see a film for a consideration, either direct or indirect, if the hon. the Minister were to invite me to his home and say: &#x201C;Look, my friend, I will hire the projector and the film and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education will supply the snacks. You can come along and bring a few bottles of highland dew for our refreshment.&#x201D; If that were to be done on a Sabbath night, I would be viewing a film for a consideration, and we would be laying ourselves open to a fine of R1 500 for having done so. It certainly is ridiculous if we try to legislate in this way, but that is what is in this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>It is in the Bill. You are making your house a public place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a public place; you are laying yourself open to a fine by inviting a person and allowing him to see a film for a consideration. That is not a public place. A club is an association of people. In the sanctity of a licensed club with prohibited or restricted membership, the members will then be committing this heinous offence of exhibiting a film on a Sunday. Home movies are only going to be possible for those people who can afford to own, to buy or to hire a projector and who can afford to hire a film to show in their own homes. When once two families or three families club together to do that very act, they will contravene this law. That is surely not what the hon. the Minister has in mind, but nevertheless it is in the legislation before us. What this is going to mean is that the man who is affluent enough to own or hire a projector and hire films is going to have home movies, while the man who lives under poorer circumstances will not be able to have home movies unless he breaks the law. Surely, once a film has been passed by our Publications Board, there can be little objection to the showing of that film even on a Sunday evening.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why this legislation needs careful consideration. The first is that it is our duty, and I accept it is the duty of Parliament, not to allow freedoms which will restrict the activities of the Church. That is what the hon. the Minister said. Is it necessary to think for one moment whether the showing of films on a Sabbath is so restrictive to the activities of the Church that the banning must be for all day on every Sunday&#x003F; Surely, that is ridiculous in the extreme&#x003F; At most, it could be argued that films should not be shown in public places of entertainment during normal church hours. There is a case for that. That is something which has been adopted by local authorities. It has been applied in Natal and I am sure that the majority of local authorities would accept such an approach if they were entitled to make the regulations. They could do it quite simply because cinemas are places of public entertainment which have to be licensed by them and the municipalities can impose conditions that such places of entertainment shall not be open during certain hours on a Sunday. To achieve that, does not need this Bill.</p>

<p>Secondly, public Sunday film shows should not be a nuisance to or interfere with church activities on a Sunday. But are they&#x003F; Interference and disturbance in the physical sense depends on the local conditions pertaining to the locality of the cinema. In my own constituency I agree that the opening of a certain cinema is interferring with and is a nuisance to church-goers. I refer to the Three Anchor Bay Dutch Reformed Church, which is almost across the road from two cinemas. If those cinemas function during church hours on a Sunday evening, every parking place in the vicinity of the Dutch Reformed Church is taken up by cinemagoers. That can be stopped simply by not allowing any cinema shows during church hours.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to have the hon. the Minister put this matter to the test here in Cape Town. Let him test the local authority here and the proprietors of that theatre. They will cooperate, provided the hon. the Minister does not interfere to the extent he wishes to in terms of this Bill. The hon. the Minister gave a third reason. That was that we must not be seen to permit the Sabbath to be commercialized. Payment for admission to a cinema, I take it, is the commercial aspect referred to in this Bill, is it not the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, let us be responsible and logical. The public pays every Sabbath to go inside and use the facilities of a swimming-bath. They pay to enter game parks; they pay to visit restaurants where they sit and view television. They pay for a snack supper at a hotel and sit there all evening listening, as I too have to sometimes, to oompah bands and the like which play to young people who sit and listen. Those bands are also paid to play on Sunday evenings. What is more, the public at large can bum up litres and litres of petrol by aimlessly driving around looking for something to do but they will not be able to sit in a cinema if this Bill is to be passed. They cannot enjoy the recreation provided in a cinema.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thought I was perhaps a little bit unfair to the hon. the Minister, but I was interested to read in <i>Die Burger</i> of Saturday in &#x201C;Van Alle Kante&#x201D;, quite a reasonable statement of the situation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Vir die meeste van ons is die rus van &#x2019;n Sondag te vinde in di&#x00E9; dinge wat ontspanning bied. En dit beteken nie noodwendig tuisbly nie. Daar is mense vir wie fliek ontspannend is. Daar is ook werknemers wat op geen ander dag &#x2019;n fliek kan bywoon nie&#x2014;koerantmense byvoorbeeld!</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Mens moet diep gaan grawe om kwaad te sien in die vertoning van &#x2019;n rolprent op Sondag&#x2014;hetsy tuis, by &#x2019;n klub, of by &#x2019;n oop vertoning. Dis asof &#x2019;n mens weer kind is en sin moet maak uit ma se vermaning dat jy op Sondae net &#x201C;klassieke&#x201D; boeke mag lees.</block>

<p>That is the attitude this hon. Minister wishes this House to adopt. For that he is asking us to legislate.</p>

<p>We object to this &#x201C;exemption by permit&#x201D; law which we again have before us. There can be no norm laid down as to how the hon. the Minister is going to determine those permits. Let us assume for one moment the practicability of the whole scheme. The hon. the Minister says he is quite happy to grant a permit so that Jewish people may attend a cinema at a set time on Sunday evenings. Now, who is going to sit there and check that everybody who comes in is in fact Jewish&#x003F; The result is going to be <i>ad hoc</i> decisions. I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to the words of anguish of his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Community Development, on the question of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions when it comes to the question of the admission of audiences to theatres. This is what his colleague said last year (Hansard, 1976, col. 10240)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to assure the hon. members that the Government adopts a sympathetic approach to this question and does not want to stop people from doing this, nor does it want to begrudge them opportunities of cultural value.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In practice the application of this policy has caused major problems. The problems arose from the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the administration. The hon. member for Green Point put it very well, viz. that for virtually every case an <i>ad hoc</i> decision is taken and the merits of each case is considered in detail. People then tend, as soon as such an <span class="col_927-928" refersTo="page_0481"/><i>ad hoc</i> decision has been taken, to say that a precedent has been created &#x2026; I find it exceptionally difficult to administer these measures on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;this was eight months ago&#x2014;that a Cabinet Committee had been appointed to see whether the application of the policy could be made more streamlined and where clearly set out principles could be laid down. We have waited for eight months and there is no streamlined principle because it is quite impossible of being determined. However, that is the right which this hon. Minister is asking us to give him in terms of this legislation: A right to administer the law by permits, by exemptions.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>If you want me to take it out of the Bill, I will do that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister cannot take it out of the Bill, because he himself accepts that the showing of films on the Sabbath is not evil in itself; it only becomes evil when it impedes other persons&#x2019; freedom, when it impedes or becomes a nuisance to those who wish to observe the Sabbath in a particular way. We on this side of the House say, however, that it is for the local community to decide what does or does not impede.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of Sunday observance. When one considers the facts to their fullest extent, one comes to the conclusion that Sunday observance does not exclude recreation. I think we must also not forget that Christian charity itself requires consideration by us of the beliefs and the circumstances of all South Africans as a people, individually and collectively. I know that in terms of our Constitution and our individual conviction we acknowledge the sovereignty and the guidance of Almighty God. As a Parliament and in practice we have in our laws regulated the affairs of the country according to the norms and customs of the Christian faith and thus we have in our calendar our Sundays and our other holidays in so far as we Christians are concerned. However, there are thousands upon thousands of our fellow South Africans who accept the sovereignty and the guidance of Almighty God and who do so with a deep sincerity, but who are not Christians. They are devout believers, but they have other holidays on their religious calendar. Even after 2 000 years of existence the Christian Church has no uniformity in regard to aspects of the practice of the Christian religion in all its aspects. The practices vary from religion to religion. They accept and respect the Sabbath, but they differ widely in respect of the personal conduct which is essentially necessary to live out the basic acceptance and belief of the sovereignty and guidance of Almighty God and the Christian practice. The depth of man&#x2019;s sincerity in these matters is the quality of his conduct viewed from the Christian aspect and is not something which can be laid down by laws made by this Parliament. Diversity has to be accommodated and the diversity of the approaches to the Sabbath cannot be accommodated by way of permits being issued under a Bill of this nature. This is the problem which will always come up and with which Parliament will always be confronted when it begins to regulate, by law, moral and religious aspects of our daily life.</p>

<p>As I have said, the first reason for our opposition to this Bill is that there must be a physical, factual interference in the freedom of other persons to conduct their Sabbath in the way in which they wish to conduct it. I now want to leave this aspect, because I believe I have made my attitude quite clear. As I have said, I believe that with the divergence of approach in the various Christian denominations as to what one should or should not do on the Sabbath, the State cannot legislate on the matter. It is a matter for the personal conscience and conviction of the individual South African concerned. On the other hand, individuals must not be interfered with as the result of the noise or nuisance caused by other persons.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to another aspect of this question. I want to ask the hon. the Minister also to give consideration to certain other matters. The hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that after the introduction of television and the showing of full-length feature films on television on Saturday nights, the cinema industry in this country found that it was having a difficult time in securing the patronage it had before over the weekend. They then commenced the showing of films late on Saturday nights. Many of them started showing films at 11 p.m. on a Saturday so <span class="col_931-932" refersTo="page_0483"/>that people could watch the TV film early and then go on to watch cinema films. Some of these cinema films, which run for two hours or more, intrude into the early hours of the Sabbath morning. I cannot see that there is any grave evil in this, and I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to bear this aspect of the matter in mind.</p>

<p>There is also the matter of the drive-in cinemas, which, in the summer months, usually commence at about 9 p.m. They usually have one programme which could very easily spill over the midnight hour for approximately half an hour. As a matter of fact, it frequently happens. This will be contravening the law if it were to happen. The hon. the Minister could consider these matters on the basis of permits at least so that they could be in general and so that every cinema could know exactly where it stood in connection with these shows that might spill over into the Sabbath morning.</p>

<p>I have raised these matters with the hon. the Minister because these are aspects which crop up if we have to legislate about matters of this kind and if we are to have laws of this kind. The hon. the Minister says that he does not want to tell people what they should do on Sundays, that he does not want to make people go to church. I can assure the hon. the Minister that this Bill is going to stop people from doing what they want to do by way of recreation on a Sunday and will have a direct and a disadvantageous result in so far as church-going is concerned. Legislation of this kind will not make one additional person enter a church on a Sunday night if they would not have done so before.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana asking that the organization and control of the exhibition of films on Sundays and public holidays be left in the hands of local authorities. I just want to say briefly why I adopt this standpoint. I do not believe that the majority of the people in this country would like to see Sunday become even more commercialized than is necessary under the modern circumstances of today. I personally am in favour of preserving the tranquillity of Sundays to the greatest possible extent; and it would be very unfortunate if Sunday in our country were ever to develop into just another ordinary day. Perhaps it is the influence of the traditions of one&#x2019;s home. Most people grow up with certain habits and traditions and, happily, a good tradition does not die easily, even in the most unfavourable conditions.</p>

<p>I myself see little danger of our Sunday degenerating into an ordinary day. My reasons for not believing that this will happen are not only religious but also social. Over the years, the tendency in our country has always been towards shorter working hours, more rest and more days of rest for the worker. This is my problem in regard to this Bill which the hon. the Minister has introduced. I cannot understand what the problem is that the hon. the Minister wants to solve by way of this Bill. If such a problem really exists, then I cannot agree with the way in which he is tackling its solution. It is my considered opinion that the hon. the Minister is going to create more problems with this Bill than he is going to solve. There is already a certain degree of commercialization of Sunday; we all know this. The major factor contributing towards the existing measure of commercialization of Sunday does not lie in the private sector but in the public sector: the Government sector with its air services, its transport services, its postal and telephonic services, its radio and television services, its licensed hotels and many other things which I could enumerate. It is true that in recent years the private sector has seen an increase in the number of delicatessens open&#x2014;city dwellers know about these&#x2014;as well as bookshops, restaurants, caf&#x00E9;s, pharmacies and even spares departments of garages, and one must expect this to increase still further in the future. In the urban areas in particular, Sunday has long been an important day for sport, and it is no use saying that there is not an element of commercialization involved in this because at the innumerable clubs and holiday resorts where people take part in sport, they have to pay very high prices for membership of their clubs.</p>

<p>Had the hon. the Minister, therefore, come to this House with a wide-ranging Bill aimed at keeping in check the existing commercialization of Sundays&#x2014;not excluding the Government sector&#x2014;he would at least have had a case to which we could have listened with interest, and we could have seen whether it was possible to help him. What have we now been presented with however&#x003F; The hon. the <span class="col_933-934" refersTo="page_0484"/>Minister chooses one of the factors, namely film shows, which contributes least to the commercialization or the disturbance of Sunday. It is a factor with very little growth potential. It was, in fact, the cinemas which suffered most from the advent of television. Many have already closed down, others are becoming progressively emptier and there is already a tendency to build smaller cinemas. Surely we know full well that as television develops, expands and increases its number of channels, and as the programmes improve, the tendency to go to the cinema will not increase, but rather decrease, even more so on Sundays than on other days, because as matters stand at present, due to the South African climate, for most people in the big cities Sunday is a day for outdoor recreation, a day for driving around. The result is that it is only a small percentage of working people that also goes out on a Sunday evening to sit in a cinema. Where film shows do take place in the Christian community, church services are for the most part respected. Shows normally begin after the church services, as is the case with symphony and other concerts in Cape Town and in other cities.</p>

<p>Your facts are completely incorrect.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I said in most cases, and in any event, this matter could easily be arranged without further far-reaching interference. Consequently I really cannot understand why, in view of the strictness of the existing legislation regarding the Sunday observance, it was necessary for the hon. the Minister to come forward with a limited Bill of this nature, one which cracks down on a factor which constitutes one of the least serious dangers in respect of the further commercialization of Sunday.</p>

<p>Our country is far from being the most Christian, or&#x2014;perhaps I should rather put it this way&#x2014;the most church-conscious country in the Christian world, yet despite this, as a result of the existing legislation on Sunday observance, we have, in comparison with other countries&#x2014;I want to emphasize in comparison with other countries&#x2014;one of the most peaceful Sundays in the Christian world, as far as my experience goes. Nowhere else is it more dead on a Sunday than here in our country. I am not bemoaning this; I merely state it as a fact. Our smaller towns, and even larger towns such as Paarl, Stellenbosch and Potchefstroom&#x2014;every one is like a graveyard on a Sunday. This is also the case in even the centre of Johannesburg and all its suburbs. Those areas are absolutely dead on a Sunday. It is true that there are traffic jams on the roads but in Johannesburg it is only in Hillbrow, one small spot in the whole of Johannesburg, where there is a little public life on Sunday evenings.</p>

<p>That is my reason for saying that I do not really know what the big problem is which the hon. the Minister is trying to solve. What I can see, however, is that the hon. the Minister is quite certainly creating new problems for himself, the hon. the Minister said that he had received representations which led to the introduction of the legislation. I know that the hon. the Minister has received representations but he has not presented us with a complete list of the people involved, nor will he do so. Will the hon. the Minister do so&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister would submit them to the House because I am sure, and this is my opinion, that were he to do so, it would very soon become clear how unrepresentative those representations are when the whole South African population is taken into account. If this is not so however, then surely it is his duty on such an occasion to submit to Parliament the full range of the representations. Surely no one who has made representations will be embarrassed if it becomes known that he has made representations in respect of a matter of this nature. After all, we are public representatives. I concede that it is the duty of the Government, when it receives representations from any quarter, to heed them and to consider them. However, it is just as much the Government&#x2019;s duty to test representations it receives from certain quarters against the full extent of the problem and particularly, not to apply double standards. If a Government representative is asked by certain churches to take action against film shows on Sundays, and we have been told here that because certain churches spoke out, <span class="col_935-936" refersTo="page_0485"/>he had to heed them, then he must apply the same standards in all cases if he want us to accept his <i>bona fides.</i> Then he and his Government must not come along the next day, when the Roman Catholic Church or the Anglican Church and other churches want to open their private denominational schools to all population groups, and apply a different standard, and say that he will not hear of it and threaten to close the schools.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the issue. They made a request at an earlier stage and the Government refused it. My point is that if members come here and say that there were representations from certain churches and that for that reason they must be heeded, then double standards surely can not be applied. Then one must heed all the representations of all the churches. [Interjections.] I repeat, if one must heed the voice of the churches, then one must give heed in all cases to all of them. The hon. member for Meyert&#x00F6;n also suggested that one has to give heed to the church. I just wonder whether he is prepared to heed the representations made by all of them, the hon. the Minister has indicated that he has no objection in principle to film shows on Sunday and that he will grant exemption where he deems it necessary. However, this is one of the major objections I have against this Bill. Here is a prime example of what one could call legislation with a &#x201C;but&#x201D;. Let us look at the Bill. It is a Bill which is to become law, but it is not legislation which is applicable to everyone. It is legislation with a &#x201C;but&#x201D;. It states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall exhibit any film on any Sunday &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then comes the &#x201C;but&#x201D;. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Justice or any officer of the Department of Justice acting under his authority (may) consent thereto &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, in essence, this Bill indicates that: I, the Minister, will from now on decide who may go to the movies on a Sunday in South Africa.</p>

<p>One politician, he alone, can invalidate the whole act. I quote from the bill: He can grant permission &#x201C;in general or in a particular case or in cases of a particular nature.&#x201D; It is a piece of political arrogance of the worst kind. He as Minister will become the great controller of the country&#x2019;s affairs in the sphere of Sunday films. And if, therefore, there is a cinema open on a Sunday, then we can assume that it is Jimmy&#x2019;s &#x201C;pal&#x201D;. If I understood the hon. the Minister correctly when he replied to an interjection, he mentioned people of Greek descent as an example of people to whom he would grant exemption. There was the issue of some people who spoke other European languages and were unable to attend cinemas during the week and who had therefore to make use of Sundays. Allow me to say at once that I regard it as a completely wrong principle for the Government to subject yet another part of citizens&#x2019; private lives to authoritarian power which it can apply arbitrarily. The hon. the Minister may favour whomsoever he wishes. This is what is stated in this Bill. It will inevitably lead to political pressure upon him and to favouritism on his part, apart from the fact that it must also lead to an expansion of bureaucracy&#x2014;the last thing we can afford these days. After all, we know that every law must be administered. This takes time and the taxpayer&#x2019;s money. It requires officials, there is a lot of paper work and so forth.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>But time is money. It will entail a lot of paper work. It will create additional work and if there is extra work there have to be more officials to cope with it. With every Act put on the Statute Book, the bureaucracy has to be enlarged. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister realizes that if, for example, he were to agree to the exhibition of films on Sundays by Greek-speaking South Africans and if he were to grant exemption for this, he would have a problem in regard to the Germans&#x002D;peaking people. There are 40 000 Germanspeaking people in Johannesburg. There are also considerably more than 100 000 Portuguese. Then, too, there are thousands of Italians and thousands of Dutch, many of whom still speak their own language. Thus there is a whole variety of language groups amongst South Africans. Where will the hon. the Minister draw the line&#x003F; Where is he going to end his discrimination between one group of South Africans who may attend film shows and another group who may not do so&#x003F; If he grants exemption to such a group of people, is he going to prevent the films which they show from having English or Afrikaans subtitles&#x003F; Is he going to prevent the films which a certain group is showing with his approval from being accessible to South Africans who belong to a different language group&#x003F; If so, how is he going to enforce this&#x003F; Is he going to shoulder the Police with new responsibilities&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is yet another aspect of this Bill which I want to refer to. According to its own stated policy this Government has undertaken to decentralize, and is presumably in the process of decentralizing, the powers and the control over the lives of people in the different population groups. They are using all sorts of nice phrases. They talk about self-determination, separate freedoms and, in the case of Indians and Coloureds, of domestic self-determination. But in this instance they are acting in direct conflict with their own policy. What the hon. the Minister is doing here, is concentrating absolute power in the hands of the White administration in South Africa in regard to an intimate matter like the showing of films and recreation on Sundays. He wants to have full control over this, not only over provinces and local authorities, but also over Coloureds, Indians and other population groups. I want to ask the Minister pointedly whether he is going to make any exceptions with respect to population groups other than Whites, population groups to whom he and the Government have promised self-determination in their own affairs. I hope that the hon. the Minister will answer us on that score. Is he going to do so&#x003F;</p>

<p>Just wait.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I see that the hon. the Minister does not care to do so at the moment. He is probably tired by this time. Nevertheless, this is an important matter. The Government&#x2019;s policy is that every population group must arrange its own intimate affairs leaving the Black man out of the argument for the moment, will the hon. the Minister permit exceptions in the case of the Indians and the Coloureds or&#x2014;this is the alternative&#x2014;is he going to apply White authority at the level of cultural, religious and social affairs, as contained in this Bill, to the Coloureds and Indians&#x003F; Is he going to maintain this White authority over the other population groups in regard to a matter such as this, or is the Government going to give other population groups the power to decide for themselves, at their own administrative level how they want to handle a matter of this kind&#x003F; This is a question to which we must know the answer because this bill is in total conflict with the declared standpoint of the Government. I want to ask: If the hon. the Minister and the Government are really in earnest in wanting to give the Coloured and Indian populations full domestic self-control over matters of this nature, what will prevent cinemas in Coloured and Indian areas adjacent to and among White areas from being frequented on Sundays by Whites, if the Coloureds and Indians want to admit them&#x003F; Even as the bill reads now, ways will be found of getting around it. I am absolutely sure that it is only a question of time before the hon. the Minister introduces amending legislation to patch it up further. To be specific, the Minister will have to start making exceptions himself. As soon as this legislation is placed in the Statute Book, he will have to make exceptions and grant exemption.</p>

<p>It is therefore our standpoint on this side of <span class="col_939-940" refersTo="page_0487"/>the House that the sensible thing for the Government to do would be not to draw towards the White political centre even more powers than the Government already has over all population groups; this is an incorrect principle, particularly in that it concerns powers in respect of matters intimate to a people, about which different population groups and people in different parts of the country think and feel differently. Authority in respect of matters of this nature ought to be decentralized, not only to the various population groups, but also to local authorities. Existing powers concerning matters of this nature ought at least not to be taken away from the local or provincial authorities because we know full well that the different parts of the country have differing views on matters of this nature. It is not only the Opposition which feels this way. I found it interesting that when the hon. the Minister failed to proceed with the bill last year, one of the mouthpieces of his own party&#x2014; <i>Rapport</i>&#x2014;adopted this standpoint&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons hoop die reses sal geleentheid bring vir samesprekings en &#x2019;n vergelyk tussen die Minister en provinsiale owerhede sodat hierdie sake op meer plaaslike vlak gere&#x00EB;l kan word.</block>

<p>If I heard rightly, Israel was mentioned a few times in this debate. Israel was put forward as a country in which strict views on the Sabbath are upheld. This is true in so far as it concerns the Jews of Israel. Israel prides itself on the fact that it is a multi-national country&#x2014;&#x201C;a pluralist society&#x201D;&#x2014;in which there is complete freedom of culture for the different population groups. I have here an official publication by its information service and I find it interesting that Israel was twice used as an example by speakers on the opposite side. In regard to its pluralist society the publication states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Israel has regained its independence to become a homeland for the Jewish people. The majority of its population are Jews. Nevertheless it is a pluralist society where different cultures and social traditions coexist.</block>

<p>It then lists the communities in Israel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jews 85,1%; Moslems 11,2%; Christians 2,4%, and Druzes and others 1,3%.</block>

<p>They then go on to explain in the section on the Sabbath and business hours&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jewish shops, offices and places of entertainment are closed on Saturday and Jewish religious and national holidays. The Jewish Sabbath starts at sundown on Friday and ends at nightfall on Saturday. Transport services resume, and some shops and all places of entertainment open again at nightfall on Saturday. Moslem and Christian establishments close on Friday and Sunday respectively.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am mentioning it because it was presented as an example by your side. Here we have the implementation of the concept of multinational control. They give effect to their pluralism. There is scope for every cultural group or religious denomination to make its own arrangements about matters of intimate concern to each, and each respects the customs and views of the other. In this country the Government talks about multinationalism and a pluralist society, but in practice we find that wherever local choice exists it is invariably smothered and that people are governed and ordered around arbitrarily from an office in Pretoria, according to the whim of a Minister or an official appointed by him. I am glad that a man like Dr. Wimpie de Klerk supports the correct standpoint. He is editor of <i>Die Transvaler,</i> an official publication of the NP. He wrote last year&#x2014;&#x201C;Die veelvolkigheid raak ook beleid oor Sondae.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;Handhaaf die Sondag en beheer dit, in sover die Staat beheerreg en beheerplig het, maar dan sonder &#x2019;n wettiese oorentoesiasme wat gewetensvryheid aantas &#x2026; Motiveer die mense om Sondagaande kerk toe te gaan en ontwikkel hul spiere om self die televisieknoppie af te draai.&#x201D; This is the standpoint which he adopts.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Opposition would be neglecting its duty if it were not to voice its strongest <span class="col_941-942" refersTo="page_0488"/>opposition to this increasing tendency on the part of the Government to try and control everything in an arbitrary and authoritarion fashion.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in his carefully documented speech the hon. member for Verwoerdburg quoted from the Select Committee report on Sunday observance, a Select Committee of 1964. He made reference to the Church of England. I think he equated it with the Anglican Church. In view of any misunderstanding which may exist, I wish to make the matter quite clear in this respect. If one refers to the figures given&#x2014; which I will refer to again later&#x2014;of adherents of various churches, we find that the Anglicans are sub-divided among the Church of the Province of S.A., Anglicans and the Church of England. May I say that, to the best of my knowledge, the Church of England represents a very small proportion of the total number of members of the Anglican Church as such. For the benefit of the hon. member for Verwoerdburg, as well as the hon. member for Klip River who seems to be particularly interested, I want to quote from the evidence given before that Committee by Bishop R. Cowdry, who was the main witness of the Church of the Province when evidence was given before the Select Committee in 1964. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to make it quite clear that our Church dissociates itself entirely from the views and suggestions put to this Committee by Bishop S. C. Bradley of the Church of England in South Africa in his memorandum. We do not agree with any of the views expressed in his memorandum, and we disapprove especially of the last paragraph.</block>

<p>I believe, Mr. Speaker, the last paragraph referred to imprisonment without the option of a fine. Bishop Cowdrey continued:</p>

<block name="quote">I make this point quite clear because the Archdeacon of Durban, the Venerable H. Lawrence, was one of the signatories to the memorandum of the Church of England in South Africa, and also to a petition to the Administrator of Natal. Archdeacon Lawrence has since written a letter to the Lord Bishop of Natal stating that he withdraws his support of the petition of the Church of England in South Africa.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister has referred to representations which have been made to him. Mr. Speaker, when I was very young, I can remember that the daily train from Natal to the Orange Free State, which left every evening, did not run on a Saturday evening because it was customary, for passenger traffic at least, to be restricted through the Orange Free State on Sundays. I believe there was a general restriction in the Orange Free State on train traffic. However, times have changed, but I believe if all the other provinces had adopted the same practice of personal option in this particular respect, the traffic in South Africa would have been severely curtailed &#x2026; [Interjections.] Now, we have the other situation where three provinces since the end of the last century have experienced certain restrictions in regard to Sunday observance. Natal, on the other hand, has had a fairly open system, and we find the hon. the Minister saying that he has had many representations. I would like to refer briefly to the evidence that was given before the committee in 1964. I am referring to the evidence given by Mr. W. L. Howes, the then town clerk of Durban, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have been Town Clerk of Durban for mere than 12 years. I have been in a high position in the service of the Durban City Council for 26 years. During that time I have not heard of a protest from any of the churches or any other organized body on the matter of Sunday observance in Durban, addressed to the city council.</block>

<p>I think that the time has come when we should raise the federal standard in South Africa and lower the double standards under which we have become accustomed to living for many years. Let me refer to some of the double standards which have been and which are accepted as our pattern of life nowadays. There is the question of double standards in regard to this Bill. It is claimed&#x2014;not in the terms of the Bill, but it is claimed&#x2014;and it is directed at assisting the churches and helping them to preserve the Sabbath. But what is the Government doing in the various provinces, with the exception of Natal&#x003F; It is busy hampering the churches themselves, as the <span class="col_943-944" refersTo="page_0489"/>hon. member for Pinelands indicated, in their efforts to carry out their Christian belief and concept in the admission to church schools of pupils of other races; they are acting in accordance with their own Christian concept.</p>

<p>We have this Bill providing for no films on Sunday, but there will be exceptions, there will be prescribed conditions. We have no sport broadcasts on Sunday and sports results are restricted to a minimum, but we have commercial Springbok Radio and advertisements on regional SABC programmes. We have no lottery, because a lottery is illegal, but we have horse racing, one of the major industries, almost, in South Africa, which is legal. Are those not double standards&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have the differentiation between the lower and the higher income groups. The hon. member for Green Point referred to it, but let me quote a more specific case. Take a man who has a group of friends, who is in an upper income group and who can therefore afford to go along on a Saturday afternoon, hire a projector and a film and tell five or six of his friends with their families to come to his house where he will give a film show. There will be no charge, and they will have tea and see the film and all will be in order. One of his friends will show a film the next Sunday and someone else will do so the following Sunday. This will mean that, because they are in a higher income group and can afford to do these things without having to have a collection, it is possible to hold a film show every Sunday without even seeking a permit. However, people in the lower income group are not able to avail themselves of that particular position. Firstly, they are not able to afford the extra expenditure of hiring the film on a Saturday. Secondly, they might wish to combine their more frugal resources and decide to get together and have a film show by hiring a film and by pooling together to pay for it. In this way they can afford to see it.</p>

<p>There is another example of discrimination, the SATV. The rich man can watch his TV in his own home, but the poor person cannot afford a TV set and cannot afford the R36 a year licence. He is prohibited now, in terms of this Bill, from subscribing to an innocent little film club which might provide that person with entertainment on a Sunday. If that is not double standards, then I just do not know what is.</p>

<p>The prohibition is, in the Minister&#x2019;s own words, &#x201C;by virtue of any contribution to any fund&#x201D;, so it rules out the poor man in the instances which I have quoted. The Minister referred to what he called a &#x201C;groot aantal verto&#x00EB;&#x201D;. I read his Second Reading speech very carefully, but I must say I remain unconvinced of the validity of his claims, because he did not give any, in my opinion, specific instances or figures which convince me or this House that his claims are fully justified. But you see, Sir, we live in an atmosphere of much confusion. The hon. member for Pretoria East, for instance, was reported by the SABC as saying that as far as he was concerned, both English and Afrikaans speaking South Africans were overwhelmingly in favour of the Bill. In contrast we have the hon. member for Parktown, who said that it was rejected by the majority of the population. Who is right, the hon. the Minister, the hon. member for Pretoria East or the hon. member for Parktown&#x003F; Again, according to the SABC report, we have the hon. member for Klerksdorp who said that the Bill did not remove the rights of the individual; people could still view films of their own choice in their own homes, and in certain instances the Minister would grant permission for a film to be exhibited.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Tedious repetition&#x003F; Well, I wish it would sink in so that you would change your mind. I hope that the hon. the Minister will in his reply give this side of the House some facts and figures which will substantiate the claims he made in his Second Reading. I want to refer to some actual figures&#x2014;I take the amended census figures&#x2014;which give the number of people who claim to be Christians as 21,7 million. 3,6 million are adherents of the Dutch Reformed Churches. 1,7 million of the Anglican Church&#x2014;I have explained the breakdown of the three different names or designations given to the Anglican Church&#x2014;2,3 million are Methodists&#x2014;and the hon. member for Pinelands indicated that they represent a cross-section of all population groups&#x2014;and 1,9 million are Roman Catholic. We therefore have a group of people professing to belong to churches, numbering almost 6 million, who in my opinion have not indicated in any <span class="col_945-946" refersTo="page_0490"/>positive way that this Bill is repugnant to them. We also have the position of the Indian Christians. According to the year-book 10% of the Indian population accepts Christianity, so it means that of the approximately 600 000 Indians in Natal, a very small proportion would be concerned by the implications and the effects of this Bill on Sunday entertainments, because 68% of the Indian population is Hindu and 20% Moslem. There are, furthermore, more than half a million people who are classified as &#x201C;other Christians&#x201D;. Nearly 15 000 of these people are Seventh-Day Adventists who have their Sabbath on a Saturday. If the hon. the Minister would care to read a very good book, which is in the library, on the difficulties which Seventh-Day Adventists were forced to accept when they were fighting or occupying non-combatant positions in Vietnam, he would realize that Seventh-Day Adventists take their religion very seriously. I believe that they do a great deal of missionary work in South Africa for all races and all religions but keep Saturday as their Sabbath.</p>

<p>Has the hon. the Minister asked Chief Buthelezi, who represents plus-minus 4 million people, mostly in Natal, what he feels about Sunday observance&#x003F; Has the hon. the Minister consulted the Indian Council and has he had an expression of opinion from them, because the Indian Council is alleged to represent a large proportion of Indians in South Africa&#x003F; I believe that we are giving the power in this Bill for the further imposition of bureaucracy from the citadel of conservatism, in Pretoria.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to sit down, as that hon. member requests. I wish to put the matter into perspective. I wish to quote from the report again. This is the comment of the Roman Catholic Church, which is published in the appendix, chapter 13. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A South African Sunday as generally practised, is greatly to be commended and as a practical pattern can hardly be improved upon.</block>

<p>It is a reasonable and humane application of the Commandments and it is in keeping with the injunction of our Lord Jesus Christ: &#x201C;The Sabbath is made for man and not man for the Sabbath. &#x201D;</p>

<p>To put the matter quite clearly in so far as my own church, the Church of the Province of South Africa, is concerned, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South referred to the opinion expressed by a leading member from Natal. It was Bishop Russell, who had telephoned me to indicate his views. As I understood them they are the same as those of the Archbishop of Cape Town, head of the Church of the Province. I received this communication on Friday from the most Rev. Bill Burnett and this is what he said under the heading &#x201C;Bill on Prohibition of Films on Sunday&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) I do not think as a Christian that we need to have films on Sunday and would prefer to do without.</li>

<li>(2) On the other hand, in an urban society where perhaps a majority are not churchgoers, everyone cannot relax on golf courses and country clubs or beaches. People might be much worse occupied than seeing films.</li>

<li>(3) Sunday is a day of celebration for Christians. It is a celebration of the resurrection. It is not really the Sabbath, that would be Friday. It should nevertheless be a day which Christians give to God for His use and as a sign that all life belongs to Him. But I find it difficult to require non-Christians to observe Sundays with the same love for God and commitment as Christians and to restrict their chosen activities if these are not morally harmful to the community. It is foolish, I think, to stop people fishing on Sundays. It would be equally foolish to stop people seeing a film unless it is a morally undesirable film. After all, Moslems and Jews have to celebrate their weekly Sabbath on an ordinary working day.</li>

<li>(4) I would like to protect those who would be obliged to work in the cinemas on Sunday. The staff on Sunday should not be the same as for the rest of the week, so that those who work in the cinemas during the week would not face the possibility of not getting a job if they were unable, for <span class="col_947-948" refersTo="page_0491"/>reasons of conscience, to work on Sundays. It may not, of course, be possible to legislate for this, but that is how I would like to see it.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. the Minister may have his sources of information, but I do not believe that they are of the broad spectrum as put forward by this side of the House, and if he is not prepared to accept the amendment which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has moved, I suggest with due respect, that he withdraws this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apparently this was a debate which was unnecessary, but I do not think there is anyone in this House who can accuse me of not having been busy these past few months with major events in South Africa. Whether I did it well or did it badly, I leave to the judgment of the people around me. I acted to the best of my ability as far as the major events of South Africa are concerned. Many hon. members expressed the opinion that this Bill is not necessary. Apparently this is so, and at one stage I felt the same way, but then why did I get so much opposition in this House if it was supposedly such an unnecessary and such a petty little Bill&#x003F; We cannot simply look after the major events in South Africa and neglect the small item, which may also be really essential. We are living in a very interesting time in our history, a time of onslaughts on South Africa from outside, subversion from within, and onslaughts on the spirit of South Africa. It is good to hear all these debating points, and I found it interesting to listen to the various arguments, for the time is coming when we shall have to determine where we stand spiritually in respect of these matters, and what the motivation for them is. The hon. gentlemen are entirely correct if they ask me for a principle which may be carried all the way through. I shall now try to explain this to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to what everyone said, and there was almost no speaker who did not say that it is traditional in South Africa that we keep the Sunday as quietly as possible. There was no one who told me that there may not be any church on Sunday or that there should be church on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It is traditional that the churches use Sundays only for church services. I want to put it to hon. members as a fact that in the past few years those two characteristics of our Sundays have become debased, far more than this Bill indicates. I shall deal later with the question of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout who asked why the legislation should relate only to the film industry if there are so many other things. There are many other factors, but Sundays have become debased, and we are on the slippery slope as far as Sundays are concerned. It has become so bad that one may walk into a shop on a Sunday and buy more than just a tin of milk. Hon. members will recall that the principle on which trade on Sunday rested previously was the fact that the commodity purchased had to be an essential item, for example a dummy, a tin of milk, bread and butter. That was the end of it, however, and one could buy nothing further, so that the people could rest on a Sunday. However, that principle no longer applies; another principle has now been laid down. Hon. members can go and see for themselves, and walk around in the cities, in Durban, Johannesburg and all over, and see what is being sold. One can buy just about any article in a shop on a Sunday. The shops began to open on a Sunday, and it was only the trade union which slammed the doors of the shops closed and which applied restraints to the shops. Yesterday the trade union issued another statement and said that the shops would not open. The trade union is applying restraints therefore, but we are lifting them. We are simply allowing them to open so that the people may buy clothing, shoes, may buy anything, so that commercialization can take place and these people can make money. We can forget about the church and restfulness.</p>

<p>It is quite correct and I agree with the hon. members that the amusement parks, for example the merry-go-rounds, the big-wheels, little wheels and all the other wheels continue to operate on a Sunday. The people amuse themselves, and the restfulness of Sunday is no more. Then the bioscopes came along and sought the most sensitive time to take us further down that slippery slope. They chose the time between 5 and 11 p.m. which coincides exactly with the times during which the churches still have their doors open. I want to reiterate that I am not there to fill the <span class="col_949-950" refersTo="page_0492"/>churches; the churches are quite capable of doing that themselves. I, as legislator, can see, however, that the traditional restfulness of the Sunday is disappearing. Some people have now come along and are occupying the church time in a way of which not even the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is aware. There is almost no cinema in Cape Town which is not open on a Sunday evening from 5 p.m. right through to 11 p.m. The same applies to the cinemas in Durban and Johannesburg, as well as to all the drive-in cinemas.</p>

<p>In Durban of course not. The Durban cinemas are going to circumvent the law by means of the clubs. The cinemas are already circumventing the Transvaal provincial ordinances by means of the clubs, and they are circumventing the Cape ordinances by means of the clubs. They even advertise their shows. Here it is stated in the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> These are the clubs which have now been established. <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> advertises under &#x201C;Sunday cinemas&#x201D;: In the Ster in Orange Grove &#x201C;The Owl and the Pussycat&#x201D; starring Barbra Streisand, is showing. Children from 4 to 21 are not allowed. Here the film &#x201C;A Fistful of Dollars&#x201D;, and I do not know what else, is showing on a Sunday. Here I have all the advertisements. There is not a single cinema in those big cities which is not open. [Interjections.] They came just at the time when the Government realized that the restfulness of our Sunday was being removed from beneath our feet and said: &#x201C;So far and no further; cinemas will have to close on a Sunday.&#x201D; We shall now have to provide the provincial authorities with guidance, for they are completely confused, and I shall prove this. Unfortunately this is the task of my department, although there are people who dispute this. There are hon. members here who, a few years ago, served on a Select Committee on Sunday sport. Then the United Party did not complain. Then the Department of Justice was the right department. They served on the Select Committee. Then nobody asked what that department was doing there. It is the task of my department. The point I want to make here, however, is that it is the work of my department which is being disputed here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that I, Minister Kruger, wanted more power. I am not looking for more power. I would prefer to have another department deal with this matter, but it is the task of my department. The important point at issue here is whether the Government should see to such matters or whether the local authority should do so. One of the hon. members for Pietermaritzburg said that we are depriving the local authority of its &#x201C;right&#x201D;. Where does it get that &#x201C;right&#x201D; from&#x003F; Let the hon. member who has such a lot to say reply to that question. It receives its right from the provincial council, and the provincial council receives its right from this Parliament. This Parliament is the sovereign Parliament of South Africa. This is where we are given the right to make laws. We delegate certain powers to the provinces&#x2014;I think it is in terms of section 87&#x2014;to administer on our behalf. They in turn give the local authorities certain powers, but that does not mean that they are <span class="col_951-952" refersTo="page_0493"/>the sovereign power. This kind of thing keeps on cropping up, and it is very important that we rectify this matter. It is not because the party to which I belong has been in office for such a long time now. I know those people are frustrated, but as long as this system exists, the sovereign power is vested in the Parliament of South Africa. That is why I say that the local authorities do not have a right. The question which arose was at what stage the central Government would interfere with a local authority. To me it is desirable that local authorities deal with this matter, but at what stage will the Government have to decide to deal with the matter itself&#x003F; I should like to offer the following for consideration. Firstly the Government will step in in those cases in which the local authorities refuse to obey the general policy guide-lines of the Government of the day. And now I am referring not to the NP only. If that United Party were ever to come into office, this statement would be as valid as it is under the r&#x00E9;gime of this party. The Government which is seated on this side of the House is entitled to lay down certain policies because it has the confidence of the voters. That is why I am sitting here.</p>

<p>I come now to the second case, and that is when a local authority is not able to deal fully and properly with a matter which has been entrusted to him. Let me give an example. Suppose local authorities were dealing with this matter of <span class="col_953-954" refersTo="page_0494"/>film shows and a specific local authority decided that films may not be exhibited on a Sunday. It may then happen that there is a drive-in cinema very close to the town in question, which does not fall under its jurisdiction. In other words, the regulations of the local authority will be totally frustrated by the fact that another authority has control over the drive-in cinema. In such a case the central Government or the provincial administration has to intervene.</p>

<p>I come now to the third case. What happens when a certain policy has been laid down and there is a lack of uniformity in that everyone chops and changes so that the country is made to appear ridiculous&#x003F; So it may happen that the one town decides one thing and another town another, although they are all the same kind of people. Then it is time the central Government told the people what ought to be done. Let me give an example. Let us take Natal. Newcastle wants bioscopes closed on Sundays. The same applies to Vryheid.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is another principle we have to take into consideration. Hon. members opposite can become as angry as they like, but we are going to discuss this matter. As I have said, if a province wants to make an ordinance or if a local authority has made a by-law and it becomes clear to the Government that the ordinance or by-law can be circumvented too easily, the Government has to intervene. Let me give an example. In the Cape and in the Transvaal all kinds of shifty clubs have sprung up which frustrate the legislation. That is why the central authority has to lay down legislation so that these clubs cannot frustrate the legislation.</p>

<p>How strongly do our people feel about this measure&#x003F; I have with me here a whole pile of letters from young people, old people, from churches&#x2014;from ordinary people who tell me that this is the best thing South Africa has ever done. I am not going to quote from the letters. If hon. members wish, they may come and examine them afterwards. Let me just say that the people who wrote to me, understood the principle far better than those who do not want to hear. In these letters they say that they can well understand that there are many other things which still need looking into, because, so they say, we find ourselves on a slippery slope of permissiveness, and South Africa must put a stop to it.</p>

<p>Sir, let us examine this. Hon. members have asked me: How many people are opposed to it&#x003F; I do not want to look at <i>Die Burger</i> because <i>Die Burger</i> is supposed to be a Nationalist newspaper. The hon. members opposite will say that <i>Die Burger</i> did not conduct the poll properly. Therefore, I would rather refer them to <i>The Daily News</i> of Natal. The hon. member for Umbilo referred to this investigation, but he referred to it only as far as Sunday sport was concerned. He did not refer to the cinemas. I do not know why he did not do so, for at that time the subject of the debate was still the cinemas. He referred to the statistics in regard to Sunday sport. Here in my hand I have the newspaper cutting which maintains&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From Cape Point to Beit Bridge and from Kosi Bay to Alexander Bay the Sabbath still remains unprofaned by light entertainment. So say most White South Africans, according to the latest nationwide opinion poll conducted for <i>The Daily News</i> by Market Research (Africa). Although 39% of all respondents, mainly English-speaking city dwellers, answered</block>

<p>This was the question; let me first read the question. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question asked was: &#x201C;Do you agree or disagree that cinemas should be opened <span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_0495"/>to the public on Sundays&#x003F; Although 39% of all the respondents, mainly English-speaking city dwellers, answered &#x201C;agree&#x201D;, they were heavily outweighed by a 59% majority who flatly disagreed. To drive home the lesson, a massive 81% of the Afrikaans population, to whose views this Government is most responsive, opposed Sunday cinemas. Women, too, proved more Sabbath-minded than their mates, and were 61% opposed to allowing the cinemas to distract people&#x2019;s minds on a Sunday. Even the men, however, had an obdurate 56% who thought Sundays were for church and not for cinemas.</block>

<p>The hon. member is laughing but these are the statistics from his own newspaper! Undeniably South Africa does not want cinemas on a Sunday. I have been accused of all kinds of things here, particularly by hon. members from Natal and also by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I have been accused of allegedly acting in an extremely callous manner, and of ignoring people&#x2019;s rights. In the first place, and I want to say this in all honesty, I think I have acted quite fairly here. Do hon. members wish to deny this&#x003F; I attended five National Party congresses and each congress adopted a unanimous resolution that cinemas should be closed on a Sunday.</p>

They were in the hands of the cinema people, and those cinema people were undisciplined, and did just as they pleased. They simply hired out the films. I told them: &#x201C;Go back and speak to your people who hire films from you, and make it a condition of your contract that a film may not be exhibited on a Sunday evening while the church services are in progress. Then I can consider the matter and I can also submit it to the Government and discuss it with my colleagues.&#x201D; They told me that this could not happen; the cinema people would pay no heed to it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, at that particular point of time the main difficulty was in Natal, and I say that it is an unfair allegation made against me by the hon. member who said the Bill was the result of a personal feud between me and the Executive Committee of Natal. I have no feud with anybody. I approached the Administrator, as was my duty, the very moment the Government indicated what its policy was. As the responsible Minister, I approached the Administrator of Natal and I told him the Government&#x2019;s view was that Sunday cinema shows should stop. I was informed by the Administrator of Natal that the Executive Committee of Natal was not of the same view and that they would not be interested in whatever the Government might say about the matter.</p>

<p>One of the members of the Executive Committee took it upon himself to vilify me on every possible occasion&#x2014;personally, not on principle. He went for me personally, and so did the Natal <i>Daily News.</i> They carried on a vendetta against me on these points. They vented their spleen on me personally. <i>The Daily News</i> went even further and dragged in the Afrikaner. As usual, they also dragged in the Free State. What the poor old Free State has done, I do not know. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I must point out that the Free State&#x2019;s money is very welcome in Natal, but when it comes to gratuitous insults the Free State always gets it in the face. <i>The Daily News</i> said it did not suffer from the mentality of the Free State and it did not want Afrikaner ideas thrust down its throat. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that newspaper carried on a personal vendetta against me on these points. It is easy for the editor of a newspaper to dip his pen in poison against a particular individual and to play brinkmanship with the <span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_0496"/>laws of defamation. As a matter of fact, that particular editor invites an action of defamation against him. He invites it, because, if his paper should lose such an action, it is covered by insurance whereas if any ordinary person should lose such an action, he would have to pay for it out of his own pocket. If that newspaper loses it, insurance covers it. Furthermore, that newspaper, in any event, gets the additional circulation by reporting the court hearing on the matter. This particular newspaper went to town on this issue.</p>

<p>That was part of the Natal action, part of the Natal stand which we saw here today. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, at that particular time the Natal Executive Committee member concerned also jumped onto the bandwagon and made all sorts of remarks. Then the management committee of the Durban city council decided to request the Administrator to consent to the repeal of by-laws that had stood for 18 years prohibiting the showing of films on a Sunday. This, of course, conclusively refuted the allegation by the Natal <i>Daily News</i> that the Afrikaner was forcing his own ideas onto Natal, because 18 years ago there was not a single Afrikaner in the Durban city council when the by-law was passed prohibiting for the first time the showing of films on a Sunday. At that time it was exclusively the English-speaking Natal citizen following his traditional line of thought. The Afrikaner was right out of it. That is why I say that the insults to the Afrikaner and to the Free State were quite gratuitous.</p>

He said his Executive Committee would not touch it. According to him they felt in principle that the matter should be left to the various municipalities &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I respect the Administrator&#x2019;s point of view on that issue. I said to him: &#x201C;Then you must forgive me, but I shall have to speak to the municipalities myself, because the Government has taken a stand on this issue&#x201D;.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I explained that we were on a slippery slope as far as Sunday laws were concerned, and that it had to stop. They then asked me whether they could come and see me about the matter, and I told them to do so, so that we could discuss it. They came to see me, and unless the Durban city council allows me to disclose the full conversation which took place in my office&#x2014;I am not ashamed to do so, for there is nothing to hide&#x2014;I shall not do so because it is not my custom to disclose such conversation which took place in an office. If the Durban city council gives any kind of indication that I can reproduce the conversation at any time in this House, I shall do so. However I do want to tell this House, and I think I may say this, that I found the two gentlemen who visited me to be very fair. They were very, very fair, and I explained the principle which I have elucidated here in this House to these people to the best of my ability, particularly the point concerning the Afrikaner, for they were also under the impression that it was the National Party Government which wished to impose its will on them. However, when they realized that they had had that ordinance for 18 years already, and that it had been done in accordance with their directives, the atmosphere changed completely, and they admitted that it was true and was also an English tradition in Natal. They returned, and what happened there I do not know, but they resolved not to continue with the alteration of that by-law. Now I want to state unequivocally that I appreciated it very much indeed of the Durban city council that they were prepared to heed the friendly appeal of the Government. I caused this appeal to be published far and wide through the Press and also informed each municipality of what the Government&#x2019;s <span class="col_959-960" refersTo="page_0497"/>policy was, and addressed a friendly request to them to adopt the policy of the Government in this respect. The Durban municipality did so, and I now want to inform those members opposite that even if I introduce this Bill for the sake of the Durban city council only, I shall do so.</p>

The reason is that all the little holiday resorts around Durban make it one of their special attractions to have you go to a cinema on a Sunday.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I did not at any time leave them uninformed and, to tell the truth, I submitted the Bill which is now before this House to these people and told them that I was going to introduce it in that form. The Bill was ready to be introduced at that stage. [Interjections.] In spite of that they told me that they were satisfied.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think they took the right approach. They said: &#x201C;This is not really a big issue, we have never had bioscopes on a Sunday night before. Why is there this ballyhoo about it now&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>*After all, South Africa has never had cinemas on Sundays before. Why is it so terribly essential now&#x003F; [Interjections.] Let us just take the history a little further. What happened then&#x003F; When Durban turned round and said that they went along with Government policy, the provincial council jumped to its feet and this same member of the executive committee was furious and made a kind of &#x201C;Natal last stand&#x201D;. All kinds of things were said, and the Pietermaritzburg City Council became red in the face and hot under the collar. Everyone then maintained that they would oppose the legislation to the death. They went so far that the executive committee introduced a motion in the provincial council in which I, personally, was censured; not the Government. I told them repeatedly that this was the standpoint of the Government. However, a personal attack was then made on me. A motion was tabled in which they stated that they wanted nothing more to do with Kruger. What I find strange is that there are people here who say that only the municipalities should look after this matter. If they had wanted to be consistent, surely they should have kept out of it. Why, then, did they debated in the provincial council if that was their standpoint&#x003F; Why did the member of the Executive Committee, who adhered so adamantly to the principle that the local authority and only the local authority should decide on this matter, become annoyed with Durban, and why did he want to introduce a motion in the provincial council&#x003F; Surely his standpoint should have been: &#x201C;Look, I am going to keep out of this quarrel. It is a quarrel between the local authorities and the Minister. I am not going to concern myself with it.&#x201D; Then he jumped on the band wagon and wanted to pick a fight with me because he was annoyed with Durban. They went around with the story that I had allegedly blackmailed Durban. Where and how I could have blackmailed them, I do not know.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one other matter I want to point out. When the Durban City Council asked that same Executive Committee whether they could repeal the ordinance, the reply was that it could only be done on certain conditions. What were those conditions&#x003F; The conditions were that they could exhibit films on a Sunday, but not on Good Friday, Christmas Day or the Day of the Covenant. I then felt myself obliged to tell the Administrator that I could not understand why they stated conditions, why films could not be exhibited on the Day of the Covenant. In reply to that question he told me that the Day of the Covenant was a traditional day on <span class="col_961-962" refersTo="page_0498"/>which films were not exhibited. I then told him that I agreed with him, for the covenant of Sarel Cilliers had been that we would commemorate that day &#x201C;als een Sabbat&#x201D;. If that applied to the Day of the Covenant, it should also apply to Sunday. I then told him: &#x201C;If you wish to impose the condition that films may not be exhibited on the Day of the Covenant, you must carry the condition all the way through and say that this may not happen on a Sunday either.&#x201D; Then he told me again that his Executive Committee wanted to have nothing to do with the entire matter and that they adhered absolutely to their &#x201C;Natal stand&#x201D; as far as this point was concerned. What must we do now&#x003F; Must we carry on and allow film companies to exhibit their films throughout South Africa, must we eventually allow the shops to be opened, the restfulness of the Sunday to disappear completely and allow a Sunday to become like any ordinary day so that the churches no longer have any say and are driven out&#x003F; This is the principle as I see it, and this is the reason why I say to this House that I want to introduce this Bill to show the local authorities what course they should adopt. I am saying this today in this House, and I am saying this to all local authorities and provincial councils: These are the lines along which the Government wants them to think. If they do not want to do that, we have no choice and we have to come to this House and do their work for them. The Government feels that these two principles must be taken into consideration absolutely.</p>

<p>The first is that it is a traditional standpoint in South Africa that a Sunday should be kept as quietly as possible. It is not for me to say now that a person should go to church, nor is it for me to say what he should do on a Sunday, but a Sunday must be kept peaceful, so that we may be restored in body and soul after the six days we have laboured, so that we can start afresh the next week. Even the Russians have a day of rest. They do not work seven days a week. Why should we simply allow our day to be lost now&#x003F; Secondly, this day should not be commercialized. The reason for my saying this is not because I am opposed to money being made&#x2014;I believe in capitalism&#x2014;but because the commercialization means the drawing away of people from the tranquility of a day of rest, for it is advertisements dinning in one&#x2019;s ears, pictures which entice one, such as this <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> advertisement asking people to come and see a film on Sunday. Here you have advertisements which spoil one&#x2019;s whole day of rest, and which make Sunday completely distasteful, for one always find an advertisement here, and something like &#x201C;Come to the sale; the prices are cheapest on a Sunday. Come and buy!&#x201D; Where will it all end&#x003F; These are the two principles we should like to maintain here.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the little clergyman on the opposite side, the hon. member for Pinelands. That hon. gentleman kicked up a great fuss here about how one would supposedly not be a Christian by making such laws. I agree with him; we never said that. What I did not like, however, was what the hon. member had to say about me here. He said: &#x201C;The Minister is critical of the churches in South Africa.&#x201D; And I tell him that that is an untruth. As Minister of Police, however, I have to keep my eyes wide open when clergymen adopt a political standpoint&#x2014;I do not want to argue about whether it is Christian or non-Christian, for they may imagine that it is Christian&#x2014;and make use of people with a Black consciousness, by means of schools, lectures, church organizations and church funds, to bring about a polarization between White and Black which then leads to Black Power organizations. The hon. gentleman then come here and cast their cloak of Christ over these activities, as the hon. member told us here. He told us that our behaviour towards the Black people was wrong, and did so after we had said so many times here in this House that our policy was as Christian, if not more Christian, than the policy of any other person, and that our standpoint towards the Black people was as Christian as that of any other person in the country.</p>

<p>I do not stand back for any clergyman, not from Pinelands or anywhere else, as far as the Christian principles of our policy are concerned. I do not like it at all, this mud-slinging and this casting of the cloak of Christ over political ideologies which in their opinion are Christian, but which we think are diabolical. We should not debate these matters. But then the hon. member must not tell me that I am critical of the Church, for if the churches want to do that kind of thing, they must not expect that they are doing their work as churches in the eyes of other Christians. If <span class="col_963-964" refersTo="page_0499"/>the churches were to allow revolution to be fomented, or if they are closing their eyes to it or are sympathetic towards it, then the time has come for them to call a halt, for then Christianity is no longer Christianity. The hon. member said: &#x201C;The Sunday has a special character, set aside for worship and recreation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I simply saying this to indicate that even that hon. member admits that Sunday has a special character. Why should it not then be observed&#x003F; These are the principles I see in this Bill. I do not want to be ecclesiastical today, but I want to express my appreciation to members on this side of the House who stated their ecclesiastical standpoint here. I am in complete agreement with them. I also support the Church and the standpoints of the Church in respect of Sunday. However, I do not want to argue about this in respect of this Bill, for the principle of the Government is that we must have a peaceful and a non-commercialized Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_965-966" refersTo="page_0500"/>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in March 1976, after consultations with the KWV, the Cape Wine Institute, the Federated Hotel Associations, the Association of Law Societies and other bodies. Apart from possible minor points of disagreement, the measure is acceptable to the producers, to the various branches of commerce, and to the legal profession as far as its functions are concerned. Nor have any objections been received from the part of the consumers. From this we may conclude that basically the Bill before the House contains no controversial provisions.</p>

<p>This measure may be regarded as the preliminary to the final consolidation of the 1928 Act. At the same time, licence and application fees, which were last amended in 1963, are being increased. However, the most important change which is being proposed in the Bill is an amendment to the licensing system.</p>

<p>The main function of the 56 local liquor licensing boards is annually to consider applications for the renewal of liquor licences and to hear evidence in connection with applications for new liquor licences. The liquor trade, and especially the hotel industry, have long been agitating against the annual renewal of liquor licences. Apart from the cost this involves, they allege, there is no need for annual renewal. Measures exist and others may be introduced, in so far as they may be necessary, for exercising proper control over licensed premises and liquor distribution.</p>

<p>My Departments of Justice and Police and I myself are satisfied that we can do away with the existing system of annual renewal of liquor licences and the so-called sections 1006A and 100<i>sex</i> authorities which are at present renewed departmentally. Consequently, there will be no further need for local liquor licensing boards. In terms of the proposed system, a liquor licence will remain valid, once it has been issued, until it is cancelled by the competent authority, until it is given up by the licence-holder or until the competent authority considers that it is no longer being used for carrying on business. Particulars of all concerns in possession of liquor licences and other legitimate liquor distribution points will be fed into a computer and a notice will be sent to every licence-holder by 30 September every year in which payment of the prescribed licence fee for the following year will be demanded.</p>

<p>The intention is that new applications, apart from temporary and late hours occasional licenses, will be heard in public by the National Liquor Board. This also applies to the new sections l00<i>bis</i> and l00<i>sex</i> applications. Every year, the Liquor Board will hold a meeting in respect of each province for hearing these applications.</p>

<p>Provision is being made for objections, review, appeal, special and interim meetings, etc., for the most part retaining the provisions presently applicable to local liquor licensing boards. In this connection I refer in particular to clause 12, which inserts a new chapter III dealing with matters of this nature. I should like at this stage to express my thanks and those of the Government for the great task performed by local liquor licensing boards since 1956. I have great appreciation for the work of a specialized and mostly complicated nature performed in this connection by magistrates as members of liquor licensing boards.</p>

<p>Another matter of principle which is touched upon in the Bill is the provision of liquor on election days. This matter is more clearly defined as far as the Liquor Act is concerned, and provision is being made for the elections of the Indian Council, at the request of the S.A. Indian Council and the Department of Indian Affairs. Section 79 of the Constitution and Elections Amendment Act, 1973, repeals section 181 of the Electoral Consolidation Act of 1946. The repeal has not yet been made operative, in anticipation of a decision on the question of whether the provisions of the Liquor Act relating to the sale and provision of liquor on election days are to be adjusted, and if so, in what respect. The relevant provision in the Electoral Act was repealed at the recommendation of a Select Committee, by way of a majority decision. In this connection one may refer to the discussion in the Committee Stage as reported in columns 8968 to 8974 of the debates of this House on 12 June 1973.</p>

<p>The provisions of section 181 of the Electoral Consolidation Act have now been embodied in this Bill in clause 147(f). Briefly, the effect of these provisions is that the position regarding the sale of liquor on <span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0501"/>election days will remain as it is in spite of the repeal of the relevant provision in the Electoral Consolidation Act. I gave my special consideration to this matter and a change did not appear to be desirable. I am satisfied that the present system does not prejudice anyone in any way. Nor have any representations been received in this connection.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to say something about the proposed amendment to section 100<i>sex</i> contained in clause 88. At present authority for the sale of liquor may be granted to an association of Coloured or Asian persons having at least 20 shareholders and in which no single shareholder holds more than 20% of the issued shares or has contributed more than 20% of the association&#x2019;s capital. In addition, no person may have a financial interest in more than one such distribution point. There is an exception in the case of the Coloured Development Corporation. After consultation with the departments concerned and the CDC, it has been decided to delete these restrictions. Extensive provision was made in 1969 in section 100<i>sex</i>(2B) to deal with the case of a shareholder in a section 100<i>sex</i> authority who permanently departs from the Republic. This provision is considered to be no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Section 94 prohibits the supply of liquor to Bantu except under circumstances set out therein. This provision is a relic from the days of almost total prohibition as far as Bantu are concerned, and is no longer considered necessary. It is deleted by clause 84.</p>

<p>Section 74 provides that before a club liquor licence can be granted, the authority considering the application must be satisfied that the establishment is a <i>bona fide</i> club. There is no definition in the Act of a club, and it is a matter which must be considered with regard to the requirements specified in section 74(2). A club must have at least 35 members, and ordinary members must pay an annual subscription of at least R6. The National Liquor Board is of the opinion that the minimum number of ordinary club members should be at least 50 and that the annual subscription should be increased to at least R12 per annum. Clause 60 provides accordingly. The Liquor Board recognized that in some rural areas there may be a need for licensed club facilities at industrial undertakings such as power stations where the membership requirement will be difficult or impossible to meet. In such cases it is proposed that a licence can be issued if the club has only 35 ordinary members. I trust that these amendments will eliminate applications by institutions which cannot really claim to be clubs.</p>

<p>Under clause 147(y) it will become possible to grant a wine and malt licence in respect of a boat which is lawfully operated on a lake, lagoon, dam or river. I can foresee that in the not too distant future pleasure boats will operate on our bigger dams. As in the case of all wine and malt liquor licences, it will be necessary to make provision for the service of food on such boats. Clause 51 has reference. Provision for light meals will be made in the conditions which will be applicable.</p>

<p>At present hotels may be authorized to close for certain out of season periods. This principle is being extended to all on-consumption licensed premises. Provision is also made for keeping open a part of licensed premises in cases where a material portion thereof is destroyed or becomes unfit for the proper carrying on of the business. Clause 67 has reference.</p>

<p>Section 112 limits an hotelkeeper&#x2019;s liability in respect of the property of a lodger on the premises to a maximum of R40. There are certain exceptions to this restriction which are set out in subsection (1). The amendment proposed in clause 100 will increase the extent of liability from R40 to R100. The limit of R40 dates back to at least 1928. The hotel industry does not object to the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>In 1975 Parliament made it an offence to introduce, possess or consume liquor in any portion of a sportsground to which members of the public are admitted on payment of an admission fee. I undertook to give this provision further thought and consideration. It is now proposed to amend section 166(hA) as indicated in clause 139(f). I trust that this amendment will obviate the problems previous raised.</p>

<p>Until now sportsground and theatre liquor licences have been grouped together in the Act as one class of licence. This is an impractical situation. Separate provision is being made for the two classes of licences as will be observed from clauses 7(b) and (c) and 55 the proviso to the proposed new <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_0502"/>section 71 <i>quat</i>&#x2014;see clause 55&#x2014;has been inserted to deal with a practice which has grown up over many years at the Milner Park Show Grounds and which, according to the department&#x2019;s view and that of the Show Ground&#x2019;s legal representative, will not fall within the ambit of the special condition prescribed in the proposed section 71 <i>quat.</i></p>

<p>By clause 99 it is proposed to extend the present limitation of the time for the recovery of retail liquor debts, from three to four months. I have agreed to this extension after careful consideration of the retail trades&#x2019; representations to me. I do not think this concession can lead to any abuse.</p>

<p>The National Liquor Board consists of six persons, one of whom is nominated by the Minister of Justice and is the board&#x2019;s chairman. The Secretary for Justice, or a person nominated by him, is also a member of the board. Since its inception, a nominee of the head of the department has always served on the board. It is now proposed to amend section 118 <i>bis</i> so that this particular member will be an officer in the Department of Justice to be nominated by the Minister and who will automatically be the deputy chairman of the board.</p>

<p>Clause 109 authorizes the National Liquor Board under certain circumstances to co-opt persons to assist it in the hearing of matters before it. This provision has been inserted at the suggestion of the Liquor Committee of the Association of Law Societies and has the support of the trade.</p>

<p>Another innovation introduced at the request of the lawyers and fully supported by the trade, will be found in clause 145. Provision is being made for condonation, under certain circumstances, of certain formal or technical errors or omissions in applications.</p>

<p>Section 118 provides for the appointment of what is called &#x201C;liquor traffic inspectors&#x201D;. This provision has been part of the Act since 1928 but only one such appointment has been made since then. Inspections for purposes of the Act have since 1928 been and are still being carried out by the so-called designated police officers. It is proposed to delete this provision and to substitute a provision whereby the Minister of Justice will be able to appoint government officials to carry out the duties now performed by designated police officers. The relevant provision will be found in clause 108 which was inserted after lengthy discussions between the two departments concerned and an inter-departmental investigation.</p>

<p>Clause 75 amends section 86A. In terms of this section the holder of a wine house licence can only sell wines produced by the holder of a section 6A authority. The amendment proposes to allow also wines produced on certain estates to be sold under a wine house licence. The amendment is being made at the request of the Cape Wine Institute and has the blessing of the K.W.V.</p>

<p>The existing penalty clauses are numerous and involved. In order to simplify matters, clause 140 now prescribes maximum penalties in a simplified manner.</p>

<p>The supply of liquor by certain restaurants, which are not licensed for the sale of liquor, is causing concern. It appears that at some of these places liquor is supplied to customers under the pretext that it is given free of charge as a gesture of goodwill. The charge for the liquor, so I am informed, is hidden in the price of the meal. Restaurateurs who wish to supply liquor to their clients, must apply for and obtain liquor licences so that proper control can be exercised. The existing provisions relating to dealing in liquor without a licence, are inadequate to meet the problem. A proposed amendment in this regard will be found in clause 128.</p>

<p>*I have now referred to those provisions of the Bill which I consider to be the most important ones. I wish to conclude by saying that the Bill contains many good principles&#x2014;and this is not only my opinion, but also the general sentiment of those people who are most closely affected by the provisions of the Liquor Act.</p>

<p>If this measure becomes law, many administrative functions will have to be performed, especially as far as the preparation for the introduction of the amended licensing procedure is concerned. It will most probably not be possible to finalize these in the course of this year, but we trust that it will be possible to implement the provisions early next year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has made virtually the same speech he made last year, with the exception of two or three new points which have been <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0503"/>introduced into this Bill. This Bill changes 150 of the 175 sections of the Liquor Act and repeals 42 provisions of the existing legislation. What the hon. the Minister did not mention is that, although last year&#x2019;s Bill and this year&#x2019;s Bill appear virtually the same, there are in fact over 60, almost 70, differences between the two Bills. I admit they are minor changes, textual changes, but they are nevertheless changes. It has necessitated a careful study, clause by clause, to find the differences. I think it would have been much fairer if the hon. the Minister had said: &#x201C;Look, it has changed, but there are no changes in principle, except this or that. But there are changes.&#x201D; Then one would look for them from the start, instead of being misled and assuming it was the same Bill and then, when studying it, finding these changes in clause after clause. One of the changes which was not mentioned until the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech is, for instance, the clause amending section 118, which introduces a new inspectorate and describes the powers that that inspectorate will have. A number of other changes make provision for the Indian Council elections. Others remove the recommendation to the hon. the Minister from the National Liquor Board in respect of some of the decisions which he has to take in granting licence applications. But essentially the Bill is the same as last year and I am not going to repeat what I said a year ago with regard to the Bill as a whole.</p>

<p>Do you still stand by what you said last year&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that. I did not complete my speech last year. However, I do think it is necessary to refer to the main principles contained in this measure.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are the improvements. The two main improvements, as I see them, are firstly that licences, once granted, shall remain in force until they are repealed and, secondly, that licences may be granted to companies. These are both positive amendments which have long been sought for and which I think are a tremendous improvement in so far as they grant a licence security of tenure and grant certainty to a person, who invests many thousands of rands, and sometimes many hundreds of thousands of rands, in an undertaking. Previously he did not know from year to year whether that business would continue. Now, at least, he has the knowledge that the licence is there until it is taken away from him. Similarly, the granting of licences to companies is an improvement. Previously, there was considerable difficulty in that there had to be a person appointed as the licensee. This person was usually an employee, and every time such an employee left, was sacked or died, one had to get the licence transferred. Each time such a transfer of a licence entailed effort and sometimes considerable difficulty, especially when a person absconded. These are the main improvements.</p>

<p>There are weaknesses in this measure as well, weaknesses with which I shall not have time to deal this afternoon, but I shall mention them at this stage and come back to them when the debate is resumed. The first is that all the power, and I repeat, all the power, the sole and total power to approve applications for licences is transferred to the Minister of Justice. Secondly, the National Liquor Board, now to be known as the Liquor Board, has I believe achieved its ambition in that it has gathered the last threads of control into its sticky palms and now has total control over the entire liquor industry over the whole of South Africa, except for the Minister&#x2019;s signature on the licence application. The third weakness is that, where there has been a delay in the approval of licences in the past because of the procedure followed, I believe that that delay will now be even greater. The position at the moment is that applications, which must be lodged in August and which are heard and considered by the National Liquor Board in November, are not decided upon until April or even May so that the applicant does not know whether he has got his licence or not until then. The hon. the Minister shakes his head. I want to ask him whether he has yet received any August 1976 applications, on which recommendations were made in November, and whether any one of those applications has yet been granted.</p>

<p>I am talking here about the period of time that elapses between the first submission of the application and its finalization. I suggest that the delay will be even greater when this amending Bill comes into force and the Minister will have to take all the decisions which must be taken with regard to so many of the applications received, concerning which many matters were previously decided upon by the board.</p>

<p>So, whilst there are advantages, equally there are disadvantages. When the debate continues, I want to deal with the effects of this measure and also with some of the side-effects which flow from it. I also want to point out why I believe that this is not as simple a measure or as agreed a measure as the hon. the Minister has indicated.</p>
