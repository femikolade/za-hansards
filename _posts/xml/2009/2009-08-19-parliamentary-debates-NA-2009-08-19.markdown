                          QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

The SPEAKER: Order! The first item on the Order Paper is Questions
addressed to the Deputy President. Members may press the “to talk” button
on their desk, if they wish to ask a supplementary question. The first
Question is asked by the hon N N Sibhida.

THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT:

  Steps to be taken by government to eliminate fiscal x-inefficiencies and
   improve operational efficiencies, so as to accelerate service delivery

1.    Ms N N Sibhida (ANC) asked the Deputy President:

      What steps will the government implement in the next five years to (a)
      eliminate fiscal x-inefficiencies in departments and (b) improve the
      operational efficiencies of the state to accelerate the service
      delivery process?                                  NO855E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, hon members, our country, like the rest of
the world, has been affected by the economic downturn. We are going through
a recession for the first time in 17 years. As a result of this, tax
revenues, after adjusting for inflation, are expected to decline
significantly. Our government finds itself having to meet its commitments
to the people of South Africa with fewer resources than before.

We are taking steps, however, to ensure that government works better and
uses public resources to deliver services to the people. The overarching
goal of these steps that we have taken is to make sure that departments
operate better and serve our people with speed and effectiveness.

The two Ministers in the Presidency, Ministers Chabane and Manuel, will be
tabling Green Papers on Planning and Performance Monitoring and Evaluation,
respectively, in the near future, which will outline clear and concrete
steps on how we plan to improve the way government does business.
Cabinet has also appointed a three-person Ministerial Task Team consisting
of Ministers Gordhan, Chabane and Baloyi to make proposals on
reprioritising spending to increase the impact of the Budget. The
assignment of this task team is not to cut public spending, but to make
proposals on how to reduce wastage and direct spending to new high-impact
areas. They will be presenting their proposals to Cabinet in due course.

Beyond the immediate work of the Ministerial Task Team, government is
undertaking a detailed and comprehensive expenditure review to identify
whether there are programmes which should be scaled down and their funding
redirected to high-impact priorities. The National Treasury is looking into
how government procurement is managed and investigating cases of
impropriety in the awarding of tenders.

Let me say, in conclusion, that this government is taking all these steps
because the challenges facing our society demand that we work better. It
also has to be stated that Cabinet and the national sphere of government
will work in concert with the other two spheres to give effect to these
steps. Thank you.

Ms N N SIBHIDA: Mr Speaker, thank you Deputy President for your adequate
response. Indeed, it shows that the ANC-led government is committed to
uplifting the lives of all South Africans by ensuring that there will be
proper planning and correct allocation of resources. The ANC also applauds
the decision of the executive, informed by our manifesto, to focus on
skills development, which we think is the main contributor to the x-
inefficiencies that we see in government and state-owned enterprises.

I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all members of this
House to use all the tools that we have identified to play their oversight
role more effectively for the good of our people. All these good plans, if
not communicated well to all relevant stakeholders will be to no avail. We
therefore request the executive to develop a communication strategy that
will be understood by all.

The SPEAKER: That was more like a statement than a question.

Ms A M DREYER: Mister Speaker, as the Deputy President quite correctly
pointed out, times are tough, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost
and service delivery is literally falling apart with sewerage running
through the streets. Yet, public servants, including Directors-General,
fail to disclose their business interests and they further fail to sign
performance agreements. These officials are displaying a total disregard
for regulations - then they award themselves tenders worth R600 million or
more!

If government wants to be taken seriously, it must not tell us about new
plans and new structures. It must show by its actions that it will enforce
the rules. My question is: Between April and August 2009 what disciplinary
action has government taken against defaulting officials?

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: Speaker, on
a point of order: That is not a supplementary question; it is an entirely
new question, which is unrelated to the question on the paper. It’s not
about fiscal efficiencies, I’m afraid.

The SPEAKER: Order! We will let the Deputy President decide on that one.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, obviously I would not have the data of
actions taken since April to date at my fingertips, but of course, there
are a number of cases that have been widely reported by the media of action
taken against those who were found to have flouted the rules and
regulations and procedures of awarding tenders. And that work must, indeed,
continue to be done until we eliminate this challenge of the abuse of
public resources. I make that commitment without any fear of contradiction.
Thank you.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Speaker, Deputy President, over the years many service
providers, who do business with government, have incurred great losses due
to government’s failure to pay them on time. Many of these service
providers had to close down their businesses as a result.

There are still travel agencies today that allege that this Parliament has
not settled some two-year-old accounts. Many minibus and bus operators that
transport children from townships to school have also failed due to lack of
finance and late payment by government.

In view of this unacceptable practice, can the Deputy President tell us why
service providers to government are paid so late and what has been done to
ensure that they are paid promptly as a way to improve the operational
efficiency of the state? Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you, hon Rev Meshoe. Obviously, government’s
position is that all the service providers ought to be paid within 30 days
of providing such service. Where delays occur, there are channels for
addressing them. As the President has already indicated, a hotline is going
to be opened. That will be one more channel for addressing such delays.

My office has also received similar requests from time to time from service
providers who are aggrieved, and we have ensured that we act with the
requisite speed to nudge the relevant chief financial officers to meet
their commitments. It is a challenge, I must admit, that in certain
instances officials actually hide bills in order to cause such delays
because they are mismanaging the funds. This is a problem we are aware of.
We will take steps to ensure that we eliminate it.
At local government level, we are looking at processes to ensure that each
one of the municipalities would have deployed people with accounting
qualifications, who need to be trained on the job. [Time expired.]

Ms P DE LILLE: Speaker, hon Deputy President, I’m sure you will agree with
me that to achieve a developmental state, you need efficient and qualified
public servants. I know of an incident in a Seta in East London where the
CEO of that Seta forged all his qualifications. I reported it, he came to
his office with the police and suspended a number of employees.

As one of the steps you are going to try and put into place, will you
consider doing a verification of qualifications of all senior managers in
departments? I ask this as the lack of skills has become an excuse for
inefficiency, but then we appoint people without the right qualifications.
I will also suggest that that is one of the steps that must be taken to
make sure that we don’t take people without the necessary qualifications to
do the job.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you, hon Ms De Lille, I couldn’t agree with you
more. In fact, this is part of a normal procedure to verify qualifications,
but as in all systems that are followed by human beings, there will, from
time to time, be those cases where people succeed in dribbling themselves
through the systems. Verification is a normal procedure. The Public Service
Commission also does that on an ongoing basis. I’m glad that you are
referring to a specific case that we can attend to with immediate effect.

 Mechanisms to ensure that the executive applies a full disclosure policy on
       providing answers to all accountability measures of Parliament

2.    Mr M J Ellis (DA) asked the Deputy President:

      (1)   Whether, with reference to his statement on executive
            accountability to Parliament on 24 June 2009 (details
            furnished), his standpoint is being enforced; if not, why not;
            if so, why are Ministers (a) providing incomplete and inadequate
            answers to parliamentary questions and (b) not answering
            questions, especially on issues of national importance;

      (2)   whether, in light of his statement as Leader of Government
            Business, he will introduce any mechanisms to ensure that the
            executive applies a full disclosure policy on providing answers
            to all accountability measures of Parliament; if not, why not;
            if so, (a) what mechanisms, (b) when and (c) how will the
            executive be accountable until the introduction of these
            mechanisms?                       NO862E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, I would like to assure the hon members
that Ministers are well aware of their obligations to account to Parliament
in terms of the Constitution.

Hon Ellis, in his question to me, refers to Ministers who provide
incomplete and inadequate answers and/or do not answer questions at all. I
am not aware of that happening and he has not given me specific examples.

It is true, however, that Ministers do exceed the period provided for in
the Rules of the National Assembly, for answering written questions, but I
am sure that the hon Ellis is also quite aware that those same Rules
provide for remedies to this problem, namely, the transfer of those
questions from written to oral reply. I am not aware of this being done in
the recent period, however.

Hon members, as I have already stated, the Rules of the National Assembly
do provide mechanisms for ensuring that questions to the executive are
answered. As these Rules are adopted by this House and not the executive, I
believe it would be up to the National Assembly to decide whether there is
a need to tighten these Rules or to strengthen them in any way.

However, as Leader of Government Business, it is my duty and responsibility
to ensure that Cabinet Ministers are reminded of their obligation and I do
so by regularly reporting, in detail, to each meeting of Cabinet the number
of questions each Minister has outstanding. That is the reply to the
question. Thank you.

Mr M J ELLIS: Speaker, I want to thank the hon Deputy President for his
reply. I wonder whether Mr Manuel will allow me to ask my follow-up
question? [Laughter.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: It depends
on the quality of the follow-up! [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Proceed, hon Mr Ellis.

Mr M J ELLIS: I want to assure the hon Deputy President that there are a
number of examples that we could give him of Ministers who have not replied
to questions or who have replied inadequately. If he would be interested I
certainly would be prepared to provide him with those examples.

Can I just say, hon Deputy President, that even now, since the election up
until the present time, there are in fact 209 questions, in general,
outstanding in terms of the Rules of Parliament.

You talk, sir, about the fact that we can transfer questions from written
to oral. I would like to say, Mr Speaker, that that is not always the
solution because of the quotas that are applied to members.
May I ask the hon Deputy President one question as to the possibility of
encouraging Ministers to reply in the future? In the provincial legislature
of Gauteng, for example, if a Minister has not replied to an oral question,
or a question, within the specified time, that Minister has to stand up and
explain to the legislature at the next question day why that has not
happened. Would the Deputy President be prepared to consider such a
mechanism in this House? Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, that really is not my gift. I think if
the National Assembly decides to introduce that, I will support it. Thank
you.

The SPEAKER: Members are reminded to press their talk button if they wish
to ask for the floor. Please do not use your neighbour’s button. Use the
button where your name appears.

Adv T M MASUTHA: Speaker, I would like to thank the Deputy President for
his very eloquent answer. From the ANC’s perspective, question time, and
indeed all other platforms for holding the executive to account in terms of
our oversight responsibility, is seen as an opportunity to allow the
executive to give feedback to the people on the progress that is being made
with the delivery of services as well as feedback on their response to the
many challenges that face them. This is the opposite to the grandstanding
and political point-scoring that is often reflected in some of the
questions that some members of the Opposition ask. By doing this they are
simply flooding the House with questions that are purely aimed at scoring
political points.

Deputy President, I want to ask whether you will ensure that, in addition
to responding to the questions that have been asked, the members of the
executive actually ensure that, where measures need to be taken to correct
certain errors, those corrective measures are actually implemented ...

The SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, we proceed from the understanding that
the Ministers or Cabinet should subject themselves to the oversight
responsibility of this Parliament - this National Assembly and the NCOP. As
we understand it, the purpose of such oversight is to ensure that we
discharge our responsibilities in a manner that serves the country.
Therefore, it is in the interest of all of us to comply and co-operate with
the requirements and responsibilities of this august House. Thank you.

The SPEAKER: Hon Mr Ellis, I shall allow you a second supplementary
question. That will be the last one I shall allow you.

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I simply want to ask the Deputy
President whether he would prefer Members of Parliament to stand up and ask
questions of intelligence and purpose, rather than the sweetheart type
questions that Mr Masutha would like us to ask. Surely any Minister, and
certainly the Deputy President, would far prefer to be challenged by
questions rather than simply to be asked the sweetheart type questions that
members of the ANC ask. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, I would assume that all questions are asked
sincerely and it is the sincerity of the questions that really matters,
because the purpose is to ensure that all of us are able to perform our
duties and account to the people of this country who have sent us to this
Parliament. Thank you.

    Fifa 2010 World Cup Tournament: Progress made in meeting obligations
  regarding government guarantees, and in installing a monitoring mechanism
           to ensure adherence to government procurement policies

3.    Mr B M Komphela (ANC) asked the Deputy President:

      (1)   What progress has been made in meeting the Government’s
            obligations with regard to the Government guarantees given to
            Fifa to host the 2010 World Cup Soccer Tournament;

      (2)   whether the Government has put a monitoring mechanism in place
            to ensure that Government procurement policies are adhered to in
            all processes related to the Fifa 2010 World Cup Tournament; if
            not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                   NO856E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, hon Mr B M Komphela, I am pleased to report
that the march towards the successful fulfilment of our 17 guarantees for
delivery of the 2010 Fifa World Cup continues to gain momentum. Many
projects emanating from these guarantees have been put to the test during
the recent Fifa Confederations Cup. As we are all aware, this test
tournament was delivered with great success.

Starting from the first guarantee, which is the issuing of entry and exit
permits, to the last guarantee, which is the availability of comprehensive
medical services, government and the Local Organising Committee, LOC, have
been working together for the successful implementation of these
guarantees.

Among the achievements that I may cite include the following: the
Department of Home Affairs launching and implementing an event-specific
visa in November 2008; the finalisation and implementation of the security
plan; the delivery of elements of the information and telecommunications
technology infrastructure, which was successfully tested during the
Confederations Cup; the development and testing of transport operational
plans; the steady growth in the number of accommodation establishments
signed up and the testing of social cohesion initiatives, as widely
acknowledged during the Confederations Cup.
Although we have a long road ahead of us, I have no doubt that members
present in this House today would agree that, even on the side of the
national team, we are making progress. Their performance is not part of the
17 guarantees, of course, but it is part of the social compact we have with
our own people.

We are quite aware, as has been made public before, that there are areas
that require improvement. Through the 2010 Inter-Ministerial Committee,
IMC, that I chair, we are helping the departments to overcome these
challenges, especially in the areas of transport and accommodation. The IMC
will soon audit the 2010 dividend for our country, in particular, small-
and medium-sized enterprises.

It is true that, as part of our agreements with Fifa, procurement of goods
and services for the 2010 World Cup has to comply with policies and
procedures that apply in the public sector. This applies not only to
government departments and host cities, but also to the Local Organising
Committee, LOC. This means where public funds are involved, the Public
Finance Management Act, and the Municipality Finance Management Act apply.
In brief, procurement processes must be fair, competitive, open and above
board.

To this end, government strives to ensure that procurement processes of
host cities and the Local Organising Committee, which is where most of the
buying happens, comply with our local legal requirements. We do not expect
any department, host city or Local Organising Committee to depart from
these commitments. Where the PFMA, the MFMA and the Employment Equity Act
are not followed, transactions will be reviewed during normal, internal
audit processes as well as during the audit processes by the Auditor-
General. The relevant authority will need to take action commensurate with
the severity of the transgression.

We continue to encourage institutions of government and the LOC to comply
and deliver their respective guarantees within the parameters of all
applicable legislation, policies and regulations. This House must continue
to ask questions and demand accountability from all those involved in the
preparations for the 2010 Soccer World Cup, including the host cities and
LOC. Thank you.

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Thank you, Speaker.

[Thank you, hon Deputy President. I would like to indicate briefly, as you
said, that the signing of these guarantees ensures that even small
businesses gain some benefit. But during the building of stadiums, and
construction of roads and airports, there was a lot of noise, Deputy
President, that some people were being left behind.

We are now asking the Deputy President, as we are approaching the 2010
World Cup, what could be done to ensure that we close the loopholes,
because the likes of Ms Mkhize, Ms Mofokeng and Ms Mokoena do not get
anything here? They are overlooked as if they are asleep. Hon Deputy
President, you find that big businesses, especially our black people, have
forgotten about affirmative action. How will the President ensure that we
follow the noble guidelines set by government? Thank you.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Speaker, the procurement processes with regard to the
construction of stadiums and the expansion of roads benefit all our people.
Of course, no doubt the tenders would be allocated to the most competent
bidder. As far as these primary bidders are concerned, they have a clear
understanding that they need to use subcontractors – some of our small- and
medium-sized operators. In that way, the majority of our people will be
able to benefit from this 2010 Soccer World Cup project. Thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY: Speaker, hon Deputy President, with the possible smokescreen
of the Soccer World Cup to shelter human trafficking and terrorist agendas,
what is being done by government to increase our capacity in this regard?
Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you very much for that question, hon member.
Part of the security establishment’s responsibility is to ensure that all
of our ports of entry are well-equipped and staffed to ensure that the
challenge of human traffickers and those who would like to turn our girl
children into prostitutes are apprehended and brought to book.

Both the security cluster Ministers are well aware of this and it is part
of the preparations. The security forces are attending to this issue. The
same is true of the Department of Home Affairs. I am well aware that this
department has taken steps to ensure that we will benefit from the
experiences of the countries that have hosted this event before us, such as
Germany. Those transgressors who were identified in those countries are
being monitored – I will not give the details here – to ensure that they
don’t bring their nefarious operations to our country.

That is why we are also very eager to ensure that the problems in Zimbabwe
are resolved timeously so that we don’t end up with too many young girls
who are refugees with no fixed abode. Those girls are the ones that would
be soft targets for this kind of operator. Thank you.

Mr J J MCGLUWA: Hon Speaker, after the previous Rugby and Cricket World
Cups in South Africa, a lot of legacy projects have been left behind. I
come from a rural province where some of these projects have become white
elephants. Seeing that most, if not all, of the current stadiums are being
built in metropolitan areas, my question is: What steps have been taken to
ensure the effective and optimal use of the stadiums for the previously
disadvantaged after the World Cup? Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: These stadiums have been built in some of the cities
in rural provinces such as Limpopo and the Eastern Cape. Of course, they
are in the major urban areas, but within reach of all our people, including
the poor. To ensure that the poorest of the poor in rural areas are not
left out, government has introduced or established the Ministry of Rural
Development, because we are well aware that most of the infrastructure
development linked to the Fifa World Cup would take place in the urban
areas, to the exclusion of rural areas.

That is why the Ministry of Rural Development will ensure that we also
invest, as part of our countercyclical measures, in bulk infrastructure
development in rural communities. That is the benefit of having invested in
the Fifa World Cup; it has allowed us the space in the fiscus to divert
resources towards rural development as well. Thank you.

Mnu B H HOLOMISA: Mhlalingaphambili, ndifunda apha kwinkokheli yam
endikhokelayo uKompela ukuba ndingathetha ngesiXhosa. Umbuzo wam uthi,
ingaba Sekela Mongameli ungeza nayo na ingxelo yethutyana ephuma kwikomiti
eququzelayo, equka zonke ezi ndawo sithethe ngazo, ibekwe apha ePalamente
ukuze siyithelekise nezithembiso esazenzayo, nokokuba siza kuziphumeza na
ezo zinto? Kwicala elidibene neziseko zophuliso ezinxulumene nothutho
sasithenjiswe ukuba kuya kubakho imizila kaloliwe kufuphi namabala
emidlalo, kodwa ukuba ungaya kwibala lemidlalo eliseBhayi, kunzima kwa
ukungena phaya ngemoto. Sifuna ingxelo yethutyana kwanokuba ngaba
umgangatho wokwakhiwa wala mabala okudlala uyahambelana na nenkcitho yezi
bhiliyoni. Ndiyabulela.

USEKELA MONGAMELI: Lungu elihloniphekileyo, mandibulele ke ngombuzo wakho.
Ndicinga ukuba siyiKomiti yabaPhathiswa singasenza eso sithembiso sokucela
le ngxelo yethutyana size nayo apha ukuze kuqwalaselwe ukuba imali ithenge
le nto besifuna ukuyithenga na okanye ihle ngomlenze. [Kwahlekwa.] Enkosi.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B H HOLOMISA: Speaker, I am taking the cue from my leader, Komphela,
that I can speak in isiXhosa. My question Deputy President is, can you
bring an interim report from the Local Organising Committee, including
everything we have discussed to be tabled here in Parliament so that we can
compare it with the promises we made and also to see if we will achieve
those things?

As regards transport infrastructure, we were promised railway lines near
the stadia but if you were to go to the stadium in Port Elizabeth, you
would find that it is even difficult to enter with a car. We want an
interim report and also to look at the standard of construction of these
stadia versus the expenditure of these billions. Thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon member, let me thank you for your question. I
think as the Interministerial Committee we can make that promise of
bringing this interim report so that we can check if the money has been
used for what we budgeted for or if it has been mismanaged. [Laughter.]
Thank you.]

  Strengthening of relations with countries of Africa and the world through
                           peacekeeping operations
4.    Mr M S Booi (ANC) asked the Deputy President:

    How do our peacekeeping operations through the SA National Defence
    Force on the African continent strengthen our relationship with these
    countries and the world?           NO857E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, as is commonly known,  both  the  Charter
of the United  Nations  and  the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African  Union
respectively enjoin the international community  and  Africa  to  unite  our
strength to maintain international peace and security and to promote  peace,
security and stability on the continent. The  commitment  to  realise  these
objectives galvanised the AU and its Peace and Security Council as  well  as
regional organisations to find durable solutions to the  countries  affected
by conflict.

The promotion of peace and security is one of South Africa’s most  important
objectives. This  includes  the  strengthening  of  conflict-prevention  and
resolution  capabilities  of  the  region  and  rendering  assistance   with
monitoring and addressing domestic issues that affect stability.  The  SANDF
has formed part of  and  participated  in  various  peace  missions  on  the
continent since 1994.

These include capacity building of  the  Central  African  Republic  Defence
Force; the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo;  integration
and training assistance in the Democratic Republic  of  the  Congo;  the  AU
Special Task Force in Burundi; the UN Mission and  AU  Mission  in  Ethiopia
and Eritrea; the AU together with the  UN  Hybrid  Mission  in  Darfur;  the
Security Sector Reform in the DRC; and the deployment of military  observers
to the AU Mission in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan; and the  Specialist
Advisory Team in the DRC.

In addition to these deployments on the  continent  we  have  also  deployed
observers to be in support  of  the  UN  Political  Mission  in  Nepal.  The
Missions in Burundi and Northern Uganda as  well  as  Ethiopia  and  Eritrea
have been officially terminated,  as  a  consequence  of  progress  made  in
attaining the objectives set.

Our participation in these missions strengthens  our  relations  with  these
countries, the continent and the world at large in a  variety  of  ways.  To
quote but a few  instances:  Both  the  governments  and  peoples  of  these
countries value the contribution that we make and, therefore, relate to  our
own government and people in a variety of areas as friends and partners.

The attainment of peace and stability in these countries and  regions  opens
up possibilities for these areas to attend to  matters  of  economic  growth
and development, in pursuit  of  which  various  sectors  of  South  African
society, from civil society to business, are able to make a contribution.

This helps to strengthen political, economic, cultural and other  relations.
The commitment that South Africa has shown to the attainment  of  peace  and
stability on the continent has improved our standing on  the  continent  and
further afield as a partner in promoting the African agenda and  building  a
better world. I thank you.

Mr M S BOOI: Thank you, Deputy President. As we are preparing for a peace
keeping mission month, where we are going to be showing appreciation for
most of the contributions made by our soldiers, we would like to know from
you as to whether all that has been said is sustainable or not. Is there
any co-operation from these African countries; are they contributing to the
rehabilitation and developmental programmes that we are outlining? We ask
this so that the ordinary citizens of South Africa could appreciate the
contribution that we are making.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, I couldn’t agree more with the hon
member about some of our contributions towards the creation of a more
stable, well-managed continent. I have never seen any remarks about that in
the newspapers. It is only the negative aspects thereof that are given
coverage.

I believe that it is important that our people should know that the
creation of political stability is a great achievement and a great
contribution by the SANDF in many countries that offer many visitors
opportunities - for our investors and for our people. I thank you.

Mr J R B LORIMER: Mr Deputy President, are troops from the Burundi mission
going to be redeployed to another peace keeping mission or are they going
to be deployed to protect South Africa’s borders?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, hon member. I would hope that
the achievement of peace and stability on the continent would exclude any
more possibilities of us deploying our troops outside of our borders. As
much as possible, we should really ensure that these conflict-ridden areas
are stabilised. We will do everything in our power to ensure that the need
for more deployments outside of the country is lessened.

I think the SANDF should be kept in the barracks here at home and only be
deployed outside of the barracks with the permission of this Parliament, so
that we do not militarise our society. I think even the deployment of the
defence force here at home should really be confined to areas of extreme
need. [Interjections.]

There are all kinds of skills in the defence force. We think that the
Ministry of Rural Development can benefit a great deal from some of those
skills in making the quality of life of rural communities much better. As
you know, there are engineers who could build bridges where they did not
exist before.
The Minister of Defence agrees with us that the country could benefit more
from employing the skills in the defence force here at home rather than
keeping them deployed on foreign soil. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Speaker, hon Deputy President, it has been reported that
the SANDF record in Burundi, from 2002 to 2008, included some 400 cases of
misdemeanour and nearly a thousand military trials for offences ranging
from murder and rape to absence without leave and rebelliousness.

It has also been reported that the UN, under whose auspices the peace
keeping missions are run, was said to be shocked at the conduct of the SA
troops. Has the UN ever raised its concerns about the conduct of our
troops, or has any country, where some of these misconducts and crimes were
committed, ever complained? And has such unacceptable behaviour had any
effect on our relationship with these countries? I thank you.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Speaker, on the contrary, the term of the
deployment of these national servicemen in Burundi ended early in 2008. It
was through the UN request that their deployment was extended until the
Burundian president was satisfied that they had done enough to train the
local forces.

I bumped into him in Congo Brazzaville last week Friday and he thanked
South Africa for having assisted in stabilising that country. I think the
impact has been a very positive one. I thank you.

MINISTERS:

 Lessons learnt from successes of SAPS operations during Fifa Confederations
 Cup, to enable SAPS to ensure a safe 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup tournament

17.   Mr G D Schneemann (ANC) asked the Minister of Police:

      (a)   What were the successes of the SA Police Service (SAPS)
      operations during the recent Fifa Confederations Cup and (b) what
      lessons have been learnt to enable the SAPS to ensure a safe and
      secure 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup tournament?      NO845E

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Mr Speaker, we thank the hon Schneemann for asking
a question of such critical significance to our country. Hon members, SAPS,
working in partnership with other departments, did an outstanding job in
managing the safety and security aspects of the Confederations Cup. Our
country received commendations on the success of the soccer competition.

We, as a country, as well as various other bodies, including Fifa itself,
were, in fact, highly delighted and satisfied with the overall management
of the Confederations Cup. There was a noticeable trend of a reduction in
crime in the focal areas, suggesting, amongst other things, the positive
impact of high police visibility. Twenty-five arrests were made in cases
related directly to the event, including a case where two burglary suspects
were arrested, convicted and sentenced within twenty-four hours to a total
of ten years’ imprisonment.

Hon members, we must indeed mention that we benefited immensely from the
fact that our country has accumulated a wealth of experience in hosting
major events. Whether this experience is enough or not, will of course be
tested to the limit next year.

We are also mindful of the fact that the scale of next year’s operation
will be much greater. However, even this aspect should be weighed against
the vast knowledge accumulated through managing a good number of elections.
On the whole, we must reiterate that our government, the people of this
country and the African continent are ready to work in partnership to make
the next Fifa Soccer World Cup the best ever. I thank you.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Deputy Speaker, I thank the hon Minister for his reply.
We want to congratulate our policemen and women for the commitment and
dedication they showed during the Confederations Cup, and also to thank
their families for the sacrifices they had to make during this time. To all
the policemen and women in blue, we want to say that their efforts have
indeed made us proud as South Africans.

There have been recent reports of challenges regarding the employment and
training of security personnel for the Confederations Cup. Could the
Minister indicate whether steps are being taken to ensure that SAPS work
more closely with the Local Organising Committee to ensure that all
security measures are adequate for the 2010 Fifa World Cup next year? Thank
you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any supplementary questions?

Mr S N SWART: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Arising from your response,
hon Minister ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry! Can the Minister reply first? Sorry.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon member has touched on
a critical point. In fact, after the Confederations Cup, we did interact
with the LOC. But I just want to say, as part of what the member has said
in commending the police work, that we did have Plan B in case anything
happened with the security personnel from the private security industry or
the stewards. In fact, those of you who were part of the games would have
noticed that members of the SAPS were indeed at the pitch, as it was
expected earlier on that we were going to have members from the private
security industry. Thank you very much.

Mr S N SWART: Hon Deputy Speaker, arising from your response, hon Minister,
it is clear that we learnt a number of valuable lessons during the
Confederations Cup. One of the incidents that received wide publicity was
the alleged burglary of certain members of the Egyptian team’s hotel room.
I remember reading “Egyptian team robbed”, which clearly was not the case.
Burglary is not robbery. This notwithstanding the fact that members of the
South African delegation to the German Soccer World Cup had their hotel
rooms burgled, with little or no publicity.

However, hon Minister, what progress has been made with the investigations
into this alleged burglary? Is it still alleged that Egyptian team members
may have allowed the perpetrators into their rooms; and what steps will be
put in place to avoid such incidents next year? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the hon member. This
is a matter which was highly publicised and it came out in a very nasty
way, particularly within the media circles in South Africa. But, yes, the
matter was investigated and a conclusion was reached on the matter: There
wasn’t any foreign forced entry into the rooms, and so on. And we were
satisfied with the progress that was made there.

The point which we need to emphasise from that process is that indeed
members of SAPS were up and about to ensure the safety of people and our
visitors to the country, and yet we still emphasise that that happened!
Thank you very much.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Minister, considering the
security debacle during the Confederations Cup, which resulted in the
Private Security Regulatory Authority instituting an investigation into
allegations that the organising committee and its service providers
employed unqualified security guards and stewards and considering that the
security manager has just resigned - apparently shortly before being
pushed, in fact - and considering that two weeks before the kick-off no
company had even been appointed to provide security, is the SAPS ready,
financially and procedurally, to step in yet again should these
arrangements prove to be equally chaotic for 2010, without our citizens
being left unprotected as a result?

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Hon member, the issue of
the security we have just addressed here. As you know, Fifa regulations
only allow private security or stewards on the pitch. We are in talks with
the LOC, as the committee convened by the Deputy President of the Republic,
to ensure that members of the private security industry do their job. If
stewards are supposed to be on the pitch, they should be on the pitch. But
as I said earlier on, we have taken extra care, particularly with these
activities, which involve the entire world as it were. The SAPS will always
be ready, and we’ll be ready come 2010. Thank you very much.

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, does SAPS have detailed
crime statistics, specifically related to the Confederations Cup, that
could be used to analyse trends in preparation for the 2010 Fifa World Cup?
If so, Minister, can that information be made available?

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the hon member. I am
sure we can make those statistics available. But statistics as such will
form part of the annual report on statistics, as it were, which will be
released. That is one of the questions that is coming up as we proceed.

But on the issue of the Confederations Cup, there were specific incidents
and I’ve just mentioned the statistics here. We do not have more than the
ones we have mentioned here, including the arrests that were made during
the Confederations Cup, particularly, and focusing around the games and the
areas where the games were played. This includes accommodation areas such
as hotels and so on. So that’s what we can repeat, or we can just forward
it to the member. Thank you very much.

 Referral of release on parole to Correctional Supervision and Parole Review
                                    Board

6.    Mr J Selfe (DA) asked the Minister of Correctional Services:

      Whether she will refer the release on medical parole of a certain
      person (name furnished) to the Correctional Supervision and Parole
      Review Board; if not, why not; if so, (a) when and (b) what are the
      further relevant details?               NO832E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, thank you to the hon
Selfe. I have articulated my position clearly on this matter before, Mr
Selfe. In fact, what is even more interesting to me is that you do not ask
or state why it is that I should send this matter for review. And yet I am
required to supply reasons why I have not done this.

I have indicated in the past that unless I am provided with compelling
reasons to take this matter for review, I will not do so. Until such time
as this information is provided to me, I will not do so.

It is not, in fact, correct that I should act on the basis of information
that is in the public domain through the media. I thought that we all
understood procedures and how the parole system works; and therefore I
cannot be expected to take a matter of this nature for review on the basis
of the public outcry and of information contained in the media. Thank you.

Mr J SELFE: Deputy Speaker, thank you to the Minister for that reply. I
would suggest to the hon Minister that the compelling reasons lie in the
fact that by all accounts Mr Shaik is well enough to drive around Durban
streets, yet Mr Shaik was released in terms of section 79 of the
Correctional Services Act.

That section states that an offender can be released on medical parole only
if he or she is in “the final phase of any terminal disease or condition”
in order “to die a consolatory and dignified death”.

Now if the decision to release Mr Shaik was based on sound medical grounds,
why is the Minister so reluctant to have this decision reviewed?
Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, what are Mr Shaik’s parole conditions;
is he adhering to his parole conditions? And why, if he has been released
to “die a consolatory and dignified death”, has he got parole conditions at
all? [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Well enough to drive around? The two of us don’t know that. We read about
it. The two of us don’t know. We have not seen it. [Interjections.] Well, I
saw a photograph of a car supposedly with Mr Shaik’s registration number; I
did not see Mr Shaik in the car and I don’t even know where the car was
parked. That is the first point.

Secondly, I don’t know what that means. I don’t understand. I know when you
talk about “terminal disease” or “terminal suffering”, it means “dying”.
Nyani ke! [It is true!]. But if you have a terminal disease, does it imply
that you may not be able to work, move around, get into a car and drive? I
don’t know. [Interjections.] Thula, thula, Natsika! [Keep quiet, Natsika!]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: The person next to Ma Njobe - I’ve
forgotten the name - allow me to talk. Just wait, then you can ask a follow-
up question, right? [Interjections.] Kohler-Barnard, honourable, just be
honourable.

Now, Mr Selfe, the other thing that I wanted to say to you is that I
thought you and I know that there are parole officers responsible for each
one of the parolees, and unfortunately for you and me, I have not received
a letter from a parole officer suggesting that there is a case for Mr Shaik
to answer. Now I cannot base my actions purely on what I read in the media.
I have to be given information.

Maybe as part of your oversight function you should actually call the
parole officer to account. What I do have, is a file that contains
information about communications between Mr Shaik and the parole officer on
occasions where he has requested to be released to go out of his premises.
[Interjections.] Kohler? Now I really cannot be expected to act on the
basis of media reports, with due respect. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms P DE LILLE: Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, if some miracle happened and
Mr Shaik recovered, and he is not dying and he is fit again ... [Laughter.]
You know, a miracle could be drinking French wine, eating curry and a
miracle happens and he recovers. If he recovers, will he be sent back to
prison, because then certainly he didn’t die?

I think the Minister must explain this. I don’t know what the law says. I
don’t know if the law says that if you recover and there is a miracle that
you must be sent back to prison. What is the legal position? Thank you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: I also don’t know, but what I would
propose is that the portfolio committee needs to amend the Correctional
Services Act in order to make sure that if a person does not die at a time
when we all anticipated that the person would die, that then there should
be action taken by way of sending the person back to prison. It is not I
who can take that kind of decision; it is the portfolio committee, if it so
wishes, which can propose an amendment to the Correctional Services Act.

Mr T W COETZEE: Madam Deputy Speaker, in connection with what the hon
Minister said about not being able to react to articles and suggestions,
she is the responsible Minister. Why doesn’t she then ask for an in-depth
investigation around Mr Shaik? If she doesn’t know, why doesn’t she make it
her business to find out and report to the National Assembly?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Deputy Speaker, one of the things
all of us have been saying - and in fact you have said so in the past - is
that Mr Shaik should be treated like any other person, like any other
citizen, like any other former inmate who is now out on parole. He is not
the only one who was released at the time on medical parole. But what we
are doing is drawing a lot of attention to an individual and we are
elevating him, in my view.

I really suggest that we should actually request the department to come and
present to the portfolio committee a whole list of names of people who have
been released on medical parole.

Secondly, I want to remind hon members that we have already referred this
matter to Judge Desai and the Parole Review Board for them to develop a
policy around medical parole. What we have, indeed, is that we release a
person on the basis that the person is about to die, but in fact a number
of them have not as yet died. Maybe they are dying, but they have not as
yet died.

I really want to request that, even with regard to that, it is the
responsibility of the portfolio committee to monitor and make contributions
and inputs to Judge Desai and his team, to make sure that the whole area of
medical parole is properly defined. Thanks.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would just want you to make a
ruling, please, with reference to Rule 61, which says that no member shall
refer to any other member by his or her first name or names only. I heard
the Minister refer to the hon Diane Kohler-Barnard as “Kohler” and “Kohler-
Barnard”, and I don’t think that is parliamentary. [Applause.]

Mr T W COETZEE: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: With due
respect, the Minister did not answer any of my questions. Could she answer
what I have asked her, please?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we move to the next question?

    Questions regarding sustainability of government of national unity in
   Zimbabwe and implementation of provisions in Global Political Agreement

16.   Ms M E Pilusa-Mosoane (ANC) asked the Minister of International
      Relations and Co-operation:

      (1)   Whether the government of national unity can be sustained in
            view of the Movement for Democratic Change’s (MDC) complaints of
            breaches by Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe; if not, why not; if so, what
            are the relevant details;


      (2)   whether the provisions in the Global Political Agreement have
            been fully implemented to ensure that conditions for free and
            fair elections are created; if not, why not; if so, what are the
            relevant details?                      NO844E

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m sorry to interrupt further, but the
hon Terblanche did in fact raise a point of order and you haven’t ruled on
that at all. I’m sure that you should rule and simply say that the hon
Minister should ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I’m attending to that; I will rule at some stage.

Mr M J ELLIS: Only at some stage?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.

Mr M J ELLIS: Fine. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND CO-OPERATION (Ms S C van
der Merwe): Deputy Speaker, the answer to the question is yes, indeed,
there have been very many positive developments in Zimbabwe since the
January 2009 SADC Extraordinary Summit. These developments include the
passing of Constitutional Amendment 19; they also include the formation of
the inclusive government and the passing of the National Security Bill,
amongst other things. The country’s parliament is also working to fulfil
its constitutional mandate and the Joint Monitoring and Implementation
Committee is functioning.

There is, therefore, noticeable progress regarding the functioning of the
inclusive government, notwithstanding the few outstanding issues which
still need to be resolved. All the parties are committed to the full
implementation of the Global Political Agreement, GPA, and South Africa,
SADC and the AU as the guarantors of the GPA will remain seized with
developments in Zimbabwe and will provide the necessary support to the
Zimbabwean political leadership to implement the GPA.

The constitution-making process is also progressing, notwithstanding some
concerns raised by civil society. Of importance, we believe, is the fact
that they continue to participate in the process and as we know, under the
GPA, these parties must draft a new constitution for Zimbabwe in order for
it to be put to the electorate in a referendum.

Now, recognising the progress in the political and economic reforms that
has been made since the formation of the inclusive government in February
this year, and also notwithstanding the two outstanding issues that have
been referred to SADC for mediation, it is our view that the inclusive
government can be sustained and it is the view of our department that the
outstanding issues will be resolved soon.

The answer to the second part of the question is “no”. Provisions of the
GPA have not yet been fully implemented. In order to ensure the conditions
for free and fair elections, however, an inclusive and participatory
process is underway to draft this new constitution for Zimbabwe under which
future elections will be conducted. Thank you.

Ms M E PILUSA-MOSOANE: Deputy Speaker and hon Deputy Minister, I am
satisfied with the response to this question. Thank you.

Mr G G BOINAMO: Deputy Speaker, will the Minister consider the appointment
of a joint task team between officials of the Department of International
Relations and Co-operation and the Department of Home Affairs, and perhaps
the Department of Trade and Industry, to assess the social and economic
impact that the inflow of the political refugees from Zimbabwe has had on
service delivery in South Africa? Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND CO-OPERATION (Ms S C van
der Merwe): Deputy Speaker, once again I think the supplementary question
has nothing to do with the original question which related essentially to
the sustainability of the new Global Political Agreement and the new
government in Zimbabwe. However, I will certainly take the question of the
hon member back to the Minister for consideration.

I’m sure that she and her colleagues in the Department of Home Affairs and,
indeed, in the Department of Trade and Industry are engaged in such
activities and in reflecting on what some of these matters mean to us in
South Africa. Thank you very much.

Mr K S MUBU: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon Deputy Minister, there are
serious reports of continued human rights violations, intimidation and
arbitrary arrests of MDC activists by the police in Zimbabwe. It is known
that the Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, is losing its majority in
Parliament because of these arrests.

Just to give one example: The husband of the Minister of Regional
Integration and International Co-operation in Zimbabwe, who is an MDC
Mutambara official, passed away this week after being attacked in her home
in Harare in July by Zanu-PF thugs. What is the department doing to address
the deteriorating human rights situation in Zimbabwe? [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND CO-OPERATION (Ms S C van
der Merwe): Hon Mr Mubu has a question on the Order Paper a little later on
which refers to the report that he is quoting from and we will answer that
duly when that arises.

Suffice it to say at this stage, hon Mr Mubu, that we as a government are
fully engaged with the process in Zimbabwe, also as SADC members, in the
reconstruction and the developments that are taking place in Zimbabwe.

It is South Africa’s wish and desire that Zimbabwe return fully to
democracy and that the Global Political Agreement agreed to by all parties
is fully implemented, as I’ve indicated in my response.

South Africa, of all countries in the world, has been the one that has
stuck with the process and has taken measures and worked extremely hard in
order to see that there is a peaceful and satisfactory resolution to the
difficulties that that country has faced. Thank you.

 National unity of Palestinian people as a factor in political negotiations
                        between Israel and Palestine

20.   Mr M B Skosana (IFP) asked the Minister of International Relations
      and Co-operation:

      (1)   Whether the disunity of the Palestinian people was found to be a
            major impediment to the political negotiations between Israel
            and Palestine; if not, what is the position in this regard; if
            so, on what were such findings based;

      (2)   whether she will assist in bringing about the national unity of
            the Palestinian people; if not, why not; if so, what are the
            relevant details?                      NO848E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND CO-OPERATION (Ms S C van
der Merwe): Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. The position of the South
African government on this matter has been that the current divide between
Fatah and Hamas does indeed present an impediment to political negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians in that any final political solution,
we believe, to the conflict has to have the support of the major political
formations in Palestine, including Hamas.

Whilst the Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas can
negotiate with Israel, as he is the president of the PLO, the current
divide between the Fatah-controlled West Bank and the Hamas- controlled
Gaza make any final, negotiated solutions to the conflict very difficult to
implement.
In response to the second part of the question, the South African
Representative Office in Ramallah continues to engage with the PNA, PLO and
Fatah as well as Hamas in the course of diplomatic practice, in an effort
to promote national unity in Palestine. Our government encourages both
formations to form a national unity government until new elections can be
held in Palestine.

South Africa also continues to encourage the unity of the Palestinian
people through and within international forums such as the UN Security
Council and the Non-Aligned Movement. Thank you.

 Questions regarding management and administration of Marievale, as well as
                         occupation of houses there

3.    Mr P J Groenewald (FF Plus) asked the Minister of Defence and
      Military Veterans:

      (1)   Whether the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) is responsible for
            the management and administration of Marievale; if not, who is
            responsible for it; if so,

      (2)   whether residents are allowed to stay on in the houses; if so,
            for how long; if not, why not;

      (3)   whether alternative housing will be provided; if not, why not;
            if so, what are the relevant details;
      (4)   whether she has been informed about the safety concerns and
            illegal occupation of some of the houses; if so, what steps are
            being taken in this regard;


      (5)   whether the SANDF provides daily transport to its members from
            Marievale; if not, why not; if so, (a) to which bases and (b)
            what do the monthly costs amount to?         NO827E

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS: Hon Groenewald, Marievale is
a military base on the East Rand, in the Johannesburg area, and has been a
matter of concern for many Members of Parliament; it has been a concern of
members of the community around there, too. It has since also become a very
serious concern to me.

After a great deal of confusion over who is responsible for the base, we
have finally arranged that we, as the Defence Force, are responsible for
it. Therefore, the answer is that we are responsible for the administration
and the maintenance of the base.

The second question is: Who lives on the base? We have two types of people
who live on the base. There are the residents, the official residents, who
are SANDF personnel. We also have the unofficial residents – the illegal
occupants. The legal residents are allowed to stay, because they work in
that environment, and we are trying to assist the illegal residents to find
better accommodation elsewhere.
The Department of Defence and Military Veterans and the Department of
Public Works, in conjunction with the municipality of Ekurhuleni, are in
the process of seeking alternative accommodation for the illegal occupants.
We are very aware of the danger around the area that they live in, and an
interdepartmental task team has been set up to facilitate this.

Yes, I have been informed about the concerns about the area, and I have
been given a general overview of the military base. There is no transport
arranged for the people who live there, the official residents. They are
members of the construction and engineering regiments and their work is
very close by, within walking distance, so we have not arranged any
transport for them. Thank you.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Adjunkspeaker, eerstens, baie dankie vir die volledige
antwoord van die agb Minister. [Deputy Speaker, firstly, I would like to
thank the hon Minister for her comprehensive answer.]

You can leave the earpiece, hon Minister, I’ll change to English. Actually,
I was thanking you for the thorough answer to my question. Deputy Speaker,
as the hon Minister said, it was a serious concern for her as well. I think
if there is one common aspect about any individual’s life, it is that he or
she wants certainty about the place where he or she lives and can stay. Now
there is clarity, because the community wants to develop the area for the
benefit of the entire community and, of course, it will also benefit the
SANDF.
My follow-up question is: Is the Minister willing to go - I don’t expect
her to go herself, as Minister - or rather send a very senior official,
whom I would like to accompany, to the people and the residents of
Marievale and explain the situation to them so that there can be certainty
also for those people? Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS: Yes, I’d be very happy to
accompany you to the military base, but not for the reasons that you
outline. We, ourselves, are very concerned and very interested in
developing the environment, and if the community there would like to
develop a golf course, I would also like to develop a golf course for my
people. Their health and general recreation is very important to me, so we
would be going there for two different reasons.

I have certainly dealt often enough with the kind of problem concerning
illegal occupants and will be very sensitive to ensure that they are given
the benefit of a discussion between us and them and an indication of what
other arrangements have been made.

Hon Mr Groenewald, if the community has approached you because they are
interested in developing it for their own purposes, we are also interested.
So please carry this message to them. We will develop it for ourselves, and
it will be in very good condition. Thank you.

  Measures to reduce backlogs in court processes and otherwise accommodate
                          awaiting-trial detainees

15.   Mr V G Smith (ANC) asked the Minister of Correctional Services:

      (a) What measures are in place to reduce backlogs in court processes,
      (b) what other alternatives are in place to release awaiting-trial
      detainees (ATD) who cannot afford bail, (c) what is the progress
      regarding ten correctional centres earmarked for conversion to remand
      detention facilities and (d) when will ATD be transferred to these
      facilities?                 NO843E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you Deputy Speaker, and thanks
to hon Mr Smith for the question. The Department of Correctional Services
is participating at the National Integrated Case Flow Management Committee,
NICFMC, which is a cluster structure under the leadership of the Department
of Justice and Constitutional Development.

It is a primary reality that these delays are court delays and, therefore,
not in the domain of the Correctional Services Management. The Department
of Correctional Services uses the relevant criminal procedure provisions
that enable the following: correctional supervision as an alternative to
bail where appropriate; reduction of bail applications in terms of section
63(1); applications by heads of centres for detainees to be released in
lieu of bail or the amendment of bail conditions, where appropriate, in
terms of section 63(a); the placement of under-18 awaiting-trial detainees,
ATDs, under correctional supervision of a correctional officer in terms of
section 71; and, of course, plea bargaining in terms of section 10
(105)(a).

The successful use of these provisions requires close co-operation between
the criminal justice system departments. There is a continuous process of
engagement between these departments at various levels. There are, of
course, 11 existing correctional centres earmarked for conversion to remand
detention facilities.

The Commissioner of Correctional Services has approved it that an in-depth
cost analysis be carried out to determine the possibility of refurbishing
these existing facilities. The analysis will be used to request funding
from the National Treasury for the refurbishment project. The assistance of
the National Department of Public Works has been requested to appoint a
team of consultants to carry out the cost analysis. This analysis is
expected to be finalised in the current financial year. I thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you Minister. Is there a supplementary question
hon Smith?

Mr V G SMITH: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Thank you, Minister, for
clarifying that this is an issue not restricted to correctional services
only. However, Minister, the founding provisions of our Constitution talk
to human dignity and the advancement of human rights. The Bill of Rights
talks to individuals not being deprived of their freedom arbitrarily or
without just cause.

But we have in our system many individuals who are incarcerated purely
because they can’t afford bail of R1 000, and they clearly are not a threat
to society. When do you think this joint cluster approach will deal with
that matter?

Secondly, in terms of the awaiting-trial detainees, you have 33 female
awaiting-trial detainees, and five of them have been in prison for more
than three years; that’s about 15%. Of the 2 847 male awaiting-trial
detainees, 512 of them ... [Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon member Vincent Smith may be
aware that there is what is called a “bail protocol”, which has recently
been signed by the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Police and the
Department of Correctional Services. The Bail Protocol is meant to assist
us in releasing people whose bails are less than R1 000. That is another
way of dealing with overcrowding in the area of awaiting-trial detainees.

I also agree, hon member, that it is inhumane and unconstitutional to have
people who are awaiting-trial detainees in the main prison in our
facilities. It is for that reason that that team which was reviewing the
entire functioning of the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security, JCPS,
cluster directed us, as the Department of Correctional Services, to
establish within the department a branch that will purely look after the
needs and management of the awaiting-trial detainees. It is because of the
conditions under which the awaiting-trial detainees are currently kept. We
are looking into that matter.

I’m really sorry, hon member, that you could not finish the last question
because I didn’t understand what the question was about.

Mr A T FRITZ: Hon Minister, year after year the problem of overcrowding is
raised. The question from the DA is: When is the Minister going to look at
an accurate forecasting model of the prison population, where the Minister
can say what the number of awaiting-trial people coming into your centres
in the next five years will be? That is the first part of it.

The second part is that both Judge Jali, from the Jali Commission, and
Judge Yekiso, from the Office of the Inspecting Judge, referred to
forecasting models. I think the time has come for us to look at this,
because we are going to spend R8 billion on new prisons in the next
financial year. We really need to look at some forecasting models. That is
my question, Madam Speaker.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you very much, Mr Fritz. I
don’t know what the predictions will be or how to forecast the coming in of
new people, because the business challenge we have as the Department of
Correctional Services is that, as you release people, more people come into
our centres.

At the point when we joined the Department of Correctional Services, we had
plus-minus 67 000 awaiting-trial detainees. That was in May. There are many
awaiting-trial detainees who have since left our centres, but the numbers
are not being reduced, as you are aware.

Much as we are applying all these procedures of trying to alleviate the
load and relieve correctional services of people who are awaiting-trial
detainees, there is, unfortunately, an increase in violent crimes committed
by some people; and the courts obviously decide not to grant bail to
persons who have been involved in very serious and violent crimes. They
don’t grant them bail. We have to live with the reality that we will
continue to have that problem.

Lastly, I have been saying, Mr Fritz and hon members, that building more
facilities, building more prisons, is not the solution to the challenges of
our society. What is of importance is for us to prevent our children from
committing crime. That is what we need to address, because if you look at
the number of awaiting-trial detainees and even the number of people who
are incarcerated at the centres, 70% of those are young people who range in
age from 17 to 35 years.

We cannot have an entire generation of people being incarcerated in
prisons. There is something which we have to do as a society. We have to
take responsibility for what is currently going on in the country, and we
have to come to an indaba and discuss what has gone wrong for us to be
having these kinds of numbers at our centres and that are also made up of
mainly young people. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr S N SWART: Thank you, Deputy Speaker and hon Minister for those comments
about our children, which we fully endorse. We have supported the
restorative justice approach in the Child Justice Bill to prevent
reoffending, particularly where there is no danger to society.

Minister, you referred to various initiatives to cut down on the awaiting-
trial population and you made reference to section 63(a). Is there not a
reluctance to make use of that provision, because the head of a prison then
has to admit that the conditions have reached such an overcrowded level
that the health of prisoners and wardens is at risk?

As it’s only under such circumstances that applications can be brought
under section 63(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, would that not in
another sense be a matter of the commissioner admitting a failure before
such an application can be brought? Is that not the reason why we see few
applications in terms of section 63(a)? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: It can’t be an admission of failure,
really. I think that the Office of the Inspecting Judge, Mr Van Zyl, is
quite vibrant and very active, and he is keeping all of us on our toes.
That is the first thing.

The second issue of overcrowding is a matter which is under discussion and
one which has actually become a matter of public debate on how we can best
deal with the issue of overcrowding. I think that it wouldn’t be too
embarrassing or shameful for heads of centres to acknowledge that there is
a problem of overcrowding.

In fact, in a number of instances, we have come up with statistics as to
the number of bed spaces we have and what number of occupants we have. So
it is the bed space as against the number of people incarcerated at the
centres.

We know that in many instances we are way above the numbers we should be
having at our centres. In some cases, overcrowding is at the level of 200%
or even more. I don’t think that that is embarrassing; maybe the police are
doing a good job.

What is needed is for us to get the courts to appreciate that custodial
sentences are not necessarily the best. There are alternative ways of
dealing with crime. The issue of conversion of custodial sentences to
correctional supervision comes up.

It applies to ATDs, and people should understand that to send a girl child
who is 15 or 16 years old to prison for shoplifting to await trial for over
a year is inhumane and unconstitutional. A lot of work needs to be done by
mainly the judiciary to appreciate that prison or correctional centres
cannot be the only answer to the ills of society. Thank you.

 Request for particulars of any arms deal approved by the NCACC in the past
                               financial year

5.    Mr D J Maynier (DA) asked the Minister of Justice and Constitutional
      Development:

      (1)   Whether the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC)
            has approved any arms deal in the past financial year; if so,
            (a) to which country, (b) what weapon system, (c) what are the
            names of the persons who approved the deal and (d) on what date
            was the deal approved;

      (2)   whether the committee had a quorum when the deal was approved;
            if not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                              NO831E

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (on behalf of the Minister of
Justice and Constitutional Development): Madam Deputy Speaker, the reply to
the question is as follows: With respect to Part 1, over the period of
April 2008 to March 2009 the committee did consider and authorise arms
sales transactions to a number of countries.

Since its assumption of duty on 21 July 2009, the current committee has
considered and approved the 2008 National Conventional Arms Control Co-
ordinating Committee annual report. This annual report was prepared in
compliance with the provisions of section 23 of the National Conventional
Arms Control Act of 2002. To that end this annual report covers the 2008
calendar year, as prescribed by section 23 of the Act.

The committee is in the process of tabling the 2008 annual report to
Parliament. The countries and arms categories that are involved in these
transactions are reflected in that annual report. In view of this, the
House and hon members are requested to allow the tabling of the 2008 annual
report to take place. Once this is done, the committee will be available to
Parliament to discuss the contents of the annual report.

We answer in that fashion, Madam Deputy Speaker, because the list of
transactions is extremely long and is in the annual report in full. Members
of the portfolio committee have invited the chairperson of the control
committee to appear before the portfolio committee on 2 September. The
meeting is already on the committee timetable of meetings. Therefore the
committee will have the opportunity to peruse and consider the full details
of that report.

With respect to Part 2 of the question, as far as the newly constituted
National Conventional Arms Control Committee is concerned, all meetings
held thus far have been based on prescribed quorum requirements. With
respect to the 2008 calendar year, the report that will be tabled in
Parliament reflects business conducted in terms of the said Act.

Mr D J MAYNIER: Madam Deputy Speaker, we say in the preamble to legislation
regulating the conventional arms trade that our country is a responsible
member of the international community and will not trade in conventional
arms with states engaged in repression, aggression or terrorism.

Now, the National Conventional Arms Control Committee, under the leadership
of Minister Jeff Radebe, stepped up to the plate and did the right thing
when they recently refused to authorise the sale of thousands of aviator G-
suits to Iran. Will the Minister once again step up to the plate and do the
right thing, and give this House the assurance that she will stop the sale
of thousands of sniper rifles to Syria and millions of rounds of ammunition
to Zimbabwe?

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have
indicated, when we conduct our business as the committee we do so in terms
of the Act and its provisions. I do not deviate in any way in my reply from
that assurance to the House.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, there is a bit of confusion here: The
hon Maynier would like to ask a second supplementary question.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Maynier, if you are serious about the second
question, can you do that?

Mr D J MAYNIER: Madam Deputy Speaker, I am serious. The National
Conventional Arms Control Committee is due, as the Minister says, to appear
before the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans on
Wednesday, 2 September 2009. Will the Minister be prepared to provide
members of the portfolio committee with copies of all the minutes of all
meetings of the NCACC as well as copies of the minutes of all meetings and
supporting documentation of the scrutiny committee which advised the NCACC
over the past five years before that meeting?

If the Minister has nothing to hide, she surely must be prepared to provide
the documents to the members of the committee. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a little
surprised. The hon member indicated that he is fully aware of the contents
of the Act and its provisions. I do not recall any section of the Act,
which I have read copiously, as he has done, that demands the sorts of
documents he has referred to. What the committee will get is the annual
report, as required in section 23 of the Act. As to other documentation, I
think that matter will be dealt with in the process of the meeting, but
there is no requirement in the Act for such. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D J MAYNIER: Madam Deputy Speaker ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Maynier, surely you know that you cannot ask a third
supplementary question. You can ask a maximum of two supplementary
questions.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Rules make it quite clear that
there will be four supplementary questions to every question, but the Rules
do not indicate that any one person is limited to two questions only – the
Rules do not state that. And one person can ask all four supplementary
questions if there are no other supplementary questions from any other
party.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any other further supplementary questions?

Mr D J MAYNIER: Yes, there are.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: The hon Maynier would like this question, I am asking
for the following one, so that I am not put last on the list again.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that a question or a comment?

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Madam Deputy Speaker, I was answering your request.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Maynier, I shall very, very reluctantly allow you
the third one, which will be the last one.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: Why would you
reluctantly allow him a third question, and if necessary ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Because there has been a practice of allowing two
questions and this session is structured so that everybody can ask
questions, not just one person ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: If I may, Madam Deputy Speaker ...
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I don’t think we are going to have a dialogue, Mr
Ellis. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, it’s a very important principle,
because what happens today will happen in the future. I will write to you
and we will sort it out. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon Ellis! Do that at another time. Let us not
have a dialogue. Hon Maynier? [Interjections.]

Mr D J MAYNIER: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Minister of International
Relations and Co-operation, Mr Ebrahim Ebrahim, recently made a very
welcome statement on the situation in Burma, when he said that the
government of South Africa was deeply saddened and regretted the decision
of the Myanmar authorities to convict Aung San Suu Kyi on charges of
subversion.

It appears that this government has made a foreign policy about-turn, and
for once we are supporting the democrats and not the dictators. But it was
not always so, and in the light of this, would the Minister tell this House
whether the National Conventional Arms Control Committee has ever
authorised or refused any permit in relation to conventional arms transfers
to the military regime in Burma?

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I had thought that
there was some clarity when it was said that there is a law and that law
doesn’t say that you have to go into the details of what has been presented
before the committee. I thought that the hon member had read the law, and
the law just says that a particular report will be presented to Parliament.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon Booi. Can we ask the Minister to be the
one to decide on that?

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Madam Deputy Speaker, that is a
very different question. However, in terms of the information available to
me, all details with respect to countries and types of arms purchased will
be in the 2008 report submitted to Parliament - all countries and the types
of arms provided or sold.

  Particulars regarding prosecution of head of Krugersdorp organised crime
           unit and others on charges related to drug trafficking

13.   Rev K R J Meshoe (ACDP) asked the Minister of Police:

      (1)   Whether (a) the head of the Krugersdorp organised crime unit and
            (b) two of his subordinates who were arrested in March for
            charges related to drug trafficking have been successfully
            prosecuted; if not, why not, in each case; if so, what sentences
            were imposed on them, in each case;
      (2)   whether the drug lords who were buying drugs from them have also
            been (a) arrested and (b) prosecuted successfully; if not, why
            not, in each case; if so, what are the relevant details, in each
            case?            NO839E

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, the criminal trial involving the
head of the Krugersdorp organised crime unit and the other members has not
yet been finalised by the court. The matter was postponed to 12 October
2009, in the High Court in Johannesburg. Considering that the matter is now
in our courts, we believe that hon members will appreciate the need for
caution in discussing such matters. Thank you.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Thank you, hon Minister, for the reply. We heard this
afternoon from the Minister of Correctional Services that about 70% of
awaiting-trial detainees are young people. Many of them, I’m sure,
especially those who are still in detention for violent crimes, have access
to illegal habit-forming drugs. It is mainly these young people we want to
protect from druglords and crime syndicates.

We believe that severe sentences - while I understand that the matter is
before the courts - have to be imposed on druglords and that syndicates
have to be smashed, so that our children can grow up in drug-free areas.
Will the Minister consider giving the challenge of smashing drug
traffickers and druglords to the newly established Hawks, so that this
problem can be solved once and for all? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, in spirit I agree with the hon Rev
Meshoe. The syndicates that we are talking about, not only for drug
trafficking, but also for other scourges like human trafficking are part of
the programme of the broader SAPS. And, as you know, because these are
priority crimes, the new unit, the DPCI, or the Hawks, as we refer to them,
will be dealing with this as well. It is a broader challenge within the
entire Police Service. Thank you.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Deputy Speaker, could the Minister explain to this
House why it is that cases against members of SAPS are kept out of the
public eye, when transparency in this sort of unutterably distasteful case
is called for, with SAPS proving to the citizens of this country that they
deal harshly with transgressions of the law on the part of their members?

Is it perhaps that in instances the punishment in relation to an infraction
by SAPS members so seldom seems commensurate with the initial action? For
example, when two Volksrust officers locked a female into an all-male cell
where she was gang-raped, they were told not to do it again for six months,
after which it would be expunged from their records. They face no loss of
income, no demotion - in fact, nothing at all. Surely, this lack of firm
action not only undermines the morale of the good cops, but also
discourages people from co-operating with the police.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, I find that contradictory. How do
you then know that there are cases which involve police if there are no
records and if they are kept away from the public? You know, because
everybody knows, because SAPS works for the entire nation and each and
every case is equal to any other.

The issue of drugs that has been raised here, and which I think we should
confine ourselves to, as referred to by the hon Rev Meshoe, is a matter, as
I have said, which is being dealt with; but I don’t think we should come
and mislead the House and say those cases which involve police are kept
away from the public eye. It’s not true. Thank you.

Mr V V MAGAGULA: Deputy Speaker, what measures have SAPS put in place to
ensure that men and women of integrity are deployed to the organised crime
unit, and what other measures could be implemented to reduce such incidents
in the future? I thank you.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, as the hon member knows, we
launched a new unit, DPCI, which took on board members of the crime unit,
amongst other things. Subsequent to that, a thorough process of vetting and
security clearance is still being undertaken, because we made the point
that we should be thorough as far as that is concerned. Rather delay for
the thorough process and outcome thereof, than rush the process. Thank you
very much.

Mr L RAMATLAKANE: Deputy Speaker, I’m sure it’s allowed to have a minor
deviation from the norm concerning a maiden speech and that I may have a
supplementary question today; and I will make my maiden speech at the next
available opportunity.

We believe and we want to say that the police are doing very, very good
work. We are all indebted to them and we must always support them when they
do a good job - all of us. Therefore, we shouldn’t take a position where we
paint all the police with the same brush. There are a few, however, who are
behaving inappropriately in the police, in terms of committing crime.

I want to ask the Minister whether there are any records kept in the
department of the police’s alleged involvement in drug trafficking, and if
the department has the capacity to detect it and, of course, prosecute all
those who are involved in inappropriate behaviour in the department?

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, hon member, not much has changed,
since the last time you were the MEC of Safety and Security in the Western
Cape. [Laughter.]

The hon member will know that, in terms of statistics, whether you are a
member of the police or not, if you are engaged and involved in crime, you
are recorded as such - a criminal. Perhaps a special request for just
focusing on the police can be put forward, because we may want to talk
about this matter to see what we can do. Thank you very much.

  Particulars of rewards and training given to patrollers working with SAPS
                                 in Gauteng

14.   Ms M T Kubayi (ANC) asked the Minister of Police:

      (1)   Whether patrollers in Gauteng who work with the SA Police
            Service (SAPS) to help keep communities safe receive any form of
            stipend or reward; if not, how are they motivated to continue
            their work with the SAPS; if so, what are the relevant details;

      (2)   whether these patrollers receive any form of training; if so,
            (a) what form of training and (b) at what level of National
            Qualifications Framework (NQF); if not,

      (3)   whether there are any plans to provide them with training; if
            not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                         NO842E

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Deputy Speaker, I thank the hon member for the
question. The Community Patroller Project is one of the projects that has
been initiated by the Department of Community Safety in the Gauteng
province. Patrollers receive a R300 voucher as a token of appreciation. The
vouchers are issued on a quarterly basis and are meant for volunteers or
patrollers who would have actively participated in the patrol activities
during each period under review.

As part of improving the programme, Gauteng is considering further
developing the skills of volunteers through learnership programmes and
facilitating support from other government institutions, with a view to
achieving the following: assisting in equipping these patrollers for
employment opportunities; and encouraging entrepreneurship amongst
patrollers, which could result in them empowering each other and
volunteering to assist the police for many reasons.

Patrol groups undergo NQF Level 3 security-related training. This process
equips them to understand better the environment in which they work. It
also opens up opportunities for them to be employed in the security
industry. Thank you.

Ms M T KUBAYI: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for
the response. I hope that the government and the department will increase
the stipend or reward beyond the R300 voucher that is allocated every three
months. I am sure that if this can be done, the people who are volunteering
- for example Ntate Abe Lebelo of Ward 14, the leader of patrollers in
Soweto - would be happy and more motivated as they continue doing the good
work.

Their work includes ensuring the safety of residents as they walk to and
from work. This further indicates that working together as government,
legislatures and members of the community, we can do more to create safer
communities. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF POLICE: I agree with the hon member. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That was a comment.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Madam Speaker, could the Minister explain why a total
moratorium has been placed on the taking on of reservists, with no date
announced for its lifting? Could the Minister also tell us whether the same
moratorium relates to patrollers? We have a number of citizens offering
their services to SAPS, expecting no payment at all, and yet we have this
huge blockage that has developed.

Certainly, I have heard that patrollers, while not asking for salaries, are
given certain food parcels as a sort of gift for doing the work that they
do. It is of great concern to citizens who are proffering their services
who are turned away.
I would like to know when this turning-away process is going to stop. Also,
why is it that you are even considering allowing reservists without driving
licences to be admitted through the back door, as it were, into SAPS when
we already have such a huge problem with SAPS members who do not have
driving licences, even today?

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Madam Speaker, I would invite the hon member to
just give details and to substantiate her claims, particularly on the
question of the turning away of members of the public who want to join the
reservists.

As you would be aware, what is currently happening with the reservists is
that they are divided into four categories. Amongst those four categories
is a category for those who are unemployed. That is the group we are
dealing with currently, in terms of looking at the feasibility of having
them as employed police officers, so there isn’t any turning away of would-
be police reservists.

However, as I say, if you have any evidence in that regard, we would
definitely welcome it because we have been going around the country and
people have been showing their enthusiasm to join the Police Service,
whether as reservists or even as patrollers, as it were. And we encourage
people to do that, but if there are people who are turned away, we really
would want that evidence. Thank you very much.

Mr L RAMATLAKANE: Madam Speaker, I also want to say that the involvement of
the community in the fight against crime is an important pillar in its
success. However, I just want to ask the Minister, in relation to the
community safety department in Gauteng, whether that kind of project is
going to be broadened beyond Gauteng. If so, I would like to know whether
there is any consideration for some degree of cover for those who have been
recorded as normal participants in the fight against crime, for example, in
the case of volunteers whom we heard qualify for a stipend.

Is there something beyond the stipend or food parcel in terms of the cover?
If so, how broad would that be? If there is already something in existence,
could details of that be made available?

The MINISTER OF POLICE: Madam Speaker, the broadening of the scope is what
provinces do. We were dealing with a specific province here, namely
Gauteng. And this question of the hon member is related to the original
question.

In terms of resources for patrollers and the general public, I am getting
an indication from members from both sides of the House that they would
motivate strongly for us, as the SA Police Service, to get more resources.
I hope so because, frankly speaking, the enthusiasm out there is too great
for any one department to be able to absorb everyone.
Things are complicated by the fact that we have a high rate of unemployment
in the country, so both people who have very good intentions and those with
not-so-good intentions would want to come to the fore, in so far as that is
concerned. But I am pleased that hon members will really support us. Thank
you.

             REFERENCE TO MEMBERS BY FIRST NAME OR SURNAME ONLY

                              (Ruling of Order)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, in response to the Point of Order raised
by the hon member Terblanche, I agree that hon members should not refer to
any other member by his or her first name or surname only. I would
encourage hon members to observe this Rule. In this instance, however, I do
not consider a withdrawal necessary. That is my ruling.

      (b)   conduct a skills audit to determine the availability of duly
           qualified applicants from other population groups that may be

           delivery in the short and medium term; and


      (c)   implement effective programmes for mentoring and skills transfer

National Assembly

 1. The Speaker

    The Speaker of the National Assembly received the following letter,
    dated 14 August 2009, from the Minster of Trade and Industry:

         Hon M V Sisulu
         Speaker of Parliament
         National Assembly
         Cape Town
         8000

         Dear Speaker

        SUBJECT: TABLING OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN COUNCIL
        FOR THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION


        I write to inform you that there will be a delay in the tabling of
        the Annual Report of the South African Council for the Non-
        Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (the Council), a
        statutory body established in terms of the Non-Proliferation of
        Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, 1993 (Act No 87 of 1993) (Non-
        Proliferation Act) for the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009.


        This is due to the delay in the reappointment of the Council. I
        would like to inform you that the Non-Proliferation Act is silent
        with regard to the deadline for tabling of the annual report.
        However, once the council is appointed, it will urgently consider
        the draft report for the above mentioned period. The report will be
        tabled as soon as possible thereafter in the usual format of a
        published booklet. Five hundred copies will be made available as
        has been done in previous years.


        You are welcome to contact me if further clarification is required.




        Yours sincerely,




        signed
        Dr Rob Davies, MP
        Minister of Trade and Industry
        14/8/2009
