                            CHILD PROTECTION WEEK

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Mr Speaker, I move without notice:

    That the House –


    (1)     notes that Tuesday, 26 May 2009, marks the beginning of Child
        Protection week, which will culminate in the commemoration of
        International Children’s Day on 1 June;


    (2)     further notes that the theme for the week is “Caring
        Communities: Protect Children”;

    (3)     acknowledges that our Constitution has made children’s rights a
        priority and that every child is afforded the right to food and
        shelter, and must be protected from abuse, neglect and degradation;


    (4)     recognises that a large number of our children, one of the most
        vulnerable groups in our society, are still victims of neglect,
        abuse and violence on a daily basis;

    (5)     further acknowledges the selfless role stakeholders in civil
        society and in local communities have played in campaigning for the
        protection and development of our children; and


    (6)     calls on all South Africans to stand together to ensure that our
        children are protected from all forms of abuse, so that they can
        enjoy the benefits of freedom and democracy which they so rightly
        deserve.

Agreed to.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                           (The late Ms N K Shoba)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Speaker, I move:

    That the House –


    (1)     notes with profound sadness the untimely death on Saturday, 9
         May 2009, of hon Mama Nomvula Khellinah Shoba;


    (2)     further notes that Mama Khellinah, as she was affectionately
        known, held several positions within the Tripartite Alliance,
        including that of Secretary and Deputy Chairperson of the local ANC
        branch, Provincial Secretary of the Congress of South African Trade
        Unions in Mpumalanga and Regional Treasurer of the National Union
        of Mineworkers;


    (3)     recognises that her untimely and sudden death has not only
        robbed her family of a caring mother, wife and grandmother but that
        her departure from our midst is indeed a great loss to the ANC, the
        Tripartite Alliance, the women formations, the people of Mpumalanga
        and the rest of South Africa, and that Mama Khellinah has left a
        void;


    (4)     recalls that the attainment of gender parity and other gains
        achieved by women since the dawn of democracy were largely brought
        about through courageous and unwavering struggles waged by women of
        the calibre of Comrade Shoba; and


    (5)     conveys its condolences to the Shoba family, the African
        National Congress, the South African Communist Party and the
        Congress of South African Trade Unions.


Motion agreed to, members standing.

The SPEAKER: The condolences of the House will be conveyed to the Shoba
family, the ANC, the SACP and Cosatu.

                                 AFRICA DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Speaker, I move:

    That the House –


    (1)     notes that 25 May is observed by Africans throughout the
        continent of Africa and in the diaspora as Africa Day;


    (2)     further notes that this is the day the Organisation of African
         Unity (OAU), the precursor to the African Union (AU), was formed
         in 1963 and also marking the adoption of its Charter, the African
         Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights;


    (3)     acknowledges that, for us, as Africans, this Day means that our
        entire continent has an opportunity to join together in a united
        affirmation of our confidence in ourselves, and our future;


    (4)     believes that Africa Day celebrates the progress that we, as
        Africans, have made, while reflecting upon the common challenges we
        face in a global environment; and


    (5)     calls upon Africans on the continent and in the diaspora and
        progressive humanity to work hard for securing peace and friendship
        amongst all our people by upholding equal rights and status for
        all.
