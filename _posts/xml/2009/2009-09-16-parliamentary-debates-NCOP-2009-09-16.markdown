                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr W F FABER: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek sal voorstel:

   Dat die Raad –

     1) kennis neem dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Protea-krieketspan die beste in
        wêreldkrieket op die Internasionale Krieketfederasie se ranglys is;


      2) die Protea-krieketspan alle sterkte toewens met die komende
         Internasionale Kampioene Trofeëreeks wat aanstaande Dinsdag begin,
         waar die Proteas teen Sri Lanka deelneem;
      3) verder kennis neem dat ‘n Sharks-rugbytrui met die Discovery-
         ruimtetuig na die Internasionale Ruimtestasie geneem is -
         ruimtevaarders mag een persoonlike besitting saam met hulle na die
         ruimtestasie neem op so ‘n tog - en die Amerikaanse ruimtevaarder
         Patrick Kennedy is ‘n groot Sharks-rugby-ondersteuner en het
         besluit om sy Sharks-rugbytrui saam te neem, dit is dus die eerste
         rugbytrui wat die ruimte in is;

      4) ook die Sharks rugbyspan baie gelukwens met hulle tweede oorwinning
         teen die Blou Bulle op Loftus Versveld in die Curriebekerreeks; en


      5) die Sharks rugbyspan alle sterkte toewens met hulle kragmeting teen
         die Vrystaat Cheetahs Saterdag in Durban.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr W F Faber: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

   That the Council –

     1) takes note that the South African cricket team the Proteas ranks as
        the best team in world cricket according to the International
        Cricket Federation;

     2) wishes the Proteas cricket team well in the coming International
        Champions Trophy series, starting next Tuesday, when they face Sri
        Lanka;

     3) further notes that a Sharks rugby jersey was taken to the
        International Space Station with the Discovery space craft, with
        astronauts being allowed to take one personal possession with them
        on such a flight, and the American astronaut Patrick Kennedy being
        such a huge Sharks rugby supporter that he decided to bring along
        his Sharks jersey – clearly the first rugby jersey to travel into
        space;

     4) also congratulates the Sharks rugby team on their second win in the
        Curry Cup competition against the Blue Bulls at Loftus Versveld; and

   (5)      wishes the Sharks rugby team well in their showdown against the
        Free State Cheetahs this Saturday in Durban.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I am sure you are aware that we have two types
of motions: A notice of motion and a motion without notice. Are you moving
a notice of motion now? Is that what you are moving?

Mr W F FABER: Correct, Mr Chair.

Mnr M J R DE VILLIERS: Agb Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek sal
voorstel:

   Dat die Raad –

   (1)      kennis neem van die berig in Die Burger van 1 September 2009
        waarin Tony Ehrenreich van Cosatu beweer dat mev Zille, Premier van
        die Wes-Kaap, en haar gevolg haar besoek aan Duitsland misbruik het
        om haar familie in Duitsland te besoek;


   (2)      verder kennis neem dat mnr Ehrenreich en Cosatu kwaadwillig mev
        Zille, Premier van die Wes-Kaap, van slingse streke, onbetroubare
        gedrag, misbruik, wan-administrasie en korrupsie beskuldig;

   (3)      ook kennis neem dat mnr Ehrenreich en Cosatu mev Zille se naam
        as agbare lid en die amp van Premier onteer en beledig; en

   (4)      mnr Ehrenreich en Cosatu versoek om met bewyse vir sy bewering
        na vore te kom, so nie, in die openbaar sy en Cosatu se verskoning
        aan mev Zille aanbied vir ongetoetse en ondeurdagte uitlatings.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)
[Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall
move:

   That the Council –

      1) notes a report in Die Burger of 1 September 2009 in which Tony
         Ehrenreich of Cosatu claims that Mrs Zille, Premier of the Western
         Cape, and her entourage had abused a visit to Germany to call on
         her relatives there;

      2) further notes that Mr Ehrenreich and Cosatu have maliciously
         accused Mrs Zille of underhand dealings, treacherous behaviour,
         misappropriation, maladministration and corruption;

      3) also notes that Mr Ehrenreich and Cosatu have discredited and
         insulted the name of Mrs Zille as an hon member and the office of
         Premier; and

   (4)      requests Mr Ehrenreich and Cosatu to present proof of his
        claims, failing which to apologise publicly for his and Cosatu’s
        untested and ill-considered statements.]

Mnr H B GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek sal voorstel:

   Dat die Raad –

   (1)      kennis neem dat die probleme wat Eskom nou reeds vir ‘n
        onaanvaarbaar lang tyd ondervind, asook die feit dat al hoe meer
        bewyse aan die lig kom dat Eskom herhaaldelike waarskuwings rakende
        die potensiële omvang van die krisis blatant en herhaaldelik oor ‘n
        tydperk van etlike jare geïgnoreer het, rede tot ernstige kommer is
        en ‘n wesenlike bedreiging vir ons ekonomie in sy geheel is;

   (2)      voorts kennis neem dat -

        (a)      werk aan die kragstasie tans in aanbou by Ellisras dreig
              om heeltemal tot stilstand te kom vanweë die feit dat
              kontrakteurs geen betaling ontvang het vir kontrakwerk wat
              reeds afgehandel is nie;

        (b)      hierdie skokkende toedrag van sake vererger word deur die
              feit dat Eskom, ten spyte van hul klaaglike vertoning, die
              arrogansie het om hul hoofuitvoerende beampte – wat volgens
              alle aanduidings na regte ontslaan behoort te word – te
              vergoed met ‘n skandalige salarisverhoging van meer as een
              miljoen rand, asook ‘n totaal onverdiende bonus;

        (c)      die verskoning dat so ‘n verhoging markverwant is, ‘n
              belediging is in die gesig van elke belastingbetaler wat die
              koste van hierdie uitspattigheid dra, maar nie markverwante
              dienste gegun word nie;

   (3)      glo dat sulke aksies ‘n mens noop om tot die gevolgtrekking te
        kom dat Eskom hoegenaamd geen begrip of insig het van die omvang en
        impak van die huidige wêreldwye ekonomiese krisis nie; en

   (4)      gevolglik daarop aandring dat ‘n dringende ondersoek na die
        aangeleentheid geloods word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr H B GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

    That the Council –


      1) notes that the problems that have now been experienced by Eskom
         for an unacceptably long period, as well as the fact that more and
         more evidence comes to light that Eskom have blatantly and
         repeatedly ignored the potential extent of the crisis over a
         period of numerous years, is reason for serious concern and a
         genuine concern for our economy as a whole;
    (2)     further notes that -

          a) work at the power station at Ellisras is threatening to come to
             a complete stand-still owing to the fact that contractors have
             not received any payment for contract work already done;


          b) this shocking state of affairs is exacerbated by the fact that
             Eskom, despite their miserable display, have the arrogance to
             reward their Chief Executive Officer – who according to all
             indications should rightly be fired – with a shameful salary
             increase of more than one million rand, as well as a totally
             undeserved bonus;

          c) the excuse that such an increase is market-related is an insult
             to each and every tax-payer who carries the cost of this
             opulence, but who are not offered market-related services;


    (3)    believed that such actions forces one to the conclusion that
         Eskom does not have any grasp or insight of the extent and impact
         of the current worldwide economic crisis; and


      4) therefore insists that an urgent inquiry into the matter be
         launched.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, hon members! Just to remind you that a
notice of motion is supposed to be one and half minutes long, and if you
exceed that then I’ll have to stop you. Members must just understand that,
please.

Mr D A WORTH: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on behalf
of the DA on the next sitting day of the House:

   That the Council –

   (1)      congratulates the Springbok (Ama-Bokke Bokke) Rugby Team on
        winning the 2009 Tri-Nations series last Saturday; and

   (2)      congratulates the coach, Peter De Villiers, captain John Smit
        and the team on their outstanding performance throughout the series
        and their triumphant victory; and

   (3)      also congratulates the Homeless Street Soccer Team who won the A
        C Milan City trophy for the first time. Well done!

UMntwana M M M ZULU: Mhlonishwa Sihlalo, ngiphakamisa ngaphandle kwesaziso:

  Ukuthi lo Mkhandlu-


      1) uzwakalisa ukukhalela izintombi zakithi ezimpisholo ezazilaphaya
         emzini weNkosi noma emzini weNdlovukazi kaMsweli, la kwalimala
         khona uMbali Mhlongo waseThekwini kwaNongoma kanye  noNoxolo Mbatha
         waseHluhluwe, lapho intombi ezincane esizweni samaZulu ziyaye
         ziyalwe khona yiNkosi minyaka yonke;

      2) uthi-ke uzwakalisa ukukhala emindenini yalezintokazi zaseNingizimu
         Afrika, izimbali zesizwe ngokwendlula kwazo emhlabeni ngoba lapha
         kwakuzoyalwa izingane ngalolubhubhana olukhona lwengculaza ukuthi
         zikwazi ukuzithiba ukuya ocansini ngoba njengesizwe esimpisholo
         akufuneki ukulalana nje ngaphambi kokuba kushadwe.
(Translation of isiZulu notice of motion follows.)

[Prince M M M ZULU: Hon Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -

   (1)      would like to convey its condolences to our maidens who were at
        the King’s palace or at Queen kaMsweli’s palace where Mbali Mhlongo
        of Durban in the area known as kwaNongoma and Noxolo Mbatha of
        Hluhluwe passed away when they were attending a ceremony where
        young girls of the Zulu nation are given advice on good behaviour
        every year by His Majesty the King; and
   (2)      expresses its condolences to the families of these young maidens
        who were flowers of South Africa for passing on, because this
        ceremony was meant to give advice to young girls about the Aids
        pandemic so that they can be able to abstain from sexual activities
        because as Africans, it is not appropriate to engage in sexual
        activities before marriage.]


The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In the light of the objection, the motion may
not be proceeded with and the motion without notice will now become a
notice of a motion.

Mnr M J R DE VILLIERS: Agb Voorsitter, u het vinnig oorgegaan na voorstelle
sonder kennisgewing. Ek het nog twee kennisgewings van voorstel. Ek sal
berus by u beslissing, maar dan het ek ook twee voorstelle sonder
kennisgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Hon Chairperson, you proceeded to motions without
notice too quickly. I still have two notices of motion. I will abide by
your ruling, but then I also have two motions without notice.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Have you finished with the motion?

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: No, I’ve asked for your permission to move two
notices of motion and then I also have two motions without notice.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No, put one first and then I will call you
again for the other one.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Thank you very much.

Mnr M J R DE VILLIERS: Ek gee kennis dat ek sal voorstel:

   Dat die Huis-

   (1)      kennis neem van die kommer van die Departement van Gesondheid in
        verband met die advertensie deur ryk lande om Suid-Afrikaanse
        dokters te trek;

   (2)      kennis neem dat die Raad op Gesondheidsberoepe ... (Translation
of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: I give notice that I shall move:

   That the House –

   (1)      notes the Department of Health’s concern regarding the
        advertisement by wealthy countries to lure South African doctors;

   (2)      notes that the Health Professions Council ...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, you are giving a notice of a
motion and we are now dealing with motions without notice. What are you
moving?

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chair, I asked for your permission to give notice of
a motion first, but also said that I will abide by your ruling. If I should
carry on with the motion without notice, then I shall move it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Move the motion without notice. We are done
with notices of motion.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Ok, I have two motions without notice.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Now move the first one, then I will call you
for the second one.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Thank you very much, Chairperson.

           ACTIONS OF ASA OFFICIALS IN CASTER SEMENYA CONTROVERSY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr M J R DE VILLIERS: Agb Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:

   Dat die Raad –

   (1)      kennis neem dat volgens mediaberigte ASA, Atletiek Suid-Afrika,
        kennis gedra het dat Caster Semenya ‘n mediese toestand gehad het
        wat haar prestasie in die gedrang sou bring;

   (2)      verder kennis neem dat die klaarblyklike toets wat in Pretoria
        gedoen is, nooit aan die Internasionale Vereniging van
        Atletiekfederasies, IAAF, deurgegee is nie;

   (3)      ook kennis neem dat dr Harold Adams, ASA se spandokter, mnr
        Leonard Chuene, die president van ASA, versoek het om Semenya eerder
        aan die kompetisie in Duitsland te onttrek; en

   (4)      ‘n beroep op die Minister van Sport en Ontspanning doen om ‘n
        deeglike ondersoek in te stel na die volle situasie waarin Caster
        Semenya beland het en ‘n volledige verslag aan die Raad te voorsien.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Hon Chairperson, I shall move without notice:

   That the Council –

      1) notes that according to reports in the media ASA, Athletics South
         Africa, knew that Caster Semenya had a medical condition that would
         have brought her achievement into question;


      2) further notes that this apparent test, which was done in Pretoria,
         was never passed on to the International Association of Athletics
         Federations (IAAF);


      3) also notes that Dr Harold Adams, ASA’s team doctor, asked Mr
         Leonard Chuene, President of ASA, to rather withdraw Semenya from
         the competition in Germany; and


      4) calls on the Minister of Sport and Recreation to conduct a full
         inquiry into the whole situation in which Caster Semenya found
         herself and to provide the Council with a full report.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In the light of the objection, the motion may
not be proceeded with and, therefore, the motion without notice will now
become a notice of motion.

  CONGRATULATIONS TO SOUTH AFRICAN FILM-MAKING SCHOOL ON THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS

        won the category of Corporate Social Responsibility Programme of the

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs R N RASMENI: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -

     1) notes that on 15 September 2009 the organised crime unit of the
        South African Police Service raided a bogus Home Affairs office in
        Ghandi Square in Johannesburg (Gauteng) where dozens of illegally
        produced passports, identity documents and other Home Affairs
        documents were confiscated and a man who is believed to be the
        brother of an immigration official of the Department of Home Affairs
        was arrested;


     2) also notes that thus far the Department of Home Affairs has
        dismissed over 120 personnel for corruption and fraud related to the

     3) takes this opportunity to congratulate the police and the Department
        of Home Affairs for their swift action in curbing corruption and
        fraud in the Department of Home Affairs; and

     4) calls on the people of South Africa, particularly the personnel in
        the Department of Home Affairs, to report those among them who
        continue to produce and sell state documents and thus undermine the
        security of our nation.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        SAPS SPECIAL TASK TEAM AND AIR WING COMMITTED TO FIGHT CRIME

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M H MOKGOBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council -

     1) commends the South African Police Service for deterring what could
        have been a cash-in-transit heist at Kameeldrift, Pretoria, on 14
        September 2009;


     2) acknowledges that the swift reaction by the SAPS special task team
        and the air wing illustrates police commitment to fight crime and
        make sure that South Africa becomes unbearable for criminals;


     3) takes this opportunity to wish the police officer who got injured on
        duty defending the interests of the law-abiding citizens of this
        country a speedy recovery; and

     4) calls upon members of the community to help the police to intensify
        its search for the arrest of the other three robbers who fled the
        scene.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     WEEK-LONG STRIKE BY SARS EMPLOYEES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T HARRIS: Chair, I move without notice:
   That the Council -

     1) takes note of the week-long strike by SARS employees that ran from
        Monday, 7 September 2009 to Friday, 11 September 2009;


      2) while noting the right of workers to take industrial action, given
         that the deadline for manual tax returns by taxpayers is this
         Friday, 18 September 2009, notes that there is evidence that
         submission of returns was badly hampered by delays at SARS offices
         last week;


      3) notes that in addition, several complaints have been received from
         businesses regarding equipment manufactured in South African plants
         which could not be loaded and that other exports were stuck at
         borders and ports of exit, due to the strike action; and

      4) calls on SARS to extend the deadline for manual submission of tax
         returns by one week to allow for the burden of the delays on
         taxpayers, and that the tax authority prioritises its efforts to
         get SARS operations registered as “essential services” to prevent
         industrial action from negatively affecting business and taxpayers
         in future.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            PRESIDENTIAL HOTLINE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:

  That the Council –

     1) notes that on Monday, 14 September 2009, the President of the
        Republic of South Africa, President Jacob Zuma, launched a
        presidential hotline, 17737, a toll free number for the people of
        South Africa to directly inform him about the challenges that they
        are facing in their communities;


     2) notes that the presidential hotline, which was part of the
        commitment that President Zuma made during the election campaign and
        in the state of the nation address, is intended to encourage an all-
        round improvement in citizen care and liaison and introduce a
        culture of putting the citizens first in all spheres of government;

     3) further notes that the hotline will be extended to provinces and
        include liaison officers for each municipality so that the service
        is taken to local government level, including rural municipalities
        and districts;
     4) congratulates President Zuma for his innovative initiative and his
        continued quest to bring government closer to the people and further
        inculcate a culture of accountability and principles of batho pele
        in the Public Service; and

     5) calls on political parties that have started to abuse the number for
        political prankstering, for publicity and point-scoring, to use this
        important initiative of our people as intended and in a responsible
        manner.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: In the light of the objection, the motion may
not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become a notice
of motion.

                     (Statement by Minister of Finance)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon delegates, ladies  and  gentleman,
thank you very much  for  your  warm  welcome.  I  have  great  pleasure  in
introducing the Provincial Budget and Expenditure Review to you today.

The tabling of this review in the NCOP  provides  an  important  opportunity
for South Africans to reflect on our provincial system. It  is  also  useful
for us to remember that the current constitutional system is the  result  of
our negotiated settlement. We are now 15 years into our democracy and  there
is no doubt that great progress has been made on the  delivery  of  services
and on the embedding of the system.

No one can deny that there are more children attending school today than  at
any other time in  the  history  of  our  country;  there  are  more  people
accessing health services now than 15 years ago; our  housing  programme  is
deemed historic internationally; and there are many  such  examples  of  our
successes. This  year’s  review,  which  we  table  today,  highlights  this
undeniable progress.

However, as South Africans, we have to look at the next step we have got to
take and not just at our achievements. This review also then provides us
with an opportunity to reflect on the impact of government spending on the
lives of ordinary citizens.

Is the quality of services at a level that has had a lasting impact on the
lives of our people? Has the education system, with the expenditure that we
have put into it, delivered the skills needed for the economy to grow and
to foster social cohesion? Why is it that our education outcomes are
lagging behind other comparable countries? Despite the historic delivery on
housing, did this contribute to sustainable communities where our people
can work, sleep and play in peace? The answers to these questions will,
without a doubt, suggest that we have many challenges before us before we
can realise the goal of a better life for all South Africans.

I am of the view that the review that I table in this House today will
allow you and the NCOP to ask these tough questions and to undertake this
interrogation. It should be a tool that you can use effectively to exercise
your oversight responsibility, to challenge us and people at provincial
level to work smarter and to be efficient and effective in the period ahead
so that we achieve the developmental goals we have set for ourselves.

Provincial budgets have increased by R100 billion between financial years
2005-06 and 2008-09. By 2011-12, provincial spending will stand at
R339 billion and would have more than doubled since the 2005-06 financial
year. The growth in the budget should allow us space to strengthen our
education system, ensure effective service delivery on health services and
expand social services to our people.

I remain concerned that the outputs and outcomes are not in line with the
massive investments we are making. What could be the underlying reasons for
this mismatch between the huge sums of money that we have put into
education, health and social development, on the one hand, and on the other
hand, the social and other outcomes that we expect from it?

What is it that we could do better? What is it that we are not doing
correctly? What is it that we are not doing properly in the service
delivery chain of our country? These are the questions we all need to ask
and ask more vigorously. If we don’t ask these tough questions, we will be
endorsing poor performance and we will be endorsing the fact that these
billions of rands that we do have and have invested in these various
services are not being used productively. When departments in our provinces
come to report to us on the funds that we have appropriated, what questions
do we ask them and what questions should we ask them? These are difficult
and unpopular questions, but I implore you to have these frank
conversations in a much sterner way than we might have done until now.

But let’s not focus on the negative; let’s look at the road ahead of us.
Yesterday you had an opportunity and the time to look at this document
carefully with the assistance of tertiary officials. Today is the time for
you to recommit with us to provide better service delivery and ensure that
we have better value for money.

I am told that many of you have made very interesting suggestions, and I
thank you for that, to address the challenges that we face. Let me
highlight some of these: Firstly, there is a need to change the culture of
our Public Service from self-serving to serving our communities. One can’t
emphasise this strongly enough and we hope that your voices will get much
louder than they are at the moment, to ensure that we do, in fact, get
better value for money and that hard-earned taxpayers’ contributions to the
South African fiscus is not abused, as it might be in many instances.

Secondly, norms and standards should be developed to guide our delivery and
these should include norms and standards in terms of the schools that we
build, the support that we give to schools and the basic standards for
sustainable communities. Here again I think that much more can be done than
we are doing currently to ensure that there are universal norms on the one
hand, with appropriate deviations where that might be necessary for
specific provincial conditions.

Thirdly, there is a need to modernise the delivery mechanisms. Why is it
that a soft drink company can deliver soft drinks, or newspapers, for that
matter, to thousands of outlets on time without any leakage, and yet our
clinics are without drugs and medicines, and our learner support materials
arrive late or never arrive at all?

Fourthly, contract management must be strengthened in our provinces. This
should ensure that there is alignment between delivery and payment and that
we avoid any unwarranted escalation of costs. Not only should there be
alignment between delivery and payment, but there should be alignment
between payment and real delivery, because many payments take place without
any delivery taking place.

Fifth, supply chain management needs to be strengthened. National Treasury
and its provincial counterparts will be taking a strong lead in this
particular regard.

Sixth, provincial treasuries must on a quarterly basis present their
section 32 spending numbers to the relevant committees as a matter of
routine, and these committees must align their processes to start building
a culture of accountability. I want to offer, on behalf of National
Treasury, assistance for your committee to empower you to understand those
numbers and to interrogate those numbers and to hold the provincial
treasuries accountable.

Seventh, national and provincial governments must also take the lead to
realign budgets from noncore to core areas of service delivery. What we
need to put a stop to is when money is budgeted for health, it must be
spent on health, and not on consultants or frills that a particular
political office bearer might have in mind that has nothing to do with
improving the conditions in which our people live or the services that they
actually receive.

Lastly, there must be consequences for failure in the same way that there
is reward for excellent performance. Action against nonperformance must be
stepped up. One of the things that South Africans are guilty of is being
too compassionate with ourselves, so we don’t take nondelivery or
nonperformance seriously and everybody is resting in the comfort that if
they don’t deliver it’s ok, their job is still safe and there won’t be any
consequences.

Unless there are consequences - and that can be anything from naming and
shaming to getting fired - no human being takes any performance requirement
seriously; whether that is in the work environment, in the public or
private sector, or any other environment, the same rules apply.

So, join us in making sure that there must be consequences for nondelivery,
there must be consequences for tender fraud and there must be consequences
if you have actually engaged in corruption.

This is a step in the right direction, the kind of conversation that we had
yesterday. There should not be any nonaction on our part. Our people cannot
continue to suffer while we sit on the sidelines and do nothing when we
have the power to do so much more. We have achieved much, as I have said,
in the past 15 years and we should build on those strengths and continue to
improve the lives of our people and that is that we must be able to bring
the promise of a better life for all into being a reality at a day-to-day
level for our people.

I believe that the foundation that we have laid over the last 15 years is a
very strong and powerful one. We should be proud of the fact that we have
actually built a whole new constitutional system in less than 15 years on
the kind of negotiated settlement that we have had and that is something
that we can write in the history books.

But unless we build on that foundation and unless we progress in the kind
of directions that your own comments have indicated, we will lose and chip
away at that particular foundation and so I hope that you will work with
all of the other office bearers at a provincial and local government level
to build on that 15-year foundation. Learn from what this review tells us
about our performance and make a commitment to much better performance as
we go forward. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon Minister, I actually thought
that one of the members would stand up and move a motion about the
wonderful workshop we had yesterday. They haven’t done so, but let me
repeat the statement that I made in the workshop yesterday.

We started with this workshop two years ago, and it was the first time
yesterday that we had an intense discussion on the document that had been
given to us. I have never seen members so dedicated in deliberations.
Normally when you hold a workshop at Parliament, by 5 o’clock there is no
one left as they all have to be at other meetings, or in their offices to
take calls, etc.

They were disciplined until the last minute; everyone was there until the
end. I want to congratulate them; everyone did a very good job. Even I
myself couldn’t slip out to go to all the meetings that I was supposed to
attend - I had to stay until the end.

I would like to say to the members that that particular document actually
gives us information that will assist us in performing our oversight work
function. The Minister is quite correct in saying that we need to use it
everywhere we go and ask those hard questions, and not just take it and put
it in drawers where it will gather dust. We want to thank you, Minister,
for organising that workshop. It was an eye-opener for us.

Last week we had a provincial week – that is where we spend time in the
provinces doing our oversight function – and everybody actually said that
we should have had this workshop before going to our provinces. Next time
we will plan it that way, so that we get this information before we go.
Again, thank you very much. I think it was a wonderful workshop. I would
also like to thank your staff; please tell them that they have done a very
good job. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

                       HERITAGE DAY: “CELEBRATE CRAFT”

                          (Subject for Discussion)


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Chairperson and the Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP, hon members of the NCOP, comrades and friends, the
Ministry of Arts and Culture welcomes the opportunity to participate in
this debate broadly to reflect on the meaning of Heritage Month to the
people of South Africa. Heritage Month represents an opportunity for us as
a nation to celebrate our rich and diverse cultural heritage.

It is an opportunity to reaffirm once more that what unites us far
outweighs that which divides us; it is time to celebrate the profound power
of our cultural heritage to help in the renewal of our society to promote
patriotism.

Indeed, throughout this month, we must use our common heritage to promote
national unity, reconciliation, and social cohesion, appreciating fully
that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white. The theme
for this year’s Heritage Month is: “Celebrating South Africa’s craft, our
heritage”.

During this month, as the Department of Arts and Culture, we pay tribute,
particularly, to the crafters, many of whom are found in rural areas and
have made a significant contribution to the development of our country’s
rich heritage. This year’s theme presents an opportunity to highlight the
socioeconomic impact of the craft industry in our country.

It also seeks to encourage further development and investments in the
crafts sector of our economy. This theme recognises that, historically,
crafts have been part of the South African economy, especially in rural
areas. It takes into account that until recently the role that crafts have
played in our economy has not been fully acknowledged.

It is for this reason that this year’s Heritage Month activities are
designed to raise awareness about the socioeconomic impact of the crafts
sector. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates that South Africa’s
crafts sector contributes about R2 billion or 0,14% of South Africa’s GDP,
annually.

In addition, the sector provides jobs and income for approximately 38 000
people through an estimated 7 000 small enterprises. The crafts sector can
also be used as a catalyst for rural economic development and for fostering
expanded participation in the economy, especially by women. This is
significant, particularly since one of the key priorities of this term of
governance is the development and revitalisation of rural economies.

Furthermore, as the art of designing and producing craft products is handed
down from generation to generation, members of communities have an
opportunity to work together and impart knowledge and social values to each
other, especially the youth.

This contributes to social cohesion and instils the culture of respect,
discipline, and ubuntu. It is for these reasons that we continue to say
that crafts represent both an economic activity and also a cultural
practice.

While crafts made a significant contribution to the economy, it is the
middle persons – and not the crafters themselves – that derive the most
benefit from this sector. Another challenge which faces this sector is
that, currently, most raw materials used in the production of craft
products are imported and, therefore, unaffordable for many people.

Access to markets also remains a challenge for practitioners in this
sector. Therefore, going forward, our task is to find appropriate responses
to this and many other challenges facing this sector.

Since 1994, through numerous agencies, the government has provided
resources to help to develop the craft sector of our economy. In the
Department of Arts and Culture, through our Investing in Culture Programme,
we have spent over R300 million over the past three years to support
various crafts projects. This has led to the creation of jobs and
contributed towards building sustainable livelihoods. Working together with
all stakeholders, including the private sector, we must improve on these
initiatives.

Our country is privileged to be home to no less than eight World Heritage
Sites, namely, Mapungubwe, Robben Island, Vrede Fort Dome, the Cradle of
Humankind, Cape Floral Region, Richtersveld, Isimangaliso Wetlands and
Ukhahlamba Drakensburg. We have a responsibility to use these sites to
further stimulate tourism in our country, thus contributing to the national
effort to create decent work and build sustainable livelihoods.

In this regard, the Department of Arts and Culture as well as the
Department of Tourism have begun a process aimed at developing synergies
between heritage and tourism. It is important that we do this because
tourists are often attracted to a particular cultural and heritage
significance.

The highlight of Heritage Month is a Heritage Day celebration that will be
held in the Sekhukhune District at the Ntwampe sports ground in the Moroke
village in Limpompo. Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe is expected to
address this event.

I, therefore, take this opportunity to wish you, Chairperson, and the hon
members a happy Heritage Month. We are looking forward to your continued
support as we celebrate our country’s rich and diverse cultural heritage. I
thank you very much.

Mr M J R DE VILLIERS: Chairperson, it is indeed an honour to participate in
this debate today because it is an opportunity for the DA to say exactly
what opportunities there are in our country with its diverse communities.
This is a huge blessing received from the hand of God, and we, as His
children, must make the utmost of His blessings bestowed upon us.

Let us first look at the meaning of the term “craft” for it to give us an
eagle’s view of what we have here. “Craft” refers to a set of opportunities
and activities that involve a person’s skill, innovation and dedication to
produce a desired object. It is also viable to bring out an art piece which
either has a utilitarian or decorative value or even both.

The principal materials used to create crafts are wood, stone, clay, glass,
textiles, metal, cement and paper. We find crafts in the categories of
handicrafts or traditional crafts.

Craft is as old as human beings. In saying this, we, as people, have lost
the real value of what craft could do to promote opportunities, the economy
and employment in communities, and what it could do for South Africa.
Traditional crafts are done in old ways. Their methods, tools and
techniques have been used for centuries. Some crafts are done by modern
inventions - with new tools, techniques and media.

Voorsitter, Suid—Afrika het ’n multi-kulturele samelewing en gemeenskap,
vol diversiteit en verskille. Juis hierin lê die rykdom wat ons sukkel om
te ontgin, omdat ons en ons kinders in moderne ontwikkeling vasgeval het.
Ons moet onsself daaruit ontsluit, met ander woorde, ’n balans moet gekry
word. Hierdie multi—kulturele karakter het die potensiaal en kapasiteit om
’n noemenswaardige ekonomie te genereer waaruit maatskaplike voordeel vir
die nasie getrek kan word.

Die vraag kom soos ’n refrein na vore: Verstaan en gebruik ons die
potensiaal en dinamiek van kuns en kunsvlyt ten volle? Juis hierin lê die
ope geleentheidsgemeenskap wat so oud is soos die mensdom self en reeds op
verskeie gebiede gebruik word. Dit is glad nie ’n nuwe begrip nie.

Kom ons ondersoek hierdie geleentheid verder. Die moderne samelewing stroop
ons jeug en volwassenes van die talente wat ons van God ontvang het. Die
Bybelse uitdrukking sê: Moenie jou talente onder ’n maatemmer verberg nie.
Laat ons van die een penning nog meer maak, en dit lê juis in kuns en
kunsvlyt opgesluit. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, South Africa has a multicultural society and community,
filled with diversity and differences. This is precisely where the wealth
that we are struggling to develop lies, because we and our children got
caught up in modern development. We need to free ourselves from it; in
other words, we need to find a balance. This multicultural character has
the potential and capacity to generate a significant economy which could be
to the social benefit of the nation.

The question rings forth like a chorus: Do we fully understand and utilise
the potential and dynamics of arts and crafts? Herein lies the very open
opportunity society that is as old as mankind itself and is being used in
various areas. This is by no means a new concept.

Let’s explore this opportunity further. Modern society strips our youth and
adults from their God-given talents. The Biblical expression says: Don’t
hide your light under a bushel. Let’s use the one penny to make even more,
and this can be done through arts and crafts in particular.]

Let us celebrate our crafts and our heritage everyday in the real sense of
the word, from the young to the old. South Africa is the best country in
which to celebrate an industry that has morphed from an expression of
creativity to a form of producing crafts, natural resources and recycled
products. Our rich history of cultural expressions is particularly defined
in crafts.

A nation is built by celebrating its common identity and pride and by
building cohesion and sustainable communities to showcase its museums,
galleries, heritage and other tourist attractions. We must never try to
erase our history in South Africa, and this characteristic is currently
shown by the ANC government in trying to wipe out a certain piece of
history in certain areas of our country. We must use history to cause those
coming after us to never do it again because of the ills it has created.
Our diversity lies in all of this.

National Craft Month is a great reminder to tell the kids about the
potential of fun they could have, although they’ve grown widely accustomed
to movies and video games as a form of entertainment. Childhood is the most
fragile time of our lives, and it is of utmost importance that our kids are
well prepared for whatever life has to show them later on.

Kids love making things. Therefore, we must also use this opportunity in
our schools. This method of education is less and less seen and used in our
schools, and the curriculum must include craft and other forms of handiwork
for our learners. The benefits are huge and enormous, such as the
following.

Firstly, creativity is healthy and relaxing. It builds dexterity and motor
function since one’s hands and mind are used to create. Secondly,
creativity relates to lots of mental ideas, problem solving and
comprehension.

Dit ontwikkel die mens se selfbeeld en -erkenning. Dit sal juis ons kinders
op skool leer hoe om hul verstand te gebruik, hoe om te dink en hoe om te
evalueer.

Derdens, kinders leer ook hoe instruksies gevolg kan word, en watter ouer
sal nie daarvan hou dat hul kinders hul instruksies en leringe volg nie!

Die doel heilig die middele, en dit is een van die middele wat gebruik kan
word om dwelms en bendebetrokkenheid by ons jeug aan te spreek.

Elke jaar in September word Erfenisdag gevier en die regering kies ‘n tema.
Vanjaar se tema, “Celebrating Craft, our Heritage”, moet in murg en been,
van dag tot dag, van skool tot skool, en van gemeenskap tot gemeenskap
vasgevat en ontwikkel word. Die geleenthede wat dit bied, moet ontgin word.
Die oplossing vir al die probleme in ons land, lê opgesluit in die
diversiteit van die nasie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It develops one’s self-esteem and self-recognition. It could teach our
children who are in school how to use their intellect, how to think, and
how to evaluate.

Thirdly, children learn how to follow instructions, and what parent would
not be pleased when his or her child was following his or her instructions
and teachings!

The end justifies the means, and this is one of the means to address drug
abuse and gang involvement amongst our youth.

Heritage Day is celebrated every year in September and government chooses a
theme. This year’s theme, “Celebrating Craft, our Heritage”, must be firmly
incorporated and thoroughly developed on a day-to-day basis, from school to
school and community to community. The opportunities it creates should be
developed. The solution to all our country’s problems lies in the diversity
of the nation.]

The heritage awards event of this year honours six South Africans for their
contributions. The awardees this year are: the late Alfred Nokwe for
theatre; Johny Clegg for music and social cohesion; Noria Mabasa, an
accomplished sculptor and wood carver; the late Bheki Mseleku for music;
Nanda Soobben, a Durban-based animator and arts educator, and Jay Pather
for dance. [Interjections.] I thank you. [Time expired.]

Ms M W MAKGATE: Chairperson, let me express my grattitude to the ANC for
having entrusted it to me to debate on this phenomenal theme of celebrating
our craft, which is very close to my heart. Every year the month of
September revives our spirit in terms of taking pride in and valuing our
cultural practices and traditions.

Crafts play a vital role in our lives, especially in the rural communities.
It promotes the values of ubuntu, social cohesion, and gives us an
identity. Furthermore, it promotes tourism and contributes to our economy.

The Freedom Charter says that:

   The government shall discover, develop and encourage national talent for
   the enhancement of cultural life;

   All the cultural treasures of mankind shall be open to all, by free
   exchange of books, ideas and contact with other lands;


   The colour bar in cultural life, in sport and in education shall be
   abolished.

During the dawn of democracy in 1994, we removed all the apartheid clauses
that created a division; instead we created a rainbow nation where we could
celebrate our diversity and affirm our beliefs that South Africa belongs to
all who live in it, black and white.

The above is guaranteed in the Freedom Charter and further affirmed in the
Constitution of the country. The equality clause under section 9 of the
Constitution provides that the state may not unfairly discriminate,
directly or indirectly, against anyone on the grounds of ethnicity, colour,
social origin, belief or language.

The celebration of our culture, crafts and heritage has been in existence
even long before the democratic dispensation. However, not so much
cognisance was given in terms of exercising and demonstrating our heritage
proudly to other nations.

After 1994, this sector was given a lot of attention and made a priority.
In a global world, arts, culture and heritage are often given high priority
as they assist the country in terms of income- generating opportunities.

Originally, crafts were a traditional skill of black people, especially
from the rural communities and farms who would manufacture during their
spare time. Traditional people have been specialising in work such as
indigenous wood items, grass mats, pots and paintings. Gradually people
graduated to producing serious traditional beadwork attire such as
necklaces, bracelets and belts.

Through this artwork rural communities have been using this skill to
express their natural creativity and to generate skills and income.
Normally women would gather in small groups and work together, singing or
even sharing a pot of food. This has promoted the building of the spirit of
ubuntu, unity, peace and solidarity amongst the locals. On a large scale
this has contributed to nurture the families and develop their communities.


Boineelo Service Club in Ipeleng, Mamusa Municipality in North West, is
where elderly people come together on a daily basis to do handwork at this
club. This helps them to exercise their hands and also become mentally
strong. This gives them an opportunity to talk about their history.

It is very important to maximise the use of institutions like Mmabana in
Mafikeng, which used to be the best in crafts. We cannot allow these
centres to vanish. Due to the nature of this trade, it is very informal and
not legislated. The producers become vulnerable to manipulation. They
become victims. They are always cheated and do not get value for their
items, which are normally bought at a very low price from them and sold at
a very high price either locally or abroad. From there these items would be
exported and branded, yet these are proudly South African products.

It requires of us as parliamentarians to empower our people economically
and also give these people the necessary skills, eg, financial management
and marketing skills so that they can benefit from their work. We also
should look into encouraging young people to take this as a career and give
them the necessary support.

This month reminds us of who we are and where we come from. Today we have
become very Eurocentric in terms of our dress code, the food we eat, the
manner in which we relate to one another, the houses we stay in and even to
the extent of the medication we use. We have kind of neglected the value of
our origin. It is always of great importance to remind ourselves of our own
origin and go back to the basics.

There used to be a difference in the dress code of a married and unmarried
woman, but today it is not easy to say that. If we compare the dress code
of South African women to that of other African countries like Ghana and
Nigeria, they are very proud of their African attire.

The beads that we wear often have meaning. To a large extent, it is
believed that our traditional dress code, including the beads, have the
power to connect us to our ancestral spirits. In Tshivenda, IsiNdebele,
Sesotho and IsiXhosa cultures there is a certain manner in which the
community would paint their houses. It’s a technique. They use different
colours that symbolise who they are.

We have become more reliant on Western medication and have neglected the
value of African herbs and the role they have been playing for centuries in
preserving the rural communities. They further have a role in combating
diseases such as HIV and Aids, cancer and diabetes.

Ke tshwanetse go tlhalosa gore mo malatsing a a fetileng jaaka Maaforika re
ne re na le ditlhare tsa rona tse re di dirisang tse gompieno di
fetoletsweng fela mo sekgoeng. Sekai, motekwane o ne o dirisiwa go fodisa

kgatelelo ya madi le mala a a segang. (Translation of Setswana paragraph
follows.)

[I have to explain that in the past as Africans we used to have our own
medicine that we used which is being westernised nowadays. For example,
weed was used to cure flu, lengana was used to cure flu; kgobemetsing,
which is called lavender nowadays, is a tea that helped to reduce blood
pressure, and mogalakane, which we call aloe nowadays, was used in helping
to reduce high blood pressure and stomach ache.]

Let us all enjoy Heritage Month. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J J GUNDA: Chair, hon Deputy Minister, indeed the Constitution of our
beloved country clearly states that the people of South Africa believe that
South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.

South Africa has a rich cultural heritage that is evident in our diverse
cultural expressions, oral traditions, craftsmanship, social practices,
rituals and festive events, which have always been celebrated and passed on
from generation to generation.

We in the ID believe that heritage plays a crucial role in nation-building.
Indeed, in our efforts to bring about social cohesion, we will need a
return to the Nelson Mandela years of reconciliation so that we can begin
to replace mere respect for each other’s cultures with a celebration of
these cultures as if they were our own.

We in the ID believe that we must also see Heritage Month 2009 within the
context of the global economic meltdown – a phase of recession that has in
turn resulted in large-scale job losses. It is imperative that we show
solidarity with the poor through our actions. The ID would therefore like
to take this opportunity to call on all South Africans to give in the
spirit of ubuntu, share what we have and get involved in work that will
improve our communities.

As members of the community, we need to focus on local cultural crafts,
getting to know our provinces and helping to preserve our heritage. I would
like to extend this and say that if you can go to the Northern Cape, to the
Kalahari, you can go and see original crafts and the beauty that crafts can
do, so that our children can keep this and learn from this.

Heritage Month is a time to reflect on our constitutional responsibility to
develop our South African culture. Part of this means nurturing our
indigenous languages and supporting South African literature. We must
develop all languages to have equal status in our day-to-day lives, and not
only equal status in our Constitution.

Allow me to quote from Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe when he said, and I quote:

  Here is a tree rooted in African soil, nourished with waters from the
  rivers of Africa. Come and sit under its shade and become, with us,
  leaves of the same branch and branches of the same tree. We dare not
  compromise, nor dare we use moderate language in the cause of freedom.

I thank you.

Mr S H PLAATJIE: Chairperson, hon members, on the 24th September of each
year, we consciously remember what each of the cultural groups in our
country contributed to the rich tapestry that makes up South African life.
It is appropriate that Heritage Day comes at the beginning of the spring
season. Africans at home and the Diaspora, irrespective of their colour or
their social background, must rise to the call of cultural renewal and
celebrate our crafts.

As Eric Arthur Blair puts it, he who controls the past controls the future;
he who controls the future controls the present.

Cope acknowledges that 24 September signifies the call for South Africans
to reinvent themselves and take very seriously their cultural lessons and
values. This House is a microcosm of the diverse and rich cultural
heritage, yet how much do we know about each other’s culture?

In Europe, September is also time to remember heritage because without the
knowledge of heritage, we cannot know ourselves. This year, Sweden
celebrated European Heritage Day on 13 September by focusing on the theme,
namely, “Sweden-Finland, a shared history”. Therefore, as Cope, we
recommend that we always remember in our celebration of heritage and crafts
in this country to acknowledge that the majority of people do not actually
take this day very seriously.

But this is not so with the Zulu people. The day of 24 September was
celebrated for a very long time as King Shaka Day, and that will happen
again this year. It is right and proper that we should dip into history to
understand how we became who we are and learn to know who we want to be.

Heritage is priceless, and crafts are also priceless. Heritage cannot be
treated in a frivolous manner. Heritage walks with a person and such a
person gives and begets respect. The greatest blemish that our country
suffers from comes from the rampage of criminality that is prevalent
everywhere. Criminals generally have no awareness of culture, history or
heritage. Our schools are becoming notorious for violent behaviour. An
unawareness of heritage spawns such violent behaviour and criminality.

People who experience no connectedness with iconic figures of the past,
music, dance or literature will obviously have no moral compass. Even if
what happened in the past was not glorious, it serves to teach and to
inform.

Civilisation occurs when we select the positives from the negatives. When
people act together for the good on the basis of the good that they
inherited, they stimulate arts, culture, music, craft, literature and
dance.

For four days in September, people in the UK are offered open doors to
castles, churches, houses and other buildings of great architectural value.
They pay nothing and are welcome to explore places and buildings that would
normally be closed to them. [Interjections.] Thank you very much,
Chairperson. [Time expired.]

[Prince M M M ZULU: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Arts and
Culture, hon Members of this House, we as South Africans cannot deny that
we are one of the countries with different racial groups who have their own
cultures.

What we are very proud of as the people of this country is that all these
racial groups are allowed to practise their customs. As the hon member has
said, in KwaZulu-Natal we commemorate Shaka’s Day. We commemorate him as
the person who unified and founded the Zulu nation, which count for an
estimated 11 million of the population of South Africa.

We cannot deny that we are part of South Africa, but as 11 million people
we are able to commemorate a person who founded such a big nation by
remembering the battles he fought in, in order to unify these tribes.

Hon Minister, I am therefore saying that you are not facing these
challenges alone; we are also faced with them. As the citizens of this
country we have to encourage tolerance when one racial group shows pride in
its culture because we cannot deny that South Africa has diverse racial
groups. If we deny that we would be lying to ourselves and that can cause
people to fight.

I salute the government for making this day official. The government also
needs to emphasise that with regard to African languages, if a child cannot
speak his or her mother tongue which can be isiZulu, isiXhosa or Sesotho as
a first language, that is a disgrace to the nation. Thank you,
Chairperson.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms N W Magadla): Thank you very much, hon Zulu. I
hope not everybody picked up what I picked up during the interpretation.

Ms R N RASMENI: Hon Chairperson and the House, during the dawn of democracy
in 1994, with the removal of apartheid laws, the birth of a new nation in
which the celebration of cultural diversity and affirmation of beliefs that
South Africa belong to all who live in it, black and white, was realised.
The Constitution of the Republic, under the equality clause, section 9,
provides that, and I quote:

  The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against
  anyone on one or more grounds ... ethnic or social origin, colour ...
  belief, culture, language ...

Under section 31(1) it further stresses that -

  Persons belonging to a cultural, religious or linguistic community may
  not be denied the right...


     a) to enjoy their culture, practise their religion and use their
        language ...


I was just reminding the House about this clause. To affirm the above
constitutional provisions, the ANC-led government put in place the Chapter
9 institution the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights
of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.

One has to acknowledge the fact that South Africa is a country with a rich
cultural heritage. Through the ANC-led government, a space has been created
for all cultural groups to enjoy and demonstrate their heritage with no
fear of intimidation.

Heritage and crafts have been in existence long before the democratic
dispensation. Since 1994 this sector has been given a lot of attention and
priority. In the global world arts, culture and heritage are often given
priority as they assist the country in terms of recognition of its nation
status. Originally crafts were a traditional skill for black people,
especially those from the rural communities and farms to manufacture during
their spare time.

Traditional people have been specialising in work such as indigenous wood
items, grass mats, grass baskets, etc. Through this art work the rural
communities have been using their skills to express their natural
creativity and to generate skills and income. Normally women would gather
in small groups, and work together. While working, they would sing together
or even share a pot of food.

These items would be sold to the tourists. They would divide the income
generated amongst themselves. Due to the nature of this informal trade, it
was not legislated. As time went by the locals became vulnerable to
manipulation. They became victims. They could not get value for their
items. These items would be bought for a very small amount from the locals
and the buyer would sell it at a very high price, either locally or abroad.


In his 1997 Heritage Day address on Robben Island, former President Nelson
Mandela, stated inter alia that, and I quote:

  In an earlier period Afrikaners celebrated their heritage in song and
  ceremony; in festivals and carnivals; in the selling of their own wares
  and buying items associated with their heritage; and by working the
  history of their communities into everyday artefacts, as the women of
  Hlabisa weave their stories into baskets.

The ANC strives to facilitate and celebrate cultural production that
captures the diversity, complexity and vibrancy of all South Africans and
recognises that a flourishing cultural life is vital to the well-being of
South Africa. At its 52nd National Conference at Polokwane, the ANC
reaffirmed our belief that arts and culture is a cornerstone of any
national democratic society and a fundamental pillar in the transformation
of our society.

Traditional cultural expressions such as the design and production of
crafts are handed down from one generation to another and are constantly
evolving, developing and being created within the community. They reflect
the community’s cultural and social identity and are created for
commercial, religious and cultural purposes. Manifestations of traditional
cultural expressions include basket weaving, crafts, instrumental music,
songs and pottery.

Crafters have over the years produced a vibrant crafts legacy by using
natural resources and recycled products such as plastic bags, paper,
cardboard boxes and wire, among other things, from their communities.
There’s a lot of new work in traditional media, with artists constantly
developing the African crafts repertoire. These include pretty tableware,
Christmas tree decorations, magnificent embroidered cloths and also bed
linen.

The sculptor Phutuma Seoka is another artist who has taken a traditional
form and given it a personal twist. In his case, the carving of figures
using the inherent curves and forks of tree branches, common in the Venda
region, is used to create a cast of eccentric characters. More than a
decade ago Comrade Wally Serote, then an ANC MP, said that the arts and
culture in South Africa, if properly organised, could become a very good
provider of revenue because there are some arts and crafts which are
uniquely peculiar to South Africa. He said we are looking at a possible
multimillion rand industry, and that the craft industry would be developed
to benefit women in rural areas in particular. He added that these women
have the skills, but need resources, infrastructure and business capacity.

The crafts industry has gradually moved from being just a mere expression
of individuals’ skills to entrepreneurship. Practitioners still lack
protection from exploitation. The imbalances between rural and urban areas
must also be addressed.

Lastly, recognising therefore that South Africa is home to a unique and
diverse crafts industry that produces a wide range of craft products across
different styles and genres, we also realise that it bodes well for rural
development, which is one of the priority areas for the current
administration. We must not miss the opportunity to highlight the
socioeconomic value of the crafts industry and encourage further
development and investment in it. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Hon Chairperson, firstly, let me
take the opportunity to thank hon members for their contribution. Quite
clearly, everybody said the importance of heritage cannot be
overemphasised, but also that we should continue to celebrate heritage on a
daily basis.

However, during this month, it is particularly important as we chose the
theme of craft to really ensure that the work of all those women in rural
areas, who are trying to produce one form of craft or the other, is
promoted and that they are protected and exposed to markets beyond our
shores.

There are lots of people who come to this country and are impressed by what
we produce. They want to buy these goods. We must make sure that our people
are not exploited and that they can derive value through money for what
they produce. But at the end of the day, the crafts reflect who we are as a
nation. As the Department of Arts and Culture, we will continue to promote
crafts as part of our heritage in our country, and make sure that we
promote crafts from all over South Africa because we are in a process of
building one nation. Therefore, it is important that we recognise the
diversity that exists.

I want to particularly encourage hon members to visit some of the heritage
sites that we have in the country. As I have said, we have more than eight
World Heritage Sites. I am sure that members have taken time to visit some
of them; if not, please do so. You can take your children and expose them
to these important areas of heritage in our own country.

But I want to conclude by thanking members for their constructive
contribution to the debate, and agree that going forward we must continue
to work together to ensure that our country can continue to thrive as a
united country in its diversity - with various cultures. But at the end of
the day, we must ensure that we remain a strong nation. Thank you very
much. [Applause.]

                       INTERNATIONAL DAY OF DEMOCRACY
                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members, yesterday
the Inter-Parliamentary Union and parliaments around the world celebrated
the second International Day of Democracy, declared by the United Nations
General Assembly in 2007.

In its Resolution 62/7 establishing the International Day of Democracy, the
UN says:

  Reaffirming the Charter of the United Nations, including the principles
  and purposes contained therein, and recognizing that human rights, the
  rule of law and democracy are interlinked and mutually reinforcing and
  that they belong to the universal and indivisible core values and
  principles of United Nations, ...


  reaffirms –


      ... that democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed
      will of people to determine their political, economic, social and
      cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their
      lives; ...


       3.   Encourages governments to strengthen national programmes devoted
       to the promotion and consolidation of democracy, including through
       increased bilateral, regional and international co-operation, taking
       into account innovative approaches and best practices; ...


       4.   Encourages regional and other intergovernmental organisations to
       share their experiences in the field of democracy promotion with each
       other and with the United Nations system where appropriate, ...

The International Day of Democracy is meant both to celebrate democracy and
to serve as a reminder that the need to promote and protect democracy is as
urgent now as ever.

The choice of 15 September for the International Day of Democracy
corresponds to the adoption, in September 1997, by the IPU, of a Universal
Declaration on Democracy. That declaration affirms the principles of
democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government and the
global scope of democracy.

The 2009 International Day of Democracy was held under the theme,
“Democracy and Political Tolerance”. In a statement released yesterday to
mark this day, IPU President Dr Theo-Ben Gurirab described political
tolerance as follows:

  ... accepting and respecting the basic rights and civil liberties of
  persons and groups whose viewpoints differ from one’s own. ... It is the
  foundation of democratic dialogue and political pluralism.

This year’s International Day of Democracy has been defined as an
opportunity for parliamentarians to emphasise the importance of democracy,
what it involves, the challenges it faces as well as the opportunities it
offers, and the central responsibility that all parliaments have as the key
institutions of democracy; to examine and discuss how well parliament
performs its democratic functions, possibly on the basis of self-assessment
and identify what steps it may take to strengthen its effectiveness; and to
promote awareness and practice of political tolerance within parliament and
the greater society.

As noted by the UN in 2007, we are mindful of the central role of
Parliament and the active involvement of civil society organisations and
media and their interaction with government at all levels in promoting
democracy, freedom, equality, participation, development, respect of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.

The Freedom Charter, the seminal document adopted in 1955 and which gave
meaning to our struggle for democracy, states that the government of the
country shall be based on the will of all people, black and white, and that
all adults shall be entitled to a universal suffrage; and that all national
groups shall be equal and racialism shall be considered a serious state
crime.

In 1994 this dream was realised when South Africa joined the rest of
humanity as a free nation. In the 15 years of our democracy we have been
applauded for entrenching democratic practices. We have done more than many
established democracies in espousing political tolerance. This is not
surprising because our struggle for freedom was informed by a deeper
yearning for democratic rule.

Bidding farewell to the UN General Assembly in September 1998, our first
President and struggle veteran Nelson Mandela, said that in his retirement
he would -

  ... continue to entertain the hope that there has emerged a cadre of
  leadership in my own country and region, on my continent and in the
  world, which will not allow that any should be denied their freedom as we
  were; that any should be turned into refugees as we were; that any should
  be condemned to go hungry as we were; that any should be stripped of
  their human dignity as we were.

As we mark the International Day of Democracy, we are reminded of the many
in our land and abroad who sacrificed their lives for others to enjoy
freedom. We salute the veterans of the struggle who were inspired by the
vision enshrined in the Freedom Charter, that the government of the day
shall be based on the will of all people, black and white.

South Africa is now a better place, the envy of many nations. As we forge
ahead, building our nonracial democratic society, we must continue to work
hard to create a better place for present and future generations.

Our democracy will be meaningless if it does not lift our people from
poverty. It will be meaningless if the wealth of our country is not shared
among all the people.

History is an important teacher for us. Building strong democracy remains
our goal as a nation. Central to this is the building of strong
institutions of democracy, promotion of political tolerance and ensuring a
government that is open and accountable to the electorate.

Parliament, whose role is to oversee the work of government on behalf of
the people, is an important institution in the world, and therefore people
should regard it as such and respect it.

As President Mandela said, we must –

  ... not allow that any should be denied their freedom as we were; that
  any should be turned into refugees as we were; that any should be
  condemned to go hungry as we were; that any should be stripped of their
  human dignity as we were.

We should not allow this as parliamentarians. We should guard against it.
We should go around in our country and make our democracy stronger, and
protect our Constitution that was not just drafted by us as
parliamentarians, but by the entire society of South Africa that we’ve
engaged in completing this document, which is so wonderful and praised by
the entire world. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R A LEES: Chairperson, Chairperson of the NCOP, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen, it is with a sense of honour and pleasure that I address this
august House this afternoon. Like many hon members present here today – and
there are not that many present – I have spent the better part of my life
campaigning for democracy in our country.

There are those who will argue that South Africa is now a democratic
country, and in many ways they will be correct. It is indeed a better
country. A democracy, however, is not an event that occurred for South
Africa in 1994. It is a system of government which evolved, and continues
to evolve; one which requires every one of us to nurture and protect it. It
is, therefore, fit and proper that we should celebrate this the
International Day of Democracy.

Democracy is not simply government of the people by the people; there is so
much more to democracy than that. There are certain core and independent
institutions in any real democracy. These are the legislature, the
executive - or government - the state, the judiciary and the Press. If even
one of these institutions ceases to be independent or to exist, then
democracy under these conditions is doomed to failure.

There is a dangerous view amongst many of the people in South Africa that
democracy starts and finishes at the ballot box, that once the majority has
won, then it is the democratic right of those with the majority to control,
not only the legislature and the government, but also all other
institutions of democracy such as the SABC, the judiciary and other
institutions.

Thus we see the appointment of cadres of the ruling party at all levels in
state departments, the JSC, the SABC board, the Reserve Bank and others.

The holding of elections and forming a government does not constitute a
democracy. Before 1994, South Africa was no more democratic than Swaziland
is today. Elections and governments existed or exist in both, but neither
can be called democracies. Largely as a result of the unselfish efforts of
our very own hon Nzimande, who is not here today, there is today a disabled
person who is a member of the Swaziland parliament. Even so, that
parliament is still not part of a functioning democracy.

I spent last week in the company of the Kwa-Zulu Natal delegates to the
NCOP; good people, every one of them, with whom I believe I have formed a
close bond. Despite these good people, two of us, delegates from Kwa-Zulu
Natal, who are not members of the ruling party, were left high and dry on
Thursday because the official programme had been cancelled to allow the ANC
delegates to attend an ANC workshop.

In a small way, this is an example of the view that interests of the ruling
party take precedence over the interests of government. I raise this point
not to embarrass my Kwa-Zulu Natal colleagues in any way, but simply to
highlight the dangerous mode of undermining democracy that we sometimes
find ourselves in.

Some of us will argue that it is the job of both Parliament and government
to implement the wishes of the people. In a democracy, the wishes of the
people must always be balanced against the requirements of justice, and in
particular, justice for every single man, woman and child. A situation
wherein the rights of a single person are trodden on in order to carry out
the wishes of the people is not a democracy.

The National Socialist German Workers’ Party, the Nazis, in Germany had the
support of the people, but it was certainly not a democracy. In South
Africa, there can be no justification either for my son to be denied
employment simply because he’s a so-called white. How can we justify it
when my son is interviewed for job by a large corporation, reaches the
final selection, but is then told that despite his suitability for the job,
they cannot employ him because he is not African.

Let me say it to you that this manipulation of individual rights to give
preference to some South Africans simply on the basis of skin colour is
undemocratic and is no better than the job reservation laws of the
apartheid government. I say it to you today, ladies and gentlemen, my
family and I are African, and no government will ever take that away from
us.

What our democracy in South Africa urgently needs is for opportunities to
be created for all its people; that is what we need to make it a true
democracy.

We all need to grapple with the meaning of real democracy for South Africa,
and to try, without rest, to put this into place. We must never again allow
our country to slide into the undemocratic state of nationalism.

With God’s help, may we all strive for a nonracial liberal democracy in
South Africa. I thank you, Mr Chairman.

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order: Hon Chair, is it in order for a member of
the ANC, hon Gamede, during the speech of hon Lees to admit it verbally by
saying “Kunjalo” when the member was saying that it is not democracy for
the governing party to think they control the judiciary, and by so doing
defying the Constitution which says that its not the right of any party to
control the judiciary?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): What is your objection? What is the
point of Order?

Mr A WATSON: That is a reflection on the Constitution. By saying “Kunjalo”
that means it is true that the party that governs this House and this
country is not in line with the Constitution, and objectively disrupts the
Constitution.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): I don’t have the benefit of the
statement that you are referring to, which will make my life very difficult
if I am to make a ruling on that. Do you mind if we then allow me to
satisfy myself with what you have said and then maybe present the ruling in
the next sitting on that particular matter? Also I need to verify the state
of order of whatever statement that was made. Is that agreed to? You don’t
agree?

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chairperson, we want to agree but it is important that, in
the future, members must not raise issues if they have not listened to what
other people were saying in this House. Satisfy yourself, because I think
he is out of order; it’s incorrect. He has not said that. Please satisfy
yourself and give a ruling in this House.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): If we are agreed on that particular
process, then let’s conclude it. I think ... [Interjections.] Hon Watson
... [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: Chair, you gave a ruling, and now he says I’m out of order.
Rule against him.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon Watson, we had agreed as a House
that we are going to proceed in a particular way, and... [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: But the member does not agree, Chair.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): No, he is not objecting to that ruling.
[Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: He says I’m out of order; that means he’s not agreeing.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): No, if he had not agreed with the
ruling, he would have then said that my ruling was incorrect; but it’s not
what he is saying. Hence the ruling stands. Can we proceed with the debate.

Mr D B FELDMAN: Hon Chairman, hon members, it is nearly 12 years since the
Inter-Parliamentary Union adopted the Universal Declaration on Democracy.

The IPU did this to affirm the principles of democracy and of the elements
and exercise of democratic government. Naturally, the IPU was keen to see
the parliaments of the world doing more to entrench these principles within
society. Since last year, 40 countries have begun participating in
celebrating the International Day of Democracy.

It’s a pleasure for me to stand up this afternoon and affirm the principles
of democracy on behalf of Cope. I know that we all share the ideal.

A mere 20 years ago it was not even possible to conceive of such a thought,
yet here we are, celebrating democracy. The theme for this year’s
International Day of Democracy is “Political Tolerance”. It is common cause
that political tolerance is indeed a central tenet of democracy. As such,
political tolerance is absolutely essential for the functioning of our
parliamentary system and mode of government.

Today, we should not only be mouthing platitudes concerning political
tolerance, but should also be reflecting deeply on it and committing
ourselves to it without reservation. Our commitment to political tolerance
has to be absolute.

Our unique history must teach us political tolerance. The example of the
iconic Nelson Mandela must teach us tolerance. The philosophy of ubuntu, to
which all of us subscribe, must teach us tolerance. A perfect democrat, in
my view, is the person who shows the greatest political tolerance and is
open to new ideas for the common good of all.

In our country we have many political parties. Political parties have many
disagreements about processes and policies, but never about outcomes. All
of us who are here are motivated by a single desire to serve our people in
the best possible manner.

As parties, we are therefore united on the outcome we want. Our
contestation, therefore, is limited to practice and policies. This is
democracy at work, and let us therefore set high standards for ourselves in
this regard. We know that it is through debate that the best ideas are
born. And where debate is suppressed, the worst excesses occur.

In conclusion, may I propose to this House that we take the cue from
Uruguay and launch an essay competition for grade 11 learners on the phrase
that appears on the upper walls of the General Assembly, namely:

  My authority emanates from you and it ceases before your sovereign
  presence.

If our children imbibe the principle of democracy, that which we are
seeking to build here today will indeed last into the future. Let democracy
in our country never falter. Let us, therefore, on this momentous occasion,
recall the following stirring words by Nelson Mandela:

  Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will
  again experience the oppression of one by another. Let freedom reign.

I thank you. [Applause.]

UMntwana M M M ZULU: Sihlalo ohloniphekile waleNdlu, Mnumzane uMahlangu
osihola kulezi zinkulumompikiswano, namalunga ahloniphekile aleNdlu,ngithi
thina lapha njengezwe laseNingizimu Afrika siyazi ukuthi inkululeko yethu
sayilwela kanjani ngendlela ezehlukene kule lizwe.

Ukwehlukana kwemiqondo yethu sasilwa nabantu ababodwa-nje, nabantu ababodwa
ababezama ukusikhubaza nokusikhinyabeza ukuthi ezweni lethu sibe
yizihlupheki. Kepha angeke sakubamba lokho ngoba sesalilwela lelizwe futhi
sesikhululekile sonke. Ngiyazi ukuthi ngonyaka ka1994 kwakungokuqala ukuthi
ngivote kule lizwe ngivotela uhulumeni wentando yeningi. Uhulumeni usekhona
manje kufuneka sazi ukuthi bab’u Mahlangu, impilo yentando yeningi emazweni
womhlaba yilapho kuphikiswana khona. Kodwa ukuphikisana kwethu akungasho
ukuthi kufuneka sibambane ngezandla kodwa silwa impi yamazwi ukuze sikwazi
ukuthi uhulumeni obusa ngaleso sikhathi abesendleleni okuyiyona yona.

Akungasho ukuthi kufuneka ngigxeke ngephuzu lokuthi kufuneka ngizuze
amaphuzu ezepolitiki yini ohlangothini lwami kodwa kufuneka ngigxeke
ngokwakhayo uma kugxekwa ukuze kwakhiwe kuyiwe phambili. Ngithi-ke sonke
lapha kufuneka siyijabulele inkululeko yethu sikwazi futhi ukuyigada ukuze
sibone ukuthi kuhamba kanjani ezintweni eziningi. Ngoba inkululeko ihamba
ihambe ibenomkhawulo.

Uzakwethu uthe Isahluko 9 soMthethosisekelo nezinye izinhlangothi kufuneke
ziyekwe zisebenze nje. Hayi! Mina ngithi cha! Cha! Ngeke kuthi uhlelo
lwezobulungiswa luyekwe nje lusebenze ngaphandle kokuthi lugadwe
nguhulumeni ngoba uma kungenzeka lokho ngoba sonke sophelela emajele
singabantu ngenxa yentando yemantshi ethile eyodwa noma ngomeli othile.
Ngiyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Prince M M M ZULU: Hon House Chairperson, hon Mahlangu who is leading us
in the debates and the hon Members of this House, we know as the people of
this country how we used different strategies as different people when we
fought for our liberation.

We used different strategies in our fight against a group of people – we
were fighting a group of people who were trying to cripple us so that we
could not prosper; they wanted to make us impoverished in our own country.
But we are not going to hold on to that now because we have fought and won
and we are all free now. I know that I voted for the first time in 1994
when I voted for this country’s democratic government. We have a democratic
government now, hon Mahlangu, and we must be aware that in a democracy
there are disagreements, and that happens all over the world. But our
debates should not necessarily end up in physical fights but we should
engage one another so that the government of the day can stay on the right
track.

It should not mean that I need to criticise for the sake of scoring
political points, but I must criticise constructively when there is a need
to do so, so that we can go forward. I am saying that all of us here must
be grateful for our freedom and be able to safeguard it by seeing to it
that everything goes well because at times freedom has its own limitations.

My colleague said section 9 of the Constitution and other parts thereof
must be left unchanged. I disagree with that. We cannot allow the justice
system to function without being monitored by government because if that
happens many people will end up behind bars because a magistrate or a
lawyer did as he/she pleased. Thank you.]

Mr J J GUNDA: House Chair, Chair of the NCOP and hon members, let me start
off by saying that the International Day of Democracy is a time for all of
us around the world to reflect on the value of democracy.

What is also important is that those of us who are fortunate enough to live
in a democracy need to look at ways in which we cannot only strengthen our
own democracy, but also show solidarity with our fellow human beings who
are still living in undemocratic societies.

It is up to each and every one of us to ensure that the flame of democracy
is lit throughout the world and burns brighter and brighter.

Democracy is government by the people; a form of government in which the
supreme powers vested in the people are exercised directly by them or by
the elected agents under a free electoral system; a state of society
characterised by formal equality of rights and privileges, political or
social equality and democratic spirit; democracy is about the common people
of the community, as distinguished from any privileged class; and the
common people with respect to their political power.

Democracy needs to deliver on the aspirations of the people and form part
of the drive for the creation of a more socially and economically just
world.

Here at home, this is an auspicious day on which we should celebrate our
people’s freedom from oppression and the fact that we overcame a racist,
undemocratic regime and replaced it with a democratic dispensation.

Our unique and impressive story is an example to nations around the world.
We, in the ID, believe that democracy is not true democracy unless it is a
purveyor of social and economic justice.

As an example to other nations in the Third World, South Africa has a
leading role to play in negotiations around fair trade and climate change.

We also cannot allow the recognition of our position as a role model to
other nations to stand in the way of honesty when it comes to the living
conditions of our own people. With more than half of our people living in
abject poverty, it is clear that our democracy has not yet translated into
something tangible for our people.

Only once we have ensured that increasing numbers of our people taste the
fruits of our democracy will we be able to say that as public
representatives we have achieved what our people trusted us to deliver.

We have certainly seen some improvements in the lives of our people, but we
still have a huge amount of work to do. And until that work is done, true
democracy will remain a reality only for the upper echelons of our society.
We, in the ID, would therefore like to recommit ourselves to the task at
hand.

Let me also just agree with hon M J Mahlangu that we need to have political
tolerance so that we can respect each other, so that we can have a better
life. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms B V MNCUBE: Chairperson, hon members, on 18 November 2007, the 192-
member UN General Assembly, stressing the need to promote democratisation,
development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, agreed
to observe 15 September each year as the International Day of Democracy.

In addition, the Assembly affirmed that democracy is a universal value
based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own
political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full
participation in all aspects of life.

The quest of the ANC for a better Africa and a better world derives from
the internationalist tradition, with its origins in the Freedom Charter,
which states that “There Shall be Peace and Friendship!”
and that-

   South Africa shall strive to maintain world peace and the settlement of
   all international disputes by negotiation – not war ...

South Africa’s geopolitical location continues to shape and inform this
agenda for a world order which must be characterised by greater security,
peace, dialogue and greater equilibrium between the poor and rich.

In this, we are guided by the ANC’s principles of a better life for all and
a vision of a better Africa and a just world, hence our country entered a
global discourse with a clear reform agenda and with a view to promoting
the democratisation of international, political and economic relations.

South Africa, while cognisant of its status as a middle power on the global
stage, has deliberately set out to confront the global realities of a
skewed distribution of political and economic power, mass poverty and
conflict resolution. It is committed to the promotion of human rights, to
democracy, to Africa and to international peace through participation in
the global system of governance.

To this end, and recognising the relationship between armed conflict and
poverty, the ANC has prioritised the reconstruction of Africa, particularly
where internal and armed conflict, poverty and underdevelopment militate
against democracy, peace, stability and development.

History informs us that parts of the African continent, especially
postcolonial Africa, have been subjected to dictatorships, armed conflict,
ethnic wars and genocide. This culminated in the displacement of her
peoples, concomitant outbreaks of disease, hunger, and the absorption of
millions of refugees in countries that were perceived to be safer.

As a signatory to the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and
Governance, we have, as a country, reaffirmed our commitment to the
relevant decisions of the OAU: the 1999 Algiers Declaration on
Unconstitutional Changes of Government, the Lomé Declaration for an AU
response to Unconstitutional Changes of Government, and the 2002 AU
Declaration on Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa.

In fact, the preamble to the African Charter commits the member states of
the AU to the principles enshrined in its Constitutive Act, particularly
the articles which emphasise the critical importance of good governance,
popular participation, respect for the rule of law and upholding human
rights.

It places obligations on African countries in relation to the holding of
regular, transparent, free and fair elections; the separation of powers;
the promotion of gender equality in public and private institutions;
effective participation of citizens in democratic and development processes
and governance of public affairs; the condemnation and rejection of acts of
corruption, related offences and impunity; and the condemnation and total
rejection of unconstitutional changes of government.

It currently remains uncertain as to how many countries actually ratified
the Charter. Although the Charter does provide for state parties to
initiate measures, including legislative, executive and administrative
actions to bring state parties’ national laws into conformity with itself,
it leaves a lot to be desired.

It can therefore be argued that the African Peer Review Mechanism,
established by Nepad as an instrument for voluntary self-monitoring for
good governance by AU member states, was neither adequately applied in
terms of its injunctions, nor addressed by parliamentarians on the
continent.

But, even so, in all countries, democracy is about much more than a single
decision or a hastily organised election. It requires a deeper process of
political development to embed democratic values and culture in all parts
of society and a political maturity to sustain it.

In fact, let me correct hon Lees by pointing out that the apartheid regime
never practised democracy. It protected only the few at the expense of the
majority of South African citizens, Africans in particular. So, real
democracy was ushered in by the ANC, for the people, by the people, for the
people’s power, in 1994.

In South Africa, under the ANC-led government, the Constitution has
enshrined a number of institutions supporting constitutional democracy.
These include the Public Protector, the Auditor-General, the Public Service
Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Commission for Gender
Equality, the Independent Electoral Commission and the Commission for the
Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities,
and the Hawks – formerly known as the Scorpions.

The independence and impartiality of these institutions are entrenched in
the Constitution. Hon Lees, mazambane. The three pillars of democracy are
Parliament, the judiciary, and the executive.

It is of great significance that Parliament has ensured maximum public
participation and public accountability, which is central to democratic
governance. Public participation enables popular participation by
nongovernmental organisations and institutions, various stakeholders and
all those who have an interest in various pieces of legislation, specific
debates and the performance of the state in general.

Public accountability has ensured that there is transparent and robust
debate and scrutiny of government actions. Overall, the transparent
functioning of particularly select committees of this august House and the
dedication of parliamentary activists has deepened accountability.

In conclusion, let us always remember that it was the ANC who introduced
the Freedom Charter. I heard my hon colleague from Cope quoting from the
Freedom Charter. The first systematic statement in the history of our
country of the political and constitutional vision of a free, democratic
and nonracial South Africa can be found in the ANC’s 1989 Constitutional
Guidelines for a Democratic South Africa.

That document stated that the creation of a truly just and democratic South
Africa required a constitution based on, among other principles, a Bill of
Rights and that such a Bill of Rights should guarantee the fundamental
human rights of all citizens irrespective of race, colour, sex or creed. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: House Chairperson, I thank all the members of
the House for supporting this debate. I think everybody has driven home his
or her point. However, I just want to say a few words. If one listened to
me very well, I said quite a few things that I quoted from other people. I
think those things are very important in democracy.

Firstly, I said that when the chairperson of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,
IPU, Mr Gurirab, was celebrating this day last week he said that democracy
is accepting and respecting the basic rights and civil liberties of persons
and groups whose view points differ from one’s own. That is very important.
We will never agree on everything in this world. We will always differ. But
differing does not mean hating each other, neither does it mean fighting
each other. That is what democracy is about.

We don’t have the same minds as we are seated here. Every one of us has a
unique way of thinking. These things are normal. For example, I normally
have a fight with my wife as well as my children. But I’ve never chased
them out of our home. It is their democratic right to question some of the
things that I do as much as I have the right to question some of the things
that they do. At the end of the day we sleep together, and we’ve got a very
happy family. [Interjections.] That is all it means.

There are people who are so self-centred and selfish because they want to
be recognised as individuals. We shouldn’t be doing that because we would
be killing democracy. All these views from the different walks of life that
we are living as people in this country are very important. That’s a
viewpoint which I have expressed, and I put it very clearly.

Also, I said we are mindful of the central role of parliaments and the
active involvement of civil society organisations and media. I have said it
here; it’s in my statement. I am reading from my statement about their
interaction with government at all levels in promoting democracy, freedom
and equality. They should not be destroying.

There are those who destroy. Building this democracy is not an easy thing,
but destroying it is a very simple thing. I’m talking about promoting and
not destroying these things: freedom, equality, participation, development,
respect of human rights and the rule of law. We have to promote these
issues, and we have to talk about them.

We must tell those people who are destroying them that they are wrong.
Let’s not go to restaurants to have dinners with such people and tell them
they are right whereas we, as public representatives, know that those
things are wrong and are destroying our Constitution. As I have said, the
Constitution is a lovely document drafted by the people of South Africa,
and we respect it.

I also quoted the former President, Mr Mandela, who said we must never
allow - not just himself but all of us here as public representatives -
that any should be denied their freedom as we were denied ours in the past;
that any should be turned into refugees as has happened in the past; that
any should be condemned into going hungry as we did in the past; or that
any should be stripped of their human dignity.

We must not allow those things. All of us as public representatives must
protect these rights as they are enshrined in the Constitution so that our
dignity will remain intact and we can be proud citizens of South Africa. I
thank you, House Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                     TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF PROCEEDINGS

                               (Announcement)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Hon members, you might have noted that
there is a second order, but we can’t continue with it because the Minister
is absent. However, I have been informed that she is on her way. Therefore
we request a suspension of the proceedings for the next five minutes or so.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: I support what the House Chairperson is saying.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -
         OVERSIGHT VISIT TO HARMONY GOLD MINE ELAND SHAFT IN WELKOM


The MINISTER OF MINING: Chair, please accept my apology for running late.
Sometimes programmes tend to clash, so I once more tender my apology for
coming a bit late.

Hon members, today’s debate deals with issues of illegal mining. Theft of
gold and illicit mining is nothing new in South Africa, as theft has been
occurring since the inception of the gold mining industry.

Illicit mining in South Africa started to gain momentum from the late
1990s. Illicit mining first reared its ugly head in Welkom as far back as
1999. The department and mining companies have been working together over
the last decade to put an end to this problem, but with little success. The
recent unfortunate loss of 91 illegal diggers’ lives in Welkom has again
put into sharp relief the scourge of illicit mining, and has focused public
attention on the issue like never before.

Illicit mining poses serious challenges for the industry. This issue is
extremely complex and it should not be underestimated. Illegal mining is a
huge multibillion rand criminal industry featuring national and
international syndicates and is valued at some R5,6 billion.

These gold smuggling syndicates are highly organised, dangerous and well
resourced. When considering the question of how these syndicates manage to
transport food and other consumables deep down into the mines, it is clear
that illicit mining is being assisted by legal miners, both workers and
managers.

Explosives and equipment are also transported and stolen from underground
stores of operating mines. Thousands of diggers – many coming from Lesotho,
Mozambique and Zimbabwe – are willing to risk their lives to profit from
these illegal activities.

These illegal diggers are armed and dangerous. We want to send a clear
message that poverty cannot be an excuse for criminal activities. I want to
make it clear that all those involved in illegal mining are no different
from those ruthless criminals involved in cash-in-transit heists who
mercilessly kill our policemen and policewomen.

In Barberton, in the province of Mpumalanga, illegal diggers are now taking
over equipment and work places. They openly carry a huge number of weapons,
including AK47s and 9mm pistols. Intergang fights and shoot-outs are now a
daily occurrence in this area.

Confrontations between illegal miners, the police and security personnel
are becoming more frequent. Legal miners have also been abducted in
Barberton and illegal miners use human shields when confronting the police.
In Welkom, booby traps using explosives are set for the police and security
personnel.

Therefore, illicit mining is also spilling over into illegal activities,
including child prostitution and child labour. Both employees and
communities are experiencing serious threats where illicit mining takes
place. These illegal activities are impacting negatively on the economy,
robbing our country and its people of valuable resources which could
otherwise have been used to improve the lives of our people.

The sophistication of these gold smuggling syndicates cannot be
underestimated. The so-called zama zamas are the diggers recruited from the
ranks of experienced, unemployed miners, and are known to stay underground
for up to a year. They protect their turf from other illegal miners or
threaten and attack legal miners.

At another level, local gangs are also involved in, amongst other things,
recruitment and the supply of food and basic necessities underground. This
creates networks of mine officials and security guards who receive bribes
for their support and even provide legal support to arrested illegal
miners.

The local syndicates interface with the exporter who then smuggles gold out
of the country. The smuggled gold then changes hands with intermediaries or
front companies and ends up with international buyers. These illicit mining
activities threaten to undermine the country’s economy, and social and
security policies which have been coined, not only for enhancing the
Republic’s reputation as an investment destination of choice, but also for
its citizens to enjoy the fruits of our democracy.

To this end, this government has taken decisive steps to ensure that we
deal firmly with illegal mining. On 2 June 2009, we visited Welkom
immediately after receiving the news of the 36 deaths there, to see for
ourselves and get a first-hand understanding of the issue.

We visited Welkom again, on 13 June 2009, to discuss the issues with a wide
range of role-players, including the local communities, municipalities,
business people, mining companies and trade unions. Representatives of the
SAPS, both nationally and provincially, were also in attendance.

Subsequent to that, we established the Free State Illegal Mining
Stakeholder Forum, constituted by community leaders, organised labour,
municipalities, mining companies, the Department of Mineral Resources, and
the SAPS as well as the Department of Justice and Constitutional
Development. Other relevant departments are also consulted to provide
assistance where necessary.

The Free State Illegal Mining Stakeholder Forum has since developed an
action plan to eradicate illegal mining activities in the region. The
stakeholder forum continually monitors progress made on the implementation
of the action plan by the relevant stakeholders, as a sign of the forum’s
success. There are now reports that illegal miners have been migrating to
the West Rand in Gauteng.

Having been presented with this matter, Cabinet noted the serious nature of
the threat that illegal mining poses to the country, and took a decision
that the matter be attended to by the Justice Crime Prevention Security
cluster, the relevant structure to deal with this criminality.

We have since presented this criminal matter to the Inter-Ministerial
Security Cluster, which agreed, amongst other things, that the newly-formed
Hawks must take over and investigate illicit mining in its totality; that
relevant legislation must be applied without fear or favour to deal with
racketeering, money laundering, illegal possession of minerals and so on;
and that an investigation should determine whether or not local police and
prosecutors in the relevant magisterial district are involved with the
illegal mining syndicates.

A delegation of Ministers of the JCPS cluster and I will soon visit some of
the affected areas to assess for ourselves what else can be done to deal
comprehensively with the issue of illicit mining.

In conclusion, I want to assure this House that my department and, indeed,
this government of South Africa, have taken decisive steps to tackle the
issue of illegal mining head-on. However, I also want to assure the
criminal syndicates involved in illegal mining that we have resolved to
crush them. We are determined, we are strengthened and we will continue in
our efforts. They will continue to feel the heat as government closes in on
them, until they stop robbing our people of the minerals that, as per the
Freedom Charter, belong to them. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon colleagues, let me start by
thanking the Minister for making herself available for this debate about
the report. Illegal mining has taken a lot out of our country in terms of
finance. Research has shown that R10 million leaves the country per year.

Thank you, Minister, for your consideration. It shows that government, the
ANC-led government and the ANC Ministers are really passionate about
delivering on the instructions that they got from the President and from
the ruling party.

It is quite strange because this illegal mining activity happens on
privately-owned mines. The Minister could have just folded her arms and
said, “It’s privately-owned property, they must deal with it!” But because
– and I want the DA to listen, especially hon Faber and hon Watson - we
have a caring government that does not only care about money, but cares
about the people of South Africa as well, the Minister took those steps.

Hon Watson, if you listened, you would have heard what steps Minister has
taken. Hon Watson and hon Faber, the Minister took proactive steps!

The DA is criticising, but doesn’t come up with solutions to the problems.
The ANC and the Minister took steps to curb this. As I said, it is
privately-owned property! We need to give the DA a lesson on the
distinction between state- and privately-owned property.

Without any waste of time, I want to put the recommendations of the
committee. The committee has sat and felt that a debate is necessary
because this is of national interest. The committee has come up with
certain recommendations. I would like to thank the members of the committee
who have been proactive, who went to Welkom and engaged with various people
there.

The committee has recommended that the Department of Mining and the
Department of Police should report back to Parliament. Thank you, Minister,
for doing that. Thank you for the willingness you have shown on a regular
basis regarding the progress made in respect of remedial steps taken by the
state, mining houses and mine owners to combat and prevent illegal mining,
and improve the security and safety at mines.

Parliament needs to tighten the laws pertaining to the Justice cluster, and
the Minister has alluded to that. Thank you, once again, Minister.

Hon Sinclair, be assured, I am not an imbongi for the Minister, but we need
to give praise where it is due. You could see that she is a hands-on
Minister. She is not a Minister who serves the “congress of the people of
Europe,” as one of your colleagues has spelt it out. She is a Minister for
the people of South Africa.

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Order! Is that a point of order?

Mr D V BLOEM: I am confused. I don’t know whether it is a Member of
Parliament or an imbongi who is at the podium because it sounds like an
imbongi and not a Member of Parliament.

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): I am not going to carry that. You may
continue.

Mr F ADAMS: The hon Bloem is confused. He was a member of the ANC until 22
April 2009, and he said that he did not know how his name appeared on the
list. He is totally confused. They are a confused “congress of the people”.
I don’t think I need to answer him on that.

As I said, I’m not going to answer hon Bloem because he is totally
confused. You cannot say, “I don’t know how my name appeared on the Cope
list” and the next thing you are sitting in the ANC chairs. That is total
confusion. If the ANC didn’t take the necessary steps, I don’t know what
would have happened. [Interjections.]

The proper terminology must be defined and agreed upon in the various
sectors, as the Minister has alluded to. There should be co-operation
between mining houses, labour unions, the SAPS and the Department of
Justice. The SAPS should perform top-level arrests and name and shame
syndicate kingpins.

The Department of Minerals and Energy must force licensed gold dealers to
keep a register of buyers and sellers. Mining companies should tighten up
security and invest in proper security systems. The Mine Health and Safety
Inspectorate should be strengthened in order to implement effectively the
Mine Health and Safety Amendment Act, Act 74 of 2008, and to investigate
and enforce compliance with the Act, which will hopefully result in
reducing occupational injuries and ill health.

The Mine Health and Safety Amendment Act should be amended to increase the
fine for noncompliance in respect of the safekeeping of explosives from the
current R200 000 to R1 million. Underground security patrols should be
encouraged. Security should be increased at functioning mines, including
search procedures, to prevent the theft and smuggling of equipment and
explosives.

The shortcomings in dealing with illegal mining need to be addressed,
especially gaps in current legislation. I put this report before this House
for support. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms E C VAN LINGEN: Chairperson, hon Minister, it is good to have you here,
hon members. As the NCOP committee, we visited the Eland Shaft, and we were
briefed by all stakeholders except the zama-zamas. Those who were
underground would not speak to us and those that were above ground were
dead - a lot of them. They died at the beginning of June.

We found out about three major things at the shaft. The illegal mining
industry is growing fast; the second issue was that it is organised crime
on a big scale. I don’t know if I heard the Minister correctly. She spoke
about R5,6 billion. The figure that was mentioned to us was R10 billion, so
it varies a bit. Billions! Yes, it’s a big industry. Until these
unfortunate deaths, the ANC and the Department of Mining had been turning a
blind eye to all of this. [Interjections.] It has been coming for a long
time; illegal mining is a big contributor to organised crime in South
Africa, and it needs to be stopped.

The so-called zama zamas channel an estimated R10 billion each year into
the hands of criminal syndicates. These funds go into drug distribution,
prostitution rings and all other sorts of unsavoury practices – in short,
activities that make South Africa a more dangerous and unlawful place.

It is obvious that cutting down on these activities would have a drastic
and immediate effect on the ability of organised crime to function and
will, therefore, improve the security situation in South Africa. Rather
than spending millions upon millions of rands on government VIP protection,
the people of South Africa would be much better served if crime could be
tackled at its roots.

In order to do this, the DA happens to be agreeing with the Minister. We
would like the Hawks to form a special unit, and this is what we are
proposing, to exclusively clamp down on the zama zamas. The case for such a
unit is clear. It is a relatively specialised area, and it is a source of
criminal funding that can be turned off if policed correctly.

Up to now, the government has had its head in the sand, so to speak. There
has been no political will to curb the spread of illegal mining at these
decommissioned mines, thereby creating a huge gap to fill the pockets of
criminals. The Department of Mining is clearly incapable of dealing with
this matter, and is either unwilling or unable to take action against this
problem. It is true that monitoring the decrepit mines may be seen as
counterproductive to a country that needs all of its security resources
available. But the argument is clear; stop this huge influx of funding to
criminals and organised crime will be reduced.

South Africa needs to be smart about how we are going to tackle the
enormous crime problem. Merely waiting for something to happen, as the
Department of Mining has done until the beginning of June, is not going to
solve anything. On the contrary, the problem is getting worse and is
getting more difficult to clamp down on it, as it is becoming more
entrenched.

Some may argue that clamping down on illegal mining is unfair because these
people are merely scavenging the remains of old mines. This argument does
not hold up, especially since organised crime is part of the package.
Unemployed people are severely exploited, often having to stay underground
for up to six months. The Minister said it is double that time, so let us
believe her. It is inhumane and surely falls beyond the ANC’s conception of
decent work.

The DA will take the matter further as the zama zamas are becoming
everybody’s problem. The government needs to do something.

In closing, the DA sympathises with the families of those zama zamas who
died so tragically early in June this year. These deaths are placed at the
door of the Department of Mining. It took these deaths to bring the horse
to the water, and now we will help the horse to drink the water! I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon colleagues, in a recent
interview with the Mail & Guardian published on 15 June 2009, Sipho
Mahabane, who has been involved in this activity for four years, admitted
that, and I quote: “There’ll always be a demand for gold on the black
market”. He continues by submitting that gold smugglers from Limpopo and
foreign gold smugglers, mainly from Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and local
businesspeople control the illegal mining operations in the area. He says
that the kingpins operate syndicates which include legal miners, shift
managers and security guards. These kingpins regularly visit the now
notorious G Hostel.

That is according to Mahabane, who is one of the thousands who are involved
in a R10 billion industry. Taking Mahabane’s admission as a true reflection
and synopsis of the daily life of an illegal miner, the purpose of the
visit to Welkom on 7 July was to assess the unacceptable situation, which
includes the tragic death of many, but also the loss of millions of rands
of revenue to the state. It is necessary, Chairperson, to ask three
critical questions. Firstly, who and where is the market for this R10
billion activity? Secondly, what is the role of the formal mining sector
and mining houses in this illegal activity? Thirdly, why can’t the
notorious G Hostel be decriminalised? The recommendations of the committee,
supported by Cope, certainly strive to answer these questions and
challenges.

It is, however, necessary to add to these recommendations by suggesting
that a specialist unit of the SAPS be considered. It seems that the SAPS is
involved and, in some instances, highly infested, regarding these
investigations and activity.

This is also applicable to the approach regarding the G Hostel, and the
inability to decriminalise the alleged bastion of criminality in Welkom and
in the Free State.

Chairperson, it’s necessary that the hon Minister, the Cabinet and
government must seriously engage and also come up with suggestions and
recommendations with regard to how to address this unacceptable situation.
The one issue that needs to be addressed is the quantum of these
activities. I heard hon Adams speak about R10 million, the Minister spoke
about R5,6 billion, and our activity indicates R10 billion. But we know hon
Adams by now. He always gets confused by a zero here or a zero there.
[Laughter.] But we don’t blame you for that. Chairperson, we accept his
chairpersonship, and we want to thank him for taking us with; it is not
always that Cope has the privilege to travel with the ANC. We are always
sidelined.

Chairperson, in conclusion, Cope is supporting this report, and we trust
that these recommendations submitted by the committee will not only stop
the illegal mining activity in Welkom, but also in the rest of South
Africa, including the diamond and the platinum industries. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, in the Freedom
Charter we said: “The people shall share in the country’s wealth!” However,
are we sharing in the country’s wealth? We also said in our manifesto that
we will fight against crime and corruption. Now, look at the zama zamas;
where do they come from?

Let us look at the background of being in a recession and that the mines
have been closing down for the past 10 years and the zama zamas have been
there since the apartheid days. As a miner in those days I used to work at
some stage at Eland mines. We were visiting G Hostel and the zama zamas
were there. What did the apartheid government do? Nothing! [Interjections.]

The ANC government and this committee went down there because it cares for
the people. [Interjections.]

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Order!

Mr B A MNGUNI: As you move over, you realise that financial crime has
forced most of the mining projects to be mothballed because the investors
did not have money or they were doubtful about investing huge amounts of
money because of the credit crunch.

Also, because of the retrenchments that have been taking place, over 300
miners have been retrenched. Most of those miners are from Lesotho or
Mozambique. Those people don’t go back home and therefore end up around the
mining area. That has resulted in unemployment increasing as rated in the
Human Development Index, HDI. In other words, the standard of living
deteriorates because most of the activities around those towns are linked
to the mines. The problem is: Whose responsibility is that?

The hon Sinclair says the government has turned a blind eye. We never
turned a blind eye. We would not have gone down there if we had turned a
blind eye. [Interjections.] Excuse me, hon member - I wanted to say the hon
Van Lingen. The fact that we did go down there to investigate was to show
that we care about the lives of the people and we care about making a
better life for all.

The Gini coefficient in South Africa is one of the highest, irrespective of
the fact that the per capita income in South Africa is the highest in the
whole of Africa. The reason for this is that these mining houses who
disinvest planned to do so years ago.

I say this because I also used to be a geologist and I sat in the
management meetings. For instance, Anglo American took a decision 10 years
before democracy that it wanted to disinvest in South Africa so that when
the ANC takes over only 40% of its gold would be mined in South Africa.

They moved over to Ashanti in Central Africa because the oil reserves there
were still shallow and there was a lot of cheap labour and that would
result in high profits. That was the strategy that was laid by Anglo
American 10 years before democracy due to their mineral intelligence
department. Now you come here and tell us that the ANC government does not
care – that is not true!

Who is involved in illegal mining? As you are aware, the mining houses are
pulling out and these people who go underground cannot move from one area
to another underground, two or three kilometres, without a guide. I have
been a geologist and have worked on the mines for ten years underground. I
know what it is like there. It is dark, hot and one cannot breathe once the
air is turned off. Now, who was guiding them when they moved from one shaft
to the other?

As we were informed by the chief health inspector, they move up to 34 km
from one shaft to another. For those 34 km they go up and down the inclines
because underground it is not as flat as one would think. You go up steeply
and go down the slopes and have to crawl in some tunnels. Now, who was
guiding those people underground? That is why we say it is a syndicate, and
mine management must involve some people who are sitting there at top
positions in ivory towers who are pumping money to these people – they must
be involved. [Interjections.]

Hon Sinclair is right in saying there are kingpins because we were told by
the secretary of the mines that even though we were there, the zama zamas
would, within five minutes thereafter, know about what was said in that
meeting. We have said that we will fight crime and corruption and the
Minister is right when she says that the law must bite.

Perhaps we should look at our laws, the Mine Health and Safety Act. We must
look at our compensation Acts, because as we were informed just last week
by the chief inspector on health, most of the people who die in the mines
don’t die from falling ground or locomotives that move underground.

The main cause of death used to be the locomotives that moved underground,
followed by falling ground, but most people die at home because of
pulmonary TB. The causes of that is the silicosis that is in their lungs,
which they get from the mines and the mines are doing nothing about it.

Therefore, hon Minister, that is what we must look at; we should make sure
that the law bites. These people go back home from wherever they came,
either Mozambique or Lesotho, and that is where they die a slow death. And
the reason is that they get separated from the mines without being
medically checked by anybody. Unfortunately, I am also one of those people
who got separated from the mine without being medically checked.

We must make sure that those people who are separated from the mines or
leave the mines permanently are properly checked to make sure that when
they pass away their families get paid by the mines if their death is due
to the effects of working in the mines. Then the mine must pay.

Another example is, if one goes to the Free State goldfields, one finds
that some underground water has been contaminated due to all the acids and
minerals that come from the sludge. If you water your garden with that
water you will kill all your plants. You cannot plough in a certain area
between Virginia and Welkom because whatever you plant there dies and the
cause is the mines and slime dams. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr R J Tau): Order! Hon member, can I call you to
order. I am busy presiding here and I have got a watch here. Whatever watch
you have, don’t allow it to instruct me to do something that I am sure I am
not supposed to do. So, please, you are quite distracting with that kind of
behaviour.

Mr B A MNGUNI: Thank you, Chairperson. I am left with 43 seconds. In short,
they say the more the rules are imposed the more they are broken. So, the
lasting solution, hon Minister, is for us to go back to those mines and
ensure that we revitalise the economic situation of those mines, not only
in Welkom but also in Barberton and other areas where these town are
turning into ghost towns.

The key solution is that we revitalise the economy of those areas so that
people can find jobs and be able to put food on the table, and thus better
the lives of the people. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF MINING: Thank you, Chairperson, for this debate. I would
like to thank the chairperson, hon Adams, for leading on this matter of
illegal mining, and also the hon members of the committee for the visit.
Hon Bloem, apparently you are from Welkom. They say you are part of the
zama zamas! [Laughter.]

I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the report by the
committee. We will look at what we can do, because the intention is to make
sure that we continuously improve on the situation and stamp out illegal
mining.

Hon Van Lingen, we have covered issues that you’ve raised. There is no
caring government like the ANC government. I am here precisely because I
care. I went to Welkom because the ANC cares. If I were a Minister under DA
government, I am not sure if I would have gone to the place.
[Interjections.]

I must indicate to you that I didn’t just go there to visit, but to see the
situation. I have even been underground, unlike you who only ends up at the
top. I am not scared to confront any situation which challenges and
threatens my community in South Africa. We will continue to make sure that
we do the right thing. We are not going to run away. We are not going to
see ourselves as useless, as you say we are. We will take responsibility.

I must indicate that the issue of mine health and safety must be separated
from criminal activities. The Mine Health and Safety Act cannot regulate
criminal activities. That’s pure crime - let’s not run away from it. It’s
illegal mining, whether they are driven by poverty or not. It is wrong and
we cannot justify a wrong thing in this country. If we justify illegal
mining, we must also justify those who are involved in cash-in-transit
heists and kill our police officers and security personnel. It is the same
thing. Crime is crime and it must be condemned at all times. It cannot be
tolerated.

The steps that we, together with the Justice, Crime Prevention and
Security, JCPS, cluster are taking are steps to make sure that we combat
and eradicate these forms of activities. They have been pushed to other
areas. Barberton, we are coming! Rest assured, we are not lame ducks,
especially not me. I am not a lame duck. Hon Makhubela of Cope can attest
to that. When I make an undertaking, I live by it and make sure that I
oblige.

Hon Sinclair, the ANC cares. It cared yesterday, it cares today and it will
care tomorrow. That is why we will make sure that we involve everybody at
all times, because we are not selfish and we are not scared of anything.

When we took the theme, “Working together we can do more” it’s because we
wanted you to come to the table, to come with us to fight this problem. If
you don’t, this problem will haunt this country; it won’t grow our economy
and it will cause our country to decline. We cannot afford this. We cannot
lead this country into anarchy.

We will fight any form of criminal activity from any quarter, even those
who are collaborating. We will make sure that we do the right thing.

I am surprised that the DA is calling on the Hawks to take up the matter.
You said it is not going to make it; it is a lame duck! You said it’s a
hawk that cannot fly. It is flying, my dear, it is flying! And it is flying
with colours. It has flown! Six criminals down; four criminals opposite my
home, down! All because of the Hawks!

This problem has been referred to the Hawks. Just wait and see, and listen.
They are there and we are there as the ANC; we are decisive and we don’t
beat about the bush. Government is led by the ANC. Thank you. [Applause.]

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces

1.    FIRST REPORT OF JOINT RULES COMMITTEE, 2009

The Speaker of the National Assembly and the Chairperson of the National
Council of Provinces, as co-chairpersons of the Joint Rules Committee,
present the First Report of the Joint Rules Committee, dated 25 June 2009,
as follows:

The Joint Rules Committee, having on 18 June 2009 considered the
establishment and non-establishment of joint structures, reports as
follows:

(1)   Co-chairpersons for joint committees

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that as a general principle joint
      committees shall have co-chairpersons.


      Recommendation
      It is therefore recommended that, where applicable, joint committees
      shall have co-chairpersons.


(2)   Constitutional Review Committee

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that the composition and party
      breakdown of the Constitutional Review Committee in regard to the
      Assembly component mirror the composition and party breakdown of
      portfolio committees as follows: ANC 8; DA 2; Cope 1; IFP 1; and other
      parties 2; and that the Council component be constituted as follows:
      ANC 6; DA 1; Cope 1 and IFP 1, the party breakdown of the Council
      component being subject to review.

      Recommendation
      It is therefore recommended that, in order to give effect to the
      decision of the Joint Rules Committee, Joint Rule 98(1) be amended by
      the deletion of the numbers in bold and insertion of the numbers
      underlined:


      98(1) The Joint Committee consists of [45] 14 Assembly members and
      [24] 9 Council members.

(3)   Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that the composition and party
      breakdown of the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests in
      regard to the Assembly component mirror the composition and party
      breakdown of portfolio committees as follows: ANC 8; DA 2; Cope 1; IFP
      1; and other parties 2; and that the Council component be constituted
      as follows: ANC 6; DA 1; Cope 1 and ID 1. The Joint Rules Committee
      also decided that the rule dealing with the non-remuneration of the
      chairperson and deputy chairperson be deleted.

      Recommendations
      It is therefore recommended that Joint Rule 122(1) be amended by the
      deletion of the number in bold and insertion of the number underlined:


      122(1)      The Joint Committee consists of [18] 14 Assembly members
      and 9 Council members.


      It is further recommended that Joint Rule 123(2) dealing with the non-
      remuneration of the chairperson and deputy chairperson be deleted.
(4)   Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and
      Status of Women

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that since the Assembly had
      established the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth, Children and
      People with Disabilities and since the Council had established the
      Select Committee on Women, Children and Disabled Persons, Joint Rules
      128 to 132 in regard to the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement
      of Quality of Life and Status of Women were no longer required and
      should be deleted.


      The Joint Rules Committee further decided that references to the Joint
      Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of
      Women in Rules 137A to 137F pertaining to the Multiparty Women’s
      Caucus should be removed and that the above-mentioned Rules be amended
      accordingly by the Joint Subcommittee on Review of the Joint Rules.

      Recommendations
      It is therefore recommended that –
      (a)   Joint Rules 128 to 132 be deleted; and
      (b)   as a result of this deletion, Joint Rules 137A to 137F in
           relation to the Multiparty Women’s Caucus be amended accordingly
           to remove all references to the Joint Monitoring Committee on
           Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women and that the
           matter of amending the Rules be referred to the Joint
           Subcommittee on Review of the Joint Rules for drafting.

(5)   Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and
      Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that since the Assembly had
      established the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth, Children and
      People with Disabilities and since the Council had established the
      Select Committee on Women, Children and Disabled Persons, Joint Rules
      132A to 132E in regard to the Joint Monitoring Committee on
      Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Children, Youth and
      Disabled Persons were no longer required and should be deleted.

      Recommendation
      It is therefore recommended that Joint Rules 132A to 132E be deleted.

(6)   Joint Monitoring Committee on Reconstruction and Development

      The Joint Rules Committee decided not to operationalise Joint Rules
      133 to 137 in regard to the Joint Monitoring Committee on
      Reconstruction and Development, which had not been operationalised in
      the Second and Third Parliaments.


      Recommendation
      It is therefore recommended that Joint Rules 133 to 137 be deleted.

(7)   Oversight mechanism of Parliament

      The Joint Rules Committee decided that the Joint Rules should be
      reviewed in view of the provisions of the Financial Management of
      Parliament Act, No 10 of 2009, which require that the composition of
      an oversight mechanism of Parliament must be in accordance with the
      Joint Rules of Parliament.

      Recommendation
      It is therefore recommended that the drafting of rules in regard to
      the oversight mechanism of Parliament be referred to the Joint
      Subcommittee on Review of the Joint Rules for processing.

Report to be considered.

      PARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATION (CPA) AFRICA REGION CONFERENCE HELD IN
                    PORT HARCOURT, RIVERS STATE, NIGERIA
                               12- 24 JULY 2009

Introduction
The 40th Conference of  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association  (CPA)
Africa Region was held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria from 13 –  24

Friday, 17 July 2009

Meeting of the Executive Committee:
The following members of the  delegation  from  South  Africa  attended  the
meeting of the Executive Committee:
 ▪ Hon M J  Mahlangu  in  his  capacity  as  the  Southern  Africa  Regional
   Representative ;

 ▪ Hon. L Maseko in her capacity as the Regional Treasurer;
 ▪ Hon. J Mthembu in his capacity as  Provincial  Speaker  representing  the

The following key issues were highlighted:

Report of the Regional Representatives
The Chairperson of Southern Africa Sub-Region Hon. M  J  Mahlangu  presented
the report which included the following issues:

   1. Funding of Regional Activities
   Following  the  approval  of  US  $25,000  for  Regional  Representatives
   activities, the Regional Representatives would be  developing  an  action
   plan which would be used as a  guide  for  the  Programme,  Planning  and
   Finance  Sub-Committee  to  allocate   more   funds   to   the   Regional
   Representatives for future programmes.

   2. Strategies for the re-election of the  Secretary-General  of  the  CPA
      International
   It was brought to the attention of the committee that the term of  office
   of Dr W Shija, the Secretary General of the CPA  International  would  be
   coming to an end in 2011 and elections would  be  held  during  the  57th
   Conference of the CPA. It  was  noted  that  it  was  customary  for  the
   Secretary – General of the CPA International to hold the position for two
   (2) terms. The Executive Committee would be discussing the strategies and
   activities for the re-election of Dr Shija as  Secretary-General  of  the
   CPA. The matter would be discussed further during the 55th Conference  of
   the CPA in Tanzania.


Report of the Subcommittee on Programme, Planning and Finance
   1. The CPA Africa Region Website
   The committee briefed the meeting that  the  CPA  Africa  Region  website
   (http://www.cpaafrica.org) which was launched during  the  39th  Regional
   Conference is operational and could be accessed by all members.

   2. Branch Subscriptions
   The Secretariat reported that annual subscription fees were increased  at
   national level from US $1800 to US $2500 and at sub-national  level  from
   US
   $1200 to US $2000.


   The Secretariat reported that the Seychelles  and  Anambra  Branches  had
   paid up their arrears. The committee apologised  to  Seychelles  for  not
   sending an invitation to attend the 40th  CPA  Africa  Region  Conference
   despite the Branch having fulfilled the requirement of article 10(a)  and
   (b) and 11 of the CPA Africa Region Constitution.

Report of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians
The CWP Strategic Plan was prepared by the Secretariat  and  adopted  during
the 2nd CWP Conference in Abuja, Nigeria  in  October  2008.  The  strategic
plan would be a guide to the CWP and would be assessed in three years  time.
The strategic plan would further serve as a focus for future  leadership  in
the CWP  and  as  a  model  for  operations  despite  the  turnover  of  the
membership of the CWP.

The issue of funding was a challenge faced by the CWP  in  implementing  the
strategic plan.  The CWP Steering Committee called for  a  concerted  effort
at obtaining funds from donors and stakeholders to support  its  activities.
Donors such as CIDA, WICIS, UNFPA and UNIFEM  were  invited  to  attend  the
40th CPA Africa Region Conference  and  would  be  approached  for  possible
funding.

The CWP had  not  been  able  to  utilise  the  US  $15,000  that  had  been
allocated, however, it had agreed that US $10,000 would be allocated to  the
study/research on “Harmful,  Traditional,  Cultural,  Religious  and  Social
Practices that negatively affect women in  Africa”.  These  funds  would  be
transferred to the Limpopo Provincial Legislature in South Africa which  was
responsible in administering the study.

Emphasis was also placed on the importance  of  formalising  CWP  Structures
and realigning the CWP  agenda  with  the  existing  women’s  structures  in
Parliaments.

A 3rd Conference of the CWP would be held in Cameroon from 28 –  30  October
2009, under the theme, “Pursuing the Gender Agenda”  with  special  emphasis
on the following thematic areas:
 ▪ Achieving MDG’s through Gender Budgeting;
 ▪ Women and the burden of care giving;
 ▪ Progress reports on the CWP Study; and
 ▪  Best  practices  on  constitutional  reforms  and  other  strategies  to
   entrench the gender agenda.

There was a concern regarding the lack of continuity in  the  leadership  of
the CWP, and it was proposed that the CWP should develop guidelines in  line
with the provisions of the regional  constitution.  These  guidelines  would
assist in ensuring that the CWP Chairperson’s position  be  elective  rather
than rotational due to a  lack  of  commitment  and  interest  from  members
seconded by branches.

The leadership of  the  CWP  would  be  elected  during  the  Conference  in
Cameroon,  and  countries  were  requested  to  forward   names   of   their
nominees/candidates to the CPA Regional Secretariat by August 2009.

Report of the Regional Secretary
The Assistant  Regional  Secretary  on  behalf  of  the  Regional  Secretary
presented the report to the meeting covering the following issues:
   a) Composition of the Executive Committee;
   b) Regional Representatives;
   c) Branch Representatives;
   d) The Activities of the Executive Committee since the 39th Africa Region
      Conference in Livingstone, Zambia;
   e) Subscriptions;
   f) Status of Branches in the Region; and
   g) Venues of Regional Conferences.

Financial Management Report and Budget for the year-ending 31 December  2010

The following reports were considered and approved by the meeting:
   a) Financial Report for the year ended 31 December, 2008;
   b) Half year Budget Performance Report up to 30th June, 2008; and
   c) Budget for the year ending 31st December, 2010.

The CPA Africa Region received an unqualified audited report  for  the  year
ending in 2008.

Duration of the Africa Region Conferences
The issue of the duration of the Africa Region Conferences was raised as  an
area of concern. The conferences were generally taking place over  a  period
of two weeks, which was considered  to  be  too  long.  The  length  of  the
conference had substantial financial implications for  the  host  branch  as
well as for the participating branches. Furthermore many of  the  conference
participants  could  not  attend  for  the  full  duration  of  a   two-week
conference because of commitments within their respective countries.   There
was general  consensus  that  with  proper  planning  the  duration  of  the
conference could be reduced to a week.  The  matter  would  receive  further
attention by the Executive Committee and Regional Office –Bearers.

Matters proposed by Branches for Annual General Meeting
The Executive Committee expressed  the  concern  that  although  the  Africa
Region Constitution made provision for branches to propose matters  for  the
agenda of the Annual General  Meeting,  branches  were  not  taking  up  the
opportunity. Branches were encouraged to become more active  in  determining
the agenda of the association.


Briefing to the  South  African  delegation  by  the  High  Commissioner  to
Nigeria
The delegation from the national branch and the nine  sub-national  branches
met under the chairpersonship of Hon. Speaker of the Free  State  Provincial
Legislature, on behalf  of  the  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces.
The South African High Commissioner to Nigeria, HE Mr K Mamabolo provided  a
comprehensive briefing to the delegation.

Sub-regional meeting (Southern Africa)
The Chairperson of the NCOP as the Senior  Regional  Representative  chaired
the meeting.

The Regional Representatives from South Africa  and  Swaziland  reported  on
the issues that had been finalised during the  Executive  Committee  meeting
and highlighted  that  the  AGM  would  be  considering  amendments  to  the
Constitution of the Africa  Region  in  order  to  create  the  position  of
President, Vice-President, Chairperson and Vice-Treasurer. Furthermore  that
Hon. M J Mahlangu had been the only person nominated  for  the  position  of
Chairperson of the Region.

The Regional Treasurer provided a briefing on the financial  status  of  the
region in indicated that Hon. R  Mutanga  from  Zambia  had  been  the  only
person nominated for the position of Vice-Treasurer.

The various national branches and the sub-national branches provided  verbal
reports of the CPA activities that they had undertaken since the CPA  Africa
Region Conference in 2008.

Business meeting of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP)
The business meeting of the CWP was held  to  deliberate  on  the  following
issues:
   a) 3rd Conference of the CWP to be held in Yaoundé, Cameroon;
   b) Theme and topics of the conference;
   c) CWP Standing Rules; and
   d) Modification of instruments for the study  on  Harmful,  Traditional,
      Religious, Cultural and Social practices that negatively affect women
      in Africa.

Pre-conference tours
Delegates were scheduled to visit Bonny Island.  Due  to  the  sensitivities
surrounding the safety in the Delta Region,   the  delegates  were  informed
that people of African descent would be taken to the  Island  by  ferry  and
those of European descent were to be taken to the Island by helicopter.  The
delegation from South Africa and from other SADC countries  strongly  raised
their opposition to the discriminatory practice of the private company  that
operated the ferry service and refused to undertake the trip.

The Governor of the Rivers State arranged to meet with the delegation  later
that afternoon to convey his  formal  apology  to  the  delegation  for  the
incident that had occurred. The Governor indicated that he would be  closing
the jetty to the company as from the following Monday to  undergo  a  safety
assessment. The apology of the Governor and the apology of the host  Speaker
were unanimously accepted.

Sunday, 19 July 2009

There were no meetings scheduled. The women parliamentarians of  the  Rivers
State  hosted  a  dinner  for  the  women  parliamentarians  attending   the
conference.

Official Opening Ceremony of the 40th CPA Africa Region Conference

The following office-bearers delivered addresses at the opening ceremony:
    • The CWP Representative for the Africa Region, Hon. Prof.  Sheila  Tlou
      of Botswana;
    • The Vice-Chairperson of the CPA (International)  Executive  Committee,
      Hon. Keith Flax;
    • The  Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, The RT. Hon. Tonye
      Harry;
    • The Chairperson of the CPA Africa Region, Hon. Dr. Amusa Mwanamwambwa,
      Speaker of the Parliament of Zambia; and
    • The Governor of  the  Rivers  State,  the  RT.  Hon.  Chibuike  Rotimi
      Amaechi.

In her address the Hon. Professor  Tlou  highlighted  that  there  had  been
several achievements in the representation of women in  parliaments  in  the
region and that there were also a number of  newly  elected  women  Speakers
and Deputy Speakers that had attended the 40th conference in Port  Harcourt.


Hon. Flax highlighted  that  at  the  forthcoming  55th  CPA  Conference  in
Tanzania; there would be a prominent focus  on  the  impact  of  the  global
financial crisis and on what parliamentarians  could  do  to  mitigate  that
impact. He indicated that the global financial  crisis  posed  a  danger  to
Africa’s recent economic history since it threatened  to  reverse  and  even
wipe out, hard won gains.

In his remarks, the Hon. Harry highlighted that it was the first  time  that
a sub-national branch was hosting  the  CPA  Africa  Region  Conference.  He
indicated that the experience had given him the opportunity to  witness  the
depth of human capacity that was available  on  the  continent.  Hon.  Harry
also expressed his gratitude to the Governor of the  Rivers  State,  who  in
2004, in his  capacity  then  as  Speaker  of  the  Rivers  State  House  of
Assembly, had offered to host the CPA  Africa  Region  Conference  in  2010.
When Gambia could not host the 2009 conference, the sub-national  branch  of
the Rivers State was able to step-in to host the conference.

In his address the Hon. Mwanamwambwa reminded  delegates  of  the  decisions
that had been taken at the CPA Africa Region conference in  Zambia  in  2008
and indicated that to that  end  the  Executive  Committee  had  prepared  a
number of amendments to the Constitution of the Africa Region. He  indicated
that the amendments, which included the establishment of  the  positions  of
President, Vice-President and Chairperson of the Executive Committee,  would
be tabled at the Annual General Meeting that would  be  taking  place  after
the opening ceremony.

In delivering the official opening address the Hon. Ameachi  indicated  that
he had previously served as  the  Speaker  of  the  Rivers  State  House  of
Assembly for a period of eight years. He had always offered his  support  to
the  activities  and  programmes  of  the  CPA  and  attended  several   CPA
conferences. The Governor emphasised the  important  role  that  legislators
had to play in ensuring the  well-being  of  their  citizens.  He  indicated
that, in his opinion, the current crisis in the Niger Delta  could  only  be
resolved by the enactment  of  the  necessary  legislation  by  the  Federal
Parliament of Nigeria.  The  Governor  urged  the  Members  of  the  Federal
Parliament who were present to ensure  that  legislation  was  enacted  that
made provision for royalties to be paid to communities in areas  where  oil-
mining was being carried out.

In the absence of the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces,  the
Hon. L Maseko, Speaker of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature  delivered  the
vote of thanks at the conclusion of the opening ceremony.

   July 2010 respectively.

Tuesday, 21 July 2009

First session of the Conference

Topic: Achieving Millennium Development Goals through Gender Budgeting

The  presentations  and  discussions  highlighted  the  following  pertinent
issues:
    • There was  a  need  to  incorporate  gender  concerns  in  the  entire
      budgeting process. Budgets were generally  gender-blind  and  did  not
      consider that women and men  had  different  roles,  responsibilities,
      capabilities and commitments.  A  gender  budget  was  a  budget  that
      accounted for the  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  a  government’s
      expenditure allocations and revenues on both women and men.

    • Gender budgeting assisted to promote equity, equality, efficiency  and
      transparency in  the  budget  process  including  the  realisation  of
      social, economic and cultural rights and good governance.


    • Parliamentarians needed to support  initiatives  that  were  aimed  at
      sensitizing their constituents about issues of gender and the economy.
      In so doing,  Parliament  should  collaborate  with  other  government
      structures, including local government, provincial administrations and
      with civil society groups.

    • In countries such as Kenya, free primary and secondary education  made
      it mandatory for all children who had attained the school going age to
      access education. This had been crucial in bridging  the  gap  between
      male and female access to education.

    • It was important  to  recognise  that  poverty  cannot  be  eradicated
      without a process of poverty reduction.

Second session of the Conference

Topic:  Impact  and  Implication  of  Financial  Meltdown   on   Sustainable
Development

The  presentations  and  discussions  highlighted  the  following  pertinent
issues:

    • The current global economic crisis was universal, and as a result,  it
      had   adverse effects on the economies of all nations and the standard
      of  living  of  their  citizens,  irrespective  of  their  social  and
      political status.

    • The serious impact of the economic crisis could be illustrated by  the
      fact that global capital flow had  largely  frozen,  that  the  credit
      crunch persisted despite global  liquidity  injections  and  that  the
      international financial institutions were without  adequate  resources
      to intervene, which resulted in global coordination failure.

    • There were a number of lessons and  challenges  for  Africa  including
      that the crisis had debunked the concept of best practices in national
      governance within the developed countries. It had  shown  the  fallacy
      inherent in almost exclusive focus on financial derivatives,  such  as
      consumer credit, rather than on the core economic fundamentals.

    • Decisive steps should be taken to reduce the precarious dependence  of
      some African countries on just one product  for  revenue  and  foreign
      exchange earnings.

    • Legislatures could intervene by ensuring that resources were allocated
      only  to  those  sectors  and  projects  that  presented  elements  of
      comparative advantage for the country.

    • Legislation should be used to promote policies that were  designed  to
      support the development of enterprise sectors that  relied  mainly  on
      the use of the locally available natural and human resources.

    • There must be  accountability  for  the  expenditure  of  increasingly
      scarce financial resources.

Third session of the Conference

Topic: Have the Principles of Separation  of  Powers,  Checks  and  Balances
been achieved among African Commonwealth States?

The  presentations  and  discussions  highlighted  the  following  pertinent
issues:

    • The checks and balances inherent in  the  doctrine  of  separation  of
      powers were legal structural safeguards that secure the  integrity  of
      elected institutions and ensure that the representation,  conduct  and
      decision- making of elected representatives were fair and equitable.

    • There were certain challenges for ensuring  the  independence  of  the
      legislature,  these  included,  lack   of   financial   autonomy   and
      interference by the executive in legislative matters.

    •  Even  though  a  number  of  Commonwealth   African   countries   had
      constitutional provisions entrenching the  separation  of  powers  and
      checks and balances, current practice indicated that there was often a
      concentration of power in a specific branch of government.

    • The direct or  indirect  influence  in  the  appointment  of  judicial
      officers by the executive and political interference in  the  work  of
      the judicial officers, were  obstacles  to  the  independence  of  the
      judiciary.

    • In order for the doctrine of separation of powers and the  checks  and
      balances to be effective,  parliamentarians  should  ensure  that  the
      people entrusted with governance should improve upon  the  quality  of
      governance, that existing institutions were strengthened through legal
      and constitutional reforms and  that  the  interest  of  the  citizens
      superseded parochial interest of the privileged few.

Fourth session of the Conference

Topic: Electoral Reforms and Political Stability in Africa

The  presentations  and  discussions  highlighted  the  following  pertinent
issues:

    • While many African countries have  embraced  multi-party  systems  and
      held regular elections, the quality of these elections  differed  from
      one country to another.
    • Many African states which had been under  British  colonial  rule  and
      which upon independence adopted  the  Westminster  constitutional  and
      political arrangements, had not subjected the electoral  systems  they
      adopted to broad-based internal debate within their countries.

    • Under-representation of women and the youth in electoral processes  in
      Africa was a significant weakness in the electoral systems.


    • There were certain African countries  that  should  consider  bringing
      amendments to their current electoral processes in  order  to  reflect
      the  present  realities  in  the  region  as  well  as  to  adhere  to
      international best practice.

Fifth session of the Conference

Topic: Management of Political Parties in  the  Democratization  Process  in
Africa

The  presentations  and  discussions  highlighted  the  following  pertinent
issues:

    • A number of African liberation movements declared themselves political
      parties on the eve  of  independence  from  colonial  rule.  Political
      parties managed to endow regimes  with  legitimacy,  they  became  the
      principal actors in the electoral system, they were the  vehicles  for
      the recruitment of  credible  political  leadership  and  avenues  for
      participation in the political process.

    • In some countries on the continent, some political parties  had  been
      active not only in political mobilisation but also in mobilisation of
      activities for conflict management.


    • Political parties competed with each other for the  public  vote  and,
      they often entered into complex  relations  with  their  internal  and
      external environment and with other  political  parties.  In  general,
      there were four types of political systems in operation on the African
      Continent. These included  the  One-party  system,  Two-party  system,
      Dominant-party system and Multi-party systems.


    • One of the  main  functions  of  political  parties  was  to  maintain
      themselves  as  organisations   capable   of   contesting   elections,
      maintaining  their  membership  and  supporting   their   Members   of
      Parliament to ensure that, when they become the governing party, their
      political  programmes  and  election  promises  were  acted  upon  and
      implemented.


    • Leadership succession and crisis in politics  seemed  to  be  a  major
      setback confronting African political parties often due to a  lack  of
      party constitutional provisions that  restricted  their  office  to  a
      specific number of terms.

    • Political parties  needed  to  constitutionalise  the  issues  of  the
      regulation  of  their  funding,  as  this  was  consistent  with   the
      principles of transparency and accountability.


    • The issue of women representation and political party  leadership  was
      still a serious problem to political parties. In an effort to  respond
      to a call for women empowerment, most of the political  parties  still
      did not have any  constitutional  provisions  that  required  them  to
      determine women representation.

Thursday, 23 July and Friday, 24 July 2009
Delegations departed from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.

Observations
The delegation made the following observations:
 ▪ Given that the composition  of  delegations  to  the  CPA  Africa  Region
   Conferences is varied on a year  to  year  basis,  it  would  assist  the
   delegation if there was sufficient time set aside prior to the conference
   to enable the delegation to prepare for the conference and to  engage  on
   the issues to be discussed.
 ▪ There should be a clear clarification of the roles of the  newly  created
   positions of Regional Office Bearers to facilitate the implementation  of
   the CPA Africa Region Strategic Plan.

Recommendation
The delegation recommends that  the  resolutions  of  the  40th  CPA  Africa
Region Conference as provided in Annexure 1 hereto be implemented.

Acknowledgements
The delegation would like to thank the South African  High  Commissioner  to
Nigeria, HE Mr Mamabolo and all the employees  of  the  South  African  High
Commission in Abuja and Lagos, for their assistance in making this  visit  a
success.

ANNEXURE 1

Conference resolutions

1.    Under the topic Achieving Millennium Development Goals through  Gender
      budgeting, the conference noted and observed that:

      Whereas:

(a)   women comprise over half of the world’s  population,  they  are  still
lagging
      behind  in  decision  making  positions  because   they   are   poorly
      represented at this level,


   b) women contribute 60 to 80  per  cent  of  agricultural  production  in
      developing countries,

   c) many African countries are party to the Convention on the  Elimination
      of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  (CEDAW),  parents  still
      prefer to send boys to school and see little incentives for  educating
      girls,

   d) the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  number  3  deals  with  the
      promotion of gender equality, access to credit services is  restricted
      because they do not have the required collateral which  formal  credit
      institutions require,

   e) many African countries are party to the  International  Convention  on
      Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966,

   f) many African countries are also party to the African Charter on  Human
      and People’s Rights, which are  aimed  at  eliminating  discrimination
      against women, the right to dignity, the right to life, the  right  to
      education and training, economic and social welfare rights and  health
      and reproductive rights.

We hereby:

   a. Call upon national and state governments to make gender  mainstreaming
      an integral part of policy design and legislation formulation  and  to
      operationalise Gender Management Systems.


   b. Call upon national and state governments to strengthen Gender-Planning
      capacity through training of planners  and  implementers  as  well  as
      carrying out gender analysis of budgets.

   c. Urge national governments  and  Parliament  to  strengthen  the  legal
      frameworks that protect women’s rights  by  amending  subsidiary  laws
      that discriminate against women.

   d. Urge national  and  state  governments  to  support  relevant  sectors
      (through mainstreaming)  to  address  specific  constraints  faced  by
      females e.g. high drop out rates  among  girls  in  primary  and  post
      primary schools.

   e. Call upon national and state governments and  Parliaments  to  educate
      and sensitise communities about the human and legal rights of women.

2.    Under the topic  Impact  and  Implication  of  Financial  Meltdown  on
   Sustainable Development, the conference noted and observed that:

Having regard to the G20 declaration on the financial crisis of 15  November
2008 in Washington, and to the G20 Leaders’ Statement at the  London  Summit
of 2 April 2009.

Having regard to  the  ACP-EU  Joint  Parliamentary  Assembly  Port  Moresby
Declaration on the global food and financial crisis, adopted on 28  November
2008.

Having regard to the United Nations  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),
and the commitment to  halving  the  proportion  of  people  suffering  from
hunger and living on less than one US dollar a day.

Whereas

   a. as a result of the financial crisis, some donor countries have reduced
      their financial contributions to Official Development Assistance (ODA)
      to developing countries, which already have fragile economies.

   b. the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in particular the eradication
      of extreme poverty and hunger, as well as the development targets  and
      principles agreed in the  United  Nations’  Conference  including  the
      Earth Summit of 1992  on  sustainable  development,  provide  a  clear
      vision for all countries of the world.

   c. most poor countries of the Commonwealth are dependent  on  exports  of
      commodities that constitute a significant  portion  of  their  foreign
      exchange earnings and the financial crisis is resulting in  decreasing
      exports from, and remittance  flows  into,  these  countries,  reduced
      access to credit  and  reduced  foreign  direct  investment;  and  the
      plummeting of commodity prices.

   d. despite proven importance of the  agricultural  sector  in  developing
      countries, neither national  nor  state  government  policies  provide
      adequate priority to this key sector, putting hundreds of millions  of
      people in danger of extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition.

   e. a serious obstacle to increasing  agricultural  output  in  developing
      countries, which is fundamental to reducing food  insecurity,  is  the
      fact that small farmers, especially women, often lack access to  land,
      loans  or  micro-credit  for  investment  in  seeds,  fertilizers  and
      irrigation mechanisms and  the  necessary  range  of  crop  protection
      tools.

   We hereby


   a. Welcome the outcome and commitments of the London  G20  Meeting  of  2
      April 2009, in particular references to: restoring  growth  and  jobs;
      strengthening  financial  supervision  and  regulation;  strengthening
      global  financial  institutions;  resisting  protectionism;  promoting
      global trade and investment; ensuring a  fair  trade  and  sustainable
      recovery for all; and delivering on aid commitments.


   b. Call on national governments in the Commonwealth to increase  spending
      on social sectors and strengthen safety net programmes to protect  the
      poor.

   c. Urge national and state governments in the Commonwealth to  invest  in
      infrastructure facilities such as  roads,  electricity  and  water  to
      serve a critical investments in the agriculture sector.

   d. Urge developing countries in the Commonwealth to be more committed  to
      economic diversification and value addition and move  away  from  over
      dependency on single commodity exports.

   e. Urge developing countries in the Commonwealth  to  broaden  their  tax
      bases and strengthen their revenue mobilisation.

   f. Urge governments to promote intra-African trade.


3.    Under the topic Have the Principles of Separation  of  Powers,  Checks
   and Balances  been  achieved  among  African  Commonwealth  States?,  the
   conference noted and observed that:

Having regard to the

   a. Harare Commonwealth Declaration that was issued by Heads of Government
      in Harare, Zimbabwe on 20 October 1991;


   b. Millbrook Commonwealth Action  Programme  on  the  Harare  Declaration
      issued by Heads of Government at Millbrook, New Zealand, in 1995;
   c.  Commonwealth  (Latimer  House)  Principles  on   Accountability   and
      Relationship between the three Arms of Government  as  agreed  by  Law
      Ministers and endorsed by the  Heads  of  Government  meeting,  Abuja,
      Nigeria, 2003;

   d. Plan  of  Action  for  Africa  on  the  Commonwealth  (Latimer  House)
      Principles on Accountability and the relationship  between  the  three
      branches of government adopted in Nairobi, Kenya, 2005;

   e. New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)’s African Peer Review
      Mechanism (APRM); and

   f. Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU).

We hereby

   a.  Reaffirm  our  commitment  to  the  implementation  of   the   Harare
      Declaration and  the  protection  and  promotion  of  the  fundamental
      political values of the Commonwealth;


   b. Urge national and state governments  in  the  Commonwealth  to  create
      frameworks for the effective implementation of the plan of action  for
      Africa   on   the   Commonwealth   (Latimer   House)   Principles   on
      Accountability and Relationship between the Arms of Government;

   c. Call on the Commonwealth to collaborate closely with the African Union
      in the promotion of democratic principles and institutions in  Africa;
      and

   d. Endorse the Commonwealth’s commitment  in  the  Milbrook  Commonwealth
      Action Programme to enhance  the  Secretariat’s  capacity  to  provide
      advice, training and other forms of technical assistance in  promoting
      the Commonwealth’s fundamental political values.

4.    Under the topic Electoral Reforms and Political Stability  in  Africa,
      the conference noted and observed that:


        a. Recognising that the quality of an election constitutes  one  of
           the  determinants  for  deepening  democratic   governance   and
           political stability.
        b. Aware that even though  many  African  countries  have  embraced
           multi-party systems and hold regular elections, the  quality  of
           these elections differ from one country to another.

        c. Acknowledging that most African states which were under  British
           colonial rule and  upon  independence  adopted  the  Westminster
           constitution and political  arrangements  did  not  subject  the
           electoral systems they adopted to broad-based internal debate in
           their countries.

        d. Acknowledging that under-representation of women and  the  youth
           in electoral processes in Africa is a significant failure in the
           electoral systems.

      We hereby,


        a. Urge all key election stakeholders,  including  parliaments,  to
           focus their attention on the task of improving  the  quality  of
           elections  in  the  sub-region  for  the  purpose  of   avoiding
           political instability.

        b. Call for amendments in  certain  African  countries  to  current
           electoral processes in order to reflect the present realities in
           the region as well as to adhere to international best practice.

        c. Encourage African parliaments to enact legislation  to  increase
           the participation of women and youth in politics, as a means  of
           enhancing the democratic processes.

5.     Under  the   topic   Management   of   Political   Parties   in   the
      Democratization Process in Africa, conference noted and observed that:

      Whereas:

       Political  parties  play  a  very  important  role  in   setting   up
      institutional  frameworks  and  competitive  environment,  making  the
      struggle for power more humane and accessible to all; and  that,  many
      political parties on  the  continent  of  Africa  contributed  to  the
      political landscape;

        a. Recognising that the promotion and  building  of  democracy  and
           good governance has been a key element in the strategies of  the
           majority of African governments  and  their  parties  since  the
           early 1990’s.

        b. Realising that the democratic dispensation and the  constitution
           have ushered in new debates by political parties on how best  to
           design and ensure that the democratic governance is facilitated.

        c. Noting that the role of political parties in some  countries  is
           still threatened by the environment in which  they  operate  and
           the lack of resources, general  level  of  apathy,  unfavourable
           electoral system and the problem of one party dominance.

      We hereby


        a. Call  for  full  studies  to  be  commissioned  on  how  African
           political parties function in order to gain  full  understanding
           of their governability and the extent to which their  operations
           conform to democratic governance ethos;

        b. Call upon national and state  governments  to  constitutionalise
           the
           issues of regulating the funding of political parties as a means
           of enhancing transparency and accountability;

        c. Call upon parliaments to enshrine Presidential  term  limits  in
           their
           constitutions and ensure strict adherence thereto.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional
Development on the Provisional Suspension from Office of Magistrate T C
Oliphant, dated 26 August 2009

Introduction

The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs, having
considered the report on the provisional suspension from office of
Magistrate T C Oliphant tabled by the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development in terms of section 13(4)(b) of the Magistrates
Act, 1993 (Act no 90 of 1993), reports as follows:

Background

        1. The Select Committee noted from the report tabled by the
           Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development that the
           Magistrates Commission resolved on 04 March 2009 to recommend
           that Ms T C Oliphant, an additional magistrate at Wynberg, be
           removed from office in terms of section 13(4)(a) of the
           Magistrates Act, 1993.


        2. The Select Committee noted that Ms Oliphant was employed by the
           Department of Justice and Constitutional Development since 01
           February 1994 and was appointed as Magistrate on 06 May 2002. Ms
           Oliphant was subsequently absent from office from 25 April 2008
           to 10 November 2008.
        3. A preliminary investigation was conducted in terms of Regulation
           26 (1) of the regulations for Judicial Officers in Lower Courts,
           1994, into allegations of Ms Oliphant’s absenteeism from office
           without leave or valid cause.


        4. The Ethics Committee of the Magistrates Commission on 25
           September 2008 considered the preliminary investigation report
           and resolved that Ms Oliphant not be charged with misconduct,
           but to deal with the matter in terms of regulation 26(4) (b) of
           the said regulations in that she be requested to appear before
           the Ethics Committee to be reprimanded.


        5. The Select Committee notes that Ms Oliphant was absent from
           office without leave from 25 April 2008 and did not inform her
           immediate superiors of her whereabouts. Contact with Ms Oliphant
           was attempted through various means and her Judicial Head was
           eventually able to trace her and serve a notice on her
           personally on 22 October 2008 for her to appear before the
           Ethics Committee.


        6. Ms Oliphant subsequently appeared before the Ethics Committee at
           Pretoria on 06 November 2008. She indicated that she had been
           suffering from a major depressive disorder and that she was
           admitted to a Psychiatric Clinic for the period 02 – 24 April
           2008. A medical certificate for this period was produced. No
           application for leave or medical certificates was produced for
           the period 25 April – 05 November 2008.


        7. Ms Oliphant indicated that she would resume her duties on 10
           November 2008. The Ethics Committee requested her to obtain a
           written report from her medical practitioner confirming that she
           had recuperated to such an extent that she was able to resume
           her duties as a magistrate. She undertook to provide such a
           report on 20 November 2008.


        8. Ms Oliphant resumed duties on 10 November 2008 and was present
           until 14 November 2008. She was then absent from office from 17
           November 2008 and again failed in her responsibility to report
           her absence to her Judicial Head.

        9. Ms Oliphant failed to attend a meeting scheduled for 20 November
           2008 and to produce a report from her medical practitioner on
           her fitness for duty. She again did not communicate with her
           Judicial Head of Office in this regard and all attempts to
           contact her were unsuccessful.


       10. On 05 December 2008 Ms Oliphant was informed in writing that her
           conduct amounted to serious misconduct. She was further advised
           that should she fail to report for duty or fail to inform her
           Judicial head of her whereabouts by 17 December 2008, she would
           be deemed to have absconded and that she would have made herself
           guilty of misconduct. A letter was served on her but Ms Oliphant
           was not at home at the time and the letter was left on a chair
           in the living room through an open window.


       11. Two Judicial Quality Assurance Officers, in a final attempt,
           traced Ms Oliphant to her residence in Mitchells Plain on 14
           January 2009. The Judicial Officers met with Ms Oliphant and
           requested an explanation for her absence from office. She did
           not give an explanation. She was advised to contact her Judicial
           Head and report for duty. Ms Oliphant failed to do so.

Legal requirements
        1. If a magistrate is absent without leave or valid reason from
           his/her office or duty for a period of 30 days or longer the
           following applies:
            a. The Commission must in terms of regulation 34(1) of the
               Regulations for Judicial officers in Lower Courts, 1994, be
               informed without delay; and
            b. It shall be deemed that the magistrate has absconded and
               made himself/herself guilty of misconduct.
        2. In terms of section 13(4) (a) of the Magistrates Act, 1993 (Act
           no 90 of 1993) the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
           Development, if the Magistrates Commission recommend that a
           Magistrate be removed from office, on inter alia, the basis of
           misconduct, must suspend that magistrate from office or if the
           Magistrate is at that stage provisionally suspended in terms of
           the Act, confirm the suspension.


        3. The report in which such suspension and the reasons therefore
           are made known, must be tabled in Parliament by the Minister
           within 14 days of that suspension if parliament is then in
           session or, if parliament is not then in session, within 14 days
           after the commencement of the next ensuing session.

        4. In terms of section 13(3)(c) of the Magistrates Act, 1993,
           Parliament must, as soon as is reasonably possible, pass a
           resolution as to whether or not the provisional suspension of a
           magistrate is confirmed.


Committee recommendation:
        1. The Select Committee recommends that the Magistrates Commission
           endeavours to contact Ms Oliphant for one last time, in writing,
           to request that she produce her medical records for review by
           the Ethics Committee of the Magistrates Commission.


        2. The Select Committee further recommends that Ms Oliphant be
           given two weeks, from the date of receipt of the letter, to
           comply with the above-mentioned request to produce her medical
           records.

        3. The Select Committee expects a report from the Magistrates
           Commission on Tuesday, 15 September 2009, on the basis of which
           the Committee would finalise its recommendation to the National
           Council of Provinces.

2.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional
Development on the Update Report of Magistrate Bacharam, dated 26 August
2009

1.    Introduction

The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs, having
considered the update report on the provisional suspension from office of
Magistrate A Bacharam tabled by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development in terms of section 13(3)(f) of the Magistrates Act, 1993 (Act
no 90 of 1993), reports as follows:

   1. Ms Bacharam was charged for a traffic offence and summoned to appear
      in the Scottburgh District Court on 13 December 2005.  She had an
      option to pay an admission of guilt fine of R300-00 (three hundred
      rand).  On 27 October 2005, she was approached in her office by the
      Sheriff for service of the summons.  Instead of accepting service of
      the summons, she called an interpreter to her office and requested her
      to accept service of the summons on her behalf.  The interpreter
      subsequently signed on the return of service and left Ms Bacharam’s
      office.  On 13 December 2005, the date of trial, all traffic summonses
      were brought before Ms Bacharam. She dealt with the cases, including
      her own.  She, herself, struck case no B7309/05 in which she was an
      accused, from the roll.  The case was thereafter filed. She did not
      pay the admission of guilt fine.


   2. Due to Ms Bacharam hearing her own case and striking it from the roll
      she was criminally charged with defeating or obstructing the
      administration of Justice. The Magistrates Commission also brought
      disciplinary charges against her.

   3. A disciplinary hearing was set down by the Magistrates Commission for
      30 May 2008.  Ms Bacharam’s representative requested a postponement of
      the inquiry pending the finalization of the criminal case against her.



   4. Ms Bacharam was on 13 February 2009 acquitted on the above criminal
      charge.

   5. The Committee was informed that the Magistrates Commission has
      subsequently reviewed the transcription of proceedings in the criminal
      case and had, on Tuesday, 25 August 2009, advised the Minister for
      Justice and Constitutional Development on the feasibility of
      proceeding with a disciplinary hearing.

   6. The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development is considering
      the recommendation by the Magistrates Commission and will inform
      Parliament on the appropriate course of action.
   7. The Committee therefore awaits the tabling of the report from the
      Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development in Parliament in
      order to conclude the matter.

                         WEDNESDAY, 2 SEPTEMBER 2009

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Public Services on Budget Vote 5:
Department of Public Works, dated 25 August 2009

Having considered Budget Vote 5 of the Department of Public Works, the
Committee reports as follows:

   1. Introduction

      On 23 June 2009, the Select Committee on Public Services met with the
      Department of Public Works to consider Budget Vote 5.


   2. Aim of the Department of Public Works


      The aim of the Department is to provide and manage the accommodation,
      housing, land and infrastructure needs of national departments; lead
      and direct the implementation of the national expanded public works
      programme; and promote growth, job creation and transformation in the
      construction and property industries.


   3. Strategic Objectives

     1. The 2009/10 – 2011/12 Strategic Plan of the Department is informed
        by the following government strategic documents:


           i) Current Medium Term Strategic Framework.
          ii) Fifteen Year Review.
         iii) 2009 development indicators.
          iv) Medium term Budget Policy Statement and the Budget Vote.
           v) Millennium Development Goals.
          vi) May 2009 Cabinet Lekgotla decisions.


     2. Public Works Strategic Goals

           i) Provide strategic leadership for effective and efficient
              asset management.
          ii) Establish an enabling environment for the creation of short
              and sustainable work opportunities for the unemployed.
         iii) Contribute to the national goal of job creation and poverty
              alleviation.
          iv) Transform and regulate of the construction and property
              industries to ensure economic growth and development
           v) Ensure effective and efficient implementation of project
              management in the construction and property management
              environments.
          vi) Effective stakeholder management for enhanced implementation
              of the Department’s mandate.
         vii) Ensure effective corporate governance processes and sound
              resources management.
        viii) Improve service delivery to meet clients’ expectations.


   4. Challenges

      The following challenges were highlighted by the Department of Public
      Works:


           i) There was a shortage of built environment skills in the
              country.
          ii) Incorrect and incomplete data complicated the facilitation of
              projects.
         iii) Limited integration of business processes also impacted on
              projects.
          iv) There was a lack of inter-operability due to unaligned
              terminology.
           v) Finalisation of reclaiming the Department’s mandate.
          vi) The difficulty in attracting and retaining personnel from the
              professional and technical fields due to the shortage of
              skills. Competition for these skills from the private sector
              and global economy also exacerbated the problem.


   5. Concerns


      Having considered and deliberated on the Departmental Budget Vote 5
      the Committee noted the following:


           i) The Department’s contribution to the 500 000 jobs and whether
              these would be decent and sustainable, as it is assumed that
              the DPW could provide for the bulk of the jobs. The Committee
              also noted that many local governments were not in a position
              to create jobs.
          ii) The Department should engage with the public and private
              sectors as it could play a fundamental role with regard to
              skills development, especially in the building sector.
         iii) The condition of the buildings, mainly schools and hospitals,
              lacked quality service delivery.
          iv) Many state buildings had been vandalised. The Department
              needs to do an audit of buildings belonging to the DPW.
           v) Insufficient finance led to many vacancies not being filled
              with the Department.
          vi) Unused funds within departments should be spent in different
              spheres of government to avoid fiscal dumping.
         vii) Many young people had been recruited and completed practical
              tests as part of the National Youth Services (NYS). Many had
              not, however, completed the theory component of the
              programme.
        viii) Eight per cent (8%) of National Government Buildings were
              found to be in a good condition. Twenty per cent (20%) were
              reported to be in a poor condition.
          ix) Many new Members of Parliament had difficulty in accessing
              Parliamentary Villages due to former Members not vacating the
              residents.
           x) Many building were not user friendly for people with
              disabilities.
   6. Conclusion


      The Department should present its plan with regard to the EPWP II. In
      order to make monitoring possible, the Department must give a
      breakdown of the expected contributions by provinces towards job
      creation.


   7. Recommendation

      The Committee, having considered Budget Vote 5 of the Department of
      Public Works, recommends that Budget Vote 5 be passed.


      Report to be considered

2.    Report of the Select Committee on Public Services on Budget Vote 33:
Department of Transport, dated 25 August 2009

Having considered Budget Vote 33 of the Department of Transport, the
Committee reports as follows:

   1. Introduction

      On 26 June 2009, the Select Committee on Public Services met with the
      Department of Transport to consider Budget Vote 33.


   2. Mandate of the Department of Transport

      The mandate of the Department is to maximize the contribution of
      transport to the economic and social development goals of the society
      by providing fully integrated transport operations and infrastructure.

      The aim of the Department of Transport is to lead the provision of an
      integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport system, through
      safety and economic regulation, planning, development, coordination,
      promotion and the implementation of transport policies and strategies.

3.    Strategic Objectives

      a. To effectively manage a national innovative research centre and
         provide economic advice and analysis for all modes of transport.
      b. To create an enabling regulatory environment for road, aviation
         and maritime transport, and manage accident and incident
         investigations in all modes of transport.
      c. To manage and facilitate integrated planning and inter-sphere
         coordination for transport infrastructure and operations.
      d. To manage the implementation of the transport logistics strategy
         and the development of freight movement corridors.
      e. To develop integrated accessible and affordable quality public
         transport networks that meet the needs of both rural and urban
         passengers.
      f. To develop appropriate mandates and monitoring mechanisms for
         public entities.


   4. Concerns


      Having considered and deliberated on Budget Vote 33, the Committee
      highlighted the following:


           a. The outcry by the taxi industry with regard to the Bus Rapid
              Transit (BRT) system and the Department’s role in this
              process..
           b. The State-of-the-Province emphasised the development of rural
              roads and grants for infrastructure.  The Northern Cape
              Province would not receive the conditional grant in the
              current financial year.
           c. One of the challenges experienced by the Department with
              regard to the Road Accident Fund (RAF) are the claims made by
              foreigners. Expectations for payment were made in
              international currency and this created a great difference in
              exchange rates.
           d. Issues were raised around the level of preparedness of the
              2010 host cities. This concern was raised in relation to the
              assessments conducted by FIFA. If the assessments were not up
              to standard, this could have a negative impact on the
              economic growth of the country, that is, the stadiums
           e. Infrastructure developments in terms of airports namely:
              Kimberley, Polokwane and Mpumalanga Airports, should be
              prioritised by the Department.
           f. The increased volume of trucks using rural roads caused
              serious damage. The Department should address the issue of
              the collapsed railway transport as it would ease the burden
              of overloaded vehicles damaging provincial roads.
           g. Weighbridges were not functional in many provinces, and
              needed urgent attention.
           h. The Department would be a major contributor towards the 500
              000 jobs that would be created as mentioned by the President
              in his State-of-the-Nation Address.
           i. Collaboration was needed between the Department of Transport
              and the Department of Health to address the H1N1 flu virus.
              If not enough was done to improve the situation, this could
              scare tourists away.
           j. The time frame set for the taxi recapitalisation process was
              projected as seven years. However, the process went beyond
              the set time frame.
           k. Programmes empowering women do not indicate a programme or
              commitment by the Department to establish or promote co-
              operatives;
           l. A meeting between the Department of Transport and the
              Department of Education needs to be scheduled to deal with
              the issue of scholar transport.
           m. The simplified version of the National Land Transport Act to
              be made available in all official languages.

   5. Conclusion


      The Committee noted that some provinces did not have the capacity to
      spend grants or spent it incorrectly. The Committee would welcome the
      assistance of the Department to assist provinces in allocating such
      funds. The Department requested the Committee’s assistance with the
      implementation of legislation to capacitate the Cross-Border Road
      Transport Agency, to execute its mandate. The Committee notes the
      important role that provinces play in terms of transport


   6. Recommendation

      The Committee, having considered Budget Vote 33 of the Department of
      Transport, recommends that Budget Vote 33 be passed.

     1. Strategic Objectives

      The reviewed mandate of the Department informed the strategic intent
      and strategic            objectives to focus the Department in its
      delivery efforts and to strategically align the organisation in terms
      of the internal structure, systems, processes and procedures as
      follows:


           a. Accelerate the delivery of housing and integrated sustainable
              human settlements.

   4. Concerns


      Having considered and deliberated on the Departmental Budget Vote 26,
      the Committee noted the following:


           p. The capacity of the Housing Development Agency (HDA) to
              utilise the allocated budget of R49.5 million, since its
              inception at the beginning of the current financial year.
           q. Thubelisha and Servcon had ceased to exist and were expected
              to be replaced by the HDA. The budget indicated funds
              allocated to Thubelisha and Servcon, and a concern was raised
              about the responsible body to oversee the function.
           r. The creation of a unit within the Department to facilitate
              projects specifically targeted for women and youth.
           s. The housing cover for military veterans, as there would be a
              certain quota per province.
           t. Farm workers needed to be educated with regard to the housing
              policy and their rights to land.
           u. The rapid growth of informal settlements, especially in
              unsafe areas.
           v.  The provision of legislation to assist with the eviction of
              illegal occupants.
           w. The budget reflected a decrease in funds allocated to improve
              the Department’s capacity to deal with inter-governmental
              relations.
           x. The involvement of the Department in dealing with the mandate
              of different spheres of Government, specifically with regard
              to housing.
           y. The challenges experienced at the N2 Gateway and the Khutsong
              Resettlement Projects and mechanisms in place to prevent
              recurrence.
           z. The decrease in funds allocated to improve the Department’s
              capacity to deal with inter-governmental relations as the
              needs of the poorest members of society, in terms of land
              acquisition, were often ignored.

   5. Conclusion


      The Committee urged the Department to recommit itself to the
      intervention programme as it played a vital role in assisting
      provinces and municipalities in service delivery. Furthermore, as a
      matter of urgency, the Department should combat the settlement of
      dwellers in unsafe areas.


   Recommendation

      The Committee, having considered Budget Vote 26 of the Department of
      Human Settlements, recommends that Budget Vote 26 be passed.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs on
the Presidential Launch of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme:
Muyexe, Giyani District Municipality in Limpopo Province dated 25 August
2009

    1.      Introduction and background

The Select Committee: Land and Environmental Affairs, was invited by the
Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, to attend the official
launch of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme, on the 17 August
2009. The programme was launched at the pilot site in Muyexe in the Greater
Giyani District Municipality in the Limpopo province. A delegation was
selected to represent the SC: Land and Environmental Affairs at the launch,
which included Members of Parliament, Honourable Mokgoro (ANC) and
Honourable Worth (DA) together with the Content Advisor (Deshni Pillay).

The Muyexe village was selected for the pilot project due to the high
levels of poverty, unemployment and under development. The Greater Giyani
District is classified as a rural municipality with the main challenge
being access to water. The area is characterised by a dry and hot climate.
Basic services like access to safe drinking water, sanitation, health
services and transportation are unavailable. Since the selection of the
site for piloting the Comprehensive Rural Development Strategy, there has
been an increase in economic activity and interest from developmental
agencies. The Independent Development Trust (IDT) has been closely involved
in several projects within the Muyexe village, by initiating construction
projects thereby empowering the marginalised community.

During the launch of the programme several projects were show-cased, these
included:

   1. The Nene family house
   2. Primary and Secondary School renovation project
   3. Muyexe Hospital
   4. Community Center
   5. Macena Community Farm

   2. Site visits to the different projects

The original Nene home was a traditional hut and after an exceptionally
harsh storm in January 2008 the house was destroyed leaving the family
vulnerable. A further tragedy was the death of the father in February of
the same year. The 11 occupants were destitute and appealed to the
government officials for assistance. The Department of Rural Development
and Land Reform together with the IDT then committed to building a six-
bedroomed house for the family. The house is a brick-house with an
adjoining vegetable garden and proposed orchard to ensure that the
household has access to food and becomes sustainable. The current challenge
is having access to water to start the food garden as water availability is
limited to the rainy season and the high levels of nitrates in the water
decreases its quality. Currently the area is experiencing a drought and
this has further contributed to the poverty in the community.

The two schools in the area have been renovated and toilets have been built
as part of the programme. There are no flush toilets but running water is
now available. Previously the schools had no sanitation facilities and now
there is limited access to taps and ventilated pit latrines.

The old visitors centre has now been upgraded to replace the mobile
hospital that visited the village once a month. The proposed plans for the
hospital include a staff quarters so that the clinic/hospital can be
accessible 24 hours a day by the community. The Department of Heath has now
dedicated one permanent nursing sister to service the clinic. Currently the
newly renovated building has several consulting rooms and the clinic is
relatively well stocked for consultations. No antiretrovirals are currently
available at the clinic/hospital.

The Muyexe Community Centre is currently being built and the project is
contributing to the employment of the village. Both men and women are
employed and each household is represented by one member, so that the
benefits of employment can be equitable. The proposed computer facilities
for the village will also be located in the building. The service will
include a virtual learning portal for school learners and teachers. Other
government service centres will also be housed in this building.

The Macena Community farm comprises of a group of 36 women farmers assisted
by the Organic Farms group and the Department of Rural Development and Land
Reform to produce organic vegetables for the local Spar supermarket in
Giyani. The farmers receive very limited support from the Department of
Agriculture and recently lost their tomato crop to red spider mite
infestation. The farm is 15 ha but only 4 ha are being used productively.
The plans to expand the infrastructure to include a pack-house, storage
facility and shade-cloth nursery are underway. The challenge for the group
is proper expertise and advice on extension services and production.

   3. Recommendations

    ❖ The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is required to
      report to the Committee on a quarterly basis on the progress of each
      of the implementation plans of the two pilot projects, especially
      regarding the co-ordination of activities with other Departments and
      local structures (i.e. regional offices, provincial departments and
      local authorities).
    ❖ The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is required to
      provide the committee with quarterly progress reports on the
      Comprehensive Rural Development Strategy and implementation plan with
      milestones achieved over for the financial year and MTEF period.
    ❖ The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to report within
      two months of adoption of the report by the house on the extent that
      alternative energy sources and specifically green design options for
      solar energy that have been implemented in the design of the houses
      for the rural development projects.
    ❖ The Department of Water and Environmental Affairs is required to
      report within two months of adoption of the report by the house on the
      status of access to free basic water within the Greater Giyani
      District Municipality, with specific reference to the dam and the bulk
      infrastructure within the area.
    ❖ The municipality is required to report within two months of adoption
      of the report by the house on the progress made in providing water and
      sanitation services to the constituency of Muyexe.
    ❖ The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to report within
      two months of adoption of the report by the house on the public
      participation process followed during the implementation of the pilot
      project within the Muyexe village.

   2. Overview of the Economy

Challenges

   In his presentation to the Committee, the Director-General highlighted
the global economic downturn and its impact on the local economic
environment.

   While the crisis first appeared in the financial sector, it has become a
deep real economy and job crisis which threatens the economies of the
developed and the developing world.

    South Africa as part of the global village is not immune to the economic
crisis affecting the world economy. The domestic economy is in recession
and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has contracted by 6.4 % on the
annualized basis in the First Quarter of 2009.

    The crisis has negatively impacted on South Africa’s industrial base and
the following are some of the economic challenges:

    • Manufacturing production has decreased by 11, 7% in March 2009.
    • A labour intensive sector such as wood products, leather, clothing and
      textiles has declined dramatically.
    • Mining production has decreased by 12.8 in March 2009.
    • Company liquidations in the First Quarter of 2009 increased by 46.7%
      (from 687-1 008).
    • The Quarterly Labour Force Survey gave an indication that a total of
      208 000 workers lost their jobs between the First Quarter of 2008 and
      First Quarter of 2009.
Responses to the economic crisis

2.5   In response to the economic crisis crippling the economy, government
      and the social partners on 19 February 2009 reached consensus on the
      mechanism and interventions to be put in place to address the economic
      crisis, the mechanism agreed upon is referred to as the Framework for
      SA’s response to the international crisis.

2.6   The framework outlines the following measures:
    • Defensive measures aimed at protecting the South African economy and
      society in the face of the economic crisis. The government economic
      cluster together with the social partners need to urgently expedite
      implementation of the framework agreement.
    • Transformative measures to deal with the long standing structural
      economic problems.

2.7   The main focus area of the framework focuses on maintaining high
      levels of public investment in infrastructure to support private and
      public job preservation and creation.

2.8   In order to rebuild local industrial capacity and to avoid the
      erosion of the country’s manufacturing base there is a high need to
      utilize industrial and trade policies.

2.9   Guided by the framework agreed upon at NEDLAC, the Department of
      Trade & Industry has formulated its in-house responses focusing mainly
      on:
       • Improving access to finance.
       • Addressing under invoicing, dumping and illegal imports.
       • Leveraging the capital expenditure programme and broader
         government procurement to stimulate demand and support the local
         manufacturing base.
       • Improving competitiveness of local industries by intensifying
         awareness campaigns on the suite of incentives on offer.
       • Addressing growing global protectionism through active
         participation in trade negotiations.

3.    Overview of the Department of Trade and Industry’s strategy

Key interventions over the MTSF period

As part of its key intervention strategy the Department organized work
according to the following themes:
    • Industrial Development
    • Trade, Investment & Exports
    • Broadening Participation
    • Regulation
    • Administration and Co-operation

3.1   Industrial Development

      As a significant part of the national response to the global economic
      slowdown, the Department has prioritized industrial development as a
      crucial strategy in order to rebuild the local industrial capacity.
      The industrial development seeks to address the following:


         ✓ Over the next three years the Department intends to grow and
           diversify manufacturing services by facilitating and monitoring
           the implementation of the industrial policy action plan.
         ✓ Strengthen regional industrial development and cooperation by
           working with regional economic communities to harmonize business
           laws and develop strategies on continental norms for
           agricultural, industrial and environmental standards.
         ✓ Assist firms experiencing economic distress through the
           amendment of the incentive rules
         ✓ Utilize COEGA, East London & Richards Bay Industrial
           Development Zones (IDZ’s) to attract new foreign and local
           investment.

3.2   Trade, Investment and Exports

      South Africa seeks to expand and strengthen the trade and investment
      ties with key political and economic players globally by consolidating
      trade investment relations with developed countries through continued
      engagement with the European Union and the US, deepen economic links
      with major developing countries such Brazil and India and strengthen
      Africa’s continental integration and development negotiated frameworks
      in the AU and NEPAD.

3.3   Broadening participation

    • To foster the growth of small business enterprises and co-operatives,
      the Department seeks to create a broader participatory environment
      through the support of agencies such as Khula, the Small Enterprise
      Development Agency and the South African Micro-finance Apex Fund.
    • Furthermore, the Department intend to increase the participation of
      the historically disadvantaged individuals and businesses to enter the
      main stream economy through the promotion of empowerment and equity
      policies.

3.4   Regulation

      In order to increase access to economic opportunities for historically
      disadvantaged individuals, as their strategic plan going forward the
      Department will monitor all Departmental regulatory entities.

3.5   Administration and Co-ordination

      To continue providing quality service the attraction, development and
      retention of professional skills is going to be addressed by
      implementation of the Human Resource Development Strategy and reviewed
      Performance Management System.

3.6   Allocated Resources

      The allocation of the budget over the MTEF period (2009 – 2012) is as
      follows:

      2009/10     :    R6 344 192
      2010/11     :    R5 752 987
      2011/12     :    R6 003 769

4.    Committee responses to the briefing

      In the interrogation of the briefing, the Committee raised a number of
      issues emanating from the briefing. The issues raised by the Committee
      are follows:

        • While the Department is functioning under a restrictive
          regulatory environment, what measures are in place to attract
          investment under such a restrictive environment?
        • What is the effectiveness of the current macro-economic
          variables.
        • Are there any plans by the current government to review the
          ASGISA policy?
        • Regarding the economic downturn, what is the turnaround strategy
          to address poverty and rural development?
        • Industrial Development Zones - why the development of these zones
          is on the eastern side of the country and not the other parts of
          the country.
        • Given the high rate of textile industries closures mainly due to
          illegal dumping of textiles by Countries such as India, the
          Committee wanted to know what the DTI is doing to address the
          matter.
        • Overpricing by local factories - what is it that the DTI is doing
          to deal with this matter.

5.    Conclusion

      The Committee welcomed the briefing by the Department and took an
      undertaking that it is still going to interact with the Department in
      order to obtain more insight into the functioning of the Department
      and its agencies.

      The Committee supports Budget Vote 32.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Council of Provinces

Report of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs on the
Annual Report for 2008/2009 of the Commission on Restitution of Land
Rights, dated 1 September 2009:

The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, having considered
the Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2008/2009 of the Commission
on Restitution of Land Rights, reports as follows:

   1. Introduction

On 11 August 2009, the Select Committee met with the Land Claims Commission
to discuss its Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2008/2009.The
Commission presented to the Select Committee on the following:
• Purpose of Restitution – Strategic Objectives
• Complex Claims
• Business Process - Strategic Partnerships
• Business Process – Support for Struggling Projects
• Finalisation of outstanding claims
• Challenges and Strategies
• Budget breakdowns for the following years:
          o 2010 / 11
          o 2011 / 12
          o 2012 / 13

   2. Deliberations by the Committee

2.1.  The Committee engaged the Commission on the high vacancy rate in the
      Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and KZN provinces, and what remedies were
      being implemented. The Committee requested the Commission to forward
      its staff retention strategy.

2.2.  The Commission was queried about parcels of land that were not yet
      identified by the Department of Public Works as state assets, and how
      this affected restitution claims.

2.3.  The Committee asked why statistics showed that the bulk of the
      remaining claims were rural, which raised the question about the
      settlement of urban claims?

2.4.  In answering the Committee’s question, the Commission indicated that
      feasibility studies were conducted on all donated land received for
      the purpose of restitution.
2.5.  It was agreed that the Community Property Associations (CPA) should
     be reviewed and that legislation would be required to effect these
     changes. The Commission raised the issue of Community Property
     Associations and its implementation in communally owned land, as the
     traditional tribal authorities were not adequately included in the
     restitution process.

2.6.  A question as to what assistance was given to claimants, who are
     acquiring mineral rights to land that they received under the Land
     Restitution Act was discussed.

2.7.  The Committee discussed support given to land claimants for food
     security and which departments were responsible for this particular
     function.

   3. Challenges identified

3.1.  The Committee and the Commission engaged each other on the issue of
      land restitution vs. financial compensation. There was a concern that
      some ommissioners coerced claimants into accepting financial
      compensation rather than pursue land claims.

      As stated in the Restitution Act, the Commissioners made both options
      available to claimants, for their independent decision on which course
      of action to pursue. The Commission stated that some claimants,
      especially old people, prefer to take financial compensation instead
      of being uprooted a second time.

3.2.  The Committee inquired about the delay in finalising the proposed
      amendments to the Expropriation Act.

      The Commission stated that the process was not finalised due to lack
      of public consultation, and that the Bill is the responsibility of the
      Department of Public Works.

3.3.  The Committee expressed concern on the slow pace of settlements of
claims.

       The Commission responded by outlining the challenges experienced with
      complex claims and difficultly in retaining staff.

3.4   The Committee was not pleased with the statement made by the
      Commission in their presentation document, stating that a savings was
      made due to good planning. The Committee was of the opinion that the
      money should have been utilised, in light of the fact that there are
      still many claims outstanding.

   4. Resolution

1. The Committee resolved that:

         • the Commission should forward to the committee a report with the
           breakdown of the 200 struggling projects, per province and the
           amount of money allocated to the projects within 14 days.


         • the Commission should forward a report on it’s Human Resource
           Retention Strategy to the Committee.

Report to be considered.
