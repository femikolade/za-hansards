                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Freddie Adams, sit down, please. The
Minister wants to speak now.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces,
Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, hon members and
colleagues, I am here to present the Appropriation Bill, which most of you
are now familiar with. The original Appropriation Bill was tabled with the
Budget in the National Assembly on 11 February 2009 by my predecessor,
Minister Manuel.

Following the general elections in April, it has been revived, debated,
amended and approved by the National Assembly. Several technical changes
have been made to better align the Bill with the new Cabinet structure
announced by President Zuma in May this year after the elections. An
extensive process has been put in place by the Department of Public Service
and Administration, DPSA, to give administrative effect to the new Cabinet
portfolios and departmental structures that support the Ministers
responsible for those portfolios. This process is not yet complete and, in
some instances, is very complex. So, I present to you, ladies and
gentlemen, the Appropriation Bill as amended by the National Assembly.

Over the past weeks you have had the task of engaging in policy debates on
the Budget Votes of all the departments. This is not an easy task and it
demands your careful consideration. Once you pass the Budget, the public
relies on their public representatives to ensure that the lives of our
people are improved, wastage is eliminated and corruption is dealt with
effectively. They expect Parliament to hold the executive accountable as
much as they hold civil servants accountable.

This Appropriation Bill is passed in an uncertain and generally gloomy
global context. About 10 days ago, there was a lot of talk around the globe
in many financial newspapers and elsewhere about the recession bottoming
out. In the past couple of days this week that attitude has changed quite
significantly and, instead of the optimism that was prevalent 10 days ago,
there’s a climate of gloom hanging over the world.

The recent sentiment is that the green shoots in the global economy are
being covered by brown shoots, as indications show that the much-
anticipated global recovery is, as yet, some way off. It is now inevitable
that 2009 will see a contraction in global economic growth, with signs that
the recession will bottom out at the end of the year. Even in South Africa,
it is predicted by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that our growth will
be somewhere between -1,5% and -2%.

The global economic slowdown has pushed our own economy into recession –
our first in 17 years. We have had to relook at our fiscal trajectory, with
the impact of the slowdown on our revenue collection for this year being,
undeniably, quite significant. We recently announced that our revenue
collection could be as much as R60 billion below target if the present
trends continue. Of course, we will only know this later in the year. Our
spending will, therefore, exceed revenue this year. However, our prudent
fiscal stance in the past years has given us the space to increase
borrowing to address this shortfall, and to ensure that spending plans to
sustain economic activity can continue.

In essence, over the past few years we’ve been careful not to borrow so
much in South Africa. Our debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25% to 26%, and that
means, unlike many other countries around the world, we have more space to
borrow.

Equally, over the past two years we’ve had a small surplus in our budgeting
in South Africa, and that small surplus in fact helped us to cope with the
recession we are facing. This means that we have to borrow more in the
coming year to make up for the shortfall in revenue. We have to prune
unnecessary spending and reprioritise our plans going forward. We must be
uncompromising about our approach in attacking wastage and corruption.

The space created by our fiscal position has also taught us that it is
vital to ensure that any borrowing that is done, is done in a sustainable
way. Borrowing means paying back later on with interest. So, borrowing now
effectively means that there will be less money available in the future,
because we will be paying more in interest. Our borrowing requirements,
therefore, must be met in a manner that will not hinder our future growth
plans. If we spend more money on paying interest, we are spending less
money on delivering services to South Africans. Therefore, the balance
between the amount of money spent on interest payments versus the amount of
money spent on delivering services to South Africans is a balance that has
to be carefully maintained.

As many of our borrowing requirements as possible should be met
domestically. This means that we borrow from the domestic capital markets
instead of relying on foreign inflows. But borrowing is also related to
savings in a particular country. If a country’s citizens don’t save
adequately, then there isn’t enough money to be borrowed by government or
by businesses in that country.

Therefore, it is particularly significant that July is known as savings
month in South Africa and is aimed at promoting a savings culture in this
country. There are positive indications that South Africans are taking this
message to heart, as the gross savings rate as a proportion of GDP rose to
17% in the first quarter of this year, up from an average of 15,4% in 2008.
But we are way behind those countries that save effectively. China’s figure
is 40%, and India’s figure is 30%, compared to our 17%.

So, we have to find some way of creating a conversation in South Africa and
also an attitude which ensures that even with limited incomes we save more
money than we currently do, and consume less than is currently done as
well. And, we believe that Chambers like the National Council of Provinces
and the members of the NCOP can play an important role in educating the
public about the importance of saving.

The slowdown is putting additional pressure on ensuring that value for
money remains tantamount or important in all the spending decisions.
Spending pressures are making themselves felt at all levels of government,
and in particular provinces and municipalities are grappling with lower
revenue streams. This has implications for spending on priority areas like
health and education. Where necessary, spending must be reprioritised so
that we can spend more on providing services required by our people and
less on programmes that can be delayed or done away with.

The times have changed and our way of doing things must also change. So,
part of the conversation that we need to have with both the executive in
the provinces and civil servants in provinces and in municipalities is how
we stop wasting money, how we take exotic projects and kill them, and how
we ensure that money is directed towards the services that all of our
people actually require.

Let me from the outset clarify that there is no additional funding that the
new departments will receive in this main Budget. Funds will be transferred
from one Vote to another in line with the transfer of functions, and, where
necessary, additional resources will be provided to cater for new
Ministries and new functions. These transfers and changes will be reflected
in October when we table the Adjustments Appropriation Bill.

To ensure continuity, departments that were in existence before 10 May 2009
will continue to exist until such time as the reorganisation becomes
effective. Yesterday we tabled an explanatory memorandum in the National
Assembly, and it is available for all to read, to assist you to better
understand how these changes and processes will work. This is important so
that service delivery continues.

In essence, it’s going to still take us a few months, and perhaps, in some
instances, longer than a few months, in order not just to get the
reorganisation of departments undertaken successfully, but also to move the
right amount of money successfully. If you look at the Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, there is quite a significant change in
its functions. So, you have to work out how many people are going to move
and the amount of money needed that has to move with those people as well.

Our intergovernmental fiscal system has indeed matured over the past 15
years. We have relatively stable budgets and our financial reforms have
deepened. Over the past 10 years the budgets of provincial and local
governments have grown in real terms and, in some instances, have more than
doubled in size.

Great progress has been made on the delivery side. We have improved access
to basic services like water, sanitation, refuse and electricity. All
service delivery indicators point in the right direction, but the question
we have to ask is whether we have done enough and whether we have the
necessary quality of services that our people require.

Education outcomes are not what they should be, given the level of
investment being made in the system. At present, a great chunk of our
school infrastructure does not create a conducive learning environment.

The health system, particularly the hospitals, is under severe pressure due
to management failures.

The poor remain marginalised and are located on the peripheries of our
cities far from economic opportunity. What are the chances that these
communities will get out of the poverty cycle that they find themselves in?

I am sure these things are not new to hon members. These are just a few
examples to illustrate that government is simply not getting value for
money, given the enormous investment that it is making.

At the same time, we have challenges and successes amongst both our
provinces and our municipalities. And as a House that represents the
interests of the provinces and municipalities, I trust you will engage more
keenly with the challenges that our provinces and municipalities face as
much as we must also celebrate the successes of the provinces and
municipalities.

The National Treasury has provided this House with all the information it
requires, and I assure you that it will work closely with you to enable you
to get on top of your portfolios and interact with both the executive and
public servants as effectively as you should.

When the Budget was tabled, we said that we would protect the poor, build
capacity for long-term growth, sustain employment growth and maintain a
stable debt level, and, at the same time, address barriers to growth and
investment. The economic outlook has changed since then, but we remain
committed to these objectives.

I want to take this opportunity, in conclusion, to thank members of the
NCOP for their commitment, dedication and patience. In particular, I want
to thank the Select Committee on Finance and Appropriations, ably chaired
by Mr De Beer, for their thorough engagement on the amending Bill. I thank
you for this opportunity to speak with you. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

Mr C J DE BEER: Hon Chairperson, it is an honour to take part in the
proceedings this afternoon to deal with the allocation of money in order to
better the lives of our people outside.

On behalf of the Select Committee on Finance and Appropriations, I
congratulate the hon Minister and the Deputy Minister on their appointments
to serve our nation in positions of responsibility. We commend the Minister
of Finance for the sterling work done during his time as Commissioner of
the SA Revenue Service. We wish him well in these trying times, but also
give him endless opportunities. John Maxwell said: “Tough times never last,
but tough people do.”

Prudence and discipline in the management of fiscal policies is required
more today than ever before, as the days of the public spending boom are
over. Leadership means taking responsibility for good and bad, even if it
means taking unpopular decisions.

As a committee we have taken note that the fiscal policy framework, as
outlined in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework presented by the previous
Minister of Finance in February this year, has since been altered by the
new economic realities prevailing in the world today.

The important issue is: How do departments in the national and provincial
spheres manage their spending, including municipalities?

The budget is guided by five enduring principles, which are as follows:
protecting the poor; sustaining employment growth and expanding training
opportunities; building economic capacity and promoting investment;
addressing the barriers of competitiveness that limit an equitable sharing
of opportunities; and, in doing these things, maintaining a sustainable
debt level so that actions today do not constrain development tomorrow.

The debates on the Budget Votes showed that the departments do have clear
objectives to do what is captured in the five principles. Progress in these
areas will be more difficult over the period ahead. Policy adjustments need
to reinforce macroeconomic stability. New departments will have to align
their budgets with the set priorities.

Our country’s intergovernmental system faces a number of challenges with
regard to service delivery, where concurrent functions are concerned. Some
of these challenges have been identified as follows. Sometimes there seems
to be a misalignment between policy initiatives and resource allocation.
The lack of accountability for service delivery where the functions are
concurrent creates problems. The lack of clarity on whether the assignment
or configuration of certain functions lends itself to inefficiency and
ineffectiveness is another challenge.

The largest adjustments to spending plans go to poverty reduction. Key
spending allocations are, for example, R489 million to Education for the
school nutrition programme; R200 million for health care; and R2,3 billion
to adjust social grants for inflation and to accommodate the increase in
beneficiary numbers due to changes in the means test.

It is our responsibility to give our people a better life. The quality of
services delivered is important.

It is thus the responsibility of the NCOP, as we do our oversight, to look
at the allocated resources and how they are spent. What priorities are
addressed? The main issue is: Do we get value for money?

We are going to do our constituency work now and we will be confronted by
the communities wanting to know whether there are projects on the ground.
The underspending and overspending by departments and provinces lead us to
pose the question: What are the implications in respect of quality of
services rendered because both are unacceptable?

There will be serious engagement with the departments’ strategic plans and
their spending on a quarterly basis, as well as dealing with their annual
reports. The Appropriation Bill is providing more money in many areas. It
is our task to do oversight of this money.

In light of the economic downturn, provinces should be in a position to
weather the storm, provided the following are in place: improved and better
cash management and cash-flow procedures; improved ability to cost
activities and plan expenditure; adherence to the prescriptions of the
Public Finance Management Act, Treasury regulations and other financial
guidelines; avoidance of expenditure on nonpriority items; improved
execution of departmental plans and budgets; and renewed focus on the
efficient, effective and economic delivery of services.

The select committee dealt with the Appropriation Bill this morning, and
adopted it. But there are a few concerns that I also want to note on behalf
of the committee. The committee will deal with them in the future, when we
call on the National Treasury on a quarterly basis to find out about
progress on the issues mentioned.

What is the impact on service delivery by newly created departments that
still do not have any budget allocations and support staff? What is the
practicality of having functions transferred to new departments, while
budget allocations are still with old departments? How will the transfer of
functions to new departments impact on personnel transfers? How does the
Treasury expect the departments to implement their mandate as they do not
have any budgets and are expected to ask other departments for financial
assistance?

As I have indicated, we will deal with these issues when we call the
department back on a quarterly basis.

These are the kinds of challenges that are facing all of us - not only one
party but everyone sitting here - as we deal with the Appropriation Bill
today. We have a responsibility to our people out there. Let’s work and
give them a better life. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

              RESIGNATION FROM JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION AND
                      RECONSTITUTION OF NCOP DELEGATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chair, I move without notice:


   That the Council notes and accepts the resignation of the Hon Mr  T  H  M
   Mofokeng, MP, as a member of the Judicial  Service  Commission  with  his
   last day being 5 July 2009 and that  the  delegation  from  the  National
   Council of Provinces be reconstituted as follows:

      a) Mr M J Mahlangu
      b) Mr T A Mashamaite
      c) Ms B P Mabe
      d) Ms M G Boroto

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I don’t recall Mr Worth resigning from the
Commission, and I didn’t hear his name. I heard that Mofokeng had resigned
and, therefore, that the delegation would be reconstituted. But Mr Worth’s
name was left out. Could I have an explanation please, Chair?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chair, when I read the motion, I emphasised
that the delegation would be reconstituted. I, therefore, as the Chief Whip
of the NCOP, reconstituted the entire delegation, and the motion is that
the four names that I read now will be the people who will make up part of
Parliament’s delegation to the Judiciary Service Commission.

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I object strongly! This House adopted the
committee that was put to the House. I don’t see it anywhere in the Rules
that the Chief Whip has the right to disband the committee and constitute a
new one. I therefore strongly object to it! Now, I ask you to investigate
it before we take a decision on this, because I think the House is out of
order by simply leaving out the name of a member, a delegate from this
House that was nominated and adopted by this House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chair, let me first apologise for making
this a dialogue between Mr Watson and myself. I really apologise to you,
Chair. I didn’t mean this to go this way. But all I know, and all I know in
terms of the NCOP, is that if you read the Constitution of the country, it
will tell you exactly how many members must come from both the National
Council of Provinces and the National Assembly. And it says - if I have to
clarify this for Mr Watson – that in the National Assembly, it is six
members, three of whom must come from the opposition parties. That has been
done. Regarding the resignation, I have reconstituted the delegation and I
am moving that the House adopts the motion. Nowhere does it speak about
parties, or provinces.

It refers to four members of the National Council of Provinces. And I am
being so slow, Mr Watson, so that you understand. If you consult your
Constitution again, whatever investigation you do, you will be referred to
the very Constitution I am speaking about now. There is nowhere else from
where we take guidance. There is nothing that says that in the Rules of the
NCOP. Mr ... ?

Ms E C VAN LINGEN: Hon Worth!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Hon Worth, thank you, Madam. Mr Worth, like
any other member here and like me is a delegate of a province. Although I
am a member of the ANC, I have been sent by the Western Cape. So, that’s
how it goes. I propose that we proceed, Chair. Thank you very much.

Mr A WATSON: Chair, at no point did I refer to the hon Worth as a DA
member. I referred to the hon Worth as a member of the committee that was
elected by this House, and he has not resigned. I don’t know where the
Chief Whip gets the right to dismiss an hon member from whatever party who
has been duly elected by this House. And I ask your ruling on that, Chair.

Mr D D GAMEDE: Hon Chair, I don’t want to say this is a point of order, but
the motion is that there should be a reconstitution of this delegation.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Yes, Mr Gamede, I was still listening. I am
sorry for that.

Mr D D GAMEDE: Hon Chairperson, all I was saying is that the motion is
about the reconstitution of the delegation.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Okay, thank you very much.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Hon Chairperson, with permission, it seems that
procedurally everything is not in order in terms of the way that this
process has unfolded. I therefore request your consideration that this
matter be reconsidered and the motion not be put today. Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Okay. Let me just go through the Constitution
first, which the Chief Whip has just quoted. It’s section 178(1)(i), which
says: “... four permanent delegates to the National Council of Provinces
designated together by the Council with a supporting vote of at least six
provinces ...”

Now, my reading into that matter is that one member has resigned.
Therefore, when you reconstitute that, you reconstitute the whole
delegation together. And that’s what the Constitution is saying. I will
allow the motion to test the provinces in terms of whether they vote for
the motion, or don’t vote for the motion. And remember we need six
provinces to vote for the motion.
Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, I wish to enquire through you from the Chief Whip
whether the provinces were indeed asked to consider this vote that they are
taking today, because I know for a fact that the Western Cape was not given
that opportunity, and we control the Western Cape as the DA.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Well, I can put that question. But I’ve always
said in the House that the Whips must consult one another. It shouldn’t be
the job of the Chairperson to consult with the Whips. The Chairperson puts
the question to the House, and that is my job. But that’s fine; I will do
it through the Chief Whip if you want me to do so.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I speak as the Chief Whip but
as Whips we are a collective. There is nothing in the Rules that says you
must always consult. I am doing exactly my job as a member of the NCOP, and
as a person who has been given this little manpower to make sure that the
things that happen are in order. All that I have moved is in order. Yes, we
consult from time to time. Today I really did not have time to consult with
the Whips.

I think you have given a ruling that if six provinces here will support the
motion, it will be agreed to. Let me just say one last thing: There were no
promises to whoever, by whoever to say whatever. This is a motion that I am
moving in this House. Finished.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am putting the motion now. Can I stop
the dialogue? I’ve ruled on the matter.

I’m putting the question to the House. As there is no speakers’ list, I
shall now put the question. The question is that the motion be agreed to.
As the decision is dealt with in terms of section 178(1)(i) of the
Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are
present in the Chamber to cast their province’s vote. Are you all present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces an opportunity to
make their declarations of vote if they so wish. Is there any province that
wishes to do so?

Declaration of vote:

Mr T E HARRIS: Chairperson, the Western Cape will vote against the motion
and expresses its objection that we weren’t consulted on this before we got
to vote.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West.

AGAINST: Western Cape.

Motion accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 178(1)(i) of the
Constitution.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, just on a point of clarity: The Northern Cape
delegation consists of six people. None of them were consulted. And I don’t
know on what basis our representative voted in favour ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: All right. Be patient with one another.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I think you have given a ruling
and the voting has taken place. There is no basis for what Mr Sinclair is
saying. You can’t reopen the discussion when we have already voted.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Before the closing of the House, I call
upon the Deputy Chairperson. She has a ruling to make and then she will
adjourn the House. [Interjections.] No, I am not taking any points of
order.

Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson, is it parliamentary for an ordinary member to
say: “Dit is onnosel [That is stupid]” to the Chairperson?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, no, I didn’t say so.

Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson, he said that. I can speak Afrikaans.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Take your seat, Mr Sibande. Mr Sinclair, did
you say that?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Not to the Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You said it to whom?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I referred to the hon Chief Whip.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: But that is still wrong. Could you withdraw
those words?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I will withdraw.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you very much.

Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson, sorry again. After that, please, this thing
mustn’t happen like this. He is saying the Chairperson is stupid.
[Interjections.] Who is stupid then? Who is stupid then? No! no! no! We
can’t use this language here.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Take your seat, Mr Sibande. Mr Sinclair, did
you say that?

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I didn’t say the Chairperson is stupid. I
already withdrew what I said to the Chief Whip.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Sinclair, I said to you withdraw. Please
can you withdraw those words.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, I withdraw.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Respect one another in this House. You are not
allowed, in terms of the Rules, to use such words.

Mr K A SINCLAIR: Chairperson, then we must do it collectively, please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Okay.

                    POINT OF ORDER RAISED ON 7 JULY 2009

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms T C Memela): Hon members, this is a
ruling on a point of order raised by hon Sinclair, and I hope all of you
remember it. This was during the sitting of 7 July 2009. I’ve since
consulted the Hansard records in order to make an informed ruling on the
matter.

The hon Sinclair objected to a statement made by the hon Mabe during her
speech. The hon Sinclair’s grounds for objection was that, in terms of the
Rules, a member is not allowed to refer to a previous debate or a debate in
another House.

In terms of our Rules of debate, specifically Rule 47, no member, while
addressing the Council, may reflect upon any decision of the Council in the
same annual session, except for the purpose of moving that such decision be
amended or rescinded.

The emphasis in the Rule is on any decision of the Council, rather than on
any statement that may have been made. I, therefore, rule that the
statement made by the hon member was in order. Thank you. [Applause.]

The Council adjourned at 15:19.
