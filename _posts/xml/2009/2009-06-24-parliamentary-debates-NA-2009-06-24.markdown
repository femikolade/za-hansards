silence for prayers or meditation.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms C DUDLEY: Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP, I give notice that I shall
move:

  That the House debates South Africa’s disaster preparedness in light of
  the number of fatal diseases, natural disasters and terrorist acts
  prevalent globally.

              CONGRATULATIONS TO AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH COUNCIL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

  That the House -

  (1) notes the significant success of the Agricultural Research Council in
       completing the sequencing of 48 South African types of virus isolates
       of foot and mouth disease from different regions and countries within
       Southern Africa;


  (2) further notes that the genetic sequences of these isolates will enable
       researchers to develop and select effective vaccine strains with
       greater specificity;


  (3) acknowledges that the availability of such vaccine within South
       Africa, and the continent, will contribute vastly to disease
       management and increased livestock productivity; and

       success which exceeds performance expectations.

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote 1 – The Presidency:

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Honourable Speaker, Deputy Speaker,
Honourable President of the Republic, Ministers and Deputy Ministers ...
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Hon President, you are the President! [Laughter.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I meant to say deputy! [Laughter.] Hon
Deputy President of the Republic, hon members, esteemed guests, fellow
South Africans, thank you for the opportunity afforded the Presidency to
share its programmes and plans.

The Deputy President, hon Kgalema Motlanthe, and the Ministers in the
Presidency will join me in outlining the focus areas of the work of the
Presidency.

We will need the support of the hon members of Parliament, as we strive to
achieve our mission of building a Presidency and government that are
responsive, interactive and effective.

This Budget Vote debate complements the discussion we had on the state of
the nation address some two weeks ago. In that address we outlined 10
priorities for government over the next five years. We made a commitment
that working together will speed up economic growth and transform the
economy to create decent work and sustainable livelihoods.

We said we would introduce a massive programme to build economic and social
infrastructure.

We undertook to develop and implement a comprehensive rural development
strategy, linked to land and agrarian reform, and food security. We also
said we would strengthen the skills and human resource base, and improve
the health profile of all South Africans.

We said that, working together with all South Africans, we would intensify
the fight against crime and corruption. We added that we would build
cohesive, caring and sustainable communities.

We also pointed out that, working with Africa and the rest of the world, we
would pursue African advancement and enhanced international co-operation.
We would also ensure sustainable resource management and use.

This, we said, would require that we work with the people and our public
servants in particular, to build a developmental state, improve public
services and strengthen democratic institutions. We have to work harder and
smarter to achieve all these objectives, and we believe that the leadership
of government is equal to the task.

The Presidency, as the nerve centre of government, will strive to provide
efficient oversight and support to enable national departments and all
spheres of government to perform their work.
As you are aware, we announced a reconfigured Cabinet structure last month.
The restructuring took place after intense reflection on what had and
hadn’t worked over the past 15 years. The changes were also a product of a
very extensive public engagement process.

We are fortunate in South Africa to have a highly active and very vocal
population. We interacted with thousands of South Africans last year and
early this year in various forums. They told us that they wanted to see an
urgent improvement in service delivery. Their views added to what our
internal reviews had indicated. They made it clear that we have very good
policies, but that these will only improve people’s lives more effectively
if the Public Service becomes more responsive, interactive and effective.

The complaints raised included, amongst other things, the weaknesses in
local government, the poor quality of some of the public services rendered
by national and provincial spheres, and the failure to respond to inquiries
and complaints and to provide information.

Other complaints pointed to poor strategic planning across the three
spheres of government and weak monitoring and evaluation. It became clear
to us that we had to improve the capacity of the State, and also change the
culture and ethos of government in order to improve service delivery.
We have, since the inauguration, invested time and resources on setting up
systems and to establish new government structures, based on our
priorities.

The technical restructuring is very important, but a key factor is also to
deal with the human angle, as the services are provided by human beings for
human beings.

We must therefore improve the performance of the Public Service, and bring
to life our People First, or Batho Pele, principles. We have to introduce,
without delay, a culture of hard work, courtesy and accountability amongst
staff in the Public Service. This we will do to achieve our goal of
building a government that is responsive, interactive and effective. We
will come back to this issue later.

I would like to share with the House, hon Speaker, some of the reasons why
we changed certain government departments or created new ones. I will cite
just a few:

We had to improve the ability of the Presidency to give leadership to, and
exercise oversight on government. We had to introduce a system of
integrated strategic planning and the alignment of plans and programmes
across all the spheres of government.

These plans will take into account the socioeconomic potential of each
district and metro and assist them to exploit their comparative advantages
to the full. The Ministry in the Presidency responsible for the National
Planning Commission was introduced to lead this process.

We also deemed it necessary to improve the capacity for effective
monitoring and evaluation, hence the creation of the Ministry responsible
for that task in the Presidency.

As we said during the state of the nation address, housing is not just
about building houses. It is also about transforming our residential areas
and building communities with greater access to work and social amenities,
including sports and recreation facilities. This has informed the creation
of the Ministry for Human Settlements.

The mining sector provides a strategic link to the global economy. It is
also a major labour-intensive sector and has various other advantages for
our economy, which is why it was made a stand-alone Ministry.

Given our energy needs and the role of this sector in a developing economy,
it is a crucial area of work for the country, which is why it also needed
special attention as a fully fledged Ministry.

We made education a key priority over the next five years, which
necessitated a renewed emphasis on this portfolio. The Basic Education
Ministry will focus on adult basic education and training, as well as
primary and secondary education.

The Higher Education Ministry focuses on tertiary, technical and vocational
training as well as skills development, which includes the Setas.

The International Relations and Co-operation designation refines the
mandate of the former Department of Foreign Affairs to include a focus on
development co-operation, in which we want to continue investing for the
good of the continent and our own region.

We divided Agriculture and Land Affairs into two Ministries and created a
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The special focus on
agriculture is important to better expand agricultural production including
the regulation of and support for the commercial sector – big and small.
The fisheries sector is a critical part of the limited natural resources
base of the country and is critical for food security, and will require our
utmost attention.

By establishing a Ministry of Rural Development and Land Affairs, we seek
to ensure optimal focus on putting into action our goal of changing the
face of rural areas through meaningful socioeconomic development
initiatives. We are convinced that this new Ministry will contribute
immensely to our drive to ensure food security and, broadly, the
improvement of the quality of life of rural communities.

Combining Water and Environmental Affairs provides a consolidated approach
to the environment and matters of sustainability. Besides the
implementation of our strategies on the management of water resources, its
functions will also include a regulatory task encompassing all
environmental management matters.

We also want to focus more on improving intergovernmental relations, hence
the recognition and reconfiguration of the former Department of Provincial
and Local Government to Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs.
Given the central role of traditional leadership matters, especially in
rural areas, we felt it important to give this function an intensive focus.


The Deputy President will assist the President by leading efforts in
engaging with traditional, religious and linguistic communities.

The functions of the Department of Public Service and Administration are
being refined to include the management of personnel and related matters in
the local government sphere, in line with proposed legislation for a single
Public Service.

Meanwhile, most indicators show that there is growth in the tourism sector,
and we rely on it to create many more jobs, hence the decision to create a
Ministry solely for this function.

Some people are wondering why we have both the Department of Trade and
Industry and that of Economic Development. Trade matters will require a
strong focus to have a direct impact on industrial organisation and output.


The Economic Development portfolio will have a strong domestic focus and
will address, amongst other things, matters of macro- and microeconomic
development planning. We say this, very much aware that, in terms of
legislation, the National Treasury co-ordinates macroeconomic policy.

The affected Ministries are working together to align work and detailed
responsibilities.

Hon Speaker, already the new cluster system, made up of seven as distinct
from the previous five clusters, is functional. Ministers and directors-
general are currently finalising cluster programmes of action to ensure
that government meets its objectives. These programmes set out concrete
activities to meet each of our strategic priorities. Attached to each
activity is a timeframe for the achievement of specific concrete
objectives.

Hon members, the last fifteen years have exposed serious gaps in
intergovernmental co-ordination. Too often we have observed different
spheres of government acting in a manner that is sometimes contradictory.
The reshaping of government cannot therefore exclude the provincial and
local spheres. The three spheres have to co-operate with one another in
mutual trust, as the supreme law of our land enjoins them to do.

We are in the process of reviewing the President’s Co-ordinating Council in
which the President meets with the Premiers to make intersphere co-
ordination more effective. A number of ideas are being put forward,
including that of possibly including executive mayors of the metropolitan
municipalities in the PCC in order to improve planning and monitoring and
evaluation.

There is a dedicated team of people who are overseeing the re-organisation
of government. The experience of the last few weeks demonstrates that all
these changes are being handled with care and dedication.

Where legislation is required, Parliament will be requested to assist us.
We are on track and are pleased with the progress made.

Hon Speaker, the establishment of the Ministry and corresponding department
that will focus solely on issues affecting women, children and persons with
disabilities means that this will be the last time that this function
reports to the NA as part of the Budget Vote of The Presidency. We are
confident that this change will result in better – and not less – focus on
these vulnerable groups.

As the Presidency, we will continue to lend this Ministry all our support.
We will do so because we know that a society in which women, children and
persons with disabilities remain marginalised, cannot claim to be truly
free. Minister Noluthando Mayende-Sibiya will outline the plans of the new
Ministry.

Hon members will recall our statement that the eradication of poverty would
be the cornerstone of this government’s programme of action. The Deputy
President of the Republic will, amongst other responsibilities, lead us in
championing the fight against poverty. This will include the integration of
government plans and the mobilisation of social partners. Government cannot
wage this war alone.

Hon Speaker, as part of building a responsive, interactive and effective
government, we must strengthen our partnerships with society. We are in the
process of reviewing our public and stakeholder forums such as the current
Presidential Working Groups, advisory councils and izimbizo. We also want
to improve and strengthen the functioning and capacity of institutions such
as Nedlac. Our objective is to build an enduring partnership informed by
the shared interests of all social partners and society at large.

This principle applies equally, if not more so, to our fight against HIV
and Aids. The South African National Aids Council, Sanac, has been
exemplary in this regard. The Deputy President leads our efforts in this
partnership, and he will outline the progress made and the challenges we
face.

As Leader of Government Business in Parliament, our Deputy President will
be responsible for building stronger relations between the executive and
the legislature, as well as with political parties represented in
Parliament.

The President will also prioritise the need to maintain positive and co-
operative relations with the Opposition, in the spirit outlined during both
the inauguration and state of the nation addresses. [Applause.] Our aim is
to build a more cohesive society, where all of us, irrespective of race,
class or political persuasion, contribute to making South Africa succeed.

Hon Speaker, we said in the state of the nation address that the global
recession is one of the challenges that we will need to work together on as
political parties and other sectors. We are now being hit by the full force
of the recession.

Many jobs have been lost. The Quarterly Employment Survey of formal sector
businesses reported that the first quarter of 2009 saw the loss of 179 000
jobs. The most affected sectors are retail and wholesale, financial,
manufacturing, mining and construction.

While we know that our efforts cannot fully compensate for the impact of
the crisis, we have intervened in various ways, as agreed in our framework
agreement on the response to the crisis.

The IDC, the DTI, the Department of Labour and the Department of Public
Works and others are working hard in response to the challenge of job
losses.

Government will be making a further intervention, a final draft proposal
for a training lay-off scheme, to our social partners early next week. The
point of this scheme is to keep at least some workers in their jobs and
train them during this slow period. They will receive relevant training,
benefits and an allowance in place of their wage, for a period of time.

Compatriots, we are meeting during national Youth Month, and accordingly,
last week, on June 16, we celebrated the 33rd anniversary of the Soweto
uprisings and National Youth Day.

On this day we launched the National Youth Development Agency, which
demonstrates our determination and commitment to deal with issues of youth
development in an integrated and effective manner.

On June 16 we also underlined the critical importance of youth themselves
playing an active role in addressing the challenges that they face. We said
so, believing that the youth are the primary agents of their own
development. The Minister in the Presidency now responsible for youth
development, Collins Chabane, will further elaborate on the various youth
development interventions.

Hon members, we have committed ourselves to promote effective two-way
communication between citizens and the Presidency. I must stress that the
primary purpose of the pending President’s hotline and the public liaison
directorate is to improve service delivery.

Angigcizelele  Somlomo ukuthi sifuna ukwakha uhulumeni olalela maqede
aphendule, oxhumanayo nabantu nowenza into ebonakalayo.
Sizokhuthaza yonke iminyango kahulumeni, izifundazwe nomasipala ukuba
bavule iminyango baxhumane kangcono nabantu baxazulule izinkinga
kusenesikhathi.

Abantu bathi ukuxhumana akukho kahle. Uma beshayela uhulumeni badluliselwa
kubantu abaningi baze badikibale bengalutholanga usizo. Lokhu kufanele
kuphele.

Sisebenzela bona abantu baseNingizimu Afrika kufanele sibaphathise
okwezikhali zamaNtungwa. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Speaker, let me accentuate this, we need to build a government that
listens and answers, which liaises with people and does tangible things.

We will encourage all government departments, provinces and the
municipalities to open communication departments and to liaise better with
people in solving problems timeously.

People say that there is a lack of communication. When they call government
departments they are placed on hold until they lose their patience, without
being helped. This must stop.

We are serving the people of South Africa; we must take good care of them.]
The efficiency of the Presidency’s public liaison mechanism rests on the co-
operation of the national departments and the nine Premiers’ offices, as
most enquiries and complaints relate to their work.

In this regard, the Presidency is working with the Government
Communications and Information System, GCIS, to establish a national
liaison forum. This forum, to comprise officials representing all
government departments and Premier’s offices, will enable Presidency public
liaison personnel to obtain quick responses to enquiries and complaints
from counterparts in all government offices across these spheres.

A skeleton staff complement has already begun working on the correspondence
and enquiries being received. We are already experiencing an increase in
correspondence volumes, from an average of about 300 letters around April,
to about 700 as we speak, for the month of June alone.

Hon Speaker, for most South Africans, government is the administrative
clerk they see when they go to apply for a government document or any other
service. We wish to reiterate, therefore, that government must improve its
performance in frontline services and substantially reduce waiting periods
in order to enhance service delivery.

Government departments that provide services directly to the public should
also clearly specify the standard of service citizens should expect,
including the appropriate behaviour of officials. They must outline the
waiting periods and the quality of service, and the mechanisms of redress
should those standards not be met.

We must also implement and monitor the decision that staff dealing directly
with the public should wear name tags to ensure a more personal connection
with the public. [Applause.] This will enable members of the public to
provide the names of officials in the event of compliments or complaints.

These are just some of the improvements we can implement in order to make
the lives of South Africans less stressful and costly.

We must emphasise that we are also aware of the difficulties under which
some public servants work, especially health care workers, the police and
others who work long hours under difficult conditions. We are committed to
improving their working environment.

Hon members, we outlined most of our international plans in the state of
the nation address, and others were outlined by the Minister of
International Relations and Co-operation in that department’s Budget Vote
debate. We will touch on just a few of these.

South Africa will continue to participate in international forums and to
deepen our relations with regions and nations of the world.

Our intention is to advance the implementation of the Nepad, improve the
regional climate for growth and development, as well as place the
developmental requirements of the continent on the global agenda.

We will continue to promote developmental partnerships with other countries
of the continent. We will also prioritise regional integration.

We will play our role in strengthening the AU and its structures and
promote the implementation of the African Peer Review Mechanism.

We will continue to assist in peacekeeping operations and in the
reconstruction and development of the African continent. We will promote
the entrenchment of democratic forms of government and respect for human
rights on the African continent and in other parts of the world.

Within southern Africa, we plan to play an active role in efforts aimed at
strengthening SADC. As the current chair of SADC, we will continue to
support the inclusive government in Zimbabwe and render whatever assistance
our capacity allows.

We urge countries of the developed North to join the continent in assisting
the people of Zimbabwe to lift themselves out of the socioeconomic
difficulties they face.

We will also play our role in supporting the SADC-appointed facilitator in
Madagascar, former President Joaquim Chissano, and his team. A sustainable
solution needs to be found to resolve the impasse in that country.

Further afield, it is in South Africa’s interest to ensure that the current
momentum within the G20 is maintained and that it does not only focus on
efforts to mitigate the current global crisis.

All of us know that the undemocratic and inequitable nature of the
institutions and systems of global economic governance forms part of the
real underlying causes of this crisis.

We will continue to work with countries and organisations of the developing
south to deal with these and other global matters. For us, the strategic
partnership with India, Brazil and China constitutes a critical pillar of
our international relations. As such, we see it as very important that the
Ibsa agreements and action plans are implemented.

Hon members, the past few days have demonstrated our  passion  for  football
as well as our track record as good hosts. We gave our word,  as  a  people,
that the 2009 Fifa Confederations Cup would be a huge  success.  [Applause.]
Working together as a nation and as a  continent,  we  have  delivered.  The
tournament is going exceptionally well. As in all dress rehearsals, we  have
learnt valuable lessons, and we are certain that the 2010 Soccer  World  Cup
will be even more successful.

The Deputy President, as Chairperson of the 2010 Interministerial
Committee, will lead our efforts towards making this initiative one that
the world will not forget for many years to come.

May I take this opportunity to wish Bafana Bafana well in the game with
Brazil tomorrow night. [Applause.] The nation will be behind them. We can
be surprised by the Brazilians, did you know that? [Laughter.]

As good hosts, let us also support all  other  games  and  all  other  teams
until the end of the tournament.

Hon Speaker, let me emphasise that we want to work with all political
parties and all sectors of society to successfully fight poverty and to
build a prosperous South Africa whose people, black and white, live in
harmony.
We also want to work with all political parties, all sectors and all our
public servants to build a government that is responsive, interactive and
effective.

Masibambisane sakhe uhulumeni olalela maqede aphendule, oxhumanayo nabantu,
nowenza into ebonakalayo. [Let us work together and build the government
that listens and answers, which liaises with people and does tangible
things.]

Working together, we shall do more to meet our mandate.

Let me use this opportunity to thank the Deputy President and the Ministers
in the Presidency, the Director-General, advisors, senior management, as
well as all the staff members for their support. We have made a good start
and we are looking forward to excellent teamwork in the Presidency as we
perform our tasks at the apex of our system of government.

It is my honour to commend the Budget of the Presidency for 2009-10 to this
august House. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you, hon President, hon Deputy
President, hon Speaker, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. The
President’s vision and comprehensive plan set out in this address and
endorsement of Nepad has amplified Seme’s idea of the regeneration of
Africa.

Whilst addressing the Oratory Contest at the University of Columbia in
1905, Dr Pixley Isaka Ka Seme spoke on the regeneration of Africa. In this
address, Seme called for a unique civilisation for Africa and Africans.

Like his contemporaries, such as W E Du Bois and  Marcus  Garvey,  Seme  was
inspired by the glories of ancient Ethiopia and Egypt. In this regard,  Seme
exclaimed that –

   All the glory of Egypt belongs to Africa and her people. These  monuments
   are the indestructible memories of their great and original genius.

Marcus Garvey also made the regeneration of  Africa  a  rallying  point  for
Africa and her Diaspora. In 1914, Marcus Garvey  established  the  Universal
Negro Improvement Association in Harlem, New York, for  the  advancement  of
the regeneration of Africa. Seme and Garvey’s ideas for the regeneration  of
Africa found practical expression in the Harlem Renaissance.

The literary and cultural awakening, called the Harlem Renaissance, brought
more attention to the African Diaspora. In its own way, the Harlem
Renaissance was an African consciousness movement, which started with the
Prince Hall Masonic Movement and the Ethiopian Church Movement.

The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s witnessed a remarkable flowering of
creative energies by African writers seeking inspiration from and
celebrating their African heritage. Among black writers such as Du Bois,
the period of the Harlem Renaissance was a time of African rediscovery.

Two founding fathers of African democracy, Kwame Nkrumah and Nnamdi
Azikiwe, were profoundly influenced by the Harlem Renaissance. Nkrumah
attended Universal Negro Improvement Association, Unia, meetings in Harlem
during his student days in the US. In his autobiography, Azikiwe testifies
to the influence that Garvey had on his political development. Azikiwe,
like Seme, also validated Africa’s regeneration, drawing attention to its
remarkable past.

In 1937, Azikiwe published a book, entitled Renascent Africa, which was
another important landmark in this gradual rediscovery of a history that
had been forcibly denied, and therefore forgotten during the colonial
period when massive exploitation of the country’s human and natural
resources went hand in hand with a refusal to honour and respect its
cultural movements.

Azikiwe refused to accept that Africa’s culture had been blighted forever
by the impact of European imperialism and remained focused on achieving
moral and social regeneration through the triumph of democracy, ensuring
mental emancipation through a rejection of racism and striving for economic
prosperity through self-determination.

During the 1940s and 1950s, many African leaders, including our leaders,
Nelson Mandela, OR Tambo, John Nkadimeng and Walter Sisulu, also developed
African regeneration ideas. The African Renaissance, just like the European
Renaissance, was underpinned by humanist principles that the hon President
called upon us to rediscover and make the cornerstone of our desired
cohesive, caring and sustainable communities.

The ANC elevated humanist principles to its national vision by  setting  the
strategic objective of creating a nonracial, nonsexist,  united,  democratic
and prosperous South Africa in which the value of every citizen is  measured
by our shared humanity.  In 1997, our icon, Nelson  Mandela,  observed  that
African religion has enriched  humanity’s  spiritual  heritage  through  the
spirit of Ubuntu, that profound maxim  “I  am  through  others”,  or  “I  am
because we are”.

The principles of equality, freedom and justice for all that  are  enshrined
in our Constitution are inherent in this  spiritual  philosophy  of  ubuntu.
Thus, the human rights culture that the hon President referred to is  not  a
foreign  concept  but  an  important  part  of  our  cultural  heritage  and
tradition. The  African  regeneration  of  Seme  is  firmly  rooted  in  his
assertion “I am an African”, which was later  adopted  by  former  President
Thabo Mbeki.

Accordingly, African regeneration is founded on the idea of a cultural and
economic rebirth and renewal, based on Africa’s extraordinary history of
past achievements, especially with reference to Africa’s cultural heritage.
The beginning of our rebirth and renewal as a country and as a continent
must not only be centred on the rediscovery of our humanity, but also on
our past glories.

In his speech in Tunisia in the early 1990s, our icon for liberation,
Nelson Mandela, lamented the destruction of the African city of Carthage by
the Romans and placed in the foreground other African achievements
symbolised by the monuments, such as Axum in Ethiopia and Great Zimbabwe.
Here at home, we have heritage sites such as Mapungubwe, Lwandali, also
known as Tshiendeulu, Thulamela, Nahakwe, Ga-Kaditshwene, Ntsoanatsatsi,
rock paintings of the San and others, which share the same cosmology,
history and heritage with all indigenous cultures of Southern Africa and
North East Africa.

We have diminished heritages and languages such as Isipondo, Khelobedu,
Isintwana and Northern Ndebele, which could throw light on and deepen
African cultural unity and diversity. Viewer support for cultural,
religious and linguistic communities, in particular, will ensure that these
traditional communities may become part of the mainstream and contribute to
the development of a new African mission on the southern tip of this
continent.

Historically, our human values have been derived from our national  identity
and heritage. Our quest for service delivery must be informed by our  values
for human development underpinned by an aspect of who we are  as  a  people.
This calls for the promotion of the use of indigenous knowledge systems  and
languages to achieve our rural development objectives.

For example, indigenous spiritual and agricultural calendars are very
important, hon Nkwinti, because even if people have not been to school,
they know that September is the time to prepare to go ...

... babuyele emasimini bayolima [back to the fields to plough]...

... so that they can  have  guaranteed  food  security.  Instead  of  taking
people to universities just to understand the calendar,  I  think  from  our
indigenous cultures, we can educate the  people  without  spending  time  at
school. [Applause.]

In September last year, the hon President reminded us that we should go
back to ploughing. The President also congratulated various religious
bodies, like the Hindus, Muslims and practitioners of African religions who
were celebrating their new year in September, which means that the
overwhelming majority of the people in this country who are believers,
believe that the new year is in September, and they celebrate it and it
reminds them that it is the time to plough. So if we want to speed up rural
development, hon Minister Nkwinti, I think using these traditional cultures
can help us.

In April, many religious formations hold their spiritual celebrations and
indigenous communities also celebrate their spiritual wellbeing during this
time.

Initiation schools for indigenous communities usually begin in May, which
is the same time as when most religious formations perform their spiritual
practices.

We have sacred spaces such as Motoulong in the Free State, which are used
by Sotho-, Zulu- and Xhosa-speaking people subscribing to Apostolic,
Zionist and African religions for worship and initiation. This is a classic
example of the convergence of different cultural and religious groups
united in diversity.

South Africans and African people, in particular, have a common history and
heritage, which provides us with the means to create an overarching South
African national identity and cultural unity in diversity.

In our quest to build a nonracial, nonsexist, united and democratic South
Africa, we should not forget that Africa is the cradle of all humanity that
was fragmented and dispersed to different parts of the globe and later
returned as Afrikaners, Indians, Africans and Khoisan, to mention but a
few.

The Mapungubwe and Zimbabwe cosmology, history and heritage, which have
been rediscovered, show substantive identity with their ancient Ethiopian,
Egyptian and Roman counterparts from which Europe derived its civilisation.
Working together, both black and white, we can rediscover our cultural
unity in diversity and forge an overarching national identity and common
vision.

We recently adopted the Unesco Convention on the Revitalization of
Intangible Heritage, which provides a global platform for the regeneration
of Africa as well as the rediscovery, preservation and development of
diminished heritages and languages.

It is therefore the prerogative of the ANC government and all members of
our society to harness commonalities between various cultures in order to
build an overarching culture that unifies and gives us a common identity
without compromising our diversity. This justifies the need for a
Presidential programme on moral and social education, which could
accelerate the infusion of progressive values in our children. On many
occasions, the hon President has called for social education to deal with
the deepening moral regeneration in our society. Now is the time for your
administration to consider implementing this.

The implementation of our infrastructural development program me should
also include the rehabilitation of facilities in rural areas, townships and
missionary schools so that these could be used as centres for social
education and moral regeneration.

The endorsement of the ANC Manifesto by a decisive majority of our people
signifies confidence in the ANC’s vision of promoting humanistic principles
in its approach to meeting its key priorities on education, fighting crime,
health, job creation and rural development. For instance, when we talk
about crime, we must not focus solely on the police and courts, but we
should also emphasise social education during childhood, which would assist
young people to be responsible citizens of good moral standing.

It is in this context that Seme and Garvey’s ideas on the regeneration of
Africa and Africans remain relevant in guiding the partnership for
reconstruction, development and progress that the hon President announced
in his inauguration. The partnership provides all of us, both black and
white, with an opportunity to work together, not only for the rediscovery
of our humanity, but also for holistic development including spiritual and
material human development.

The National Interfaith Leaders’ Movement born out of the hon President’s
inclusive approach to social cohesion and nation building, has endorsed the
idea of holistic human development and is ready to be part of this
important partnership.

In this Budget Vote, the hon President very ably demonstrated that his
quest and that of the ANC to create decent jobs, provide quality and
affordable health and education, develop rural areas and create cohesive,
caring and sustainable communities is part of an integrated and
comprehensive plan to improve the quality of life of all South Africans,
both black and white.

All of us in this House are acutely aware that the hon President criss-
crossed the length and breadth of our country to seek a common mandate and
invited all South Africans to participate in the development of the ANC
manifesto.  The President’s plan is therefore a product of wide
consultation and working together with people from different sectors of our
society.

Last but not least: the decisive victory that the people of South Africa
gave to the hon President and our glorious organisation, the ANC, to lead
and build a government which is interactive and responsive and will promote
the common good of the nation as a whole, is understandable; a nation
rooted in the spiritual, moral and social values of the founders of our
democracy.

It is for this reason that we remain forever indebted to the Congress of
the People that met in Kliptown on 26 June 1955 to adopt the Freedom
Charter - the cornerstone of our democratic culture and values. [Applause.]


We shall forever celebrate this day to deepen and entrench our democracy
because the progressive values and principles embodied in the Freedom
Charter became the building blocks of the 1996 Constitution, which is now
hailed as one of the best constitutions in the world.

In conclusion, let me acknowledge that ANC MPs are reaping the benefits of
the hon President’s inclusive approach and co-operation with other
political parties. We have cordial relations and have begun to work
together for the common good of the nation, as the hon President urged us
to do.

The ANC is fully supportive of the Budget Vote for the Presidency because
it is crafted for a good national cause, which will serve the interest of
all of us without discrimination. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,
honoured guests, and my predecessor, Tony Leon, much water has flowed under
the proverbial bridge since this budget was conceived and allocated to your
office, Mr President. During a recession the adage of cutting one’s cloth
according to what one can afford is the most prudent thing to do, as you
yourself said.

In this case, however, you have done the opposite. To a certain extent,
though, it is to be expected when a new President comes into office that he
or she will have different priorities, strategies and implementation plans;
but your plans are beyond your current budget.

Not only have you chosen an enormous Cabinet that appears to owe its
existence to a not-too-unapparent appeasement strategy, but you have also
created two surrogate departments within your own office. The planning and
monitoring commissions are not headed by lightweight or junior Ministers.
They will therefore develop an appetite for already scarce financial
management resources in your office. The funding proposals and actual
mandates of these two departments need to be very clearly explained and
understood by all.

The cost of service delivery in this country is already excessively high
due to the fact that cadre deployment and the expunging of the public
service of the previous regime have left us with a corps of public
officials that are not adequately skilled and equipped to perform their
functions effectively. [Interjections.] This has led to us having to employ
and fund, effectively, a dual public service which is made up of
consultants.

These people are effectively the expunged former public servants corps that
now advises government on how to do things. This is not very clever
because, firstly, they don’t come cheap, and they don’t transfer skills
because it is highly unlikely that consultants will consult themselves out
of a job! [Interjections.] Secondly, they don’t trust government because
government put them out on the street.

My question today is: Who, actually, is governing South Africa? I know, hon
President, that you are the president of the ANC and the President of this
country; undisputed, but one must ask why it appears that the tail is
wagging the dog. Why do new Cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers,
affiliate union organisations, political parties and your own youth league
seem to feel that they have the right to pull the purse strings and
manipulate the agenda of your government?

The secretary-general of the ANC is not the director-general of the
government, and unless there is a clear separation of powers between the
ANC and your government, you will become a marionette controlled by those
who believe that you are a dispensable tool.

Your one or two-term tenure debate is instructive in this regard. I
caution, Mr President, that you not be fooled - because we are not fooled
by people like Minister Shiceka, who say one thing and mean something else.
He says, for example, “South Africa is one country with one leader, and no
one is expected to be out of tune.” Not only is this patently
unconstitutional, but it smacks of double-speak and the worst kind of
obfuscation.

This obfuscation was exposed for what it is by the Minister’s
acknowledgement this week that the ANC government intends to scrap
provinces and that it is forging ahead with the Constitution Seventeenth
Amendment Bill.

The DA unequivocally opposes both these measures that threaten to undermine
our constitutional democracy and we will not allow the ANC to stop us
governing in a province that we won in a free and fair election.
[Applause.]

If you allow your party and its interests to trump the interests of the
people, if corruption and incompetence are tolerated and overlooked, and if
the Constitution is considered secondary to the political purposes of the
ruling party, this will threaten our constitutional democracy. When one
views the current basket of proposed legislation in its entirety, it is
clear that there is a systematic assault on our constitutional democracy.

Allow me to raise some concerns about some of the proposed pieces of
legislation; but my concerns are not limited to these examples. There is a
series of Bills on the judiciary which, collectively, undermine its
independence, increase the executive’s ability to define its nature and
impose the political agenda of the ANC upon this institution.

The proposed Seventeenth constitutional amendment bill that I referred to
earlier, seeks to centralise power in the hands of the executive, which is
now apparently held to account by Gwede Mantashe in Luthuli House and the
monitoring commission under Collins Chabane – Minister Chabane.

The single Public Service legislation threatens the ability of municipal
councils and provincial governments to determine and implement their own
policies and practices when it comes to their employees; instead it
centralises this power at the national level, thereby empowering the ANC
government to force its own policies on these spheres of government.

The Bill proposing a national health insurance scheme, which will destroy
what is actually working by bringing all health services to the lowest
level instead of addressing the core problems in the health sector, will
compromise access to proper health care even further for the poor. Then
there is the Expropriation Bill, which seeks to empower the relevant
Minister to intervene directly in land reform by doing away with the
constitutional pillar of willing buyer, willing seller.

In most fields of government, the ANC seems hell-bent on diminishing the
independence of civil society and those institutions designed to support
the state. In education, the state now seeks to deploy teachers as it does
doctors, nurses and the police. Then you wonder why there is an outflow of
people from these critical posts!

The National Health Amendment Bill proposes that the Minister may determine
where a doctor may practise and how much he may charge. The Built
Environment Amendment Bill will prevent the engineering industry from being
self-regulating. [Interjections.] They are coming, because where there is
smoke there is fire. Even when you deny that they are coming, they’re
coming, Minister Manuel.

Elsewhere, independent boards such as nursing councils and school-governing
bodies are having their right to decide on their own course of action
curtailed or even stopped. And, incidentally, as to the question, Minister
Manuel, about where these Bills are: Let me tell you, every single time we
hear of a Bill that is coming -“iyafika”. [It arrives.]

As this power becomes more and more centralised with an ever-growing
administration, the Cabinet grows and expands its bureaucracy with the
following consequences. Firstly, the lives of ordinary South Africans
become increasingly dependent upon and influenced by the state. Secondly,
the ability of state entities to provide proper services declines due to a
bloated bureaucracy, and these are renowned for being inefficient. The
collapse of the SABC is a classic case in point.

These two consequences will ultimately result in a passive citizenry that
becomes more and more frustrated by poor service delivery. This is a recipe
for unrest that we cannot afford in South Africa.

Mr President, you must rein in the ANC's tripartite alliance partners'
insatiable desire for centralised control. This is not a "gogga maak vir
baba bang" [frightening] story or "rooi gevaar" [“red peril”] story. It is
a fact, if you look at all the pieces of this impending and existing
legislation.

This is essentially why we have a Parliament, so that the representatives
of the people can convene to consider all legislation proposed by
government, so that we can provide oversight of the executive and hold the
government to account. That is our responsibility. No one voted on 22 April
2009 to have a one-party state that controls all aspects of civil society
with a rigor mortis hand that controls everything in a deathly grip.

Mr President, our nation and its people need to be led and governed with
respect. Their independence is sacred, and our Constitution sacrosanct.
Your early undertaking to uphold the Constitution, respect our Parliament
and treat the opposition with due consideration is not compatible with
these issues that I have raised today.

What is clear from these issues, though, is that President Zuma’s
administration is being dictated to by the ghost of President Thabo Mbeki’s
administration. Firstly, this is evident in your recent reappointments of
some underperforming Cabinet Ministers, as well as the appointments of two
failed former Cabinet Ministers as your advisers.

Secondly, it is evident in the pieces of legislation that I have mentioned
today. And it is clear that this legislative agenda and its budget before
Parliament do not yet belong to the ANC of President Jacob Zuma.

Mr President, it is imperative that you distance yourself from the failures
of your predecessor. You must become unambiguous about how you intend to
govern and lead this country out of the morass of that era and out of the
trough of recession.

Mr President, the euphoria of an electoral victory has vanished like the
morning mist. Your government must address the issues that affect our
citizens on a daily basis. You must put the citizens first now. And, once
again, Mr President, can I recognise your undertaking and commitment to
working with the opposition? Nathi sithi phezu komkhono. Enkosi. [We also
say that is unattainable. Thank you.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: The President of the Republic, Speaker of the NA, hon
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members, distinguished guests, friends,
ladies and gentlemen and fellow South Africans, I am honoured to have the
opportunity to address the members of the NA on the occasion of the annual
debate of the Budget Vote of the Presidency.

This year’s debate is taking place against the background of the Fifa
Confederations Cup tournament, a prelude to the Fifa 2010 Soccer World Cup,
which our nation will deservedly host. Nevertheless, this event is a
striking expression of confidence in our country’s ability to hold its own
internationally.

In this regard, I wish to take this moment to congratulate Bafana Bafana,
our national soccer team, on reaching the crucial semifinal stage and hope
that they will proceed to win the Confederations Cup tournament, which will
redound to our nation’s credit. [Applause.]

I also wish to congratulate the Bokke on their win against the British and
Irish Lions. [Applause.] I hope that, like Bafana Bafana, they too will
triumph over their opponents. Even though our cricket team choked in the
semifinals of the ICC T20 tournament, everyone agrees that they remain the
team to beat and I am sure our support for them remains as strong as ever.
[Applause.]

In his address, the President of the Republic has clearly restated the
refrain that this fourth democratic government is a caring government.
Inspired by this vision, government seeks to build strong and durable
social partnerships, confident that only through dialogue and consultation
can we advance towards our goals of growth and development as a nation. To
this end the Presidency seeks to lead by example, given its place at the
head of our system of governance, so that working together we can do more
to achieve our goals.

A key area of work of the Presidency is to give leadership to the
implementation of the soon-to-be-launched Human Resource Development
Strategy. The strategy was canvassed very widely amongst practitioners and
stakeholders and has been welcomed by social partners as a critical
mechanism to address our skills shortages. The Human Resource Development
Strategy will be managed in the Department of Higher Education and
Training.

However, I, as Deputy President, will soon appoint the stakeholder-based
Human Resource Development Council whose purpose is sector mobilisation and
to provide advice on scarce and priority skills in the context of the
priorities set out in the Human Resource Development Strategy.

Poverty continues to be an unsightly stain on the face of our social
landscape. In addition to its dehumanising effect on people, it also
restricts individuals from realising their full potential, and thus robs
society of the immeasurable contribution that these individuals could
otherwise make.

Intensifying efforts against this challenge, the Presidency, working with
the social and economic clusters of government and in consultation with
social partners across the nation, has developed a comprehensive
antipoverty strategy designed to integrate and improve our current efforts
to deal with the unacceptable levels of poverty in our society. At the core
of this strategy is the creation of economic opportunities and empowering
communities and individuals to access these opportunities.

While interventions such as social grants remain a critical element of our
antipoverty efforts, we seek more effectively to bring marginalised
communities into sustainable economic activities. We are in the process of
finalising a concrete action plan which will ensure that the objectives in
the strategy are brought to life in action across the country.

As honourable members may be aware, we also decided that whilst developing
this new approach, we should initiate a war on poverty campaign which puts
into practice an integrated effort directed at the individual households.
The war on poverty brings together a range of national, provincial and
local actors.

Already, the leadership that has been assembled after the elections has
started to intensify this campaign. In particular, the Ministry of Rural
Development and Land Affairs has started work in various parts of the
country, including Giyani in Limpopo, to widen the net of localities where
this campaign will be undertaken, the better to help communities and draw
lessons critical to the actualisation of the comprehensive antipoverty
strategy.

Our Antipoverty Strategy Campaign targets particularly vulnerable sections
in our society, including children, women, youth, people living in rural
areas and urban informal settlements, people with disabilities or chronic
illnesses, as well as the elderly.

Deriving from this experience, proper institutions will be set up
reflecting an integrated service delivery model to ensure that the
antipoverty programme becomes a critical focus of activities among all
national departments and across all the spheres of government.

As part of the implementation of the antipoverty strategy, government will
develop a single central database of affected households and ensure that
interventions are systematic, that individuals with the potential to lift
their families out of poverty are identified and supported accordingly, and
that there is a follow-up on each household so that practical, positive
results come out of each interaction.

As part of fighting poverty, we need to maximise efficiency levels in our
work so as to enhance the chances of achieving our goals. To this end the
recession we are experiencing makes efficiency by government departments
even more urgent so that scarce resources are used optimally. Necessarily,
we will strengthen strategic management and leadership capability across
government to position ourselves better for the challenge of effective
governance. This is all the more important since many ordinary South
Africans are already affected by the pervasive effects of this current
recession.

So far many have lost jobs, houses, vehicles and property or are still
losing these. This state of affairs, if not addressed, will further cause
more lives to sink into poverty. It does not make economic or ethical sense
for government to be spendthrift with its financial management in the face
of this financial menace to the populace.

Part of this prudence we are envisioning in government is to avoid the trap
of overruns in our departmental expenditures. For our antipoverty efforts
to succeed, government needs to ensure at all times that it manages public
resources in a sustainable, effective and competent manner.

Conscious that the current global recession is likely to compound our
struggle against poverty, government has set its sights on the public
investment programme as a key countervailing measure against the negative
effects of this global crisis. Already, R787 billion over the three
financial years to March 2012 will be used in expanding and improving
infrastructure and related facilities. Activities will include maintenance
of current infrastructure, using labour-intensive methods wherever
possible.

As Deputy President, working with other Cabinet colleagues, I will continue
to oversee these efforts. Hon members, as you would know, the Leader of
Government Business fulfils function of aligning and co-ordinating the
programmes of the executive and Parliament, especially around the
processing of legislation.

We recognise the crucial role that Parliament has to play in holding the
executive to account and performing oversight over the workings of
government. We are encouraged that this Parliament is intending to play a
more activist role in this regard. We will ensure that members of the
executive fulfil their constitutional responsibilities towards Parliament
and encourage Ministers to respond promptly to matters raised in reports
adopted by the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.
This applies equally to parliamentary questions and the provision of
regular reports to Parliament or the parliamentary committees on the
activities of their departments.

We recognise the need for Parliament to be provided with an accurate
programme of the Bills that Ministers intend introducing. We are developing
mechanisms to improve the quality of this programme and ensure that
deadlines for introduction are met. We are acutely aware of the importance
of Parliament having sufficient time to consider Bills and to engage with
stakeholders and the public at large in the legislative process.

In order to ensure improved relations between the executive and Parliament,
I will be interacting on a regular basis with the main role-players in
Parliament, in particular the presiding officers, the Whips, the committee
chairs and opposition parties.

Over the years the world has been ravaged by HIV/Aids, a deadly pandemic
that threatens to cut a swathe through developing nations, especially in
Southern Africa. Government remains determined to tackle this mortal threat
head-on. In this regard, the partnership between government, business and
civil society in the fight against HIV/Aids, as well as tuberculosis, needs
to be strengthened.

Through the SA National Aids Council we are expanding the national response
to the HIV/Aids pandemic. We are pleased that all our social partners are
accelerating the implementation of their plans deriving from the National
Strategic Plan of 2007-2011 on HIV/Aids and sexually transmitted
infections. An independent mid-term review of this work is being
commissioned by the Department of Health on behalf of Sanac. We are also
introducing a Sanac sector leaders forum to strengthen feedback mechanisms
and sectoral accountability.

Lest we forget, the message on this pandemic remains the three simple
letters, ABC: abstain, be faithful and condomise. At the same time we
continue to encourage a variety of initiatives to stem the tide of the
pandemic. This includes the provision of antiretroviral treatment, research
on medicines and other measures. As part of this work Sanac has agreed that
we should embark on national consultations on male circumcision, given the
scientific work that has been presented on this issue.

Another challenge in this respect is the lack of capacity of
nongovernmental organisations to obtain funding. Both government and the
private sector within and outside Sanac have to reach out to the nonprofit
sector to arrest funding challenges. We also expect positive funding flows
from the Global Fund application that we have successfully submitted.

Working together, we can and will ensure that these initiatives contribute
to our ultimate goal of creating an HIV/Aids free generation.

Government recognises the important role of traditional leadership as a
salient repository of our customs, history and cultural heritage. By all
accounts the Presidency has been effective in exercising political
oversight over selected affairs of traditional leaders, and this we have
been able to do working in collaboration with the erstwhile Department of
Provincial and Local Government,  now known as Co-operative Governance and
Traditional Affairs, and the National House of Traditional Leaders.

The work of the National House is readily acknowledged for contributing to
the agenda of national unity, development and social cohesion within our
nation. In this regard, let me express government’s appreciation of the
invaluable leadership demonstrated by this august institution. The
Presidency also took an active part in the implementation of the National
Programme of Support for Traditional Leaders, which is meant to standardise
support in all provinces and ensure that clear guidelines are issued at
national level for provinces regarding all matters of support to the
institution of traditional leadership.

We wish to reiterate the President’s commitment that as the Chair of SADC,
South Africa will continue to support the inclusive government in Zimbabwe
and render whatever assistance is requested by the collective Zimbabwean
leadership in order to deal with unresolved matters.

In this context, we note and welcome the pledge by the various governments
across the world to increase their assistance to Zimbabwe.

In concert with the leadership of Zimbabwe, we are convinced that more can
be done to strengthen this support. We also hope that the visit of the IMF
fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe will result in positive engagement in the
future. We have long maintained that for the region to thrive, we need to
push for political and economic cohesion. For this reason, we have
committed ourselves to ensure the implementation of SADC protocols aimed at
improving security and stability; infrastructure, including transport;
public administration and other sectors; and in harmonising industrial
policies.

Moreover, we fully endorse the efforts towards addressing sources of
disagreement among members of the Southern African Customs Union on issues
such as trade policy and revenue sharing.

This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of our diplomatic relations
with the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Through the Binational Commission led
by the deputy heads of state of both countries, we are finalising a
comprehensive programme that will also ensure a people-to-people engagement
through our respective parliaments, as well as academic and business
organisations.

Working with other stakeholders such as the 2010 Local Organising
Committee, we are glad to announce that we have made significant progress
in pursuit of our goal to host a successful 2010 Fifa World Cup.
[Applause.] The oversight visits conducted by members of the Inter-
Ministerial Committee have helped us ensure that we meet our deadlines, not
least to speed up the infrastructure programme.

However, we need to take into account the difficulties identified with a
view to resolving them as soon as possible. This includes arresting budget
overruns by host cities, especially in the current economic environment, so
as to ensure that our expenditure is within budget. We are, however,
confident that the economic benefits flowing from the 2010 Fifa World Cup
competition will soften some of the cutting effects of this economic
crisis.

We have noted concerns regarding delays experienced in Mpumalanga over the
construction of the Mbombela Stadium. We continue to interact with the
affected parties in an urgent bid to resolve all outstanding matters.

We have also started to pay focused attention to all the 2010 legacy
projects so that the facilities are used for the maximum benefit of our
people and our country beyond 2010. For instance, it is part of our role to
ascertain the processing of the post-2010 stadium maintenance programme
which will assist us in sustaining the quality and standards of our
stadiums.

If anything was needed to confirm our country’s readiness to host the Fifa
2010 World Cup, the Confederations Cup now under way has demonstrated that
we are on course to meet our objectives and surpass the expectations of the
global football fraternity. Indeed, the Confederations Cup has also helped
us identify areas that require improvement, the better to deliver the best
World Cup ever.

We are also convinced that our national soccer team, Bafana Bafana,
building on recent successes, will continue improving with time so that,
come 2010, they can make a handsome return on the nation’s material and
emotional investment in them.

As South Africans we share not only a common territory but also a
historical identity that defines our nationhood. Spurred on by our fourth
democratic elections as a nascent democracy, we are determined to pull out
all the stops to expedite the process to build a united, nonracial,
nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.

Working together, we are confident of realising this long cherished goal. I
thank you for your attention. [Applause.]

Rev H M DANDALA: Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,
Ministers, Deputy Ministers and hon members, we congratulate you, Mr
President, that your government has rapidly started working with many of
your Ministers getting their heads around their various departments.

While the most pressing issues facing our people are unemployment and
poverty in the face of a recession, we believe that amongst the most
crucial tasks facing your particular office are nation- building, turning
the many promises made into practical reality for our people and the
building of a value system that will guide our national life to realise the
South African dream.

Mr President, we note the honourable goals behind the restructuring of your
government, but we would wish to caution that the increased size of
government is a source of great concern, especially given the recession. We
would need an indication of how much more state resources will be deployed
to make the new Ministries and departments that you have established
function.

In the face of calls by government to citizens to tighten their belts to
deal with the recession, we believe that in spite of the increased size,
the government should lead by example.

On more programmatic matters, your presidency is substantially different
and the current budget will need very tight management. Cope supports the
Budget Vote with a firm understanding that this will be adjusted to meet
the changes envisaged by the new structure of the current Presidency.

Cope notes the President’s emphasis that the socioeconomic assistance of
each district or metro will seek to assist those areas to exploit their
potential. This is noble, yet as our Constitution reflects, South Africa is
an incredibly diverse society. Integrated planning has the potential to
facilitate and encourage the resourcefulness of a country’s citizens. On
the other hand, it can respond to its own logic, centralise itself to
command and regiment without regard to any active, unfolding realities.

South Africans need to be constantly assured that government’s new planning
approach will not amount to that. Cope will thus assist to observe that
central planning does not stifle innovation and does not slow down service
delivery; as it is, the wheels of government are already known for turning
notoriously slowly. What the country needs is something that will change
this reality.

In the same vein, care should be taken that integrated planning does not
negatively affect the economy. One already feels that different players
wish to exert undue pressure on certain prices, interest rates and exchange
rates. We have noted the intention to ensure that the relationship between
the planning commission, the Ministries of Finance, Economic Development
and Trade and Industry is carefully co-ordinated. We support this to avert
a situation where dangerous duplications may be engendered and considerable
confusion caused in the minds of the investors.

Cope envisages a distributed planning instrument in which facilitation and
co-ordination channel energies towards desired ends, and in which
initiative is vested in individual Ministries with internalised monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms. Such an arrangement would be more sensitive to
the needs of different regions, provincially and locally. The planning
Ministry would then concern itself with high-level co-ordination and
reporting. This is what is desired in the spirit of our Constitution, and
we will await the tabling of the Green Paper so as to assist in shaping the
content of your plans.

Regarding nation-building, we welcome the commitment of the President to
strengthen partnership with society and political parties represented in
Parliament. In this regard, we are concerned at the continuing blurring of
lines between the state and party, as we sadly witnessed on June 16. We
believe this has to stop. South African people want to acknowledge the
important historical days of their nationhood without feeling bulldozed
into partisan events.

The President is a President for all South Africans, and not the President
of some and not others. Our Constitution is very clear about the duties and
responsibilities of the national executive. We need assurance that we will
not have a situation of the blurring of the lines between party and state.
We wish to be assured that you will be committed in this task and we, as
Cope, will support you in seeking to achieve this goal.
We will support the Presidency in seeking to ensure that the hard- won
civil liberties and the country’s well-developed human rights culture will
not be eroded in the name of national security.

We need the President's assurance that state resources are not used for
party political purposes such as the surveillance of opposition parties and
private individuals. [Applause.] We will be taking up the harassment of our
members by state organs through the police and we hope that these will be
investigated and brought to a halt.
The nation needs to be assured that institutions such as the judiciary and
the media are safe under your watch and will stay independent.

Finally, we have noted your commitment to fighting corruption in the Public
Service and we wish to encourage you. We strongly affirm your determination
in this regard, especially as it affects ordinary citizens, as you have
indicated.

We would like to believe that the action of the Premier of Gauteng, who has
let an MEC resign over of the misuse of public resources, is the first sign
of the fulfilment of this commitment by the Presidency. This is necessary
for the introduction of a new culture of accountability in our politics.

On the other hand, the ongoing saga of the arms deal continues to eat at
the heart of our body politic. Hasn’t the time come for the President to
bite the bullet and appoint an independent judicial commission of inquiry
to deal with this matter decisively and transparently? It does not help the
morale of the nation to keep hearing allegations of new evidence and
denials if this whole process is not reopened and dealt with openly. We
believe that this will put the saga to bed, once and for all.

Cope will indeed continue to call for a value-centred society across all
facets of our national life and we will support you in doing this. Thank
you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: Madam Deputy Speaker, this Excellency our President,
this Excellency the Deputy President, hon Ministers, hon colleagues, I wish
to congratulate the President on delivering his first Budget Vote.

The Presidency is, as it has been memorably put by President Roosevelt, the
bully pulpit of the nation. The success of our common endeavours depends
upon the success of the Presidency in discharging its sacred duties. The
Presidency, I believe, enjoys the understanding and warm support of the
people, which is essential to victory.

By virtue of being Head of State, you are our President across the
political divides. And this was the reason, Your Excellency, and the House
will recall, why I tried to defend the dignity of your predecessor,
President Thabo Mbeki, when he was being denigrated in this House while he
was the face of South Africa and undergoing his shameful, unceremonious
defenestration.

Whilst it is important to travel in hope, as RL Stevenson memorably puts
it, I think it is tantamount to political suicide to give people false hope
merely because we consider the truth too difficult a pill for them to
swallow.

While we should not abandon our optimism in the midst of these challenges,
we dare not lure our people into a fool’s paradise, for they will turn
against us once the sober reality dawns. Only a foolish optimist can deny
the dark realities of the moment. So on this day we should not shrink from
honestly facing conditions in our country today. We welcome the noble
aspirations contained in the 12 policy priority areas, Mr President, but we
do question how they will be achieved. The maxim, “less is more” could
apply to the present hour.

The government will battle to deliver on its promises because South Africa
has gone into recession, as has been emphasised this afternoon, for the
first time since 1992, following a sharp decline in the manufacturing and
mining sectors. The Economist magazine recently designated South Africa as
the most risky emerging market.

I therefore contend that the Presidency must practise economic growth and
bat for South Africa at every opportunity. Our President, I believe, has
all the attributes to make a fine batsman for South Africa, so we would
like to ask how the Presidency and, in particular, the newly-created
National Planning Commission, will bolster the government’s efforts to
promote South African goods and services.

As a traditional leader I must applaud this government’s creation of the
Ministry of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, and I further
wish to congratulate the President for appointing Mr Shiceka in this
portfolio. Many of us who knew him were very delighted that that was your
choice, but I noted yesterday that the Co-operative Minister, the hon
Shiceka, was quoted as saying that South Africa is one country with one
President and “no one is expected to be out of tune” when briefing
journalists about the possibilities of provinces being scrapped.

Whilst one would normally be discomfited by such a Stalinesque sentiment
and hope that the Presidency will staunchly defend our hard-won
constitutional settlement, one perhaps would not mind if it was applied to
the government’s economic strategy.  But one must remember that the first
custodian of our Constitution is the President. We are all custodians of
our Constitution, but the very first one who must protect it is the
President.

With the creation of the National Planning Commission and reconfiguration
of a number of key Ministries with overlapping competencies, the IFP
believes it is vital that the economic policy is seen to be shaped and led
by the President and that the Presidency speaks with a unified voice. There
are, alas, too many voices off stage, and off key, at the moment.

I must, however, hasten to say that this is not peculiar to your
Presidency. I am sure that you will recall that when both of us were in
President Mbeki’s Cabinet and the government unveiled its macroeconomic
strategy of Gear, that the members of the tripartite alliance were shouting
all over the country “Asiyifuni iGear!” [We don’t want Gear!] [Laughter.]

So, the point, Your Excellency, that I am making is that the multiplicity
of voices in the ranks of the ruling party today is creating a Tower of
Babel situation, which is leading to unnecessary uncertainty in the
country. It creates doubts. The recession can be likened to a time of war
where the patriotism of all colleagues across the political divides is
being sorely tested. One naturally does not expect all political parties to
sing from the same hymn sheet, but we can at least sing certain bars of our
song of survival in unison.

Time only allows me to touch upon one aspect of this issue. Whilst I
realise that mining is not a direct line function of the Presidency, it
should be a matter of grave concern to the government that the South
African mining production contracted a staggering 32,8% in the first
quarter of 2009, which led to a 6,4% decline in GDP.

Again, we would be interested to know if the National Planning Commission
will work with the Department of Mining to review urgently, if I may
emphasise, the recently published, misnamed Codes of Good Practice for the
mining industry.

These codes, we contend, not only run contrary to international best
practice, but also impose a straitjacket on the industry in the midst of
the global financial crisis and place South Africa, I think, at a distinct
disadvantage to other important African mining destinations, such as Ghana
and Botswana.

On the sunnier side, the construction sector is thriving because of the
upcoming World Cup, as has been said this afternoon, but this, of course,
will end with the completion of the new stadiums. One of the Presidency’s
priority areas is to ensure the effective oversight of the implementation
of the government’s 2010 World Cup commitments. And we congratulate the
government on the progress they have made so far. We were delighted to
learn that there is a possibility that President Barack Obama may attend
the opening ceremony.

However, we would like to know what the Presidency’s long-term strategic
plans are to take advantage of this event to market the country as a
destination of choice, and to use the stadiums long after the tournament.

I was very pleased by the remarks that were made by the Deputy President
that the Presidency is looking beyond 2010 as far as that is concerned.
After all, the Catalonia region of Spain enjoyed a cultural and economic
renaissance after the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. Could there be a boost
for South Africa? Only, we say, if we can act quickly now.

There is no unsolvable problem if you face it wisely and courageously, and
we look to the President to lead us with discipline and vision. We wish him
well.

The IFP supports the Presidency’s Budget Vote. Nxamalala, siyabonga.
[Nxamalala We thank you.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND EVALUATION AND
ADMINISTRATION IN THE PRESIDENCY: Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the
President and Deputy President, members of the executive, hon members of
the House, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I was nearly tempted
to begin to respond to some of the issues that have been raised by members
of the opposition, but, hopefully, over the next five years we will have
time to deal with those issues.

Today I am once again privileged to address hon members during the tabling
of the budget of yet another critical component of our government, the new
Ministry of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation.

It is important to highlight that the birth of this Ministry was a
deliberate response to the needs and aspirations of millions of South
Africans who, through their ballots, gave us an opportunity to govern the
country.

In the 2009 general elections, our people reaffirmed their confidence in
the policies of this government and renewed our mandate in the hope that
these policies will help to improve their lives for the better.

Given the responsibilities placed on our shoulders by the electorate, it
can no longer be business as usual. Our priority will be to strengthen and
stimulate the performance of government in a relentless effort to ensure
that government programmes yield the desired outcomes.

This will necessitate that we change our approach by consistently assessing
the performance of our initiatives in all spheres of government.
Accordingly, this will help government to continuously improve its service
delivery capacity, while promoting accountability on the part of those
charged with the responsibility to deliver.

While we have performed reasonably well in rolling out government’s
programmes and initiatives since 1994, we are the first to acknowledge that
the state has not performed as optimally as we desired. As a result, we are
more determined than ever before to improve the quality and standards of
the services we deliver to our people. This can only be successful if we
have efficient monitoring and evaluation machinery within government to
assess the impact we make in key priority areas.

In rolling out our duties in terms of monitoring and evaluation, we will
develop a set of 30 to 40 main outcome indicators, which will be determined
by the Presidency and the Cabinet on the basis of the government’s
priorities. These will comprise politically determined policy outcomes upon
which the mandate of our government is based. As a result, we will then
develop simple and straightforward measures to assess whether we are indeed
achieving those outcomes.

It is our intention to ascertain that all government departments involved
are alerted beforehand about the type of assessments undertaken in relation
to their work. This will ensure that they work hard to meet the set
delivery targets in a quest to improve the broader performance of the
service delivery machinery of government.

We must bear in mind that this assessment is not only an internal measure
within government. Through this process, we also want to bring our people
on board to ensure that they are continuously aware of the progress we are
making and the challenges we face in the implementation of government’s
programme of action.

In this context, we will avail members of the public of all the results of
our assessments in a bid to promote transparency and accountability. As
part of our work, we will also identify the type of activities per sector
that are required to produce positive results needed in that particular
sector.

This will help us ensure that we introduce the necessary plans and
mechanisms with great potential to assist us with meeting the set targets
in that particular sector. Therefore this will be a twofold process in that
we will put systems in place and then expect departments to meet the
deadlines.

We have already started collaborating with key public institutions with a
wide range of expertise. We will also use more of the expertise in
universities and other institutions. These institutions will play a crucial
role in helping us identify the measures needed to improve the performance
of government programmes. Consequently, the Ministry will put in place
measures to check whether all the required activities do take place in our
departments – that we are indeed focusing our energies on activities that
will ensure change.

This culture of performance will be inculcated within the executive and the
administration. In this regard, we will design a performance contract
between the President and the Ministers, all of us. This contract will
primarily outline the required performance in two or three policy outcome
areas and indicate, per outcome, the measurements of success.

On a quarterly basis, the executive will report back on the basis of a
straightforward one-page report card. Therefore, in discussion with the
Ministers, the President will provide feedback and guidance with a view to
assisting in removing the identified obstacles, if any, to ensure improved
performance and delivery.

As political heads of respective departments, the Ministers will also sign
delivery agreements with their officials with regard to activities and
plans to stimulate delivery as well as the required outputs. For this
reason, we are confident that this endeavour will help government reward
good performance and detect bad performance as early as possible to ensure
that corrective measures are implemented. We must outline that our initial
focus in monitoring and evaluation will be to develop a performance
management system for the seven priorities of basic education, health,
safety, rural development, housing, job creation strategies and public
sector capacity.

The outcome measures and accountability matrix for these priority areas
will be discussed by Cabinet towards the end of July this year. This will
pave the way for a concept paper and a draft Green Paper on the enhanced
monitoring and evaluation and performance management system, which will be
ready by the end of September.

Beyond these seven priorities, the usual monitoring through the
government’s programme of action will continue. In a quest to enhance the
output of our work, the Presidency is in the process of establishing a
service delivery unit, whose task will be to ensure that incidents of
nondelivery and blockages are turned around. Consequently, the Presidency
will also source outside capacity and management expertise on turnaround
strategies, whose knowledge will help our strategies yield a positive
impact.

In terms of the required data to inform the performance management system,
this will have to be carefully chosen and verified. For this reason, The
Presidency will soon launch a major project on piloting the data
architecture of the government administrative systems and available
datasets.

Another critically important task of this Ministry is to oversee activities
relating to the development and empowerment of young people in our country.
As we all know, our government has ushered in a new dawn in the trajectory
of youth development through the launch of the National Youth Development
Agency, NYDA, this year on National Youth Day, June 16.

Among other things, it will fast-track the implementation of government
programmes that affect young people in areas of entrepreneurship, skills
development, education, rural development, health, as well as the fight
against crime. In all these efforts, the NYDA will lobby various
stakeholders in civil society, business and government to ensure a generic
and common approach to issues of youth development in South Africa.

Necessarily, this will require that additional funding be appropriated
during the adjustment process in order to complete the merger of the
collapsed institutions and strengthen the capacity of the NYDA to deliver.

We will introduce to Parliament amendments to the National Youth
Development Agency Act, with a view to transforming it into a section 76
Act in order to incorporate the provincial component.

This agency comes into being under difficult economic conditions, which to
a particular extent will have an impact on its work. This includes the
challenge of job losses, which also affect the youth, thus contributing
towards the unemployment rate of young people. Therefore, it is necessary
that we appeal to government, the private sector, civil society and young
people themselves to support this agency in discharging its mandate.

The success of the NYDA lies in the collective hands of our nation. Early
this year, government adopted the National Youth Policy 2009-2014, which
details a number of policy imperatives. This policy will be followed up
with the Integrated Youth Development Strategy that sets out specific plans
that will give effect to our policy propositions.

We are aware that many issues affecting young people are not only limited
to the mandate of the NYDA, but rather speak to the work that the entirety
of government must undertake to address the challenges faced by the youth.

Therefore, we hope that government departments will reflect in their plans
how they intend to address the issues of youth applicable to them as per
their mandate.

The NYDA is currently in discussions with the Public Administration
Leadership and Management Academy to implement a Public Service National
Youth Service Programme aimed at providing unemployed graduates with the
opportunity to fill existing government vacancies or internships in
government to gain experience.

This gesture will open job opportunities for thousands of unemployed young
graduates. We anticipate that government departments will place the
development of young people as agents of change at the heart of their
Public Service responsibilities.

The NYDA will be accountable to the Presidency. It is therefore important
that we strengthen the capacity of the Youth Desk in the Presidency to
monitor the performance of this agency, thus ensuring continuous service
improvement and accountability.

The Youth Desk will also carry out some of the functions which were
traditionally performed by the National Youth Commission, such as policy
development and the co-ordination of youth development activities across
government spheres. This will ensure a co-ordinated approach and provision
of comprehensive services to the youth of South Africa.

At this juncture, it is fitting that we thank the staff and leadership of
the collapsed National Youth Commission and the Umsobomvu Youth Fund for
the foundation they have laid for the NYDA.

I am hopeful that the NYDA will have a good relationship with Parliament,
which will be guided by our collective desire to serve the youth of our
country. Indeed, the Ministry is looking forward to working with Members of
Parliament as they execute their oversight role to ensure that we deliver
on the promises made to our people.

We will, during the next two months, present our adjusted budget for this
financial year to Treasury, and budget estimates for the 2010–2013 MTEF
period during the budget process. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms P DE LILLE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,
the ID supports the creation of two Ministries in the Presidency. We have
always said that monitoring, evaluation and planning have been the largest
weaknesses in government over the past 15 years. It is hoped that these
Ministries will improve the pace and quality of service delivery and make a
real difference in the lives of our people.

We are looking forward to engaging with you on the promised White Paper on
the structure and direction of the National Planning Commission. It is our
hope that the commission will generate a long-term vision for our country,
taking into account the massive, global challenges that will occur in the
next 30 years. The mark of successful countries has been their ability to
position themselves based on their accurate anticipation of global changes.

We have always recognised that we are living in extremely difficult times
and we welcome your Presidency’s willingness to engage in debate with us on
the challenges that we face. The best way we can deal with this crisis is
through listening to all sides, and we hope that this willingness to engage
constructively will continue.

In this regard, Mr President, the ID believes that we need to review the
speaking time allocated to opposition parties in this Parliament. We cannot
make a proper contribution in one or two minutes. We have raised this issue
with Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, and we hope that the Chief Whips
in Parliament will address this as a matter of urgency.

Mr President, debate and engagement are important, but we also need to see
concrete action. I get the sense that the country is ready to move forward.
We therefore hope that the Ministry of Performance Monitoring and
Evaluation and Administration in the Presidency will ensure that planning
translates into implementation.

Lastly, the ID would like to call on you, Mr President, to be true to your
promise of a new ethos in government that is based on performance, and an
attitude of no tolerance when it comes to crime and corruption. The ID
supports the budget. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N M KGANYAGO: Hon Deputy Speaker, hon members, the budget before us
allocates a sizable amount of taxpayers’ money for spending on what is not
essentially a line function. One is reminded that there were many
detractors of the previous executive who said that too much power was being
centralised in the Presidency. But now those same detractors are champions
of an expanded Presidency, and hence more taxpayers’ money is required to
fund this expansion.

Allow me to make a rural analogy. The policies and service delivery
objectives of government are like a wagon and Cabinet is like a team of
oxen that must, together, pull the wagon to its destination. In such an
analogy, the President and his Deputy have the duty of being the wagon
drivers. The Presidency gives direction and, where necessary, wields the
whip.

At the moment, with this expanded Presidency, we have a situation where the
wagon driver is bringing in more workers to assist. In itself, this is not
a problem. What might be a problem is that they are not oxen. In other
words, they are not there to help drag the wagon. Instead, they are there
to assist the wagon driver. The obvious danger is that they are simply
adding to the load of the wagon. [Interjections.] The even bigger danger is
that there might soon be confusion about who is giving the direction and
who is wielding the whip. There is huge potential for squabbles and
conflict. The wagon could come to a complete standstill. One hopes that
this situation has been foreseen and that the President has his hands
firmly on the reins of government. The UDM supports the Budget Vote. Ke a
leboga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon member. Hon members, proceedings will
now be suspended for 10 minutes to allow members a comfort break. Bells
will be rung to alert members to the commencement of proceedings.

Business suspended at 16:20 and resumed at 16:33.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES: The economy
shed 179 000 jobs in the first quarter. The second quarter is likely to be
as bad. This is indeed not a good time to be elected as a President.

Why, in these difficult times, are there so many workers striking and
threatening to bring the country to a stop economically? Surely the medical
doctors and some workers have good reasons to be unhappy. But in contrast,
other workers are striking, from my point of view, to abuse the
Confederations Cup tournament or the 2010 Soccer World Cup for their own
selfish interests.

In Beijing, there were 100 000 volunteer workers during the Beijing Olympic
Games who did not receive any remuneration. They explained how privileged
they felt to make a patriotic contribution as proud Chinese people. Do we
have such people? I do believe so.

The South African workers on the building projects for the 2010 World Cup
are striking, knowing that the strikes could result in the projects not
being completed before the World Cup. They are not concerned - as long as
they profit from it. During the Confederations Cup soccer game between
Italy and the USA in Pretoria, tournament officials went on strike over
salaries. The police had to check the tickets at the gates. What image does
this create of South African workers?

Met die ekonomiese krisis en die houding van hierdie stakende werkers aan
die eenkant en die vyf miljoen Suid-Afrikaners wat wil werk en nie werk kan
kry nie, aan die ander kant, regverdig dit ’n nuwe debat oor ons
arbeidswetgewing. ’n Jong entrepreneur verduidelik aan my dat hy 10
werksgeleenthede kan skep, maar dat die arbeidswetgewing maak dat hy eerder
masjiene gaan invoer en outomatiseer, ongeag my argumente.

Is arbeidswetgewing een van die redes waarom ons sukkel om genoeg
werksgeleenthede te skep of nie? Dis die debat. Kom ons eksperimenteer. Wat
van belastingverligting en arbeidsregulasievrystellings in ’n deel van ’n
provinsie, byvoorbeeld in 'n spesiale ekonomiese sone naby 'n hawe of in 'n
landelike gebied wat baie onderontwikkel en arm is. Dan meet ons die
resultate. Hoeveel werkgeleenthede is geskep? Wat het dit gekos? As dit
slaag, kan dit uitgebrei word. As dit misluk dan stop ons dadelik daarmee.
Dit sluit, wat my betref, ook eksperimentering met regstellende aksie in,
wat tans baie jongmense landuit dryf.

Ek glo die huidige krisis regverdig dit. Die regering se openbare
werkeprogram is belangrik en dit gaan beslis werk skep, maar dit is nie
voltydse permanente werk met volle voordele nie. Regerings kan moeilik
sulke werk skep. Uiteindelik is dit die private sektor wat sulke werk kan
skep, as die regering dit vir hulle moontlik en maklik maak. Ek glo in
hierdie rigting kan daar dalk oplossings vir ons wees. Ek dank u.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[We have the economic crisis and the attitude of these striking workers on
the one hand and the five million South Africans who want to work, but are
unable to find work, on the other. Therefore, a new debate regarding our
labour legislation is justified. A young entrepreneur, regardless of my
arguments, explained to me that he can create 10 job opportunities, but due
to the labour legislation he will rather import machinery and automatise
his business.

Is labour legislation one of the reasons why we are struggling to create
sufficient job opportunities or not? That is the debate. What about tax
relief and labour regulation exemptions in a part of a province, for
example in a special economic zone close to a harbour, or in a rural area
that is very underdeveloped and poor? Thereafter we can evaluate the
results. What did it cost? How many job opportunities were created? If it
succeeds, it might be extended. If it fails, we then end it immediately. In
my opinion this also includes the experiment of affirmative action, which
is driving many young people from this country.

I believe that the current crisis justifies this step. The Public Works
Programme of the government is important and it will definitely create
jobs, but it is not full-time, permanent work with full benefits.
Governments find it difficult to create such jobs. Ultimately, the private
sector will create such jobs, if the government makes it possible and easy
for them. I believe there might be solutions for us in this regard. I thank
you. [Applause.]]

Mr M C MANANA: Chairperson, hon President and Deputy President, hon
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members, invited guests, ladies and
gentlemen, 33 years ago during this month, a simmering bubble of anger of
schoolchildren finally burst, releasing an intensity of emotion that the
police controlled in the only manner they knew how - with ruthless
aggression.

Thirty-three years later, the youth of South Africa have made yet another
historic mark by participating vigorously in the peaceful, free and fair
fourth democratic general elections, dispelling more than a decade of
assertions that young people remain ignorant on issues pertaining to
democracy.

We pay tribute and salute all the disciplined cadres who came before us and
made many sacrifices for the cause of our liberation. Our existence as a
liberation movement remains relevant in the fulfilment of our strategic
objectives and ultimate goal to create a national democratic society.

Both the Ready to Govern: ANC policy guidelines for a democratic South
Africa and the Reconstruction and Development Programme: A Policy Framework
emphasise the need for an integrated approach to government and
accountability for accelerated service delivery. This view, in essence,
requires a strong and effective central government which will primarily
deal with national tasks and a vibrant and effective provincial and local
government to ensure active local involvement in dealing with local
matters.

Local communities know better their daily experience and needs which
require to be addressed in a much more integrated manner, because it is
through integrated approaches that service delivery can be accelerated.

In the same vein, integrated approaches recognise that human needs are more
diverse and consistently changing, thus the need to bring them together. In
this view, integrated-based approaches should remain government’s
overarching task to ensure that the ANC government is rooted amongst the
masses of our people. This is because it is in the poorest constituencies
that the ANC has, over the last 16 years of our multiparty democracy,
enjoyed fair electoral growth.

The ANC’s strategic objective is to promote the transformation of South
Africa into a united, democratic, nonracial and nonsexist country of
abundance, which demands that the ANC-led government advances service
delivery irrespective of race, creed or ethnicity.

The principle of integrated approaches to delivery should not be seen as
though it is promoting sinister motives which seek to marginalise certain
provinces and municipalities that are under the control of strategic
opponents of the movement.

We have no point to prove when it comes to service delivery, and we will
continue to be guided by Chapter 3 of the Constitution, which speaks to a
co-operative government involving national, provincial and local levels.
The ANC-led government will neither hesitate, hon Trollip, to intervene as
and when it is required to do so in bringing about quality service to the
citizenry of the Western Cape nor delay, hon Buthelezi, any effort to
capacitate and bring quality service to Zululand District Municipality and
other surrounding municipalities controlled by the official opposition in
KwaZulu-Natal. Ours is to advance integration in order to accelerate
service delivery.

The 1996 Constitution is very clear on the separation of powers involving
the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. By the way, hon Trollip,
we practise the culture of continuity and inclusion in the ANC. We don’t
appoint Cabinet and advisors along factional lines. These three organs of
state - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary - should continue
ensuring the smooth running of the country.

Since 1994, the doctrine of separation of powers has been upheld in
government to ensure proper independence and necessary oversight for the
purposes of good governance. In his state of the nation address, the
President of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency J G Zuma, said:


  The success of the democratic system as a whole depends on good relations
  of mutual respect and a spirit of partnership among the executive, the
  legislature and the judiciary. This is very important for our
  constitutional democracy.

It is on the basis of such partnerships and good spirit that we will
continue in our responsibility as the legislative arm of the state to
oversee the executive to ensure that it acts in terms of the Constitution,
thus contributing effectively towards a good and accountable government.

Over the past 15 years, government has led programmes and policies that
sought to democratise the state. This task was informed by the
understanding that the state is not a monolithic block but a contested
terrain and a strategic battlefield. These programmes I refer to must be
influenced by the needs of the people, and government should not just play
a regulatory function but a leading role for a better life for all our
people.

The ANC 2009 manifesto points out that the developmental state that we
envisage will promote service delivery, co-ordination and planning efforts.


Over the past 15 years the ANC-led government has demonstrated commitment
to the following: regular multiparty elections based on proportional
representation; the Bill of Rights; an independent judiciary; participatory
democracy; good governance and equality; and transparency and
accountability.

One of the fundamental hindrances to quality service delivery to our people
has been corruption in our systems of governance. The RDP proposed that
government should combat corruption in the public sector through concerted
efforts. It is as a result of such efforts that we have significantly
decreased corruption in recent years as compared to 1994 to 2004.

We will, however, revisit the issue of corruption by following corruption
trends and thus putting in place additional measures to ensure that
politicians do not tamper with the adjudication of tenders. In essence, a
need to intensify more regulatory measures in addition to the Public
Finance Management Act is crucial as an essential tool to efficient service
delivery. We hope that such measures will ensure transparency in the
tendering system. The point here is that there is absolutely nothing wrong
with being rich, but there is everything wrong with acquiring wealth
through stealing and at the expense of our poor people. [Applause.]

We must be able to respond to the global economic recession by ensuring
that, as we bring service delivery to our people, we minimise fruitless
expenditure and learn the culture of improvising for greater gain. By this,
I am not implying that we compromise quality service, but that we spend
less, and with caution, as we execute our mandate.

The public sector has undergone transformation for the purpose of promoting
access to basic integrated services. This also involves working towards
building a single public sector and an integrated rural development
strategy. Similarly, the call for a single police service seeks to ensure
that metro police and provincial structures are under the command of the
National Police Commissioner in line with integrated approaches to service
delivery.

Indeed, the proposal for an integrated criminal justice system that
facilitates a co-ordination between police stations, courts and prisons is
to ensure greater service delivery and justice for all. Government has
reconfigured the Cabinet and state departments to facilitate an integrated
approach and ensure popular governance and accountability. In this regard,
it has been 15 years of nation-building, gender transformation and the
deepening of democracy.

The ANC is committed to the principle of bringing government close to the
people to ensure popular participation in government. Izimbizo remain a
vital tool and instrument of reporting back to communities to ensure
government accountability. The ANC should also be strengthened enough to
hold the executive, Members of Parliament, Premiers, MECs and councillors
to account before the end of each five-year term in order to avoid a
situation where reference is made to the lack of service delivery as
grounds for a break-away. This mechanism should protect poor people from
being used as voting fodder by such opportunistic elements. The ANC-led
political centre should provide overall strategic direction and leadership
in the interest of the national democratic revolution.

In conclusion, it appears that an integrated approach to governance and
service delivery will ensure popular participation and accountability, not
just by the executive or government structures, but also by the ANC as an
organisation, guided by the words of Mosiuoa Lekota during his heyday in
the ANC, when he said: “The ANC’s intentions remain undimmed”. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF WOMEN, YOUTH, CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES:
Chairperson, hon President and Deputy President, hon Ministers and Deputy
Ministers, hon Members of this House, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to participate in this budget debate
this afternoon.

We measure the development of any society by its ability to respond to the
needs of targeted groups. To achieve this we have to prioritise groups that
need to be targeted by special programmes. This government has taken a step
and has been commended for establishing a Ministry focused on addressing
issues of women, children and persons with disabilities.

We must now ensure that adequate resources are allocated to promote the
interests of these targeted groups. Since 1994, the ANC-led government has
endeavoured to build an inclusive and socially cohesive democratic society
through a process of socioeconomic and political transformation. The
Ministry will be building on the progress made over the past 15 years. We
will ensure that our country honours all the regional and international
commitments and protocols, such as the Convention on the Elimination of all
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the
Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

The strategic thrust of this Ministry is to advance policy and achieve
measurable milestones on mainstreaming gender, children’s rights and
disability considerations into the programmes of government and other
sectors of society in line with international and regional commitments made
in these areas.

We aim to establish effective institutional mechanisms for social and
economic empowerment, equalisation of opportunities and access to resources
for women, children and persons with disabilities. We are going to work
with other departments, provincial and local government, the private
sector, labour and civil society in mainstreaming issues relating to these
three targeted groups.

We will ensure that the social security net is tighter and poverty
alleviation programmes benefit primarily the many women, children and
persons with disabilities who continue to live in conditions of abject
poverty.

Women and children constitute the majority in rural areas. They are at the
receiving end of the challenges posed by underdevelopment in these areas.
They are the ones who fetch water from the streams, collect wood for
cooking and till the land to support families through subsistence farming.
It is therefore logical that they should be the primary beneficiaries of
government programmes on rural development, agricultural support and land
reform.

Our goal is to ensure that women are liberated from the constraints of many
centuries of land deprivation. Our programme on women will also focus on
strengthening and broadening the national machinery for women’s empowerment
and gender equality through the establishment of effective and efficient
advisory units in all structures of government at the national, provincial
and local levels.

While we continue with the process of consultation with stakeholders on
finalising the strategic priorities for the new Ministry, the following
issues should be at the top of our agenda: to respond to the challenge of
feminisation of poverty; creation of decent jobs and economic empowerment
of women; increasing the representation of women in positions of decision-
making and in management levels towards 50% parity; and eradication of
violence against women and children.

The immediate aim of delivery of the department is going to be the
establishment of a fund for women’s empowerment. This fund will enable
women to start and develop their own businesses. It will also assist NGOs
and civil society in undertaking women-empowerment programmes. We will
consult with stakeholders on this issue within the next month and pilot the
fund to reality during this financial year.

We will use research findings to identify blockages limiting progress
towards attaining the 50% equity target for women in senior management
positions in the public sector. We will take all the necessary measures to
ensure that gender parity targets are achieved.

Regarding children, we began the week with disturbing media reports that
more than 500 000 needy South Africans, mostly children, could be plunged
into further desperation because charity organisations are struggling to
raise funds in the current economic environment. I would like to appeal to
the business sector in particular to ensure that expenditure on social
responsibility does not become the first and easiest budget item to cut
when adapting to the current economic difficulties.

Corporate social responsibility is no longer just a gesture of goodwill
viable only during good economic times. It is a necessary investment in the
socioeconomic sustainability of the country. The codes on BBBEE require
that companies spend a minimum of 1% net profit after tax on corporate
social investment initiatives. In addition, this expenditure comes with tax
and significant public relations benefits.

While there is pressure on profit margins currently, there is a need to
adopt a long-term view of where each company and its community would like
to be in the next five to 10 years’ time. A company operating in a socially
sustainable environment with a diverse workforce in terms of gender and
race will have a competitive advantage when our economy recovers.

As government, we are playing our part to ensure the welfare of our
children. We have completed a review that provided a situational analysis
on the status of children in the country. This information should guide us
in further interventions and collaborative efforts with other departments,
particularly the Departments of Health and Social Development.

We will be supporting efforts to improve the quality of life of children,
including stepping up the Early Childhood Development Programme, as our
President committed us to do. We have to ensure universal access to Grade R
and double the number of 0 to 4-year- old children attending early
childhood centres by 2014.

We will strengthen relations with the Children’s Advisory Council and other
stakeholders. We are going to build on the progress made to increase
participation of municipalities in National Children’s Rights processes and
conduct further training on mainstreaming and co-ordination of children’s
issues at this level.

Just last week, Chairperson, we convened a children’s lekgotla in Limpopo
to mark the Day of the African Child with the theme “Africa Fit for
Children – A Call for Accelerated Action towards Child Survival”. Children
representing all provinces of South Africa, and some from neighbouring
countries like Swaziland, and refugee children participated; and I must
say, it was an educational process for me as well as instructive to listen
to young minds debating these issues. [Applause.]

It was an extremely informed discussion on a number of issues arising from
the AU Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child. They went on to provide recommendations on how
some of these issues affecting children should be addressed by all of us.
Most critical were issues of access to education for all, including
refugees and children with disabilities; stopping all forms of
discrimination; prevention and protection against abuse; and prevention of
drug and alcohol abuse.

Recommendations made by these children in these areas will certainly be
considered in the finalisation of our programme for this term of office.
Some of the recommendations, Chairperson, on children, emphasise the need
for further implementation of the campaign on 16 Days and 365 Days of No
Violence against Women and Children, which is one of the main campaigns and
advocacy programmes that our department will be undertaking during this
financial year.

On persons with disabilities, Chair, there are clear targets already
available, including an employment equity target of 2% and 4% for skills
development. Sadly, we have not moved very far in this regard.

The challenge is to move both the public and private sectors towards
meeting these targets. Our department is determined to take on this
challenge and ensure that every sector moves with the necessary speed to
meet the disability targets. Our activities will include co-ordination of
the job access strategy where we work together with the Department of
Public Service and Administration to achieve the employment target for
persons with disabilities by 2010.

Failure to achieve these targets, Chairperson, is not an option if we are
to remain true to our vision of an inclusive South African society. During
this financial year, we will finalise the Draft National Disability Policy
and develop an implementation plan as well. We will also prioritise issues
of access by ensuring that public buildings and facilities are fully
accessible to persons with various forms of disabilities. It is encouraging
that there is progress made in the building of stadiums in readiness not
only for the Confederations Cup of Nations but also for the 2010 Soccer
World Cup. I am happy that some progress has been made, but more needs to
be done.

Generally, we will also be responding to various practices that undermine
the interests of any of the three targeted groups. We want to ensure that
all cultural practices are consistent with the Constitution and legislative
framework existing in our country.

Chairperson, our programme is diverse and challenging. It will require the
intensive mobilisation of a multitude of stakeholders for it to succeed. It
also requires a commitment of adequate resources to support the
organisational structure necessary to advance the interests of women,
children and persons with disabilities.

It is, therefore, important that this House should support this budget Vote
as a step towards establishing, amongst other things, a fully functional
institution that stands for the rights and promotes the interests of women,
youth, children and persons with disabilities. Thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Mr President, Deputy President, hon members, the hon
President has promised enhanced service delivery. With this in mind, a
number of new Ministries have been created, including one in The Presidency
to monitor performance and delivery.
The ACDP’s concern lies with the number of new Ministries within the
economic sphere. Our particular concern lies in the sphere of the economic
policy, so crucial in view of the domestic recession and need to address
unemployment and poverty. We pose the question as to whether such
Ministries will enhance service delivery or indeed temper it.

The ACDP believes that there will be a large degree of overlap between the
Trade and Industry, Finance, and Economic Development Ministries. If one
adds the National Planning Minister in The Presidency, then, as pointed out
by the Financial Mail, the possibility of conflicts and power struggles is
huge. This would be particularly so if there is a dispute as to the
direction of economic policy.

The Minister of Finance yesterday, in response to our and other members’
questions in this regard, said that it was early days yet and gave the
assurance that each Ministry would co-operate in the spirit of co-operative
governance. He added that there would be a report-back shortly, following
discussions as to how it will all work.

Chairperson, the danger is that economic policy may become “deharmonised”.
A harmonised economic policy that provides certainty is crucial to
attracting foreign investment, particularly in a climate of global economic
recession. Markets need to be reassured about economic policies. South
Africa cannot afford such policy uncertainty in a global economic meltdown
environment.

The question, hon President, is how you see the interaction between these
various Ministries taking place and what steps will be taken to avoid
conflict or a “deharmonised” economic policy that will negatively impact on
our reputation for investors.

Mr President, you did say in your state of the nation address that the
stable microeconomic policy aims, pursued by government since 1994, were
not going to change. However, what we want to know is which Ministry will
ensure that that does happen?

Mr President, members of the public who have complained to your office are
correct when they say that when they call government departments for
assistance, they are either made to hold on for ridiculously long intervals
or are transferred from office to office until they are frustrated.

The ACDP would appreciate an immediate end to this unacceptable practice
among some government officials and members of their staff. The wearing of
name tags, as you mentioned, Mr President, to ensure a more personal
connection with members of the public, is a commendable idea.

I have two questions in this regard. Firstly, when will this practice be
implemented, and, secondly, what should members of the public do if certain
government personnel appear to be unwilling to wear a name tag?

The ACDP supports not only this Budget Vote, but also the President’s
intention to greatly improve government’s service delivery to all our
people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N W MADIKIZELA-MANDELA: Mr Speaker, my President, hon Deputy President
and members, we meet here today having been elected to the fourth
democratic Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. Every election is
consolidation and proof of our people’s commitment to deepening democracy
in our country.

Could I just correct one of my white sons; I am privileged to call you “my
son”. You asked who was leading this country. This country is ruled by the
ANC ... [Applause.] ... under the leadership of Nxamalala. [Applause.]

The recent elections were historic in a number of ways, not least because
of the fact that our people came out in large numbers to confound those who
have consistently claimed that as we move away from the historic events of
1994, our people will lose interest in the democratic project.

A staggering 77% of registered voters made their mark at the polls. They
came out to defy those prophets of doom that have become a common feature
before the elections. [Applause.] Indeed, if you were to rely on the media
before the 2009 poll, you might have been convinced that the ruling party
was set to suffer a major setback. Instead, we are back in the House with a
fresh mandate from South Africa. [Applause.]

We owe it to the masses that voted for us to ensure that our democracy has
sound political and ideological content. To do that, we have to look beyond
the razzmatazz associated with elections and identify the real meaning of
our mandate in this House. It is about giving our people real control of
their lives. It is about ensuring that the electorate steer the body
politic and are not reduced to mere passengers or spectators in the
unfolding process. For us, every vote counts and no vote comes cheap.
[Applause.]

Indeed, our movement has consistently strived to defy the political elitism
in which politics becomes a matter for professionals. Our people should not
be reduced to mere voting fodder and treated as though they are incompetent
to shape the content and direction of our democratic project.

Both in terms of our understanding and our programmes, we have committed
ourselves to participatory democracy. As hon members have heard, in this
session of Parliament there has been talk of parliamentary activism, which
you see right now.

President Zuma has indicated that he expects no less from us; it is our
expectation of him that he will indeed go down in the annals of history as
“Mr Delivery”. And that is why I am back here, Mr President. This echoes
the sentiments expressed by the millions of our people who continue to
place their faith in us. Indeed, our position is that of privilege and
responsibility – the privilege to serve and the responsibility to serve
well, which is what we are going to do.

We hold the view that only an active, engaged citizen, who critically
examines politics and social life, can impose the necessary restraints on
bureaucracy, dogmatism, empty conformism and corruption.

We understand participatory democracy as the broadest possible involvement
of, and meaningful contribution by, citizens not only in the political
arena, but in all other spheres of life as well. To achieve this will
involve the realisation of a fully participatory culture and society, not
merely participatory politics. This is at the centre of what we loosely
refer to as the people’s contract. As representatives of our people, we
need to inculcate and consolidate this participatory culture.

We must remind ourselves that this session, like any other, will be
remembered not so much for its promises, but for what it achieves in
service to our country.

Hon members will attest that -


  Great figures in history are remembered not so much for their grand plans
  or noble intentions, but for their intellectual contributions in
  radically reshaping the political, scientific, artistic or cultural
  landscapes of their time.

We often refer with pride to the contributions of the likes of Kwame
Nkrumah, Robert Sobukwe, W E B Du Bois: Pan-Africanism; Julius Nyerere:
Ujamaa; and Steven Bantu Biko, of the Black Consciousness Movement, not
only for their razor-sharp critique of power and clear political thinking,
but also for their political activism. They each sought to introduce new
ideas and, as a result, a new consciousness amongst their people.

Comrade Nelson Mandela’s contribution is understood equally in this
context. Aside from the role he played during the struggle against
apartheid and his years of suffering in prison, Mandela will be remembered
for his magnanimity, for his moral authority and for initiating and
championing the process of nation-building and reconciliation. [Applause.]

This is the legacy that all South Africans, and the rest of the world, came
to associate with the first years of democratic rule in South Africa.
Beyond the lofty ideals that we set for ourselves, this session has an
opportunity to build on the framework and successes of the past 15 years.
We carry with us a sense of urgency with regard to rapid transformation and
the delivery of social services.

I wish to highlight some of the obvious lessons that we can learn from
Bantu Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement with regard to issues of
strengthening a participatory culture and the notion of social cohesion. In
doing so, I could do no better than again recalling Comrade Nelson
Mandela’s observation on this matter. At the 5th Steve Biko lecture at UCT,
Mandela observed, and I quote:

  [Biko’s] death, which we remember and commemorate in these days, was in
  many ways as powerful in its effect on our national consciousness as was
  his life. From Robben Island we followed with immense interest the
  movement led and inspired by Steve Biko. The driving thrust of black
  consciousness was to forge pride and unity amongst all the oppressed, to
  foil the strategy of divide and rule, to engender pride amongst the
  masses of our people and confidence in their ability to throw off their
  oppression.


  For its part, the ANC welcomed black consciousness as part of the genuine
  forces of the revolution. We understood that it was helping give
  organisational form to the popular upsurge of all the oppressed groups of
  our society.


  Above all, the liberation movement asserted that in struggle – whether in
  mass action, underground organisation, armed actions or international
  mobilisation – the people would most readily develop consciousness of
  their proud being, of their equality with everyone else, of their
  capacity to make history.


  The life, work, words, thoughts and example of Steve Biko assume a
  relevance and resonance as strong as in the time that he lived. His
  revolution had a simple but overwhelmingly powerful dimension in which it
  played itself out – that of radically changing the consciousness of our
  people.


I have quoted this section to highlight the importance and role of
consciousness in consolidating a participatory democracy and thereby
honouring the contract with the masses of our people. [Applause.]

Let me conclude by making some remarks with regard to the challenge of
social cohesion and social transformation. As hon members would know, our
Constitution enjoins us to spare no effort in building a nonracial,
prosperous and democratic society. As I mentioned earlier in this speech,
this goal can only be achieved through active, engaged participation by the
electorate.

The 2009 election manifesto of the ANC serves as a reference point for
formations such as street committees, trade unions, school parent bodies
and other civic bodies to engage with provincial and national government on
issues of concern to them. This engagement will facilitate the resolution
of those tensions which continue to blight, not only our discourse, but
also the intractable causes that sustain material inequalities in our
nation. To this end, we should challenge those amongst us who have sought
to suppress all forms of debate with regard to these issues.

Professor Sipho Seepe has observed that democracy is an experiment and that
it is sustained by continuing engagement with new issues, ideas and
evolving context. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Mr Chairman, I wish to follow on the
points made by the hon Leader of the Opposition and the hon Buthelezi, and
this concerns leadership.

The editorial of Sunday’s City Press was headed: “Country is crying out for
your leadership, Mr President”. The editorial ended with these two
paragraphs:

  Zuma will engender confidence in his administration if he is seen to be
  doing his job. Delegating and consulting is important and well-meaning,
  but it does not mean he should not lead from the front.


  Otherwise, we might start to believe that this country is indeed being
  run by Vavi and Mantashe.

[Interjections.] I believe the President did show leadership on one
critically important issue in his reply to the state of the nation debate.
Here I am referring to his statement that the stable, macroeconomic policy
aims of government were not going to change. But the President needs to
lead again and unpack what he means by that statement, particularly in the
light of the fact that South Africa is currently being buffeted by the
winds of a severe recession. We need to face these winds head-on and
recognise that we – all of us - are in for a severe bout of belt-
tightening.

The Minister of Finance will tell you that government revenue is plunging.
It is R10 billion below estimates for the first two months; and that is
before corporate tax is taken into account. Notwithstanding this, demands
on the fiscus keep rising – made by Ministers, parastatals and Cosatu. The
reality has not sunk in.

SA Airways, Denel, the SABC, Alexkor and the Land Bank are all queuing up
to be recapitalised to the tune of many billions of rands. Eskom and
Transnet have a funding requirement of billions. Yet when the Minister of
Public Enterprises warned that unprofitable state-owned enterprises could
be sold off if they continued to underperform, as the state could not
continue to bail them out indefinitely, she was called to account, not by
the President or Parliament, but by Cosatu and the ANC secretary-general.
To whom are Ministers accountable in this government? Who leads?

I find it astonishing that Mr Vavi can say of the alliance that -

  We are the policymakers and the government implements. The government
  doesn’t lead anymore.

Nobody repudiates him. But it is not just the Public Enterprises –
Ministers have to take a reality check.

Projects recently put on the table by departments include free higher
education at a tertiary level, extending the child grant to 18-year-olds,
the extension of job opportunities to 500 000 individuals this year and
eventually to 5 million, the demands of land reform and restitution, the
cost of retirement reform and now national health insurance – and it just
goes on, and on, and on.

What is the cost of all of this? It is hundreds of billions of rands. We
have to have a reality check in terms of what we can afford. Now I hear the
Minister of Finance’s intervention that we will need to prioritise, but who
leads in determining these priorities? And with a soaring budget deficit,
what are we saying? Higher taxes? Are we saying higher taxes?

If so, what has become of the promise of continued stable and prudent
macroeconomic policies? And as yet, I haven’t even begun to factor in
public-sector wage demands or the additional occupation-specific
dispensation. Now, we may be sympathetic to some of these demands, but it
does not help when Cosatu’s president warns of “explosive spates of
uncontrollable labour unrest across the country”.

But it is not only fiscal policy which is being put under pressure by
government’s partners. Cosatu is now meddling in monetary policy. Yes,
let’s have a debate, but threatening to block the reappointment of the
Reserve Bank Governor and endorsing mass action aimed at bringing interest
rates down to what it considers acceptable levels, is unacceptable.

It is left to the ANC secretary-general to snap that threatening strikes
over wages and interest rates was not helpful, particularly when the
economy is in recession. Your leadership is required, Mr President.

Finally, there was the retreat into xenophobic protectionism by Cosatu when
it attempted to scuttle the R22,5 billion sale of 15% of Vodacom to
Vodafone. Leadership was silent and it was left to the courts to rescue the
deal, sending all the wrong signals to foreign investors.

Minister Manuel was taken to task for trying to engage the private sector
in the national debate. I may not have used the words that he did, but I
identify with his motives. You see, in a globalised economy the private
sector doesn’t have to engage government in the way it used to have to do
in a closed economy. It can simply walk away, and so we have to engage the
private sector and make it part of the national debate.

Finally, the editorial continues, and I quote:

  The ANC elected President Zuma as leader because it believed he was up to
  the task. There is no need for Mantashe or Vavi to babysit the President
  or usurp his authority.

[Interjections.] The country is crying out for your leadership, Mr
President. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N N SIBHIDA: Chairperson, Mr President and Deputy President, hon
members, comrades and friends, like other democracies, South Africa
requires managers with strategic capacity: those with a consciousness and
an understanding of the challenges facing the country and its people, who
not only understand that inequality, poverty, unemployment and crime remain
major challenges facing us, but also know and understand the strategic
interventions required to address these challenges.

Like other societies in transition, ours requires the strategic capacity
which would offer much needed clarity and coherence for implementation of
our national priorities - the creation of descent work and sustainable
livelihoods, education, health, rural development and land reform, as well
as the fight against crime.

Having provided strategic leadership to masses of our people under
difficult circumstances during the darkest days of apartheid in South
Africa and the past 15 years of democratic governance, the ANC has once
again been given a mandate to lead the struggle of the masses of South
African people.

With the establishment of the Ministry for Planning Commission for
monitoring and evaluation, we see the seriousness of the ANC about its
popular mandate to lead the people of South Africa into a better future in
the short-, medium- and long-term. Without doubt, this accords with the
commitment of the ANC, the people’s movement, to develop monitoring and
evaluation capacity in the strategic centres of the state.

We know and understand that national, provincial and municipal levels of
the government require the strategic capacity which will derive content
from both people’s experiences gained during the liberation struggles and
aspirations of the people without which the government will be badly
managed, which may result in services that are inaccessible, unaffordable,
disorganised and of low quality. The consequences of this would undoubtedly
be severe for poor people.

Strengthening strategic management and leadership of the government remains
a necessary imperative that has to be understood within the context of
constructing a developmental state, a state premised on being people-
centred and people-driven. I talk of a state that has as its primary
mission the desire and commitment to improve the quality of life of all the
people, especially the poor.

Central among the attributes of the developmental state is its capacity to
lead in the definition of a common national agenda and in mobilising all of
society to take part in its implementation.

We talk of technical capability and ability to translate broad policy
objectives into concrete programmes and projects of the democratic
government.

In transforming the South African state, of great importance is the
challenge of transforming both the form and content of the administration
of this state to eradicate all manifestations of apartheid in our state,
especially in the administration.

However, this would require administrators with the administrative and
technical capability and capacity to identify and eliminate manifestations
of apartheid tendencies.
Without venturing into the debate of whether the state exists to manage
class contradictions, with a strong strategic capacity the state will be
able to develop strategies and strategic plans for both policy
implementation and monitoring and evaluation.

To be able to provide strategic management and leadership, public managers
located at the centre of government would have to be empowered to be able
to devise both the clear direction for the entire government and the means
of getting there.

However, this does not only require further training and realignment of the
existing managers, but also the creation of competitive positions at the
centre. While strategic management and leadership relates to management of
the strategic decision-making process, the success of this government will
be determined on the basis of the effectiveness and efficiency of its
strategic bureaucrats.

Some scholars believe that poorly functioning bureaucracies impede efforts
to promote economic growth and reduce poverty, which are fundamental
challenges requiring decisive and effective intervention of government.
However, for it to make interventions, the democratic government requires
strategic capacity. Without doubt, the strategic capacity and capability of
the government requires a strong capacity for formulating and co-ordinating
policy in the strategic centre of government - the Presidency.

However, this would require effective and efficient delivery systems as
well as capable and motivated human resources at this centre and at the
level of the provincial and local government throughout the country. As
service delivery primarily occurs at the level of provincial and local
government, it remains critically important for the centre of government to
ensure that strong strategic capacity is also developed at these levels of
government.

In conclusion, let me emphasise that people have to understand the
strengthening of public administration within the context of fundamentally
transforming the state and developing institutional capacity for a
developmental state.

Bab’u Nxamalala, Mr Zuma, we are told that when strategic capacity at the
centre is weak, the plans of government become ill-informed and unco-
ordinated and budgets are based on unrealistic and unsound assumptions.
Left unattended, this could result in future incoherent strategic policies
and macroeconomic instability in the country. The ANC supports the budget.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M N MATLADI: Hon Chairperson, the Presidency is the highest office
around which the weal and woe of the country revolve. The aim of having
such an office is summed up well in that it has to provide leadership in
the development and management of the government strategic agenda. To this
end, we in the UCDP are at ease that the office fulfils its mandate.
[Applause.]

However, we would like to raise the following issues that need to be
addressed by the Presidency. Firstly, we are aware that at the time when
the annual reports had to be presented to the House, the Presidency failed
to do so and thus made it very difficult for members to know if it had
reached its strategic objectives or to know about the gaps that might be
existing in fulfilling these objectives. It’s a concern we believe has to
be addressed.

We congratulate the Presidency for establishing the Ministry of Women,
Youth, Children and People with Disabilities. We shall await the
mainstreaming and co-ordination plans that the hon Minister has promised to
unfold in the other spheres of government, including provinces and local
government municipalities.

Mopresidente yo o tlotlegang, ga twe ntime o mphele ngwana. [Hon President,
there is a saying that one should rather consider helping my child than
me.]

And the UCDP takes note that our youth is our future and that the plethora
of youth institutions overseen by the Presidency had always been confusing
in addressing youth problems across all spectrums.

We nonetheless welcome the fact that in the state of the nation address the
President promised his intention to launch the National Youth Development
Agency formed by the merger of Umsobomvu Youth Fund and the National Youth
Commission, which happened on 16 June this year. And we applaud him because
he leads by example; his promises are met.

The magnificent projects and programmes mounted by government are less well
known because the GCIS is found to be wanting and the UCDP recommends that
there be an improvement in the communication of this Ministry.

Finally, the UCDP joins the Presidency in applauding Bafana Bafana for work
well done and also hopes that South Africa wallops Brazil tomorrow and does
wonders also in the coming 2010 Fifa World Cup. The UCDP supports Vote No 1
– The Presidency. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Hon Speaker, Mr President, Deputy
President, hon members, it is my honour to participate in the debate today
and to speak on our international economic relations. The past three
decades have seen a deep integration of economies across the globe.

This integration, although not always on our own terms, has profoundly
changed our world. Within this new world there have been deep challenges:
challenges about the outcomes of integration, about the unequal power
relations and about policy frameworks. However, there have also been
opportunities for economic development and to promote international co-
operation.

While the global economic crisis has raised serious and fundamental
questions about the policy framework of integration, at the same time the
desirability of nations working, trading and investing together is not in
doubt. But on what terms do we do so?

Economic orthodoxy, as the standard model for that engagement, is now
undergoing a meltdown with painful effects on the poor; and indeed, many
fast-growing economies have not followed the precepts of such orthodoxy in
their domestic policies.

One of the key goals of government is to reposition South Africa globally,
based on our people’s needs and not narrow ideological considerations. This
will enable us to advance our electoral mandate.

As we engage with the powerful economies of China, India, Brazil, the EU
and the US, we need to reflect how we can leverage more and better jobs
from these economic relationships. Our trade and investment can be
structured to maximise the local employment dividend.

But our agenda is also an African agenda. We seek to develop African
economies, not as an act of solidarity only, but as fundamental to meeting
our national economic goals. We are not an outpost of Europe, and we must
seek more economic opportunity, reciprocal investment and trade within
Africa.

The trajectory of global economic development over the past few decades has
been towards larger regional economies. The economies of scale and
increased consumer markets, the synergies between regional industrial
producers, the secure sources of raw materials, the skills pool - all the
benefits that flow from strong regional economies - are considerable.

The African continent is an opportunity awaiting innovative approaches to
development. As a recent UN report noted, Africa is endowed with human and
natural resources, environmental diversity and cultural richness. The
continent is youthful, with over 920 million people, of whom 60% are under
25 years old. This is a huge resource - today and tomorrow’s labour force
that needs to get into productive and decent work.

The ending of a number of civil wars and the consolidation of democratic
rule has been accompanied by robust economic growth averaging 5,9% between
2001 and 2008, though largely driven more recently by commodity price
increases.

However, Africa’s contribution to the global economy is disproportionate to
its benefit from that global economy. Our coal and oil provides the energy
needs elsewhere; our minerals are transformed on other continents into
manufactured goods; and our agricultural output feeds many across the
world. Global companies have found the continent a ready place for mining
operations; a market for goods and services; and a solid base from where to
repatriate profits to their home base.

Africa is an exporter of skills. Skilled personnel trained with the limited
taxpayers’ monies such as doctors, nurses, teachers and engineers are
snapped up by developed countries. Take the example of Ghana. According to
a 2005 European Union Commission report to the European Parliament, the UK
made savings of £100 million in training costs from the recruitment of the
1 314 Ghanaian doctors and nurses practising in the UK. Ghana is neither
the only nor even the largest contributor to this perverse form of
development aid from the South to the North.

The continent faces other deep challenges. Africa has 12% of the world’s
population, but it accounts for only 1% of the world’s global GDP, and only
2% of world trade. If Africa’s economy was proportionally the size of its
population, it would be 12 times larger than it is today. It is this gap
that creates an opportunity for development and inclusive growth.

However, the opportunities are under enormous strain today as the fall-out
of the crisis that emerged, not in Africa, but in the US, causes damage to
the economies of our continent.

One of the most significant dangers is that of a deep de-industrialisation
in which the continent continues to lose many of its key manufacturing
sectors and enterprises, and sinks deeper into being simply a provider of
raw materials to the rest of the world. That danger, of deepening the
colonial pattern of simply exporting unprocessed agricultural and mining
output and importing manufactured goods, is real.

In the current global architecture, the structure of trade is stacked
against Africa. The global economic crisis may have not created, but it
does seriously exacerbate, these deindustrialisation pressures.

So what does development entail? Is South Africa and the rest of Africa
destined to be the modern day’s hewers of wood or drawers of water? Or, can
we build a different vision for South Africa and indeed the African region,
as a major industrial economy with strong supply linkages across our
borders, an economy based on innovation, skills, science and technology and
fair labour standards, and driven by strong domestic demand in our
economies?

The development agenda for South Africa contains the seeds of a new growth
path for the African continent. There are connections between what we do at
home and what happens in the region. Many elsewhere in Africa agree with
this perspective. For example, the programme of infrastructure development
needs to be linked to a continental infrastructure plan. Industrial policy
at home should also be mirrored by a broader Africa-wide industrialisation
strategy.

There are enormous opportunities for us in developing an integrated
production and supply chain across the region. These opportunities,
however, go with responsibilities. We need to ensure that the conduct of
our people and South African business practices elsewhere on the continent
befit our status as a proud member of the African community of nations. The
economic crisis has shown that Africa is not decoupled from what happens in
other industrial economies, and that it constitutes a powerful argument for
co-shaping of the global financial, economic and social architecture.

One year ago, the International Labour Organisation’s tripartite
constituents adopted the Declaration of Social Justice for a Fair
Globalisation. It provided a far-reaching vision of placing people at the
centre of economic policy, affirmed that labour is not a commodity and that
poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere. And it
began to put in place one part of the new global social architecture that
we require.

More recently, hon President, ILO member states grappled with how to
respond to the global jobs crisis. Following discussions in which South
Africa played a key role, and where Deputy President Motlanthe spoke at the
plenary of the conference, the tripartite parties adopted a Global Jobs
Pact. It contains an employment response to the economic crisis and it
mirrors in many areas South Africa’s framework agreement adopted locally in
February this year.

The Global Jobs Pact provides for the following: measures to accelerate
employment creation, job recovery and sustaining enterprises; building
social protection systems and protecting people; strengthening respect for
international labour standards; using social dialogue, bargaining
collectively, identifying priorities and stimulating action; and shaping a
fair and sustainable globalisation.

Indeed, hon President, you will be pleased to note that our domestic social
dialogue inspired and shaped this international consensus. We will drive
implementation of the framework with the urgency that is required. We also
take this national vision into discussions in other international fora.

At the WTO, we seek an outcome of the Doha Rounds, that is, development.
The emerging outcome does not adequately address South Africa’s
industrialisation agenda, and in its current form it will cause steep job
losses in our economy. We will, therefore, seek to positively influence the
outcome so that it leaves South Africa with policy space for new industrial
development, supports employment in vulnerable sectors and expands decent
work opportunities in the local economy.

Government will enter into discussions with the EU regarding the proposed
economic partnership agreements. The objective will be to highlight the
dangers these agreements pose for regional economic integration, given the
conflicting legal obligations they introduce among members of a single
customs union.

Within the international financial institutions, principally the IMF and
World Bank, South Africa has called for major reforms. Their governance
structures need a revamp to increase the voice of the developing world.
Their mandate needs to be reviewed to ensure that it better reflects
development goals, including decent work outcomes.

In conclusion, as we reposition South Africa to take advantage of
responsible and balanced economic relations in Africa, with the global
South and with traditional trading partners - as you, hon President, set
out in your vision – we will engage strongly with the local business
community and with organised labour to seek a national consensus. We will
seek consensus on maximising the impact of these opportunities for creating
local jobs, development of the region and the continent. Thank you.
[Applause.]
Ms S P KOPANE: Hon Chairperson, hon President, it is such an honour and
privilege to be standing here today as a new member of the fourth
democratic Parliament of South Africa and to deliver my maiden speech.

Hon Chairperson, let me start by reminding us, as we are sitting here
today, that fellow South Africans have gone out in numbers to cast their
votes on 22 April, based on their wishes and dreams for a better life. More
than half of the electorate are women. These women have demonstrated a
distinctive approach to decision-making in advocating for change and for
more equitable justice for all.

Although we are celebrating Freedom Day on 27 April annually, South African
women are still facing challenges of poverty, unemployment and exclusion
from education. Women are still excluded from accessing land and credit.
They face high rates of sexual abuse, domestic violence and HIV/Aids.

South Africa is still considered to have one of the highest rates of male
violence committed against women. Hon Chairperson, these women start to ask
themselves: What is freedom; are we really benefiting from what we have
fought for?

I strongly believe that true individual freedom cannot exist economic
security and independence. Mr President, during your inauguration you made
a commitment to our people and to the land, and I quote:

  For as long as there are women who are subjected to discrimination,
  exploitation or abuse, for as long as there are children who do not have
  means nor the opportunity to receive a decent education, we shall not rest
  and cannot falter in our drive to eradicate poverty.

Motsamaisi wa Dipuisano, baahi bana naha ya rona ba batla hore ba fuwe
mosebetsi ba tsebe ho itshebeletsa. Mosotho a re, mphemphe e a lapisa,
motho o kgonwa ke sa hae. Baahi ba rona ha ba batle ho fuwa di-food
parcels, baahi ba rona ha ba batle ho fuwa di-grants, baahi ba rona ha ba
batle ho ba mekopakopa. (Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, our citizens want to be given employment so that they can
work for themselves. A Mosotho person says, being a beggar causes hunger, a
person must be self-sufficient. Our citizens do not want food parcels, our
citizens do not want grants, our citizens do not want to be beggars.]

You cannot force people to be self-reliant. People have to become self-
reliant. People must have confidence in their own knowledge and skills, in
their ability to identify their own problems and find solutions in order to
better their lives and make independent decisions.

The DA believes that an open opportunity society gives the citizens the
ability to follow their talents and dreams, and to support their families.
However, while a small elite in South Africa is well protected in their
comfortable jobs, millions of South African people are still facing a
lifetime futilely searching for productive employment.

Social grants remain the most effective form of poverty alleviation. As of
31 March 2009 more than 30 million people receive social grants, more than
8 million of whom are children, as stated by the President during his state
of the nation address.

[Chairperson, we cannot ignore the failure of this government to fill the
vacancies in the Department of Social Welfare with people who are qualified
and trained. This government is busy filling employment vacancies with
their comrades, and this is hampering service delivery to our people.

Government organisations like the NDA, National Development Agency, and
Sasa, the South African Sugar Association, are supposed to have trained
people so that our South African society can benefit. We always hear of
fraud and corruption; high-ranking government officials are implicated in
awarding tenders.

Independent investigations which include all the political parties should
be conducted immediately. We cannot always fold our arms when rich people
enrich themselves with social funds while poor people suffer].

While an impressive social grant system exists in South Africa, it excludes
many millions of South Africans who are of working age, but who have no
prospect of ever finding gainful employment.
The state old age pension is a lifeline for many elderly people, but the
recipients must pass the means test, which excludes many needy people who
have tried to provide for their old age. The DA urges the President to
provide a universal old age pension for all South Africans. Thank you.
[Applause.] [Time expired.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Hon Chairperson, Mr President, after your state of the
nation address, the stand you have taken at the World Economic Conference
is indeed very praiseworthy.

Mr President, since you are so very interested in clean administration, we
would like you to have an anticorruption squad, like India’s CBI, that can
investigate, confiscate and detain politicians and public servants for
unaccounted-for enrichment.

There are certain structures that fall directly under the Presidency. We
are indeed glad that the Minister has elaborated in detail on the issue of
the promotion and advancement of the youth, and the establishment of the
NYDA. However, the MF strongly believes that it requires more structuring.

The MF proposes that what would be of more benefit to the youth would be
consideration of a law, to be called the “Youth Employment Act”. However,
it is very important that in equity legislation we must not only add the
various racial agendas; it must be prescribed by law that a minimum
percentage of those employed in the public and private sectors must be
youths. The MF strongly urges you, Mr President, to create a Ministry and
department for youth affairs.

As you are aware, June 16 was very highly recognised this year, after you
had assumed the role of President. The very fact that a record number of
youths have come out and registered means that they are interested in the
affairs of the country, and indeed they must not be left behind.

It is very important that the Presidency reflects the broad cross-section
of the province’s population - Madiba set a perfect example - in that the
employment of your staff shows the composite of the nature of South
Africa’s multicultural society.

Mr President, you spoke about reaching out to other political parties. The
MF proposes that you create an informal political party leadership forum so
that, over a cup of tea, we can regulate and exchange views with you.
[Interjections.] It is very important that we show not only in words, but
in deeds, that we are working across the party-political divides. Even when
you have to take staff or advisors, etc, do not ignore people who may not
belong to the majority party.

Mr President, historically, the two “Ps” became historical like Madiba. You
came from the prison to the Presidency. These are facts of history that are
very significant. I am sure that the Presidency, under your leadership,
will be very vibrant. Remember the example of President Obama. He selected
an outstanding team and we also want to commend to you that we would like
to see senior appointments to the Presidency coming from the youth.

The MF strongly believes that the war against poverty should be in the
Presidency.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr KO Bapela): Hon member, unfortunately, your time
is over.

Mr R B BHOOLA: Mr President, we wish you well, and all the best.
[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, may I ask you a question, sir? What was
unfortunate about the fact that Mr Bhoola’s time had expired?
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr KO Bapela): You wanted him to speak more?
Unfortunately, we are regulated by time.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon President, Deputy
President, hon members, political revolutions are about, among other
things, the capture of state power and are used to advance the objectives
of fundamental social transformation. This task must be carried out
consciously and intentionally as its creation will not be an accident or
what Uncle Jack Simons described as a natural, spontaneous growth arising
from interaction between individuals each seeking their own interest.

Accordingly, developmental states are social constructs arising out of
unique historical domestic and global contexts, as well as the struggles
taking place in those given contexts.

All previous national democratic revolutions, especially in Africa, have
been political revolutions. When national liberation movements hitherto
achieved independence, they seldom destroyed the old state machinery. More
often, they merely took over the structures, processes and systems of the
old order, as well as their bureaucratic administration and went on working
along the old lines.

It is for this reason that Uncle Jack Simons says that in Africa, hitherto,
when national liberation was achieved, there has most often been continuity
and not revolution.

Having drawn sufficient lessons from this African experience as well as our
own 15 years of democracy, we have said that we have arrived at a moment of
national renewal, which includes renewal at the level of the state itself
as an instrument and site of transformation.

The state is a vital feature in the effort to bring about the revolutionary
changes that we seek, to ensure that we succeed in the effort to construct
a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic, united and prosperous South Africa that
belongs to all who live in it.

The achievement of political freedom in South Africa coincided with the
collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, which was seen as the
triumph of the neoliberal policies, also known as market fundamentalism.

Whilst this set us along a course of democratisation, it simultaneously
also set limits to what we could do. What further compounded our efforts
was the fact that, firstly, our political settlement was an outcome of a
negotiated arrangement where the politically defeated forces still retained
political influence as well as their economic power and dominance.

For significant democratisation and redistribution, they needed to co-
operate. And secondly, the challenge in 1994 was not only that South Africa
had been an apartheid, colonial society with severe poverty and inequality,
and stagnation, but a further reality was that it was a developing nation
with one of the most unequal societies in the world.

From the outset, South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy has
been predicated on the rejection of the neoliberal perspective of the state
and on a bias towards the poor. The state we are constructing in South
Africa is one which places strong emphasis on the role of development and
democracy.

In his book, How Rich Countries Got Rich and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor,
the Norwegian economist, Erik Reinert says:


   History reveals how rich countries got rich by methods that by now had
   generally been outlawed by the conditionalities of the Washington
   Consensus.

The fact is that without a strong and activist state during their early
years of development, colonising foreign countries and driving development
in favour of the capitalist class, currently developed countries would not
have reached their current levels of development.

Consequently, to argue for a small and inactive state today is an
ideological construct aimed at entrenching the political and economic
dominance of those already dominant.

Neo-liberals used the collapse of the Soviet Union to cajole the world into
a tragic era of market fundamentalism; and they are now exploiting the
current global recession to seek to revive this obviously failed and
disastrous agenda.

Whilst not outrightly rejecting the role of the market, the new government
has positioned the state such that it is able to drive economic growth and
development. The debate in South Africa has not been about whether or not
the state has any role to play, but has been about the content of such
role.

This perspective has been greatly buttressed by the current global
recession, which has placed greater emphasis on the need, inter alia, to
regulate the market because on its own it deepens socioeconomic disparities
and leads to the impoverishment of vast masses of the people who lose their
jobs, livelihoods and dignity.

The developmental state is expected to lead the process of economic and
political transformation. It is underpinned by the vision of reconstruction
and development as an integrated process, consistent with the vision of the
Freedom Charter and the RDP. Central to this vision is developing both the
planning capacity of the state as well as monitoring and evaluation
machinery.

Both these elements could better be pursued within the framework of co-
operative governance and guided by the Constitution, whilst we bear in mind
that South Africa is neither a unitary nor a federal state. Whilst the
three spheres can be perceived as interlocking, each with a measure of
autonomy to deal with matters assigned to it by the Constitution or
relevant legislation, they nonetheless exist within the framework of a
single, united state.

To emphasise autonomy whilst neglecting unity is dishonest. National
planning does not take away the autonomy of provinces and the local sphere
from them. On the contrary, it will enhance the pursuit of their own
mandates by assisting them using a national instrument to set themselves
clear objectives informed by a national perspective. And they will benefit
from the accumulated knowledge, experience and know-how of other equivalent
structures through emulation. It would assist to eliminate duplications and
to exploit already existing knowledge and capacities.

National planning does not mean the same thing as the old notion of central
planning, and hence it cannot be dismissed simply because others have a
phobia for or nightmares about the period of central planning.

Of course, one of the most important lessons of the past 15 years has been
that without a strict monitoring and evaluation mechanism, you cannot
effectively measure progress achieved or identify and correct mistakes
made.

Monitoring and evaluation is not so much about policing individual members
of the executive or public servants; it is about ensuring that in strictly
pursuing set targets, we can identify where mistakes are made or targets
are not being met and thus can intervene accordingly. It is to ensure that
we respect our public mandate as the state and spend the public funds
wisely and in terms of the agreed programmes. Failure to implement our
programmes as the state, and wisely to spend public funds amounts to total
disrespect for the public.

These measures, collectively taken, assist to enhance the democratic
developmental state and ensure that we shift the focus away from the size
of the state to its role, capacity, objectives and programmes – to what it
is doing fundamentally to transform the lives of our people.

In this regard, it is important that we support the Presidency in its
efforts, as the President stated it in his address earlier, to improve its
capacity to provide capable leadership to and oversight over government as
a whole.

Contrary to what the opposition and some sections of the media have been
saying, the current reorganisation of the government has more to do with
renewal and improving the capacity of the democratic state than merely
creating jobs.

Such a view disparages and makes vulgar what is a well thought-out and
comprehensive vision, which the President earlier outlined with incisive
eloquence and insight.

The argument about the size of the state is a tired argument and the issue
the Presidency has raised today is about what role the state should play to
ensure that we address the fundamental challenges of our society as a
developing country.

The leadership role of the President cannot be reduced to chasing other
people’s soundbites and media statements. It is in how he provides a bold
vision to the country and organises government to discharge its
responsibilities effectively to fulfil its mandate and meet the genuine
aspirations of the vast majority of our people.

Let the DA read newspaper editorials and formulate its policies based on
these - anyway, they co-author these editorial opinions. Thank you.

Mr N T GODI: Chair, comrades and hon members, in your state of the nation
address, Mr President, the APC identified with a wide range of critical
issues contained in the MTSF for 2009 to 2014, whose accomplishment we
believe would give material meaning to the freedom we have. But as we pass
this budget, the key issue is implementation - ensuring that the executive
delivers on these commitments. The main challenge in government has been co-
ordination, planning, monitoring - both politically and administratively -
as well as capacity.

Yes, Mr President, we can have all the right things we want to do. But if
the machinery of government is not fixed, all will come to naught. Let
probity, efficiency and economy be the operational norm at all levels,
buttressed by an exhortation to fight waste and embezzlement in government.
Let’s teach, promote and practise revolutionary morality in the service of
our people.

The APC is concerned about the effective use of consultants in government.
Trends show a worrying increase in this practice on a year-to-year basis.
It was over two billion from 2006 to 2007 and over four billion from 2007
to 2008. Despite the passing of legislation to avoid conflict of interest,
the APC notes with concern the fact that there is no 100% compliance from
senior management on such declarations, and this has led to the disturbing
performance audit report by the Auditor-General of entities that are
connected with government employees and doing business with government
departments.

The APC is concerned that this report should not only be acted upon by
Scopa, but that the Presidency should have an active public interest in it
and act on it.

The APC believes that the trajectory that government has set for itself
while it requires the co-ordinated effort of all departments demands that
the Department of Higher Education and Training should be centrally
positioned. The reality and the experience of other developmental states
require that there should be a sufficient pool of skills to drive it.

Currently we have a serious skills deficit. If this is not addressed, the
developmental state will remain a slogan. This should speak to the need for
a fundamental review of the structure, direction and access to higher
education, as well as the working of the Setas. The Setas need a serious
review. Generally, they have not had the kind of impact that was expected
of them.

Lastly, whilst all the wrong people are making noises about the Islamic
Republic of Iran, there is a conspiracy of silence on the worsening plight
of the Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and especially East Jerusalem.

The APC applauds the position of Russia as stipulated by President Medvedev
in Cairo, Egypt, yesterday on the Palestinian question. It was in sharp
contrast to President Barack Obama’s wishy-washy statement a few weeks ago,
also in Cairo. When the people are bombarded, besieged, humiliated,
starved, their property seized and destroyed and members of Parliament and
Cabinet Ministers detained for years without a charge, the question arises:
Where are the so-called defenders of human and people’s rights? Where is
the International Criminal Court? [Interjections.] [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms S P RWEXANA: Chairperson, hon President of the Republic, hon Deputy
President, hon Cabinet Ministers and hon members, it is a well-known fact
that for much of history, women have somehow been seen as less than men.
Once again the issues of women are being seen as part of a pot of problems.

The establishment of a Ministry is a gesture and no more than that. The big
question is: How effective will it be? It is a known fact that a women’s
Ministry has never worked elsewhere in the world because the issues that
affect women are cross-cutting and wide-ranging.

A women’s Ministry that narrows the focus will impede the struggle of
women. Furthermore, Cope does not believe that adequate consultation took
place prior to its establishment. It might have taken 12 months to create
this Ministry, but it will now take 12 years to get it to work effectively,
if at all. [Interjections.]

Ms Z A KOTA-FREDERICKS: Chairperson, on a point of order: I think the hon
Rwexana was a co-author of the women’s Ministry.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Order! That was not a point of
order.

Ms S P RWEXANA: Unfortunately I am not at the moment! [Laughter.]

Cope also finds it very puzzling that the government has lumped together
women, youth, children and people with disabilities into one mini-
department catering for about 70% of our largely vulnerable population.
What sort of measurable targets will the Ministry be setting and within
what kind of timeframes is it going to operate?

More significantly, how will this Ministry impact on males and male
attitudes? A quarter of men in South Africa, who were recently surveyed,
acknowledge having raped a woman. As male attitudes underlie many of the
most serious problems that women face, how will this Ministry deal with
this problem that gets carried over from year to year without any progress?
[Applause.]

Government declares that it hopes to mainstream gender, disability,
children and youth issues by co-ordinating ... [Interjections.]

Ms J D KILIAN: Chair, on a point of order: I just want to request, Chair,
that you ask the Chief Whip of the ruling party to keep his members
controlled. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Hon member, I think the speaker is
audible. That is why we are here to judge whether there is anything that
interferes with the speech. But for now, let the speaker continue.

Ms S P RWEXANA: Government declares that it hopes to mainstream gender,
disability, children and youth issues by co-ordinating focal points in the
offices of Premiers, mayors and in departments. I don’t believe for one
moment that such mainstreaming will occur. Co-ordinating is not enough. The
programme needs to be driven, and it must be seen to be driven.

The announcement by the President at his inauguration that this new
Ministry, now headed by hon Noluthando Mayende-Sibiya, would emphasise the
need for equity and access to development opportunities for the vulnerable
groups of the society is highly commendable.

Last year, the outgoing Minister in the Presidency, hon Manto Tshabalala-
Msimang, spoke about the establishment of a women’s fund being part of the
Ministry. We in Cope would like to know whether such a fund has been
established and what amount of money is going to be made available through
such a fund. Looking at the budget line in table 1.6, I only see an amount
of R12,8 million set aside for supporting programmes covering gender,
disability and children. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): There is a point of order, although
there isn’t actually any time left for a point of order. I call Mr Mike
Ellis. [Interjections.]  Order! Hon members, can we respect the decorum of
the House. We have guests sitting in the gallery. I hope they are looking
at you as hon members.

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chair, on a point of order: Is it parliamentary for
the two hon members there to point fingers at other members, almost as if
they are going to cut them? She is still doing it!

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Order! We will come back to this
point. You can continue, hon Ellis. We will make a comment later.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, it is always interesting to watch the hon
Minister of Labour talking about other members of the House pointing their
fingers. Says he - pointing his own finger!

Sir, you must learn that when you talk about people pointing fingers you
don’t point your own finger. [Interjections.] That doesn’t worry me at all,
I can assure you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Order! Hon Ellis, can you please
pause a bit. You can take a seat. [Interjections.]

Hon M J Ellis, could you just pause a bit. Please sit down. Hon members, I
see those gestures continuing. And indeed it is not parliamentary to do so.
Because they were provoked from my left, I see some responding also from
the right. [Interjections.]

Yes, it happened. I will therefore call for the House really to be in
order, and then let’s just respect the decorum for the dignity of the
House. Such gestures are not allowed. And if indeed any member continues to
do so, we will then be forced to take measures. You may continue, hon
Ellis.

Mr M J ELLIS: Thank you very much indeed, Mr Chairperson. Mr Chairperson,
the hon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela referred to the hon Trollip as her white
son. And it gives me great pleasure this afternoon to announce to the House
on behalf of the hon Trollip that he is indeed proud to be the white son of
the mother of the nation. [Applause.]

Mr President, this really has been quite the most extraordinary debate. I
would say on a scale of one to 10, in terms of interest and excitement, it
probably will get a pretty low score. One has to wonder what happened to
the good, old-fashioned, robust political debate that used to take place in
this House.

I think the only interesting moments in this debate so far, apart from the
DA members who spoke, of course ... [Laughter.] ... were when the hon
leader of Cope lost his place in his speech, the hon Buthelezi did a jig at
the podium, and the hon Madikizela-Mandela spoke. A callback from the past!
And then, of course, just to liven things up a little bit, the Deputy
Minister of Home Affairs really did make some very silly remarks about DA
policy and the media.

The reason why I mention this at all is because my job in this debate is to
take on the ANC, the governing party, who may have said some pretty ugly
remarks about the DA during the course of this debate. But nothing has
happened. It is really terribly, terribly disappointing indeed. [Laughter.]

I have to admit that I stand here with very little to say, but I want to
say to the hon Manuel and the hon Nzimande that they could have been given
the pleasure of speaking before me because I would no doubt have had lots
to say. But that’s life.

Mr President, you have been on a charm offensive, as you know, not only
you, personally, but also through your Ministers. The change of tone in the
debates generally in this Parliament and in the Budget Vote debates has
really been very noticeable indeed.

It is clear, sir, that your slogan, “Working together, we can do more”, is
on the surface, at least, meant also to include the opposition parties, and
it is indeed interesting to note that every Minister now talks positively
about the opposition and encourages us. This is quite amazing. They
encourage us to point out government errors and to put questions to them
and their Ministries. Mr President, I promise you, we will not let you
down, we will put many questions to the Ministers in the months and years
to come.

But quite frankly, the change is noticeable and most welcome. Because we
are an opposition, that does not mean that we are unpatriotic, as some
members of the ANC have tried to claim over the years. We are all proud
South Africans. We have only the interest of this country at heart.

The fact that we may approach the problems from a different point of view
and offer different solutions to the many and varying problems of this
country, should never lead to our patriotism being questioned, and we
appreciate the change very much indeed. But obviously it does not mean that
the opposition parties, and the DA in particular, are up for sale or for co-
option.

The DA has a proud history of providing an honest, hardworking opposition
to the government and holding the executive to account at all times. We are
now equally proud of our achievement in winning the Western Cape and being
in government in this province. We are confident that we will show the ANC
how to govern over the next five years. [Applause.] It will indeed be a
fascinating time as JZ and HZ govern the respective governments with their
different styles. In five years’ time the voters will have a fascinating
choice to make between two very different styles indeed.
In conclusion, Mr President, I do want to say that we do welcome the
changes that you have brought to government. We appreciate very much the
attitudes to the opposition parties, and we do look forward to working very
closely with you. Thank you very much indeed. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING: Chairperson, Mr President,
Deputy President, hon members and comrades, I welcome the opportunity to
participate in this important budget debate. This is not my maiden speech,
so I’m continuing where I left off in 1999.

I would like to address an important matter that the President has
consistently and correctly raised: How to minimise the impact of the
current global economic crisis on the most vulnerable.

Umyalezo wethu Sihlalo, obalulekile namhlanje ukuthi lengxaki esikuyo
yezomnotho, yinkinga edalwe ngongxowa akungabi-ke abantu bakithi
abahluphekayo okufanele kube yibona abakhokhayo bekhokhela inkinga
engadalwanga yibona. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, our message which is important regarding the financial crisis
that we are in today is that it was created by the rich people. Our poor
people must not be the ones who are paying for the problem which was not
created by them.]

In order also to appreciate the enormity of the challenges at hand, it is
important that we must properly understand the genesis of the current
economic crisis. It can be argued that its genesis is two-fold: Firstly,
crises are no accidents, but are inherent in the capitalist system itself,
as it is by its very nature a system sustained through the exploitation of
a global impoverished majority by an increasingly globalised privileged
minority; its unsustainable levels of consumption; the enormous ecological
damage it inflicts on our environment as a result of its insatiable pursuit
of private profit; and the accompanying cycles of overproduction and
underconsumption.

But the most immediate genesis of this crisis was the unregulated financial
markets in the US and the crass capitalism that sought to extract maximum
returns from those who could least afford it, starting in the subprime
housing market. The burden and suffering of this has proportionately fallen
on the workers and the poor, with millions of job losses across the world.
This constitutes incontrovertible proof that contemporary neoliberal
approaches to the global economy have failed.

In fact, it strikes me that when I left Parliament, there was an
organisation here called the Democratic Party, DP; now I come back and
there is an organisation here called the DA. I had thought that the poverty
that faces the majority of our people constitutes the biggest threat to our
country, but there is another form of poverty that is coming a close second
– the poverty of ideas from the hon Trollip and the Chief Whip of the DA.
Here is an opportunity provided by the President to say this is what we
want, to try and improve the functioning of government as well as to co-
ordinate government better. There are absolutely no ideas.

It is interesting, in fact, that most of the ideas that were pushed by the
DA are the very same ideas that have led to the current global economic
crisis that we face, but they are unable to tell us how to get out of this.
[Interjections.] In any case, the less said about that, the better.

Our starting point in dealing with this crisis must be the framework
agreement collectively agreed to by Nedlac. This document correctly argues
that low-income workers, the unemployed and the vulnerable groups can lose
much through even a relatively brief economic shock. It can destabilise
their welfare, including their jobs, health and education, and increase
inequality and poverty; and that our first concern must be to avoid these
outcomes.

We are very proud that South Africa is just about the only country in the
world that adopted a collective approach to this crisis. Therefore
Parliament has a very crucial role to ensure that indeed this agreement is
implemented. Parliament should play its oversight role so that it becomes
part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.

The framework agreement also differs from most responses in other parts of
the world in that it is anchored around a state-led, multibillion rand
investment into infrastructure, including EPWPs. The significance of this
strategy is threefold: Firstly, it is not a bailout-driven strategy,
necessary as bailouts may be; secondly, it rests on a job-creating
strategy, including skills training and retraining; and thirdly, it
underlines that state-owned enterprises are vital in our economic
development agenda, now and into the future.

These are all key elements of an integrated industrial strategy. The
framework agreement also continues to commit to protecting and expanding
decent work and maintains that the conditions of the workers and the poor
have to be addressed directly, through employment creation programmes,
promoting sustainable livelihoods, public investment, and effective social
relief and support.

South Africa has now entered its first postapartheid recession. The global
economic situation presents for South Africa both constraints and
opportunities. It is for this reason that we need both defensive and
offensive strategies in response to the crisis. These require a bold
vision, not dictated to by the intellectual and policy bankruptcy of the
very same forces that brought about this crisis.

The best way to protect the vulnerable is to keep workers’ jobs and create
new ones. The framework agreement commits us to minimising retrenchments,
as well as investment in public infrastructure. We want to assure you,
Deputy President, that in so far as the national human resources
development strategy is concerned, my department is indeed going to be
working closely with your office in order to make sure that this strategy
does two things at the same time: contributing to dealing with the
immediate crises, but also laying a foundation for building the productive
capacity of South Africa’s economy.

Government is also committed to accelerating essential social transfers,
including increasing access to free basic services, such as water and
electricity, to the poor. Government will also, through the framework
agreement, progressively and steadily, starting in 2009, extend the Child
Support Grant to age 18 – to be phased in, as captured in the agreement.

An even bigger effort is called for on the part of public sector workers to
ensure that all social assistance programmes by government are vigorously
and timeously delivered. The progressive sections of the organised working
class understand clearly what we mean when we say this, that this is a call
to revolutionary duty to deepen and defend our democracy.

I am not talking about fly-by-night trade unions that are being formed
through the newspapers every day. [Applause.] I am talking about a
genuinely revolutionary trade union movement.
The framework agreement also emphasises the importance of co-operatives.
This is something that has huge potential in our country and we need to
make sure that we strengthen this. I would also like to turn our attention
to something that we are not talking enough about: This crisis originated
in the financial sector and spread to affect the rest of the economy, but
we seem to have forgotten now about looking at our own financial sector.
What role is it playing in the light of the call by the President to say
that working together, we need to tackle this crisis.

Worryingly, we hear that the most vulnerable workers are prematurely taking
retrenchment packages; banks are repossessing 6 000 cars and 4 000 houses a
month, and auctioning off properties. The National Credit Regulator has
received over 80 000 applications for debt counselling, and continues to
receive them at a rate of 7 500 per month. Of those, 60% include debts for
mortgage bonds from banks averaging R500 000.

This means that R16 billion in mortgages is affected by debt counselling,
yet, unfortunately, the banks are obstructing the debt counselling process.
This has forced the National Credit Regulator to go to court to seek a
declaratory order to restructure these debts, as banks are refusing to co-
operate. I think it is important that we call for the banks to engage in
the Financial Sector Charter Council to discuss concrete ways to shield
consumers from losing their homes and other possessions.

Most consumers, in any case, are in trouble because of credit extended
during the wave of reckless lending by banks immediately before the
National Credit Act was passed in 2007. [Applause.] The Governor of the
Reserve Bank has recently and correctly expressed his frustration at the
high interest rates charged by all our banks. The Competition Commission
has found that bank charges in South Africa are excessively high, with no
competition amongst banks.

It was the private financial institutions in the first place that got us
where we are, and therefore we need to closely examine how our own banks
are conducting themselves in this period of deep economic crisis. That is
why we are saying we should go back to the Financial Sector Charter Council
and actually discuss the role, hon Trollip, that these banks should be
playing in a collective manner through structures that have been created to
deal with this.

Credit bureau blacklisting is proceeding as if we do not appreciate the
economic crisis. Should we not be having a national debate on the need for
a moratorium on blacklisting of those directly affected by the recession?

Only if all of us collectively and positively respond to this crisis shall
we minimise its impact on the workers and the poor in our country. That is
why this Budget must be supported, because it is about improving and co-
ordinating better government performance under the leadership of our
President.
There is one plea I would like to make, maybe not to you, hon Mfundisi
Dandala, but directly maybe to the gentleman sitting next to you.
[Laughter.] Frankly, I think Cope must stop lecturing us on democracy. You
have not gone through a single democratic process since your convention.
[Applause.] You are sitting here in this Parliament on a list that was
concocted at Emperor’s Palace behind people’s backs. I think that we need
to follow what uMama Madikizela-Mandela was saying, that we do need to
build people’s power in order to have democracy. You can’t tell me that an
organisation born out of fleeing from democracy in Polokwane has a right to
come and tell us about democracy. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Is there a point of order? Hon
Minister, would you please take your seat?

Mr M S SHILOWA: Chairperson, on a point of order: I object and call for a
point of order on the member saying we are sitting here on the basis of
having run away from democracy. [Interjections.] We are sitting here on the
basis of 1,3 million votes. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING: It is not a point of order,
it is a different point of view that he wants to place. I think it is also
important to say to the Chief Whip of the DA that it is a shame when an hon
Member of Parliament wakes up in the morning to come and participate in the
debate on the basis of what he has read in the newspapers, because it is
not true.

Let me just clarify the issue of free education for you that we are talking
about. The ANC’s manifesto states that there should be free education up to
first tertiary qualification for poor students, and no student who is
deserving, but poor, must be denied an opportunity to access tertiary
education.

[Applause.] That is not free education for the rich.

Laba abanemali abahambe bazikhokhele izingane zabo, khona sizokwazi
ukuyokhela lezi zingane eziqhamuka emakhaya la kuhlushekwa khona.
Ngiyabonga kakhulu Sihlalo. [Those who have money must go and pay for their
children so that we can pay for the children from poor families. Thank you
very much, Chairperson.]

[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Thank you, hon Minister. Just to get
back to the point of order, we don’t think it was a point of order, because
the hon speaker said “their party”. He did not mention any person in
particular. So it was a reflection on a particular party. In that way then,
there was no point of order.

Mr M S SHILOWA: Chairperson, with due respect to the ruling, I would like
it to be checked against the Hansard. He said he was not directing this to
Dr Dandala, but to the gentleman sitting next to Dr Dandala. He then said,
and I want you to check the Hansard, “You are sitting here on the basis of
a list concocted,” and there was no such a thing. I want you to check the
Hansard and then give us the ruling.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): There is another point of order.

THE MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, on a point of order:
Will you please ask the member to remove his hands from his pockets when
addressing hon members? [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Hon members, we will have a look at
the Hansard and then we will come back to it in another sitting. It does
happen sometimes that members do speak with their hands in their pockets
and there is no rule in Parliament on whether this is unparliamentary or
not.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: Chairperson,
Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President, hon members, it’s a bit
disappointing when Mike Ellis finds nothing to rile me with so late in the
afternoon. President Zuma, in announcing his new Cabinet last month,
established a Ministry for Planning in the Presidency. Before discussing
the broad objectives, key institutions and the proposed Green Paper, I wish
to briefly sketch the context and rationale that gave rise to the need for
a planning Ministry.

Countries that have grown rapidly over two to three generations have often
had clear strategies which required difficult trade-offs and a careful
sequencing of policies. Often, long-run growth and development requires
long-term investments in people, in democratic institutions and in
infrastructure. Countries are often reluctant to make correct trade-offs,
because trade-offs sometimes imply pain in the short-term or pain for some
people, with long-term uncertainty. If a country chooses to spend more on
education, it must spend less on something else. If a country chooses to
invest more, it must consume less.

Governments all over the world are confronted with this dilemma of how to
make trade-offs that involve long-term benefits and short-term pain.
Democracies instinctively deal with policies that provide benefits within a
single term of office. But many of the challenges that confront us today
require a much longer-term perspective.

Addressing our skills constraints requires a long-term perspective.
Reducing unemployment requires a long-term strategy. Reducing CO2 emissions
requires a long-term plan. Addressing our future water and food
requirements requires long-term plans that have opportunity costs in the
short-term with payoffs in the longer term.

The creation of a planning Ministry in the Presidency is about
incorporating these ideas into our policy thinking and enabling government
to make long-term investments, even though the return may accrue long after
we’ve left office. Most importantly, it is about governments learning to do
better.

A government which is focused on the development imperative and on
improving both the quantity and quality of services to citizens must place
an emphasis on its own learning. Much of this learning arises from the
rigour of analysis of the implementation of its policies. The authors,
Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart, in their book, Fixing Failed States, share
the following observation of how things fall apart. They observe that -


   Various centres of power vie for control, multiple decision-making
   processes confuse priorities, citizens lose trust in the government,
   institutions lose their legitimacy, and the populace is disenfranchised.
   In the most extreme cases, violence results. This negative cycle creates
   a sovereignty gap.

It is this fragmentation that we seek to avoid and now, against this
backdrop, I would like to address myself briefly to the comments in the
speech this afternoon by the hon Leader of the Opposition. I am a bit
worried, mama, you’ve owned him as your son; I praised him the last time
and he’s off the rails already. [Laughter.]

You see, when we express, as you did this afternoon, hon Trollip, a
resistance to ideas for change that are premised on equity, when we express
a yearning for the status quo ante, then we linger back to the days of
apartheid, of deep inequality and we try to block democracy.

In any government anywhere in the world – and you can look at parliaments
across the world, the trend is the same – there will be ideas, embryonic;
they find resonance within a government and are taken forward. Part of
taking the ideas forward is to formulate legislation. That legislation is
not imposed by edict or decree. They go to a democratically elected
parliament where they are debated, amended and then adopted.

There is nothing wrong with it; in fact, it is kernel to the existence of
democracy, but many of the Bills you spoke of this afternoon don’t even
exist. So we will credit you for having such a fruitful imagination, but
many of the Bills that you spoke of don’t even exist. [Interjections.]

If we want to deal with the issues, then wait. Don’t construct the straw
man and don’t open the debate on the national health insurance when there
aren’t even ideas on the table. The Minister of Health in the debate on the
state of the nation address said, “Please don’t shoot it down”.

Allow us to formulate the ideas - that will be done in closed rooms. Once
the ideas have been clarified and tested and there is a collective
responsibility of government, when we bring it to Parliament, there will be
an opportunity to debate it. Don’t shoot it down, because you should not be
party to denying the fundamentals of democracy in this country. [Applause.]

I can tell you about the 17th amendment as well, and I would invite you to
look at the Gazette of 15 June and see the preconditions set out in the
17th amendment and then, sir, you will understand how wrong you were in
what you said here this afternoon. But we will leave that for when the 17th
amendment is debated after there has been public comment on the issue. I
do, however, invite you to read that Gazette, sir.

To sketch the context for the planning Ministry, allow me to outline what
the broad roles and functions of the Presidency are in relation to
planning. To do this, we need to locate the functioning of the Presidency
in our system of government. The seat of the executive of government is
Cabinet, headed by the President. The executive arm of government has to
operate collectively. This implies that key decisions are taken
collectively and members of the executive share collective responsibility
and accountability for the decisions of the executive.

What you need to understand is that the hon Nzimande can’t say anything to
criticise me in public, because we are collectively responsible for the
same things.

The Presidency has many functions, three of which are key in setting out
the context today. The first is the policy coherence function: It is the
task of the Presidency to ensure policy coherence throughout government,
that policies support the overall objectives of government, that
inconsistent policies are changed, unintended consequences are recognised
and managed, and contradictory policy outcomes in government are minimised.


A strategic approach to planning that sets out a coherent vision backed by
clear and measurable targets and programmes does not materialise out of
thin air. Institutions and mechanisms are needed. The economist, James K
Galbraith, sets out the argument for planning thus:


  The experience of the wider world even - that of the most despised
  countries — provides no general case against economic planning and also
  none in favour of unfettered markets as a substitute for the planning
  system. On the contrary, it shows that in a properly designed system,
  planning and markets do not contradict each other. They are not mutually
  exclusive. Rather, the choice of one or another for any particular problem
  is a matter of what works best for the purpose. It’s a question of a
  social and political division of labour, of what tools are needed for what
  goal.

It is this background that a number of members here, the hon Dandala, the
hon Buthelezi, hon De Lille and also the hon Meshoe, refer to. It’s
correct; planning has to be a core part of democracy. You shouldn’t want to
throw it overboard because it used to have the term “central” and that was
a kind of swear word. Planning has to be part of what we do. Hence the
output of the planning function is clear direction, a coherent vision for
the future supported by medium and long-term plans.

These plans should encapsulate the priorities of government and
articulation of the policy trade-offs it faces and its key policy choices.
These plans and policy choices are to be made by the executive,
collectively. The role of the Presidency is to lead the process of
developing a coherent agenda and plan for government.

The second role of the Presidency is to ensure that the agreed-upon agenda
is reflected in the work and priorities of all of government, to ensure
policy co-ordination in government. In any system, individual Ministers,
government departments, provinces, municipalities, state enterprises and
other agencies should shape their actions in terms of an overall agenda or
plan. This policy co-ordination function is carried out through Cabinet
directly by the President, through cabinet committees, through clusters of
Directors-General, through Minmecs, the President’s Co-ordinating Council,
through the budget and numerous other institutions and processes in
government.

The policy co-ordination function is critical to ensure that government’s
agenda is implemented with the vigour and consistency that citizens expect,
and hence it is located in the Presidency. In summary, it is about driving
the agenda of government.

The third function is the performance management function: The Presidency
must develop the capability to monitor the performance of government, to
evaluate the impact of programmes and to intervene where performance is
suboptimal. This function is not about removing the accountability that
vests in individual Ministers, provinces or municipalities. It is a
recognition that citizens expect more and better from their government and
holds the executive collectively responsible for delivery. There are
several techniques to drive better performance, the details of which will
emerge in the next few weeks.

Our marching orders here are the clear focus on performance and
accountability set out by President Zuma in his state of the nation
address. Two elements in his tool box are the ability to set clear targets
linked to government’s priorities and to intervene to unblock institutional
blockages to better performance.

These three functions of the Presidency are, obviously, interlinked. They
cannot be separated through artificial barriers. Government’s plan and
priorities must drive the setting of targets. Assessments of performance
must feed into the co-ordination role of government and inform what the
agenda should be in various government clusters. Information gleaned in the
monitoring function informs government’s agenda and the agenda determines
what is measured and monitored.

President Zuma, Deputy President Motlanthe, Minister Chabane and I have
collective responsibility for these three roles. We are politically
accountable for these roles. However, all Ministers, Parliament and each
institution in government are also accountable for performance and delivery
and have specific responsibilities to ensure that government indeed
achieves its objectives.

Minister Chabane and I have agreed to release two Green Papers at about the
same time: One dealing with planning and co-ordination and the other
dealing with performance monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of these
Green Papers is to provide all stakeholders with a sense of government’s
thinking in this regard and provide them with an opportunity to input into
the process of deciding how these functions will be performed.

It is like legislation, hon Trollip. We don’t come here and say, “Let’s
think about what we should put in the Green Paper”. We take a few ideas,
put them together and say let’s have a discussion about it. That’s how
democracy works. Welcome.

The precise role and function of the Planning Ministry and the  National
Planning Commission, as well as the importance of a national strategic plan
and vision that has the support and backing of the wider society, will be
outlined in the Green Paper to be released for discussion, probably by the
end of July or perhaps early August. It is intended that this Green Paper
will be presented to Parliament as a discussion document. So we look
forward to your engagement on these matters, because we need an active
discussion about it.

Let me turn now to one or two of the specifics of the planning function.
The planning function will co-ordinate the process whereby government
develops its long-term vision and plan. This long-term plan must take into
account the key long-term challenges facing our country and articulate the
vision for the type of society that South Africans desire.

The process whereby Cabinet collectively agrees to the MTSF is the second
major task of the planning function. This document sets out government’s
priorities, informs resource allocations and provides a framework for the
sequences of programmes and reforms. The MTSF then needs to be broken down
into detailed outcomes that can be used to inform the priorities of
government. For example, if the MTEF says that raising the literacy rate of
Grade 3 school learners is important, then this is what the Presidency will
measure, and this is what will inform interactions between the Minister of
Basic Education and the Presidency, certainly acting through Minister
Chabane, in the instance.
The Planning Ministry has a key role to play in building the organisational
and technical capability of the state to ensure government delivers on its
policy commitments. We envisage the creation of a point of synthesis in the
Presidency, which would develop links with organisations such as the
Development Bank of South Africa, DBSA, the Human Sciences Research
Council, HSRC, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, CSIR,
and other science councils, universities and relevant think tanks to
provide expert opinion on long-term developmental issues such as water
security, climate change, food security, defence capability and migration.

The expertise exists in the country and does not have to be replicated in
the Presidency. What we do need is the capacity to commission research, to
synthesise the evidence and to be able to feed these into the policy
processes in government.

There is also a need to encourage a more systematic approach to long-term
planning in government and in state-owned enterprises.  This is
particularly true in sectors such as spatial planning, energy, transport
and water security, where long-term perspectives are vitally important.
This is critical for private sector investment, too. Investment in the
mining sector requires policy certainty and energy security in the energy
sector. Land-use planning and agricultural investments are, obviously,
intertwined.

What will the planning function not do? I would like to say to the hon
Meshoe, in his absence, the planning function will not set government up
for failure. We haven’t come here, we haven’t fought a hard battle, we
haven’t won the trust of the electorate of South Africa to come here and
say that now we are going to set up a Tower of Babel, now we will self-
destruct, and we want to fail to serve the people. We will do everything
but that.

There is a notion floating around in some circles that the Presidency will
take over existing planning responsibilities from national departments and
state-owned enterprises, SOEs, and even from provincial and local
governments. I have heard the hon Ellis say that the Planning Ministry will
even have to do the dental implants in hens to prepare for the day when the
DA rules.

As my preceding points on the role and functions of the Planning Ministry
show, nothing could be further from the truth. Microplanning and sectoral
planning will not be undertaken from the centre. Rather, the Planning
Ministry will seek to encourage, support and harness sectoral and
subnational strategic plan-making and initiatives – I think you should
prepare a sepia copy. It is going to be very, very, very old before it ever
sees the light of day – and mainstream these within the national planning
process.

That is giving concrete expression to sectoral priorities and priorities
emanating from provinces and municipalities. I just need to bring others
into play. This picture that Mike Ellis has here is of a hen with teeth.
It’s because I said to him that the DA is becoming the government in this
country – there is a better chance of hens growing teeth. So, they’ve now
produced a hen with teeth, but it is still not likely. [Laughter.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, as I said to hon Manuel once before, this is
photographic proof of the fact that hens do grow teeth, and he will know
very soon that the DA is governing the whole country, not just the Western
Cape. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: And pigs
will fly but not give flu! [Laughter.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I’ve got a photograph of a pig flying, too.
[Laughter.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY - NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: A further
misconception that has been created is that the Presidency will play the
role of gatekeeper for plans and that all government institutions would be
required to get clearance from The Presidency before any plan is adopted.
This would be both foolish and undesirable, let alone totally impractical,
leading to massive delays in implementation. On the contrary, the task of
the Presidency would be to ensure that the quality of planning by
government departments, SOEs and provincial and local governments achieves
a high standard, and that the quality of planning in these institutions
continues to improve.

Finally, Chairperson, there are many questions that will still have to be
answered. The administration has only been in place for six weeks. We
request patience and space to be able to work through this very complex set
of issues. We are not taking them lightly, and we aren’t being silly about
them. But I think that we learnt from our own experience, and there are
certain issues of security that are fundamentally important to the future
of this country, water being one amongst many. In several cases, Ministers
have to sit down together and work out who does what. Some of these are not
straight-line functions.

If you want to deal with water, you need the Minister of Water and
Environmental Affairs, but you also need the Minister of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries. You need the Ministry of Mining; you need the
Ministry of Energy; you need Co-operative Governance; you need Science and
Technology.

There are a series of different things that we have to do together, and
these are the solutions we must provide, drawing on the quality, expertise
and research that is available in this country. It is these kinds of tasks
that I think we must understand to together define our collective
commitment as public representatives of the people, to democracy, not just
for now, but into the future.
So, as we deal with these issues, I want to assure the House that we will
be guided by a spirit of co-operation and collective accountability. Turf
wars are simply unacceptable. It will take time to resolve some of these
issues and construct the proper fit, and I think we want to say to Members
of Parliament, in good conscience, that we will work at this and continue
to work at it because it is quite an unprecedented undertaking.

We are working tirelessly to refine the system of government to define our
roles and allocate responsibilities. In some ways, this is an ongoing
process, a process of perpetual improvement. In other ways, some of the
institutions are new and require time to mature. I assure you that we will
involve this entire House and other stakeholders in discussions on these
critical issues facing our country. The Green Paper processes will
contribute towards refining the way in which the centre of government
works.

Our endeavours, hon members, are premised on the need to strengthen
democracy, to strengthen the trust that citizens have in this democratic
government and its institutions. Our efforts are for a better democracy,
capable of anticipating and responding to the needs of all of our citizens.
The budget of the Presidency is about providing all of this to improve on
the quality of our democracy, and we ask that you support it as you have
indicated this afternoon. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Thank you, hon Minister. Order! That
concludes the speakers’ list. The President will reply to the debate
tomorrow.
The House adjourned at 19:03.
