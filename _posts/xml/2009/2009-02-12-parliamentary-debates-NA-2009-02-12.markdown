  CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON REMOVAL FROM OR RESTORATION TO OFFICE
               OF THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

  (Report of Ad Hoc Joint Committee to consider matters in terms of Section
                12 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act)

Mr O E MONARENG: Deputy Speaker, esteemed members of the Cabinet, hon
Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the committee,
allow me to present a report dealing with the decision of the President to
dismiss, or remove from office, the National Director of Public
Prosecutions, Adv Pikoli.
As we all know, Adv Vusi Pikoli was  first  suspended  from  office  by  the
President, Thabo  Mbeki,  on  23  September  2007.  Following  this,  on  28
September 2007, an inquiry, chaired by Dr Frene Ginwala, was established  in
terms of section 12(6)(a) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, Act  32
of 1998, with terms of reference, dated 3 October 2007, to determine:

   2.1.     The fitness of Adv V Pikoli  to  hold  the  office  of  National
            Director, in particular –


   2.1.1.   Whether he, in exercising his discretion to prosecute offenders,
            had sufficient regard to the nature and extent  of  the  threat
            posed by organized  crime  to  the  national  security  of  the
            Republic.




   2.1.2.    Whether  he,  in  taking  decisions  to  grant  immunity   from
            prosecution to, or enter  into,  inter  alia,  plea  bargaining
            arrangements  with,  persons  who  are  allegedly  involved  in
            illegal  activities  which  constitute  organised   crime,   as
            contemplated in the Act, took due regard to the public interest
            and  the  national  security  interests  of  the  Republic,  as
            contemplated in section 198 of the Constitution, as well as the
            Prosecution Policy.




   2.2.     Whether the relationship between the National Director  and  the
            Minister has irretrievably broken down. In particular,


   2.2.1.   Whether he failed to appreciate the nature  and  extent  of  the
            Constitutional and legal oversight powers of the Minister  over
            the prosecuting authority and such other matters as may  relate
            to the fitness and propriety of the National Director  to  hold
            office.




So, you can, ladies and gentlemen, realise  that  the  aspects  which  I  am
dealing  with  are  actually  the  terms  of  reference  for   the   Ginwala
Commission. After completing  its  work,  the  Ginwala  inquiry  produced  a
written report on 4 November 2008. On 8 December  2008,  having  regard  for
the work of the inquiry, and after receiving  further  representations  from
Adv Pikoli in respect of  the  report,  the  President,  Kgalema  Motlanthe,
decided to remove Adv Pikoli from office in terms of section  12  (6)(a)  of
the Act. The aforementioned  decision  was  communicated  to  Parliament  in
December 2008, as provided for by section 12(6) (b) of the Act. So,  what  I
am saying is  that  I  am  just  trying  to  give  an  overview  as  to  the
background. When the matter was referred to  Parliament,  an  Ad  Hoc  Joint
Committee was constituted, which had to be co-chaired by myself and the  hon
Kgoshi Mokoena.



The following members were appointed from the National Assembly:


   Burgess, CV (ANC); Carrim, YI (ANC); De Lille, P (ID); Delport, JT  (DA);
   Komphela, BM (ANC); Joubert, LK (DA); Maake, JJ (Alt) (ANC);  Magwanishe,
   GB (ANC); Moloi-Moropa, JC (ANC); Monareng, OE (ANC); Nyambi,  AJ  (ANC);
   Sibhidla, NN (ANC); Swart, SN (ACDP); and Van der Merwe, JH (IFP).

Then we have members  who  were  appointed  from  the  National  Council  of
Provinces:

   Dlulane, BN (ANC); Douglas, WM (ACDP); le Roux,  WJ  (DA);  Mazibuko,  NF
   (ANC); Mokoena; Kgoshi ML (ANC); Moseki, AJL (ANC); Ntuli, ZC (ANC); Tau,
   RT (ANC); and van Heerden, FJ (FF Plus).

So, what we need to know is that we have this  overview  and  the  committee
had to go through a process,  and  the  process  suggested  that  we  should
follow some procedure. On 9 January 2009, where we had to follow  the  legal
process, it is clear that on 8  January  the  matter  was  referred  to  the
National Assembly. The Speaker made the announcement  and  the  appointments
were duly made. So, there was a procedure which was followed.

The committee, in proceeding with its work, had  regard  to  the  following:
The letter and the supporting documentation from  the  President  explaining
the reasons for the removal of Adv Pikoli; the Ginwala  Inquiry  Report  and
the addendums to the report; the oral presentations to  the  committee  from
Adv Pikoli;  the  oral  presentations  from  the  Minister  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, Enver Surty, and  the  Director-General  in  the
Presidency, Rev Frank Chikane; the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence
Report on  the  Special  Browse  Mole  Consolidated  Report  as  adopted  by
Parliament in November 2007; then, also deliberations from the committee.

So, what has happened is that we had to follow a process where
presentations were made by Adv Pikoli to the joint committee. That was on
27 January 2009. The following day a presentation was made by the Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development and, at the same time, a
presentation was made by the Presidency. So, it is important to realise
that the matter we are poised with has a very tough and difficult
background and history. It was not a matter which was an easy matter. So,
for the first time we had a chairperson, with such a difficult and daunting
task, who had to sit and deal with the issue.

So, it is important to note the arguments which were put forward by the
opposition. The opposition parties will put their case when they talk here
– the ANC did, so I just want to proceed now. It is imperative that the
responsibilities of the committee should also include the consideration of
the representations made by Pikoli to the President, because the committee
has to satisfy itself that Adv Pikoli was afforded an opportunity to make a
presentation to the President before the President arrived at his decision
to remove him from office.

Indeed, Adv Pikoli did make a representation to the President through a
document entitled “Submissions to the President – Mr Pikoli’s Fitness for
Office,” dated 24 November 2008. The President acted correctly in providing
Pikoli with an opportunity to make representations and to speak as to how
he responds to the inquiry’s criticism of his lack of appreciation of
national security issues.

In so doing, the President also heeded the recommendation of the inquiry
that Pikoli must be sensitised to the broader responsibilities of the NDPP.
Adv Pikoli did not only fail to appreciate the sensitivity of national
security issues to the inquiry and to the President, and that led him to be
removed from office. He then failed for the third time when he appeared
before the ad hoc committee in Parliament.

It has to be said that the inquiry stated its findings on paragraph 349
that –

   Having considered all the matters above, the basis advanced by government
   for the suspension of Adv Pikoli has not been established through the
   evidence admitted to the inquiry.

The inquiry went further to make a recommendation on page 212 that –

   As the government has failed to substantiate the reasons given for
   suspension, Adv Pikoli should be restored to the office of the NDPP. Adv
   Pikoli needs to be sensitised to the broader responsibility of his office
   and, in particular, to enhance his understanding of the security
   environment in which that office should function.

The committee has to note that the inquiry stated that government has
failed to provide substantive reasons for the suspension. The inquiry was
not called to determine the issue of Pikoli’s suspension, but was supposed
to have confined itself to the terms of reference that required
determination of his fitness to hold office which are contained in
paragraph 2 of the executive summary of the report.

The committee has to note that the content of the letter of suspension and
the terms of reference cannot be substituted for each other. Therefore, the
terms of reference remain the lawful yardstick or barometer that should be
utilised to test or analyse the evidence adduced and submitted at the
inquiry. Parliament is under a constitutional obligation to correctly put
into perspective the role and mandate of the inquiry.

A distinction needs to be made with regard to Pikoli’s experience and
exposure to matters of national security and to the actual or practical
manner in which he handled matters of national security. One can go as far
as to say that his experience and exposure to matters of national security
did not translate into competency or, rather, he failed to convert his
experience and exposure to a demonstrable benefit in the performance of his
work. The inquiry found that he failed on four counts to demonstrate
appreciation to operate within a strict security environment and failed to
take into account the community interest in a manner that does not
compromise national security.

Ginwala listed the following deficiencies that capture his lack of
appreciation of national security issues, notwithstanding his experience
and exposure to matters of national security: His failure to timeously
inform the Minister and the President prior to resorting to the courts to
obtain warrants in cases that could have an impact on national security;
his failure to recognise the integrity of official documents could only be
maintained through strict compliance with the Minimum Information Security
Standards, MISS; his failure to ensure that all Directorate of Special
Operations, DSO, investigators and other relevant National Prosecuting
Authority, NPA, staff had the requisite security clearances, and that
renewals of such security status are conducted regularly; and his failure
to ensure that third party service providers, especially private security
companies, were vetted.
I just want to conclude by saying that the committee accepted the decision
of the President to fire Adv Pikoli. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, this Parliament is about to commit a
serious travesty of justice. This Parliament cannot in good conscience take
steps today to put the final nail in the coffin of the career of a man who
cannot be shown and has not been shown to be in dereliction of his duty.

I have various reasons for saying so: First of all, a flawed process was
followed – a flawed legal process. If you look at the Act, it prescribes a
suspension, then an inquiry, then a report to Parliament, then a final
finding by Parliament. But these - the suspension, the inquiry, the
President’s removal and his report - form a legally integrated process. You
cannot start with a certain reason, then change the reasons as you go
along, and that is exactly what has happened in this case. The original
suspension and the final recommendation have nothing to do with one
another; it is a flawed process.

Secondly, how do we get around the fact that the Ginwala Commission found
Pikoli to be a fit and proper person in that she says the following:

  He impressed me as a person of unimpeachable integrity. He impressed me
  as a man of unquestionable integrity with passion to execute his
  constitutional responsibilities without fear, favour or prejudice,
  unimpeachable integrity and credibility.

Then in the end, despite the fact that she found that he was insensitive -
and I’ll come to that - to matters of national security, she recommends
that he be reinstated in his post and she specifically finds that she would
go as far as to make certain recommendations in the handling of matters of
so-called national security. Let me immediately say that we should deal
with the issue of national security.

I thought that with the end of the P W Botha era we heard the end of
national security as the reason given for every travesty of justice. Yet it
has now once again been taken out of the grave by this government. Before I
go any further, I also want to point to the travesty of justice done to the
opposition parties. According to the Rules of Parliament regarding the
opposition, where there is no consensus or when a decision is not
unanimous, the views of the opposition and of the minority must be
reflected. We were given time to prepare, we prepared as combined
opposition parties a document in which we aired the views of the opposition
parties in the committee. We were simply outvoted, but this document will
go public, we will show to what extent the whole process was flawed and the
fact that we were simply outvoted will not go into the report. What goes
into the report is the officials’ view of what the opposition said.
[Interjections.] How ludicrous can you get? The majority party will decide
what the views of the opposition are. Is this where we have now arrived at?
At a point where government will decide what the opposition must say. How
we can accept that? How can you sit there, hon members of government, and
endorse that once again? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, please take your seat. Hon members, I
request that we allow the debate to proceed. We are not going to have a
good debate if we all speak at the same time. Please continue, hon member.

Dr J T DELPORT: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your protection. I
come to the last aspect, and that is the damning indication that there was
a persecution of the governance of Pikoli. In his evidence before us, the
hon Director-General Chikane testified that he was present at the final
conversation between Pikoli and the then president and he informed us that
the reason why he was eventually suspended was because he was not willing
to give the President two weeks in order to prepare the environment. He
insisted on arresting Selebi after a week.

There is one thing, and I put it to the relevant person myself: If that is
so, if the reason was not the arrest of Selebi, but the two weeks you
needed, if that was what you were not happy with, and not the arrest, why
didn’t you say that to him? Why didn’t you give that as the reason for his
suspension? Why didn’t you write that to the Minister? What did you write
to the Minister of Justice to get the information as to why Selebi would be
arrested? What did the Minister then do? The Minister wrote to Pikoli
saying, “I want your reasons and you must not proceed with the arrest
before you place that information before us.”

I don’t want to comment on this, but I can only say that no reasonable
person can ever think or accept that the reason was not the arrest, but the
period of two weeks. Because he needed two weeks, it is sensitive national
security at play if Selebi is being arrested. Today again my honoured
colleague here spoke about national security. What national security is
there if you want to arrest the Commissioner of Police on criminal charges?
National security – I want to say again what my “ouma” [grandmother] always
used to say: “Hygend hert!” [Good grief!] [Laughter.] That’s all I can say.

We take further note of the fact that the Minister for Justice at the time
did not appear before Ginwala or before our committee. The present Minister
for Justice and Constitutional Development appeared and he was of little
help to us. Why did the previous Minister not appear? Her letter to Pikoli
stands unexplained. Why was she not there to explain why she wrote to him,
“Stop. You don’t arrest the man. I want to see your reasons. Bring me your
reasons. Bring me your evidence.” She was interfering directly with his
independence. It was a blatant interference with the independence of the
National Director and, after looking at all the evidence presented at the
Ginwala Commission and at the evidence before us, all the opposition
parties present came to the conclusion that the real reason for the
suspension of Pikoli was the arrest of Selebi. That was not a sound reason.
That is not an acceptable reason. That is the reason that you, as
Parliament, must put under scrutiny today. Was that an acceptable reason or
not in terms of the law? It was not an acceptable reason. It was not a
valid reason. What happens here today is, and will go down – luckily, not
on my conscience – as a travesty of justice. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                FORMER SECRETARY MR K HAHNDIEK IN THE GALLERY

                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, I wish to recognise the presence in the
gallery of the former Secretary to the National Assembly, Mr K Hahndiek.
[Applause.] Welcome to Parliament, Mr Hahndiek.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I just want to say
something about the two speakers who preceded me. Dr Delport, who was a
professor of law, was so brilliant that if ever I need a lawyer, I would
brief you to take my case. The other person who spoke before me was the
chairperson of our committee, Mr Oupa Monareng. In the 32 years that I have
been a Member of Parliament, I have never come across such an
inexperienced, useless chairperson as Oupa Monareng. [Applause.] In fact,
he shouldn’t be called “oupa” but “mosimane” [boy]. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please sit down.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a
point of order: Is it parliamentary for the hon member to refer to the
chairperson as the most useless person?

An HON MEMBER: I didn’t hear that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I heard it. I will make a ruling. Hon member, please
proceed.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. This committee will
be known as the most flawed committee in the history of Parliament. I have
called it a farce and I have called it a joke. However, the best way to
describe this unfortunate committee is to say it was an ANC instrument used
as the executioner to politically hang Vusi Pikoli come hell or high water.


And the facts are very simple.

Firstly, he was suspended. Then the Ginwala commission was appointed to
investigate allegations against him. Ginwala, a prominent ANC cadre, did a
comprehensive investigation. She finds Pikoli a fit and proper person to
occupy the position. In fact, as Dr Delport has pointed out, she said: “He
impressed me as a person of unimpeachable integrity and credibility.” She
said that he must be reinstated. Despite Ginwala’s recommendations, Pikoli
is shockingly dismissed. Why? What are the reasons? The ANC gave a variety
of reasons, continuously shifting the goal posts as it became clearer and
clearer that their initial reasons were rejected by Ginwala and are not
valid. In the end the ANC pathetically fell back on accusing Pikoli of
being “insufficiently sensitive to matters of national security”, which, of
course, is nonsense.

But what does Pikoli say? Pikoli says the real reason for his dismissal was
to stop him from arresting and prosecuting the Police Commissioner, Jackie
Selebi. This is what Pikoli says, and all available information supports
this reason for his dismissal. The end result: If an author were to write
about this drama that we have experienced, the title of the Pikoli drama
would be written in huge black capital letters namely “dismissed because I
dared to prosecute Jackie Selebi”, and in smaller print it would read:
“Vusi Pikoli, you are dismissed because you dared to arrest an ANC high
profile man, Jackie Selebi”.

Pikoli, you are dismissed because you dared to act in accordance with your
conscience and the Constitution. Pikoli, you are dismissed because you
dared to disobey orders from Luthuli House. This is why you are dismissed.
But there is a silver lining, Madam Deputy Speaker. The silver lining
around the black Pikoli cloud is that the ANC executioner will not be able
to hang Pikoli, because there will be a reprieve for Pikoli who is in the
political death cell. The matter will, after it is heard in the National
Council of Provinces, go to the High Court, where the ANC’s farce and gross
miscarriage of justice will be exposed and set aside and Vusi Pikoli will
be reinstated.

Posterity will remember this unfortunate committee as the biggest ANC
parliamentary blunder ever. We in the IFP and all the opposition parties
oppose the dismissal of Pikoli and propose that he be reinstated. Thank
you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member Van der Merwe, please take your seat!

There was a point of order made by the hon Deputy Chief Whip, and I am
ready to make a ruling. Suggesting that a member is useless, reflects on
their integrity and therefore it is unparliamentary. Hon member Van der
Merwe, please withdraw.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I unconditionally withdraw that
he is useless, and I say he is politically useless. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Van der Merwe, I have asked you to withdraw your
first statement saying that he is useless. I will make a ruling on your
second statement which you have made, despite having made an apology.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: What must I do now? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Van der Merwe, the effects are the same. I’ve asked
you to withdraw, unconditionally.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I did withdraw unconditionally. I will
unconditionally withdraw it for the second time.

An HON MEMBER: And apologise.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Apologise for what? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Van der Merwe, I am presiding. Could you please
address me?

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I am addressing you, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I
kindly go and take my seat?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I wish to remind you that I am the Deputy Speaker.
Please take your seat.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Laughter.]

Mr J BICI: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, the UDM distances itself from
this report and its recommendations. The entire parliamentary process has
been an ill-disguised sham designed to add respectability to a political
lynching of a dedicated civil servant. Mr Pikoli’s only crime has been
diligence in his job. He has been vindicated even by the commission that
was surely appointed to rubberstamp his initial suspension.

He acted in the national interest by pursuing justice without fear or
favour. Now the ruling party would have us believe that it is not in the
national interest to pursue justice if the suspect is the chief of the
police.

The ruling party is fond of bemoaning the levels of crime and corruption,
but they are the principal destroyers of institutions and people who fight
crime and bust corruption. [Applause.]

Though the ruling party wants to make this a complicated issue, it is
actually very easy. Mr Pikoli demonstrated the backbone that the
Constitution requires him to have, and that did not suit those in power.
Shame on you for punishing the good guys and strengthening the hand of
criminals and thugs. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ID does not see the point of
spending millions of our rands on commissions when the government
continuously rejects and has scant regard for their recommendations. Just
like the finding of the Khampepe Commission, the Van Zyl report and now the
Ginwala report, they just ignore the recommendations.

The fact that the President relieved him of his duties, despite the
commission’s finding, is totally unacceptable. National security is used as
an excuse but nowhere in the report does it show where he actually breached
national security.

The way the ad hoc committee also dealt with this report was unfair, and
acted simply as a rubber stamp. There was no objectivity whatsoever. The
two chairpersons sat there like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, just agreeing
with one another, nodding, even if it was wrong. There was absolutely no
justice.

The ID supports the reinstatement of Adv Pikoli, but the fact that Adv
Pikoli is taking this matter to court shows that, once again, in the
instance where the findings of a commission are ignored by Parliament and
the executive, the judiciary will be there as the final adjudicator. Pikoli
is going to win this case, and it is going to be a shame, once again, on
Parliament.
We have missed an opportunity to show the separation of powers, that the
executive is accountable to Parliament. That opportunity has been missed,
and I told the comrades of the ANC yesterday: The list process is over!
There is no need to come and perform there, because some of them are not
even on their list. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker, Parliament created a network of
provisions to reinforce and protect the constitutionally enshrined
principle of prosecutorial independence. Now, what Adv Pikoli said in his
submission is that experience has taught that the executive is always
likely to be tempted to interfere with the prosecutorial process for
political reasons, more often than not to protect their cronies in high
office. No wonder he is being fired!

The issue of security of tenure of the NDPP lies at the heart of the
prosecutorial independence. An NDPP who may be dismissed whenever he
displeases the executive has no real capacity to act with fearless
independence, and the protection of his security of tenure accordingly lies
at the heart of that prosecutorial independence.

As has been said, Ginwala found that Mr Pikoli impressed her as a person of
unimpeachable integrity and therefore that he should be restored to office.
How can it possibly be said that he is not a fit and proper person? He is
clearly not guilty of conduct of a dishonest, disgraceful or dishonourable
kind which shows his lack of conscientiousness or integrity required for
that office.

Constitutional law professor, Professor De Vos has stated that national
security is not one of the reasons that can be given to have the NDPP
fired. To remove him, serious misconduct must be involved, such as not
adhering to prosecutorial guidelines. Why was there not a misconduct
hearing? He adds that by citing national security you could fundamentally
affect the independence of the NDPP to act without fear or favour, and that
is our concern, and that is why we are not prepared to support this report.
The sequence of events leaves no room for any inference other than that
Pikoli was suspended and fired to stop the arrest and prosecution of
National Police Commissioner Mr Selebi. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC went out of their way to
cloud the whole issue of Pikoli, but if you look at the main reason for the
suspension of Adv Pikoli, according to the President, it was that Pikoli
was a threat to national security.

Why was Pikoli a threat to national security? Because he had the audacity
to arrest and prosecute the National Commissioner of the Police Service,
Jackie Selebi.

I think the hon President is completely confused. The real threat to
national security was not Pikoli – it was Jackie Selebi! [Interjections.]
To keep Selebi in his position as National Commissioner of the Police
Service, with serious criminal allegations against him, that was the real
threat to national security.

It was Selebi who was supposed to be suspended by former President Mbeki,
but when it comes to Selebi, especially the former President acted like the
three little monkeys: I hear, I see and I say nothing!

The fact of the matter is: Adv Pikoli acted in the interests of national
security and for that he should receive a medal for bravery, for standing
up against Selebi, and not a suspension.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a
point of order: Is it parliamentary to refer to the head of state as “three
little monkeys”?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! I will give ...

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I address you before you give a
ruling?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am still ruling on the point of order.
Dr C P MULDER: Yes, Madam, but I would like to address you before you give
a ruling. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: But you haven’t heard what I am going to say.

Dr C P MULDER: Fine, Madam.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, I will give this matter consideration and
rule on it later. Hon Mulder, do you still want to address me?

Dr C P MULDER: Yes, Madam Speaker, before you give a ruling I would like
you to take the following into consideration.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that a point of order?

Dr C P MULDER: I am reacting to the point of order raised by hon Deputy
Chief Whip. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is not a point of order.

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I suggest it is a further point of order in
terms of the Rules of the House, and I suggest that you listen to it.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is the point of order? [Interjections.]
Dr C P MULDER: The hon Deputy Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development is not the Deputy Speaker.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please address me!

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon speaker did not refer to the
hon President. He referred to the former President, who is not a member of
this House. That is the first point.

The second point is that he used a metaphor ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, that is not a point of order. I said that I
would make a ruling on that ...

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, how do you want to make a ruling if
you do not want to listen to what we are saying? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What I have said, hon member, is that there was a point
of order, and I have said that I was going to give consideration to that
point of order. You don’t know yet how I am going to rule on that point of
order. I will come back to the House with a ruling. Then at that point you
must address me on the matter.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order:
May I, with great respect, remind you that before you are to rule, you must
listen to all the inputs in respect of the point taken. [Interjections.] It
is the same as in a court case. You cannot make a decision before you have
been addressed by all. So I suggest then that you allow all members who
wish to make an input on that point of order, such as Dr Mulder, to make
their input before you rule. Otherwise you may rule wrongly, because
certain information was not given to you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any more points of order? Hon member, you may
continue.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Dankie, Adjunkspeaker. Ek herhaal: Die bedreiging vir
die nasionale veiligheid van Suid-Afrika was nie adv Pikoli nie. Dit was
die feit dat die President vir Selebi beskerm het. Dit was die grootste
bedreiging vir die Suid-Afrikaanse veiligheid.

Adjunkspeaker, ek daag agb lede in die Raad vandag uit, elkeen van u wat
stem dat adv Pikoli ontslaan moet word, dat as hy sy hofsaak wen, u sy
regskoste uit u persoonlike sak sal betaal, en nie die belastingbetaler se
geld sal misbruik nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] As u enige integriteit het, sal u
dit doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I repeat: The threat to the
national security of South Africa was not Adv Pikoli. It was the fact that
the President protected Selebi. That was the greatest threat to South
Africa’s security.

Deputy Speaker, I challenge hon members in this House today, all of you who
are voting for Adv Pikoli to be dismissed, that if he should win his court
case, you will pay his legal fees out of your personal pocket, and not
abuse the taxpayers’ money. [Interjections.] If you have any integrity, you
will do that.]

Or else you are also acting like the three little monkeys: you say nothing,
you hear nothing and you do nothing. I thank you. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, have you finished your speech?

Mr P J GROENEWALD: I have one second left, Madam Speaker. I stand by what I
said.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, whether or not the hon
member is using a metaphor to refer to us as acting like monkeys, etc, I
think there has been a ruling previously on this name calling which is
derogatory, referring to members as animals. Whether it is metaphoric or
not, I believe it is absolutely unacceptable. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please withdraw it.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: What must I withdraw, Chairperson? If I say that some
members are acting like lions, is that acceptable?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, please withdraw what you said. You said the
members are acting like monkeys.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I address you on this issue,
seeing that I said it? I did not say that the members “are” monkeys; I said
that they “act like” monkeys, and that is general metaphor in general,
normal speech, to say: “I hear nothing, I say nothing and I do nothing.”
That is the fact of the matter. I refuse to withdraw. I stand by what I
said.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, you have decided that you are not going to
listen to the Chair. I have asked you to withdraw the statement. Please
don’t force me to make a harsh ruling against you. Please withdraw it.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a man of my word. I have said
it, and I will not withdraw it.

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I address you on your ruling that
the hon member should withdraw the statement? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Mulder, I am still addressing the member. Hon
Groenewald, I am afraid I have to ask you to leave the House.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: I do so with honour, Madam. Thank you.

Whereupon the member withdrew from the Chamber.

Ms N N SIBHIDLA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, firstly, I think it is
important for us as the ANC ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, please take your seat. Will someone please
close the door? You may proceed, hon member.

Ms N N SIBHIDLA: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. As the ANC, we support the
decision to remove Adv Pikoli from the post. [Interjections.]
I say this because I come from the ANC ... [Applause.] [Interjections.] ...
a movement with unrivalled credentials and experience in leading people’s
struggles during the darkest days of the liberation struggle and in matters
of democratic governance in this country... [Interjections.] ... a people’s
movement which remains the only hope for the people of South Africa ...
[Interjections.] Because these masses can only trust their tried and tested
movement, they are ready, waiting to cast their ballots to renew the
democratic mandate of the ANC to lead the struggles of the people, going
forward. [Applause.]

Hon members, it was on 27 September 2008 that the former President of the
Republic, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, suspended Adv Pikoli from the Office of the
National Director of Public Prosecutions.

Subsequent to this, the Ginwala Commission was established in terms of
section 12 (6) (a) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, Act 32 of
1998, to make a determination on the fitness and propriety of Adv Pikoli to
hold the office of National Director.

Upon completion of the inquiry, the Ginwala Commission handed a report to
President Kgalema Motlanthe, who considered the findings. [Interjections.]

Having considered the findings and, in particular, noted adverse findings,
the President invited Adv Pikoli to make representations on the findings.

Because Adv Pikoli, in his representations, embraced the findings in his
favour and rejected all the findings against him, it became apparent to the
President that Adv Pikoli did not understand the seriousness of the
deficiencies in his capacity and understanding to fully execute the range
of responsibilities attached to the office of the NDPP as identified by the
Ginwala Commission.

As a result, the President decided to have Adv Pikoli removed from office.
Hon members, it is this decision of the President that we are considering
today. We are called upon to accept or reject this decision.

Central to the reasons underlying the President’s decision is the Ginwala
Commission’s finding that Adv Pikoli lacks appreciation for and sensitivity
to matters of national security. Adv Pikoli argued before the committee
that he appreciates matters of national security because of his experience
in dealing with security matters.

It appears that the advocate missed the point. The issue here is not about
his exposure ... [Interjections.]... or experience in security or related
matters; instead the issue which concerned the Ginwala Commission and the
President is Adv Pikoli’s failure to show appreciation for and sensitivity
to matters of national security when discharging his responsibility as
NDPP. [Interjections.]

In a sense, this shows that he did not appreciate and understand the
sensitivities of the strict security environment in which the NPA operates.
[Interjections.]

Hon members, what is unfortunate is that the Ginwala Commission made a
determination on the restoration of Adv Pikoli to the Office of the NDPP,
an issue that falls beyond the mandate of the inquiry. [Interjections.] The
fact of the matter is that the Ginwala Commission was established to
conduct an inquiry into the fitness and propriety of Adv Pikoli to hold the
office of NDPP, the findings of which would assist the President in
deciding whether to remove or restore Adv Pikoli. It is unfortunate indeed.

I will therefore not waste your time by dealing with recommendations that
answered the wrong question. [Interjections.] We must address the House on
matters which talk to the Ginwala Commission’s terms of reference – the
fitness and propriety of Advocate Pikoli to hold the office of NDPP and
such other matters that may relate to such fitness and propriety.

Some sections of our society ... [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, please sit down.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: May I ask the member a question?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, do you want to take a question?

Ms N N SIBHIDLA: No. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please sit down. Proceed, hon member.

Ms N N SIBHIDLA: Some sections of our society are trying to convince us
that the Ginwala Commission vindicated Adv Pikoli. The contrary is correct.
The Ginwala Commission’s report contains adverse findings against Adv
Pikoli, especially in paragraphs 16 and 17 of its executive summary. In
these paragraphs, Dr Ginwala says, and I quote:

    I have also found issues of concern in the capacity and understanding of
    Adv Pikoli to carry out the responsibilities of the office of NDPP.
    These relate primarily to his understanding of issues pertaining to
    national security and his lack of appreciation of the sensitivities of
    the political environment in which the NPA needs to operate, which
    sensitivity would not be incompatible with his prosecutorial
    independence.

This finding is based on a number of serious security breaches by the
Directorate of Special Operations that occurred before the eyes of Adv
Pikoli as the overall head of the NPA.

Needless to mention, the laissez-faire approach adopted by Adv Pikoli in
handling search and seizures operations in the Union Buildings as well as
the extremely dangerous Special Browse Mole Report, really shocked us.

You would remember that, in 2008, this House adopted a report on this
matter, which clearly outlined the attitude of the DSO towards matters of
national security. This is a report that confirmed that the Browse Mole
Report was indeed an intelligence document and that it had been classified
as a top secret document of the DSO.

Despite this, Adv Pikoli never dealt with the Browse Mole Report in the
manner it deserved. In simple terms, the advocate was very careless on that
matter. When he was advised to abort the project - since it was outside the
mandate of the DSO – Adv Pikoli decided to ignore the advice. Even the
Ginwala Commission’s report states that Adv Pikoli failed to order the DSO
to stop further involvement in the matter.

When the Browse Mole Report was leaked to the public, Adv Pikoli never
acted decisively on those who were involved, as he should have, given that
the contents of the document were very dangerous, extremely inflammatory
and divisive.

Therefore, Adv Pikoli’s approach, in mishandling this report, could not
have been in the public interest as it could have thrown our country into
chaos. [Applause.]

This democratic Parliament, as an organ of people’s power, cannot just
watch and do nothing when there are potential dangers to the security of
the country and its citizens. [Interjections.] National security concerns
us in the ANC, hon Delport.

Precisely because of this, as well as the Ginwala Commission’s finding on
Adv Pikoli’s lack of appreciation for and sensitivity ... [Interjections.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, will the hon member take an easy
question? [Interjections.]

Ms N N SIBHIDLA: No. Precisely because of this, the Ginwala Commission’s
finding on Adv Pikoli’s lack of appreciation for and sensitivity to matters
of national security, as well as submissions to the committee and
deliberations thereon, we recommend that the President’s decision to remove
Adv Pikoli from office be approved. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, it is a sad day today.
This House is deciding the fate of a man of substance to make him swell the
ranks of the unemployed, though hypothetically the dismissal of Adv Pikoli
is unwarranted, as he is the type of public servant this government
deserves. He is an upright man who brooks no nonsense as far as the office
he is being removed from is concerned.

The fact that President Motlanthe saw fit to show him the exit door comes
as no surprise because while he was the secretary-general of the ANC, he
made headlines by saying the DSO was operating in Hollywood style. It is
therefore unfortunate that by virtue of his office, he had to preside over
the fate of the advocate with that background. This is despite the fact
that the Ginwala Commission had recommended that Adv Pikoli be reinstated.

Whatever decision will be voted on, we in the UCDP know that majority
opinion is not always a dependable guide to moral conduct. We in the UCDP
will therefore not subcontract our moral choice to the rulers or majority
opinion. The obsession of the ANC with national security is surprising when
one takes into account that they have invariably prioritised their own
narrow interest over the good of the country.

The ousted head of the NPA had to uphold the law as the Constitution
requires of him. In its selective pursuit of observation of security, the
ANC tends to ignore section 198(c) of the Constitution of the Republic
which states, and I quote:

  National security must be pursued in compliance with the law, including
  international law.

The arrest of the police commissioner could not have catapulted the country
into any crisis. It has to be explained how arresting a national police
commissioner is a greater threat to national security than having him run
around with organised criminals.

The UCDP feels very strongly against the expulsion of Adv Pikoli and will
therefore not support this motion. I thank you. [Applause.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ginwala Commission dismissed Adv
Vusi Pikoli’s assertion that he was suspended because he refused to stop
the arrest of the National Commissioner of the Police, Jackie Selebi. The
commission found no evidence for this allegation. However, it found that
government failed to prove many of the allegations against Adv Pikoli and
had not adduced any compelling evidence that Pikoli was no longer a fit and
proper person to hold the office of the National Director of Public
Prosecutions, NDPP. Instead the commission made several recommendations.

The eighth recommendation draws attention to the fact that most of the
complaints against Pikoli relate to events that took place long before his
suspension. The commission pointed out that the advocate needed to be
sensitised to the broader responsibilities of his office to enhance his
understanding of the security environment in which his office must
function. President Kgalema Motlanthe, in his three and a half-page letter,
enumerates skills required for the Office of the NDPP. He remarks in
paragraph three of his letter, and I quote:

   ... the requisite skills would necessarily include professional
   competence. Adv Pikoli’s professional competence is not in question.

The President further remarks in paragraph nine, and I quote:
   Understandably, Adv Pikoli embraced the factual findings made by the
   commission which are in his favour.

This is, of course, natural in any contestation.

However, factual findings favourable to Pikoli were made by the commission
and not by Pikoli. Section 12 (6) (a) of the National Prosecuting Authority
Act provides that the President may provisionally suspend the national
director. It prescribes the grounds for this as follows: for misconduct; on
account of ill health; or on account of incapacity to carry out his or her
duties of office efficiently. The Ginwala Commission has not found any of
the above grounds against Adv Pikoli. I can only say that justice must not
only be done, but must also be seen to be done. [Interjections.] I thank
you very much, indeed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C V BURGESS: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, visitors, the matter
before the House is not whether Adv Pikoli is a gentleman or not. The
committee was to consider whether the President’s decision was correct. So,
I heard a lot of irrelevant arguments. [Interjections.]

But before I get to these irrelevant arguments, Madam Deputy Speaker, there
was reference made here to monkeys. I think the reference was highly
racial. The connotation was highly inflammatory and very inappropriate.
[Interjections.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: Given that the
reference was withdrawn, is it still relevant to be referred to?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sorry, that is not a point of order. Continue, hon
member! [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, may I also
make a point of order.

Mr C V BURGESS: Hon Deputy Speaker, it appears there are still people who
want to support ... [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a
point of order! Will you allow me?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will allow you. But please don’t shout at me.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: No, Madam Deputy Speaker. This is because
you deliberately ignored me. That is why I am drawing your attention to the
fact that I am standing.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, please make your point of order.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of
order: The reference to monkeys has been withdrawn. How can you comment on
something that has been officially withdrawn?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I think because two hon members have referred to
this issue, I must remind members that the member who made that remark
refused to withdraw. Please continue, hon member.

Mr C V BURGESS: Hon Deputy Speaker, I can’t see why people are still
defending the reference to monkeys in this day and age, given that
apartheid was supposed to have been dismantled a long time ago.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please sit down, hon member. [Interjections.]

Mr C V BURGESS: It appears that the opposition has nothing else to say
today. [Interjections.] Let’s be clear on one thing here ...
[Interjections.] Oh, more nuisance. Okay.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think the way you are conducting
yourselves is really not parliamentary. We have Rules in this House. You
are allowed to interject, but not in such a way that a member is unable to
make his speech. Please continue, hon member.

Mr C V BURGESS: Thank, Deputy Speaker. Let’s make one thing clear here. As
much as the opposition has said things about the ANC and the way
proceedings in the committee were conducted, the opposition came to the
committee with their own view from the beginning and from the very first
day. They did this without even reading the papers. They were satisfied
that they were going to support Pikoli. [Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: That is a lie.

Mr C V BURGESS: That’s not a lie, Koos.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: It is a lie.

Mr C V BURGESS: It’s not a lie; it’s the truth. You had already taken your
position on this matter before you even came to the committee. So, it is
incorrect for you to pretend that you came to a decision after careful and
very diligent consideration. [Interjections.] This is just not correct. You
know it’s not correct. You know you are being dishonest. You came there
with a view, and the view was that you were going to support Pikoli.
[Interjections.] That is not necessary; there is nothing in it.

The very delicate issue here, which the opposition has avoided, is the
consolidated Browse Mole report. It is so obvious that they have avoided
this issue. Nobody has mentioned it. Why not? [Interjections.] I can
understand that people like the hon Pheko and the other members of the
committee that are not attorneys will not address this matter. But the hon
Van der Merwe and the hon Delport and the hon Swart, who are lawyers -
legal people who understand these things ... [Interjections.]

After this, Mr Van der Merwe, I have my doubts.

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, will the hon member please take a
question?

Mr C V BURGESS: Mr Delport, I will take a question if I have time left at
the end of my speech.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of
order: This refers to someone else in the House. Unfortunately, I cannot
tell you who it was. Someone over there in the ANC benches referred to my
colleague Rafik Shah and said, “go back to Pakistan”. Could you ask that
person to please own up and withdraw?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I am not able to rule on this
particular point of order because I don’t know who made the remark. So, I
don’t know who to ask to withdraw the remark.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I think the Rules
provide that you can ask if a member has made such a statement and if that
member can please stand up and identify himself. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, is there a member in the House who
owns up to that statement?

HON MEMBERS: No!

Ms L M XINGWANA: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I just want to
ask if it is parliamentary to say a member is lying. Hon Koos has just
accused the member of lying.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Koos van der Merwe, can you please withdraw those
words?

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Yes, I withdraw. But I want to ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, without a condition.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I withdraw without a condition. But on another point
of order, the hon speaker also said I was lying. If I withdraw, then he
must also withdraw.

Mr C V BURGESS: I am so very sorry, hon Van der Merwe. [Laughter.] I
withdraw.

This Browse Mole report is an inflammatory topic, and you can understand
why. You can understand why the opposition fails to deal with the document.
Dr Delport speaks about justice. I am not sure whether, in the context of
justice, he actually read the Browse Mole report. Have you read the
consolidated Browse Mole report, Dr Delport? Has any of the opposition
parties read this? Have you seen what it says? Have you read the document
that was produced by the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, JSCI?

Let me take you through some of the findings. The JSCI found in its
recommendations that the executive authority must take appropriate action
against the head of the Directorate of Special Operations, DSO, and all
officials who were involved in the production of the Browse Mole report.
That is Parliament’s document; that is Parliament’s ruling. That is a
document that was adopted by Parliament. [Applause.] [Interjections.] I am
reading from a parliamentary document. Government must direct that the DSO
stop their intelligence gathering operations with immediate effect.
[Interjections.]
Yes! If you had read the Browse Mole, and the report of the JSCI, you would
understand that this was an institution that was out of control. They were
acting unlawfully. They were doing things that we, as citizens of this
country, should never have tolerated. Never! Mr Van der Merwe, how could
you, as a lawyer, tolerate that type of behaviour – explain that.
[Interjections.] You see, you can’t tolerate it, and that is why you are
quiet on the topic. You can’t tolerate it, Dr Delport, because it is a
dangerous document. This document is so dangerous. It was directly
threatening the national security of the country. [Applause.] This is what
it is.

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Will the hon member now
take one short question? Just tell us what Ginwala found on this issue.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, don’t ask a question because he hasn’t said
whether he will take a question. Hon member, will you take a question.

Mr C V BURGESS: No. The JSCI came to a conclusion in their report. I want
to quote this again, and other speakers mentioned this here. The JSCI came
to the conclusion that the activities of the DSO in relation to the
production of the Browse Mole report were very dangerous and against our
national interest. The contents of the Browse Mole report are extremely
inflammatory and divisive. It has the potential of throwing our democracy
into chaos. [Interjections.] These are the findings of a committee of
Parliament. These findings were adopted by Parliament. At the time, we had
nobody complaining. Nobody complained that there was anything wrong with
this. Now that the career of the head of this whole issue and organisation
is in jeopardy, you find reason to support him. How is that? Where is the
consistency? [Interjections.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Tell us what Ginwala said about it. You are not honest.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Delport, please allow the member to speak. I will
... [Interjections.]

Mr C V BURGESS: We, as Parliament, cannot overlook these very serious
matters and pretend that they did not happen. Illegal activities are a
threat to our national security. How can we overlook these things? With all
due respect, the ANC is not prepared to act and take irresponsible
decisions.

I conclude by saying ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: This Parliament
has discussed the Browse Mole report at length some time ago. This debate
today has nothing to do with the Browse Mole report whatsoever. It has
everything to do with the dismissal of Mr Pikoli. He has been totally
irrelevant. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is not a point of order. Continue, hon member.

Mr C V BURGESS: Why do you want to run away from this thing? This is the
issue. [Interjections.] No, the issue is national security - a danger to
national security.

Madam Deputy Speaker, you can see the opposition is getting out of control.
This thing is driving them mad. [Interjections.]

I conclude by saying ... [Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: The hon member referred to the opposition as mad.
[Laughter.] Now, may the pot call the kettle black?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I will make a ruling on that.
Please continue, hon member.

Mr C V BURGESS: I said the Browse Mole report is driving you mad. I didn’t
say you were mad. [Interjections.]

Madam Deputy Speaker, I am trying to conclude, but it looks like my
colleagues here want me to stay. The majority of ANC members of the ad hoc
committee could come to no other decision but to confirm the President’s
decision. This was a responsible decision and not an irresponsible
decision. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]
Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Has the
hon member got time left for a question? Is his time up, because he said he
would answer a question, if he had time?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Delport, I have not recognised you. Are you rising
on a point of order? [Laughter.] Order! He doesn’t have time, his time has
expired.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! hon members, are there any objections to the
recommendations?

Debate concluded.

Division demanded.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would like to remind hon members that they may only
vote from their allocated seats. When requested to do so, members must
simply indicate their vote by pressing the appropriate button. If a member
inadvertently presses the wrong button, the member may, thereafter, press
the correct button. The last button pressed will be recorded as the
member’s vote when the voting session is closed by the Chair.

Question put: That Advocate Vusi Pikoli, who had been removed from office
by the President, not be restored to office as the National Director of
Public Prosecutions and that the Report of the Ad hoc Joint Committee be
adopted.

Are all members in their allocated seats? Voting will now commence. Those
in favour should press the ‘yes’ button, those against should press the
‘no’ button and those wishing to abstain should press the ‘abstain’ button.
Have all members voted? The voting session is now closed

Question agreed to.

                           SECOND-HAND GOODS BILL

              (Consideration of Report of Mediation Committee)

Ms M M SOTYU: Madam Deputy Speaker, this was supposed to be a report.
Yesterday, the Minister of Finance quoted from a tip he received from Mr
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Continue, hon member.

Ms M M SOTYU: I am sorry about that, Madam Deputy Speaker. Yesterday the
Minister of Finance quoted from a tip he received from a Mr Xalani Notshe
of Port Elizabeth, thanking him for allocating money to libraries. He said,
and I quote:

   Libraries are central in community development. Libraries will assist
   your successor to collect more taxes because we would be an educated and
   skilled nation.

The hon Minister, Manuel, then continued to say: “I agree entirely.”

Libraries, especially those in a community school or state-owned libraries,
play an important role in outcome-based education. For many, that is their
only access to information. Yet many of these libraries suffer great losses
due to theft.

We stand here today because of the inclusion of books in the Second-Hand
Goods Bill. I would like to use the time allocated to me, in addressing
some of the concern that the second-hand goods dealers association
expressed on this Bill. The association in their submission to the NCOP
indicated that they believe that the Bill was discriminatory since it
targeted the used books trade and not the new books trade. That is the very
nature of the Bill, namely that it is regulating the second-hand goods
market. While we agree that at this stage, books are not part of any known
organised crime syndicate, the Bill does not deal with organised crime, but
aims to stop the one generated by theft.

The dealer association raised a concern that they would have to close down
because the Bill weighed them down under an administrative burden. Many
second-hand book dealers do not differ from other privately owned second-
hand shops in terms of size of stock and administrative capacity.
Therefore, we expect of them to fulfil the requirements of the legislation.


Closer scrutiny of what the dealers association requires of their members,
as well as their own evidence in front of the select committee, clearly
indicated that the association and its members are already doing much of
what the Bill requires them to do. The Bill stipulated that dealers in
second-hand goods should keep a register of all goods that they have bought
and for which they have paid more than R100.

In the association’s submissions to the NCOP, it stated that most books
were sold for less than R100, which clearly meant that they were bought for
less than that value. The association’s members were already keeping
records of all purchases as required by VAT legislation, so the Bill’s
requirements of a register would not place an additional administrative
burden on the industry.

The idea of the Bill was to allow different industries to regulate
themselves through the association. Chapter 3 of the Bill deals with the
accreditation for associations. The second-hand book dealers association is
a prime example of the sectors of the second-hand goods industry that would
be in a position to apply for accreditation and to be exempted from the
Bill.

We have communicated with the association that they should involve
themselves with the regulation-writing part of the legislation, so as to
make their valuable experience in the industry available to the SA Police
Service when it would be drafting the regulations. It is our understanding
that the SAPS have since spoken to the association and that they are
looking forward to working together on the development of the regulations.

It is also important to note that the legislation is not retrospective in
nature, and would thus require of any second-hand dealer, including the
second-hand book dealers, to fulfil this requirement in terms of its
existing stock. It would only be of application once it had been signed
into law and would affect stock bought after the legislation came into
effect. The South African Book Dealers Association is a critical example of
what the Bill is trying to achieve. It is an association with an ethical
basis, in that it disciplines and polices its own members, and it would
communicate to the SAPS if books were stolen or they suspected that someone
was offering them stolen books.

This Bill would, in fact, provide protection for the association and its
members against those outside of the association who, over and above other
goods, trade in second-hand books without the same ethics. With these few
remarks, and the knowledge that books are one of our most valuable assets
that should also be protected for our children and future generations, I
submit the Bill after the mediation of the committee. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Declaration of vote:

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Chairperson, as this House knows, the DA has already
voted for the Bill before us today. Indeed, severe delays have already been
experienced in the passing of this legislation and in the meanwhile the
trade in stolen goods continues to flourish because of the inadequate
legislation, with a huge illicit market for aluminium, car parts,
electronic goods, copper cabling, jewellery and the like.

As I have stated repeatedly, this new Bill is a huge improvement on the
1955 version. It was only after we approved it in the NA that the second-
hand book dealers became aware of the fact that books had been included on
the schedule, and presented to the NCOP extremely cogent arguments for
their removal. There were substantial inputs from the South African Book
Dealers Association outlining the unintended consequences of this Act.
These unintended consequences will, they calculate, put R100 on the price
of every second-hand book sold.

SAPS statistics indicate quite clearly that books are rarely stolen, not an
object of organised crime, and indeed where such legislation has been
attempted in other countries - such as the UK and the USA, it has proved
unworkable and duly fallen into disuse. It was the hon Annelizé van Wyk who
singlehandedly convinced her NCOP colleagues to back down on their
decision, and put books back on the schedule. Indeed, in meetings before
the NA/NCOP mediation she convinced the representatives of the second hand
book dealers association that the decision to put books back had already
been taken, and that their cause was lost.

Most second-hand book outlets in this country employ very few staff, and
members of the association have, from every corner of this country, begged
for second-hand books to be exempted from this Bill. The Bill is aimed at
categories of goods which can be broken down and remarketed in forms other
than their initial existing format, for example, car parts. But once a book
is altered in any way, it is rendered worthless and of no commercial value.

SAPS members have assured me that they have neither the personnel nor the
inclination to chase after a stolen book, nor had any of them ever heard of
a case involving such. In this House, we cannot afford to go on passing
legislation that is arbitrarily drawn up with figures, such as the R100
exclusion limit, put in by the chairperson of the committee with not one
moment’s research done on the matter, and merely included without the
slightest consideration for the impact it will have on the businesses it
relates to. We cannot afford to pass laws that will ruin people’s lives,
and close their businesses down, on a whim. The seven-day waiting period
before resale alone, will shut most of these outlets down. It would destroy
their ability to buy and sell second-hand books to and from students at the
start of each year.

The ANC said they could have the right to an exemption. So why on earth did
they put them into the legislation in the first place? We have been calling
for the updating of this Bill but failed to understand the logic of the
ANC, insisting that the NA should overrule the sensible decision by our
peers in the NCOP and put second-hand books back on the schedule; attacking
the one cheap source of education left in this country. If ever there were
a country that needed help with education, it is ours. [Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, the responsibility of parliamentarians who
work for the greater interest of our country and its entire people is more
than merely playing to the gallery or making a big, loud noise with
absolutely no substance. Sometimes, whether we are in the opposition or
not, we need to walk that extra mile. We need to commit ourselves to do
what is right, not necessarily what is popular.

If we want to fight crime effectively, it will require some sacrifices of
all of us. The chairperson explained at length that Doomsday will not
materialise for second-hand book dealers. We are told that books are not
part of the crime problem. However, every single book that gets stolen from
a student requires from parents a further sacrifice that many of them
simply cannot afford. Every single book stolen from a library does not
merely disadvantage one individual but a whole community of children who
would have had access to that book.

This, Chairperson, becomes that much more important in the light of outcome-
based education and this ANC government’s commitment to spreading knowledge
and skills amongst all sectors of our society. Books are an integral part
of this process.

In the light of this, there is no way that the ANC will support a Bill that
would close down the second-hand book business. Many of the requirements of
the Bill are already adhered to by legitimate second-hand book dealers. The
Bill specifically targets more expensive books and, by excluding less
expensive books, it rids second-hand book dealers of the unnecessary
administrative burden, if it was applicable to all books.

The Bill specifically makes provision for associations like the second-hand
book dealers association to accredit and be exempted from the requirements
of the Bill, and it would certainly be supported by the ANC if they were to
apply for this accreditation.

Public participation is an important part of the principle of this
Parliament and of our democracy, and if lobby groups learn anything from
what happens here, it is that they would do well to make use of the
official channels and processes for getting their voices heard. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:

  That the Bill be passed.

Motion agreed to.

Bill accordingly passed.

                        SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)(b)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, on behalf of the
Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move:-

   That the House –


   (1)      suspends Rule 253(1)(b), which provides that the debate on the
        Second Reading of a Bill that has been referred to a committee may
        not commence before at least three working days have elapsed since
        the Bill was introduced, for the purposes of conducting the Second
        Reading debate on the Division of Revenue Bill [B 4 - 2009]
        (National Assembly – proposed sec 76) tomorrow;


   (2)      subject to the concurrence of the National Council of Provinces,
        suspends Joint Rule 154(2), which provides that the Joint Tagging
        Mechanism may not classify a Bill before the expiry of the period
        stated in the Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, in
        respect of the Bill (see Announcements, Tablings and Committee
        Reports, 11 February 2009, p 301); and


   (3)      subject to the concurrence of the National Council of Provinces,
        for the purposes of conducting the Second Reading debate tomorrow
        on the above-mentioned Bill, suspends Joint Rule 220(2), which
        requires that a translation of a Bill’s official text must be
        received by Parliament at least three days before the formal
        consideration of the Bill by the House in which it was introduced.

Agreed to.

                   EXEMPLARY DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN GHANA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I move the draft resolution printed in my name
on the Order Paper, as follows:

   That the House -
      1) congratulates the people of Ghana for the exemplary democratic
         elections recently held in that African country;


      2) notes that the election results were very close even in the second
         running between the ruling New Patriotic Party, which lost to the
         opposition National Democratic Party, giving the winning party
         only 50.23% of the votes;


      3) admires the way the contesting parties have managed this difficult
         presidential election and have thus maintained the peace and
         political stability of their country, which can only lead to rapid
         economic development and the prosperity of Ghana;


      4) welcomes the statement by the newly elected president, Mr John
         Atta Mills, in his inaugural speech that honesty, fairness,
         compassion and sincerity will be the hallmark of his
         administration and that he has no wish to carry out political
         vendettas;


      5) hails his words that he does not want any Ghanaian child to go to
         school under a tree; and


      6) observes that Ghana is the second largest producer of cocoa in the
         world and has also recently discovered oil, which can earn Ghana
         between R14 billion and R21 billion a year, and hopes that this
         wealth will be used to uplift the people of Ghana and of Africa in
         general as the founding father of Ghana, that great Pan-
         Africanist, President Kwame Nkrumah, envisaged.

Chairperson, hon members of this House, the PAC moved the motion for this
House to congratulate Ghana because we believe this country’s recent
elections were an example of the kind of democracy Africa’s people, in
particular, should replicate.

The election results were very close, even in the second running between
the ruling New Patriotic Party, which lost to the opposition, the National
Democratic Party. The winning party got only 50,23% of the votes.

The results of such elections could easily have sparked off endless
bickering and violence, but leaders and supporters of these two parties
managed this difficult presidential election in a mature and admirable
manner. They did not lose their focus of the bigger national picture.

On the contrary, they maintained peace, which ensured the continued
stability of their country, which can only lead to rapid economic
development and prosperity of Ghana.

The statement of the newly elected President of Ghana, His Excellency, Mr
John Atta Mills, showed patriotism and statesmanship. In his inaugural
speech he said that honesty, fairness, compassion and sincerity would be
the hallmark of his administration and that he had no wish to carry out
political vendettas.

The PAC appreciates his words that no Ghanaian child must attend school
under a tree. In our own country, in South Africa, we boast of having the
largest economy in Africa but many of our children, especially in the rural
areas, learn under trees and in dilapidated, dangerous buildings. This is a
challenge to our own country.

In our motion on Ghana’s successful elections, we have pointed out that
Ghana is the second largest producer of cocoa in the world and has also
recently discovered oil, which can earn Ghana between R14 and R21 billion a
year.

The PAC has expressed the hope that this oil wealth will be used to uplift
the people of Ghana and of Africa in general. We have made this remark
because the founding president of modern Ghana, which the British
colonialists called the Gold Coast, had a vision of not only a free Ghana
but of Africa as a whole. That is why on Ghana’s independence on 06 March
1957, he said, “Ghana’s independence will be meaningless unless it is
linked to the total liberation of Ghana.” There is much to learn from this
African country. Ghana’s contribution to Africa is far more that its
territoriality and population of 23 million.

This is a nation whose kings sat on royal chairs made of gold before it was
colonised by the British and called the Gold Coast. This is a nation whose
equivalent Battle of Isandlwana was led by Queen Asentawa, who humiliated a
well-armed British army. This is a nation that produced that great
educationist, Dr Aggrey of Africa, at the darkest hour of colonial
barbarism in Africa. His famous story of the eagle decolonised the minds of
many in his generation.

It was Ghana’s prominent writer, J C De Graft Johnson, who wrote The
Vanished African Civilizations. This was at a time when English professors
of history such as Hugh Trevor-Roper of Oxford University could write:

    Undergraduates, seduced as always by the changing breath of journalistic
    fashion demand that they be taught the black history of Africa. Perhaps,
    in future, there will be some history to teach.


He maintained that the study of history would be “an African amusement with
the unrewarding gyrations of barbarous tribes.”

It is this West African country that has provided the former secretary-
general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. This African nation deserves the
congratulations of this honourable House. It must not be forgotten that it
is Ghana that inspired the whole freedom movement of Africa when there were
only five independent African states out of the 53 which exist today. Ghana
became a home of all liberation movements of Africa.

Without Ghana’s leadership there might have been no Organisation of African
Unity, African Union and Pan-African Parliament. When there were serious
problems that hampered the formation of the Organisation of African Unity
because there were two regional blocs, the Casablanca Bloc and the Monrovia
Bloc, it was Ghana that approached Emperor Haile Selasie of Ethiopia to
intervene, bringing the two blocs together to form the OAU.

It was Ghana’s Nkrumah who told Africa’s people, “Only a united Africa can
redeem its past glory, renew and reinforce its strength for the realization
of its destiny. We are today the richest and yet the poorest of continents,
but in unity, our continent could smile in a new era of prosperity and
power.” I thank you. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, I just want to correct the last speaker. If I
recall correctly, the Minister of Education gave a report indicating that
according to the reports she has received from provinces there are no
longer students under trees, if I’m correct. So I think the last speaker
should have taken note of that.

Coming to the relevant issues, I would like to thank Dr Pheko for the
motion. This motion gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress that
the African Union has made on the development of democracy, development and
parliamentary democracy on the continent. I agree with the last speaker
that indeed Ghana is an inspiration to all African states because its
founding leader, Kwame Nkrumah, did dream of an eventual African
government. We see now, through these elections, a progressive realisation
of that dream.

But we need to be reminded as the ANC that long ago, even before 1994, the
ANC did in its documents reflect on the need to link governance and
legitimacy to the will of the people. ANC documents reflect this. Whilst we
congratulate Ghana, we would like to use this opportunity to call upon
other African states to replicate this model that Ghana is showing us
because this African Union will develop as more and more governments become
more democratic.

The principles of democracy, of course, are reflected in the Constitutive
Act of the African Union. This is important because this document is a self-
imposed condition by the African leaders themselves as the means to
development. I mention this because we know that there are calls,
extraneous calls from the continent, calling upon Africa to become
democratic. But, sometimes we question the motive for these calls, and I
will come to that point later.

Indeed, Ghana has also, through this election – I agree with the last
speaker – showed us that it is possible to hand over power and manage that
process without resorting to violence, which is something that we have also
done and will continue to do in this country.

I would like to reflect a little bit on the purpose of elections, lest we
get carried away about regular elections and not realise that there is a
purpose and substance that we need to reflect on concerning regular
elections. In my view, democracy, without being linked to development, is
really meaningless.

Abantu abayityi idemokhrasi; ayikokutya idemokhrasi. Ingakhona idemokhrasi
kodwa abantu balambe. Intlupheko ikhule abantu bevota. Akutshiwo ukuba xa
ilizwe linedemokhrasi ngokonyulo abantu belo lizwe batyebile. Kufuneka
siyilumkele into yokuba siyiqhwabele izandla into yedemokhrasi, siqhwabele
izandla into yolonyulo babe abantu betyiwa yindlala. (Translation of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[People cannot eat democracy; it is not food. You can have democracy on the
one hand, whilst people are suffering from hunger on the other. Poverty can
rise whilst people exercise their right to vote. Electoral democracy does
not translate to being rich. We must be careful to not excessively
celebrate democracy, and not to praise the role of the elections whilst
people are in the grips of poverty.]

Therefore, it is important to link democracy to development underpinned by
the principle of self-determination. I make this point because sometimes we
get calls that we must have certain models of democracy. If we don’t adopt
these models, therefore our countries are not democratic. Therefore, the
very imposition of democracy or a model of democracy upon states, in my
view, is repugnant to the very notion of democracy. Some democracies are
presidential, others are parliamentary, and others still are a hybrid of
the two, and so on. We shouldn’t, therefore, demand a particular model of
democracy.

We also have seen that sometimes the mighty powers of the West have imposed
democracy on other countries. But, when we evaluate the motive and the
reasons for these calls for democracy, sometimes it is not about
development, but it’s about regime change. That is why in 1955 in the
Bandung Declaration, the accord between Africa and Asia, the point was made
on some of those principles that no member state must allow itself to be
used by the mighty powers to remove other regimes of member states. That
clause was put there precisely because this tendency still prevails today.
Therefore, we need to be careful when we make calls about democracy. What
do we mean by that?

For example, we have seen that there are double standards. Sometimes the
western powers are happy with certain democracies and sometimes they are
not happy. They are unhappy, not because there are no elections but because
they don’t like the outcomes of the elections, and that is undemocratic
behaviour. For example, we know that in Zambia the president was removed.
How was President Kaunda removed? He was removed because of the utilisation
of the very notion of elections and democracy. Another regime was put there
because at that time it was a preferred regime. We remember that gentleman
who made a very famous speech and said: Power is very sweet. That is when
he refused to move out of government. He said power was sweet. We know that
even today he is still facing a long trial of corruption. This is a person
who was put there by the mighty powers in the name of democracy. Therefore,
we must be careful of what we mean by democracy.

We have seen these double standards in Gaza as well. There was an election
in Gaza which was hailed as the most free and fair election, but the
outcome was not acceptable. Immediately after those elections there was an
imposition of sanctions by everybody, the European Union and all the so-
called democratic nations. Why? It was not because the elections were not
free but the outcome was not acceptable. So they squeezed and squeezed the
government until it became ungovernable. This is what we are talking about.
[Applause.]

Sometimes they say a certain regime has been in power for too long or the
ANC is too strong, all those kinds of things. But, if you look at the
history you will find that in the United Kingdom there was a Conservative
Party government for something like 17 years in succession. Later on there
was a Labour Party government for about 14 years in succession and nobody
questioned that. That is democracy.

But if, in Africa, we have long-serving regimes in power, elected popularly
by people, that regime is undemocratic, too powerful, and it must be
changed. Why? So, this is what I mean by the fact that democracy must be
based on the principle of self-determination. It must be an organic process
that is born out of the people’s process; hence the ANC says: The
government’s legitimacy is linked to the will of the people.

It is also important to note that - in Zimbabwe, for example – we impose
conditions like: For this government to work, Mugabe must go. Some of us
don’t agree with what is happening there but you cannot, from outside, say
so-and-so must go for that government to be proper. When you look at the
elections, you find that this same party gets 99 seats. How can you defy
such huge numbers of Zimbabwean people electing a particular party? We need
to respect that; hence the view is that we must let parties work together
to resolve the problem. But we can’t, from outside, say so-and-so must go
before the government works. When you say so, you are ignoring the will of
the people. So, I’m making the point that a proper democracy must be born
out of the people themselves.

We have also seen tendencies where even the right to vote sometimes is used
to sabotage governments. Today here in South Africa we have a big debate,
correctly so, about South Africans who have emigrated and now are demanding
a right to vote and so on. Perhaps they have got a legal point. But I want
to make the point that what we must remember is that these people emigrated
voluntarily, in numbers, because there is crime in South Africa. They went
and lived elsewhere where it is fine. Then when the elections come they
want the same government which in their view is useless, cannot deal with
crime and cannot administrate the country properly, to give them resources
where they are to throw stones at this government. You must empower them to
remove you from power. It doesn’t make sense.

In my view what they should do – I support their right to vote; I support
it – because they took their money and their passports and left the
country, is that they must travel back whenever there are about to be
elections in South Africa, on their own. They must travel back; come, vote
and go away again. Why must we give them resources?

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, I rise on a point of order: We are discussing
free elections in Ghana. The hon speaker seems to be talking now very much
about a domestic matter in South Africa. I would believe that he is off the
topic.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr A C Nel): Mr Ellis, I will ask the speaker to
direct himself to the motion but I think the motion is of general
application. So, we have allowed some leeway. But, hon member, please
resume and speak to the motion. Thanks.

Adv Z L MADASA: Thank you, Chair. I thought we were debating elections in
Ghana and using that as a model to reflect upon as a comparative study. The
motion says: Ghana is exemplary to all of us. So, we are examining all our
systems to see if they are, in fact, exemplary. I’m talking about our own
system. That is what we are talking about. [Interjections.] No, no, don’t
be belligerent, don’t disrupt me.

But, we must put a caveat. We must put a caveat in all that I’ve said. A
caveat is the following: As much as we must allow African solutions to
African problems, we need to ensure that these solutions are based on
principled solidarity. That is what is important. Our solidarity must be
principled. It must be based on the values we have agreed on. It must be
based on the conditions that we have set for ourselves and on the
Constitutive Act of the African Union. If our solidarity is based on
something else, tšhomi tšhomi [buddy buddy] and so on; that is not
acceptable. That is the caveat I would like to put.
In conclusion, given the Ghana example, I would like to take this
opportunity to call upon our people not to tarnish the image of our own
liberation by being disruptive when we go to the elections. Let us have
free and fair elections. In that way we shall succeed. Thank you.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, the DA agrees with the hon Pheko’s motion.
Yes, Ghana should be congratulated on a successful democratic election held
in December last year and finalised early in January this year.

What is particularly significant about it is that the previous governing
party, the New Patriotic Party, lost the elections to the main
parliamentary opposition, the New Democratic Party. Although it lost the
elections by only a small margin of less than 1%, nevertheless there was an
immediate unequivocal and peaceful handover of power to the winning NDP.

The contrast with what happened in respect of our immediate neighbour,
Zimbabwe, is huge. There the combined opposition MDC also narrowly defeated
the ruling Zanu-PF party in parliamentary and presidential elections. And
yet, the defeated ruling party continued to hang on to power with SADC’s
acquiescence for eight months, with the brokered power sharing deal being
implemented only this week.

President Motlanthe gave the Zimbabwe elections figures to Parliament this
week. Tsvangirai’s MDC had 99 seats, Mutambara’s MDC had 10 and Zanu-PF had
97. And there was one independent.

The President characterised this result as a “hung parliament”! Not in
Ghana, however! In Ghana, it would have been acknowledged as a victory for
the opposition. Since 1992, Ghana has held four successful competitive
elections and it is in many ways an important country for Africa and South
Africa.

In 1957, of course, it led the way to freedom in Africa by throwing off the
yoke of colonialism with an iconic leader, Kwame Nkrumah, at the helm.
South Africa has bilateral commission with Ghana at ministerial level, and
its economic importance to the continent is growing. Not only is it the
second largest producer of cocoa in the world, as the hon Pheko has said,
but its newly discovered oil reserves will make a big difference to its
economy.

But what makes Ghana’s elections results even more significant is that they
took place against the growing disenchantment with the capability of
African countries to hold credible and peaceful elections.

Recent major setbacks in elections management have been witnessed in
Nigeria in 2007 and in Kenya at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008,
where it required UN interventions to achieve a satisfactory power sharing
outcome, and even then only after more than 1000 people had been killed in
post-election rioting.

Early this year we had the unedifying and undemocratic spectacle of Guinea-
Bissau, where, on the death of President Lansana Conte, instead of their
constitutional precepts being followed, which made the speaker of
parliament take charge for 60 days and announce a date for new elections,
army general Moussa Camara took over in a bloodless coup, saying elections
would not be held until next year. Unfortunately, we have all seen that
movie before, several times.

On the positive side, when the president of our Western neighbour,
Botswana, Festus Mogae, stepped down in April last year, power was handed
over to President Ian Khama in a peaceful transition.

Triumphs like the Ghana elections are important because the priority, both
for our government in its foreign policy and for us in Parliament, is the
promotion of the African agenda.

Clearly, part of the African agenda should be to ensure that the way the
Ghana elections were held becomes the norm on our continent, rather than
the exception to the rule it has become in the past. While it is true that
Ghana pioneered freedom from colonial rule, it is South Africa that has set
the great example of a peaceful transition to democratic rule through free
and fair elections based on the rule of law and constitutionally guaranteed
rights and freedom.

We have established the benchmark for this on our continent. Successful
elections are the lifeblood of any democratic system. We are on the cusp of
our fourth democratic election and the IEC is getting pretty good at
running them.

The elections to be held on 22 April promise, as DA leader Helen Zille
says, to be the most exciting yet with the advent of Cope significantly
swelling the ranks of opposition parties. We can feel something new is in
the air. As opposition parties, we are gearing up for important elections
with far-reaching implications and the Ghana election result is beckoning
like a beacon on our African continent. Aluta continua, the struggle
continues. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, we also support the motion. It is a good
motion. And as far as we are concerned, there is a lot to be learned from
the Ghana experience. Basically, it has shown that democracy is growing in
Africa. It is not only in South Africa, but Ghana has shown that free and
fair elections could be held with minimum violence, acceptance of the
results, no discrimination against opponents and a striving towards
reconciliation.

Therefore, it is an example to us. There are other examples that are not
exemplary to us, like Zimbabwe. I think the message to Zimbabwe is that the
days of African dictators are counted. Their days are numbered. Zimbabwe is
a country destroyed, and we hope they will recover. I have hunted in that
country and it is beautiful. [Laughter.]

I enjoyed the speech by Mr Madasa. Some of what he said is true. He said
that the growth of democracy leads to growth in development. That is true.
If you have a good democracy, normally there is growth in development,
which enables you to fight poverty, unemployment and to give your people a
better life.

He said that some people don’t accept the outcome of elections. That is
called democracy. We didn’t accept the outcome of the elections where the
ANC won. As the IFP, we wanted to win. But we will try next time. This is
how it works. When we are in next time you will be out with your smile.
[Laughter.]

What I didn’t like in Mr Madasa’s speech was the manner in which he
referred to those South Africans who are outside of the country and who
want to vote. I think he doesn’t understand that all of them didn’t
emigrate. They didn’t greet South Africa. They would like to come back. I
know many people outside. Why did they leave? They left because of the
failures of the ANC government. They left because of the crime rate,
corruption, unemployment, HIV/Aids and because of the problems that we have
in the country caused by the ANC government. This is why they left.
[Interjections.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, on a point of order, can the speaker confine
himself to the motion? [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, that is the most nonsensical point of
order that I ever heard. In fact, I was reacting to him. If I’m out of
order, he was out of order too. [Interjections.]
I have asked people that I know why they have left. They say affirmative
action is one the basic reasons why people left. [Interjections.] You can
say, wow! But many of them are white and many of them don’t get jobs. Then
what do you expect of them, to sit here and starve of hunger or to go
overseas where they can get jobs?

In the process, those million people who left – look at the report by the
South African Racial ... [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON: (Mr A C Nel): Hon member, I have appealed to the
previous speaker to also confine himself to the broad parameters of the
motion.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I’m just reacting to what Mr Madasa has
done, nothing else. What I’m saying to him is, people who left couldn’t get
work here. That is why many of them left.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr A C Nel): The motion before the House is not what
Mr Madasa said; it’s what Dr Pheko moved.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, but you allowed him to say that. Why am
I not allowed to react? [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr A C Nel): No, I’m just saying I issued the same
warning to him to say it is a general debate. I will allow some latitude.
But ...

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE:  Chairperson, I have 12 seconds left. Can I do that
with latitude? Let me say to Mr Madasa that if there were no affirmative
action, if there were no crime, then all those people would not have left.
And the huge skills base that has gone out of the country would not have
gone out. It is on your conscience that they have left. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the ACDP notes that Ghana, sub-Saharan Africa’s
first independent country, chalked up another democratic victory on 7
December 2008 when an opposition candidate was elected as president. The
ACDP congratulates the people of Ghana who have shown great restraint and
maturity, demonstrating democracy at work in Africa. This was Ghana’s fifth
consecutive presidential and legislative poll since their return to
multiparty democracy in 1992.

In Ghana, there are two major parties in addition to the five smaller ones.
This is in stark contrast to many other African democracies where there is
one dominant party. Ghana, regarded as one of the most stable countries in
West Africa, has a well entrenched multiparty democracy and a simple
majority electoral system. The electoral system that a country uses is key
in determining how votes cast by the electorate are transformed into seats
in the legislature.

And at the risk of being constrained, I will talk about the electoral
system in South Africa. While the choices we have made up till now have
been successful in bringing us to this point in our democracy, calls for
electoral reforms are growing louder by the day – starting with the manner
in which the president is elected, especially after the recent unilateral
and unceremonious sacking of President Mbeki.

The ACDP supports the view that the President of the Republic must be
directly elected, as in France and the United States. Direct election makes
the president accountable for the whole nation and not only to the
governing party which can dictate to him and fire him at will.

According to the dust-collecting Slabbert Report, it was also recommended
that South Africa’s existing electoral system be replaced by another that
would encourage greater accountability. While a strictly proportional
system has been beneficial in the early stages of our democracy, ensuring
inclusivity and reducing the ever present threat of violence, it may well
be time for South Africa to consider a mixed electoral system. [Time
expired.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, Ghana was a heroic harbinger of things to come
when it was the first African country to elect a democratic government by
universal franchise.

Unfortunately, it is also the harbinger of all the ills of bad governance:
projecting the image of the big man, nepotism, corruption and the collapse
of democracy. It is therefore with great pleasure and admiration that Ghana
is welcomed back into the fellowship of true democracies.

After our own heroic and universally admired admission to universal
franchise in 1994, we fortunately did not initially commit ourselves to
such delusions of grandeur as to undermine the rule of law or the universal
rights of the individual.

Unfortunately and ominously, already under the administration of President
Mbeki, but particularly since Polokwane, the ANC values the law of rule
above the rule of law. We see this in the loud-mouthed threats to the
judiciary, the uncouth blue-light brigandage despoiling our public roads,
but worst of all, the timidity of the ANC caucus.
Yesterday, Minister Manuel had to urge you to earn your salaries with
worthy oversight. Your worst failing among many, was the way you assisted a
despot in Zimbabwe to reduce these neighbours of ours to the beggar’s
staff.

In this, my parliamentary graveyard speech, let me exhort you to respect
yourselves, respect the voters and value your own integrity. In my 10 years
here and in Bloemfontein I have been convinced that most of you are quite
capable of such rehabilitation of yourselves. Take note of Cope and that it
is your ex-voters who will punish you if you don’t.

Ter afsluiting bedank ek graag die voorsittende beamptes van hierdie
Parlement; elke agb kollega, elke lid van die personeel vir die vriendskap
en konsiderasie wat ek ontvang het, en ten laaste my party en die kiesers
wat hierdie 10 verrykende jare vir my moontlik gemaak het nadat ek 30 jaar
lank in ’n koue wind gestaan het in die provinsie waar ek gewoon het, omdat
die stemgeregtigde kiesers daar nie my siening gedeel het nie en ek nie
hulle s’n nie. Ek sê vir julle almal baie dankie en totsiens. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion I wish to thank the presiding officers of this Parliament;
each hon colleague, each member of staff for the friendship and
consideration shown towards me, and, finally, my party and the voters who
made these 10 enriching years possible for me, after being out in the cold
for 30 years in the province where I lived, because the eligible voters
there did not share my views, and neither did I share theirs. I express my
thanks to all of you and bid you goodbye. [Applause.]]

Mnu M P SIBANDE: Sihlalo, oNgqongqoshe kanye nabaHlonishwa abahloniphekile,
ngizothanda ukuthi ngiqondise okunye kuqala uMnumzane, uKoos Van Der Merwe

[Mr M P SIBANDE: Chairperson, Ministers and hon Members, I would like to
correct something that was said by Mr Koos Van der Merwe when he responded
to the issue of the expatriates who are going to vote. I must remind him
that some of them emigrated because they could not stand being governed by
a black-led government.

The statistics of the previous election results showed that a certain
percentage of votes were not achieved as expected because they did not have
barcoded green ID documents. It is therefore not our problem. I will come
back to the issue of Zimbabwe.

God created a cuckoo, and every year in spring, the cuckoo chants what the
African people interpret as “Start ploughing”. This means that people must
get ready because the ploughing season is upon them. With those words I
would like to thank the President of the country, President Kgalema
Motlanthe, for making a call similar to the one of the cuckoo by announcing
22 April 2009 as the date for this year’s general elections.
The President is making a call to all the different political parties to
prepare for the general elections, especially the African National Congress
and its alliance. Because after the elections we do not want a political
party or political parties that are going to complain and cry like an
orphaned baby chimpanzee citing that they were not given enough time to
campaign for the general elections.]

Ghana has been one of Africa’s great success stories of recent years, with
democratic government and individual freedoms having been consolidated
since independence.

Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the
Togoland trust territory, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan country in
Africa to gain its independence under the leadership of Dr Kwame Nkrumah in
1957.

Ghanaian politics is conducted in a framework of a presidential
representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Ghana is both
the head of state and the head of government with legislative power vested
in both the government and parliament.

The constitution that established the fourth republic provides a basic
charter for republican democratic government by declaring Ghana to be a
unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people of Ghana. It is
intended to prevent future coups, dictatorial government and a one-party
state, designed to establish the concept of power-sharing.

The people of Ghana elect a head of state, the president, and the
legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term, while the 230
members of parliament of Ghana are elected once every four years in single-
seat constituencies. The presidential election is won by a 50% plus one
vote, while the parliamentary elections are won by a simple majority.

Presidential and parliamentary elections have been held alongside each
other, generally on 7 December every four years since 1992. In the December
2008 elections, John Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress won the
presidential race with 50,23% of the total votes cast, as against the
49,77% garnered by Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party.

World leaders congratulated Ghana on the successful democratic elections in
December that saw the opposition candidate defeat his ruling party rival by
fewer than 41 000 votes. While UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the
elections as a democratic achievement, many more in Africa offered their
own praise for the peaceful and orderly nature of the voting. Our own
President Kgalema Motlanthe said that the Ghanaian people have shown their
appreciation for democracy in an election that bears testimony to respect
for good governance in Africa.

Professor Tarnue Sherman of the University of Liberia said Ghana is a
torchbearer for democracy in Africa, and that Ghana’s role as the
birthplace of the Pan-African Movement and its continuing commitment to
democracy is a source of pride for all Africans. We, as the South African
Parliament, also wish to add our accolades to those from our brothers and
sisters in Africa.
But, the recent democratic and successfully concluded presidential and
legislative elections in Ghana urge one to critically and appreciatively
look at the evolution of democracy in Africa.

The study of democracy in Africa challenges Westerners to take a hard look
at political institutions and philosophies that are too often taken for
granted as the way things must be. At the same time, it broadens and
enriches the understanding of the concept of democracy.

Many Africans consider the Western model of political democracy to be
extremely narrow and even alien to African cultures. Rev José Belo
Chipenda, General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches, says:


   Democracy is not merely the right to vote and seize power but it is about
   a whole complex of rights and duties which citizens must exercise if a
   government is to be open, accountable and participatory, and the Western-
   style democracy places people into artificial antagonistic boxes, turns
   friends into enemies and aims at arousing unnecessary competition.

In his book titled Democratisation, published in 1993, Prof Ben Nwabueze
covers a wide-range and textured examination of democratisation in African
societies. He writes:

   Democratisation is not only a concept, nor is it synonymous with
   multipartyism but it is also concerned with certain conditions of things
   – conditions such as a virile civil society, a democratic society, a free
   society, a just society, equal treatment of all citizens by the state, an
   ordered, stable society, a society infused with the spirit of liberty,
   democracy, justice and equality.

The stated thesis of his book is that democratisation, in the fullest sense
of the term, requires that the society, the economy, politics, the
constitution of the state, the electoral system and the practice of
government be democratised.

In the 1987 essays Popular Struggles for Democracy in Africa Mahmood
Mamdani, Abdelali Doumou, Samir Amin, Harry Goulbourne and other leading
African scholars deepen the theoretical and analytical study of
democratisation with contributions on aspects of the broad theme of the
state, development and participatory democracy.

The editor of these essays, Peter Anyang' Nyong'o, concludes that:

   However repressive regimes have been in Africa, and however they might
   have been in defeating popular attempts at democratic change, the
   people’s impulse to struggle for freedom and social justice can never
   completely die.

While the link between popular struggles and the building of democracy in
Africa is developed further in a collection of studies by Mahmood Mamdani
and Ernest Wamba-dia-Wamba, social movements and democratic initiatives in
the Southern African region are analysed by Sachikonye. The following
selected issues related to democracy in Africa are examined: firstly, the
theme of social and economic rights as integral elements in democratic
societies, secondly the perspectives of the problems facing democracy and
pluralism in Africa, ethnicity and democracy.

Convinced that -

   ... no society qualifies as democratic, representative and progressive
   until there is free and voluntary participation of all citizens in all
   spheres of life ...

... eleven Kenyan women scholars and writers examine the structural
constraints that have kept women thus far from participating fully and
meaningfully in Kenyan society and, undoubtedly, the rest of African
society.

Members of the African Faith and Justice Network adopted the following
thought-provoking principles regarding democracy in Africa at their 1993
annual meeting in Washington DC:

   Africans need to define for themselves the meaning of democracy in their
   own historical and cultural contexts, drawing on their participatory
   traditions and the experience of democratic societies elsewhere. Free
   market capitalism and multiparty systems are not synonymous with
   democracy. Grassroots popular movements offer new hope for truly
   democratic structures in Africa. Respect for human, social and economic
   rights, as well as civil rights is essential if democracy is to take hold
   in Africa, for democracy cannot survive in a context of stark
   polarisation between rich and poor. Economic development and equitable
   distribution of resources must go hand-in-hand with the emergence of more
   democratic structures.

I do not think that any one of us can argue against these sentiments. But,
returning to the example of Ghana, the voting system has encouraged
Ghanaian politics towards a two-party system ... [Time expired.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I would like to thank all the hon members and
parties that have participated in this debate on the Ghanaian elections.
Before I close this debate let me remind you that in April 1959 the first
President of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, PAC, said:

   We regard it as the sacred duty of every African state to strive
   ceaselessly and energetically for the creation of a United States of
   Africa, from Cape to Cairo and Madagascar to Morocco. The days of small
   states are gone.

This was 50 years ago and the PAC was denounced then for saying so, as
being antiwhite.

Over 50 years ago, Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana, who
was most hated, wrote:

   If Africa’s people are to remain free, if we are to enjoy the full
   benefit of our Africa’s rich resources, we must be united to plan for our
   total defence and the full exploitation of our material and human means
   in the full interest of our people. To go it alone is to limit our
   horizons, curtail our expectations and threaten our liberty.

The idea of a United States of Africa was once laughed off as a very big
joke. There was what was called a “grand debate” on this subject in Ghana
in 2007 during that country’s 50th anniversary. This topic was debated
vigorously in the recent meeting of the African Union.

The vision of a United States of Africa began in 1910, but has been driven
more strongly by Pan Africanist leaders like Ghana’s Nkrumah, Sobukwe and
Lumumba. Today informed financial institutions and learned people outside
Africa affirm that the economic power of Africa rests with the formation of
a United States of Africa.
Let us respect the people of Ghana, learn from them and unite with them as
with our brothers and sisters in the rest of Africa. Let us congratulate
the people of Ghana on their exemplary democratic elections.

After Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown through an imperialist orchestrated coup
d’etat, there have been 21 years of military rule in Ghana; six years of
one-party state and 16 years of a multiparty system. The recent elections
in Ghana, which were won by President John Atta Mills, are no mean
achievement. Let this House congratulate Ghana on a job well done. Thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

                       ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms N D NGCENGWANE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the economic policy of the ANC-led
government will include measures to decisively address obstacles that limit
the pace of employment creation and poverty eradication and will intervene
in favour of more sustainable and inclusive growth for all South Africans.

The Budget tabled yesterday is consistent with the priority areas of the
ANC’s objectives to create work and fight poverty. The five principles that
have informed the budget planning this year are the following:  Protecting
the poor, creating employment, investing in infrastructure, promoting
competitiveness and fiscal sustainability. The largest adjustments to
spending plans go to poverty reduction. The sum of R25 billion is added to
the budgets of provinces mainly for education and health care; R13 billion
for the social assistance grants and for their administration.

In the period ahead, South Africa will need a government with both
experience and political will; a government that fully understands what
needs to be done to address our apartheid past; a government that puts
people first, “Batho Pele”, and builds participatory democracy.

The ANC, working together with the people, can form such a government. I
thank you. [Applause.]
                            MISMANAGEMENT OF SAA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr S M VAN DYK (DA): Madam Speaker, for the past four years the DA has
raised the issue of the South African Airways, SAA, and its Chief Executive
Officer, CEO, Khaya Ngqula in this House. For four years, the SAA has been
a bastion of cronyism and mismanagement. For four years, billions of rands
that could have been spent on housing, clinics and schools have been
frittered away, in ineptitude, on  helicopter trips and catering contracts
with five-star restaurateurs.

The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa, has been unanimous in its
disgust with Ngqula’s performance and brought that to the attention of this
Parliament. The SAA is but one of his 38 directorships and the results of
his lack of managerial focus can be clearly seen by the further R1,6
billion allocated in yesterday’s Budget. The DA can only hope that that
allocation was made on the clear proviso that Ngqula leaves his position.

I want to state to you that almost half of the Ministers in the Cabinet do
not use our national airline in protest at its poor management by this man.
For the ANC, the calls of Scopa, the DA and this House fall on deaf ears.
In contrast, within a week of the ANC tripartite alliance partners, the
South African Transport and Allied Workers Union’s complaints reaching the
press, Ngqula has been put on special leave and there is to be a full
forensic investigation of his management.

Whilst we warmly welcome this outcome, it is a sad indictment of our
democracy when those outside this House are listened to more seriously than
those within. I thank you. [Applause.]

                          TRIBUTE TO JULIUS MALEMA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE (IFP): Madam Speaker, on behalf of all opposition
parties, I wish to pay tribute to the “grand hero” of all opposition
parties, one Julius Malema. Never in the glorious history of this land have
opposition parties had such a magnificent organiser and canvasser of votes
by the thousands for opposition parties. Never in the history of this
country has the ANC had any human being effectively sabotaging the ANC as
well as its “grand hero”, Julius Malema.

I am personally so grateful for our hero’s unstinting efforts to win votes
for the opposition that I am prepared to start a fund to contribute to his
expenses. Julius, old boy, thank you very much.

Siyabonga kakhulu, mfana. [Thank you very much, young man.]
Please continue your magnificent efforts and, Julius, please don’t allow
civilised people in the ANC to derail you from your efforts. You will go
down in political history as the “grand hero” of the opposition and the
“magnificent mampara” of the ANC. [Laughter.]

                  CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE IN TAXI INDUSTRY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J P CRONIN (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC strongly condemns the violence
that has been directed against communities, commuters, bus drivers and taxi
drivers. This violence has been orchestrated by a small network of warlord
elements in the taxi business in, amongst other places, Cape Town and
Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. Our communities and the majority of honest and
hard-working taxi operators are thoroughly sick of this behaviour which
threatens lives and livelihoods, which prevents learners from attending
school and workers from getting to work.

All spheres of government are fully committed to the rolling out of
integrated public transport systems, beginning in our main cities. These
new public transport systems will be subsidised and well regulated. They
will provide affordable and safe mobility to our people. Central to these
plans is the integration and promotion of current taxi operators and
drivers.

The great majority of operators must be liberated from their present
unsustainable hand-to-mouth existence. They must be liberated from the
stranglehold of warlordism. The tens of thousands of drivers in the taxi
sector must be brought into proper employment with the full rights that all
workers should enjoy. This will be possible with the new dispensation.

While the doors of government must always be opened to bona fide concerns
and negotiations, criminal behaviour cannot be tolerated and must meet the
full might of the law. We would like, as the ANC, to salute what the
security forces have done so far in Nelson Mandela Bay and we urge them to
crack down heavily on this kind of warlordism. Thank you. [Applause.]

          E N N NGCOBO’S APPOINTMENT AS CLIMATE CHANGE COMMISSIONER

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D M GUMEDE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC has humbly learnt that hon
member Eugene Nqaba Ngcobo, a member of this House and chairperson of the
Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy, has been invited to serve as a
commissioner for South Africa in the international commission on Climate
Change and Energy Security. [Applause.]

It has further noted that he will be one of the five commissioners from the
G5 countries that have been established in order to advise the G13
countries in the exploration of political trade-offs and security
implications in the battle against climate change. We thus salute the hon
member and this Parliament for contributing to the advancement of a better
life and a brighter future for the progressive global agenda. I thank you.
[Applause.]

                 UNANNOUNCED VISIT TO NYANGA REFUGEE CENTRE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms H WEBER (DA): Madam Speaker, yesterday I conducted an unannounced visit
to the Nyanga Refugee Centre. On my arrival, I was greeted by a long,
disorganised queue of foreign nationals. They were waiting for interviews,
renewal or just for clarification. It was total chaos and it would not take
a rocket scientist to make this whole process controlled and user-friendly
and prevent unnecessary damage to property, as I witnessed. Palisades were
broken down by people, out of pure desperation. Surely, a few officials
could be placed there in the morning, sort the people out and give them a
number and a reference to the correct official inside the building.

According to the manager of operations, each official has a target, so they
must know how many people they can accommodate per day. Perhaps this simple
idea would be to the detriment of those taking bribes to jump the queue, as
various methods of bribery were explained to me. I also have affidavits to
this effect. Officials are aware of it, but say they cannot stop people
paying bribes; so much for bribery and corruption. The building is totally
inadequate and the 22 staff members are also inadequate. There are no
megaphones, so people do not know when they are to be called. There seems
to be a lack of interpreters.

In short, it is a blatant disgrace that we open our borders to people who
suffer hardship in their own country and impose more suffering here. The
Minister must decide whether we are a country open to everybody. If so,
then she must make arrangements to accommodate them.

The SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired.

Ms H WEBER: Oh, has it? Can I not just quickly finish by saying the
Minister seems to have lost interest in her department. [Time expired.]

The SPEAKER: Order! That statement will be taken in its entirety, but your
time has expired. Thank you.

                     REDUCTION OF HIV AND AIDS INFECTION

                            (Member’s Statement)
Ms J C MOLOI-MOROPA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC-led government aims to
reduce the rate of new infections by 50% through an aggressive information
and prevention campaign; expanding access   to appropriate treatment, care
and support to 80% of all living with HIV and Aids and their families.

In line with the ANC manifesto, the ANC-led provincial government of
Gauteng has committed itself to reducing new HIV infections in youth,
babies and adults by 50% by 2011. Furthermore, the provincial coverage of
HIV and Aids education in wards, schools, community-based organisations and
NGOs reaches about 40% of the population, and as such, there is a
tremendous reduction of new HIV infections in youth under 30 years of age,
increased safe sex behaviour and reduced HIV infection in babies through
prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

The ANC government will continue to mobilise our communities around the
healthy lifestyle campaign, including the antitobacco campaign and the
campaign against alcohol and substance abuse. Thank you.

                      CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms C N Z ZIKALALA (IFP): Madam Speaker, issues regarding the environment -
in particular, climate change and global warming - have taken greater
prominence in recent years. While this is good, it is important to ensure
that this increased prominence does translate into the improved plans and
actions that are needed to secure environmental protection and
sustainability.

In our efforts to protect our environment and to ensure sustainability, the
IFP believes that it is vital that efficient monitoring mechanisms are in
place to make certain that our environmental legislation and regulations
are being properly implemented and are having the desired effect so that if
they are not, we can take corrective action. Information and awareness of
environmental issues, especially climate change, must not be limited to
certain groups. We must find ways of effectively communicating the impact
of climate change, and how to adapt to it, to the people in rural areas who
still rely on traditional farming methods for survival, as they will bear
the brunt of the harsh impacts of global warming. Thank you.

                    HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN RURAL AREAS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms T E LISHIVHA (ANC): Madam Speaker, unemployment in rural areas is
disproportionately high and many rural areas lack basic infrastructure such
as roads, water and electricity supply. These conditions force people to
migrate to urban areas in search of a better life, which leads to lack of
human resources in rural areas and places an increased burden on service
delivery in urban areas. Part of the answer is to develop rural areas.

A bed and breakfast facility in Muhlava Village near Tzaneen in Limpopo,
which boasts five chalets and an exhibition centre built in a rural
village, aims to cater for tourists visiting South Africa during the 2010
Fifa World Cup and is scheduled to open next month. The project will help
to fight poverty as many villagers would be employed as cleaners and chefs,
while local crafters, dancers and storytellers will be able to showcase
their skills at the facility.

The project is funded by the partnership of the ANC-led provincial
government, the Mopane District Municipality, the Development Bank of
Southern Africa, the European Union, as well as the Irish Embassy. This
partnership demonstrates the correctness of our statement that: Together,
we can do more. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                     HIJACKING OF SCHOOLS FOR ELECTIONS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr G G BOINAMO (DA): Madam Speaker, schools are being hijacked by ANC
election campaigning and the DA calls on the Minister of Education to act
so as to stop children from suffering yet more setbacks at the hands of
entirely thoughtless and self-interested teachers and officials. The deputy
principal of a school in Pretoria was seen distributing ANC election
material during school hours. He also used teaching time to praise the ANC
and warned learners at the Holy Trinity School in Winterveld who are
eligible to vote not to support Cope.

To make matters worse, it has also been reported that matriculants were
given timetables featuring ANC President Jacob Zuma’s face next to the list
of the school’s terms and calendar. This comes on top of many other reports
at other schools about meetings during school hours and disruptions of
lessons. Learners are sent to school to learn and not to be indoctrinated.
Our national leaders need to use their authority and make this very clear.
Thank you. [Applause.]

       CHALLENGES OF SERVICE DELIVERY WILL BE ADDRESSED SYSTEMATICALLY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr G LEKGETHO (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC is committed to ensuring that
the challenges of service delivery are addressed in a systematic,
determined and transparent manner, at all times working to involve
communities in resolving problems and overcoming whatever obstacles may
exist.

Hence the Department of Home Affairs, in partnership with the Department of
Social Development, the South African Social Security Agency and the City
of Johannesburg, hosted an imbizo at the Diepsloot sports grounds. The
purpose of the imbizo was to facilitate the registration for birth
certificates and identity documents for the people to access government
services.

The residents of Diepsloot came in large numbers to access these services
and despite the challenges that people in the area face, they remain
positive about government’s efforts to improve their lives.

The ANC-led government will continue to work together with the people to
implement programmes that are aimed at improving their lives. Thank you.
[Applause.]

            RIGHT OF SOUTH AFRICAN CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD TO VOTE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF Plus): Agb Speaker, algemene stemreg vir volwassenes
word in artikel 1 as een van die grondliggende bepalings van die Grondwet
genoem. Dit is een van die artikels wat met 75% verskans is as ’n basiese
reg.

Artikel 36 van die Grondwet maak dit moontlik om van hierdie basiese regte
te beperk. As hierdie artikel dan gebruik word om Suid-Afrikaanse burgers
in die buiteland hulle stemreg te ontneem, moet daar logiese redes wees
waarom sekere Suid-Afrikaanse burgers in die buiteland wel mag stem en
ander nie. Die Pretoriase Hooggeregshof het bevind dat artikel 33 van die
Kieswet om presies hierdie, en verskeie ander redes, ongrondwetlik is.

As alle Suid-Afrikaanse burgers in 1994 kon stem, en alle gevangenes tans
kan stem, is daar geen rede waarom geregistreerde Suid-Afrikaanse burgers
nie in hierdie verkiesing by bestaande stembusse in die buiteland by
ambassades en konsulate kan stem nie.

As hierdie regering nie bereid is om dit te doen en dit vir mense so
moontlik te maak nie, sal die Grondwethof uiteindelik moet beslis hieroor
om dit wel moontlik te maak om op ’n praktiese en beslis nie onrealisitese
wyse nie, nie almal nie, maar geregistreerde kiesers by bestaande
ambassades te kan laat stem. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans member’s
statement follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER (FF Plus): Hon Speaker, universal adult suffrage is
stipulated in Section 1 as one of the founding provisions of the
Constitution. It is one of the clauses entrenched as a basic right by a 75%
majority.

Section 36 of the Constitution makes it possible to limit some of these
basic rights. If this clause, however, is then used to deny South African
citizens overseas the right to vote, there should be logical reasons why
certain South African citizens overseas may indeed vote but others not. The
Pretoria High Court found, for this very reason and numerous others, that
Section 33 of the Electoral Act is unconstitutional.

If all South African citizens could vote in 1994, and all prisoners may
currently vote, there is no reason why registered South African voters
cannot vote at existing polling stations in this election at embassies and
consulates overseas.

If this government is not prepared to do this and accommodate voters in
this manner, the Constitutional Court will eventually have to pronounce on
this matter to indeed make it possible for registered voters, not everyone,
to vote at existing embassies in a practical and definitely not in an
unrealistic manner. I thank you.]

               ANC’S EFFORTS TO REDUCE OVERCROWDING IN SCHOOLS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms F J WRIGHT (ANC): Hon Speaker, the ANC-led government believes that
education is a means of promoting good citizenship as well as preparing our
people for the needs of a modern economy and a democratic society.

Building on the achievements in education, the ANC government aims to
ensure progressive realisation of universal schooling, improving quality
education and eliminating disparities. The ANC together with our people are
working round the clock to deal with the burden of overcrowded classrooms.

ArcelorMittal South Africa and the Department of Education have entered
into an agreement that commits the company to building ten schools
throughout the country.

The ANC calls upon others in the private sector to emulate this example.
Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: These are extra slots that were created by the absent parties.
There is an extra slot for the DA. [Interjections.] No, no, why do you do
that, hon members? I’ve just been assisted at doing my work; at least I
haven’t failed to ask for assistance.

                          SPENDING OF ANNUAL BUDGET

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr S J F MARAIS (DA): Madam Chair, Minister Manuel has presented 13 Budget
Speeches to this House. Within that time we have seen our debt levels for
our personal income tax drop and our tax revenues rise. Yet despite
consecutive increases in the budget of the Department of Health, the
Department of Education, the Department of Housing and the Department of
Home Affairs, we continue to see the maths and literacy standards of our
learners fall below those of the levels in Egypt and Indonesia. Entire
provinces’ health care systems are collapsing because the annual budgets
are spent prematurely, and there are new visa requirements for South
African citizens because the Department of Home Affairs is unable to keep
track of the passports and the identity documents that they issue.

It is true that prudent fiscal management has made South Africa’s
expenditure shovel ready. Yet, as after every Budget in the past, the poor,
the pensioners and the marginalised in our society wonder whether this is
the year that those in this government will do as they promised and, as the
Minister emphasised yesterday, that they should roll up their sleeves and
begin digging. Thank you. [Applause.]

                   TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF BUSHBUCKRIDGE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M W SIBUYANA (IFP): Madam Speaker, in the name of the IFP, I stand to
pay tribute to the people of Bushbuckridge and their different traditional
authorities for being law-abiding citizens even in trying circumstances.

They, with great humility and soul-touching dignity, conducted funerals of
their relatives who had died in man-made wells in search of water, whilst
others had died after drinking water from polluted rivers.

Klaserie Dam is nearby and Inyaka Dam is in their midst, and all the rivers
are full of flowing water, and yet again the majority of residents have not
a drop of clean water to drink.

I say to the people of Bushbuckridge: Keep it up. Refrain from violence.
Keep praying to your God. Your tears are not in vain. Thank you.

                    HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN RURAL AREAS
                      CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Ms E Thabethe): Madam Speaker, I
would like to respond to the statement made by hon member Lishivha, on the
rural economic development project which is a success. Yes, I do agree with
her that by working together we can do more. This is one example in which,
when we talk about these things, some of the people think that we just want
votes, but these are programmes of government because the ANC-led
government is a government that is caring. It is indeed accelerating in
ensuring that we can do away with poverty. And I hope that this is one
example that other people should learn from and be able to work together
with government.

Government alone cannot create jobs. Government creates the conditions and
the environment to attract investments so that one can then be able to come
with such projects. I am sure that in 2010 some of our guests will be
sleeping here and there are even rooms to increase this if they can contact
some of the agencies of the Department of Trade and Industry, DTI, to
assist them to expand.

The second statement that I would like to respond to is the one made by the
hon member Zikalala on the environment’s sustainability, climate change and
global warming. I do agree with her that some of the points that she is
raising are valid. But I think that as a country we hosted the World Summit
on Sustainable Development, WSSD, and also there were responsibilities on
the part of government to follow up on in ensuring that we implement them.

In implementing those, we also ratified the Kyoto Protocol and I hope that
as government we are implementing some of those contents of the Kyoto
Protocol to ensure that we can deal with the challenges of environmental
biodiversity and other issues that are related to that. We are a country
that is very caring and we have passed a lot of legislation in this House
to ensure that the polluters are made to pay. Hon Zikalala is a member of
that committee, and we are doing very well. So, these are good things that
we do as this government, which once again shows that if we work together,
we can do more. [Applause.]

Linked to that statement is the statement that was read by hon Gumede on
our member who is going to serve on the global progressive agenda. Surely
as a member of this House, with his expertise, he is indeed going to add to
this agenda of global change. He is going to ensure that he can contribute
positively, and we really need to applaud him and thank him for his good
contribution, ensuring that this is an ANC member who was trained by the
ANC to change, not only the country or continent, but the world. Yes,
together we can do more if we work together. Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Deputy Minister, as the executive you have the
opportunity to respond to six statements. You have responded successfully
to three statements, which means your colleagues are left with three
statements to respond to.

                  CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE IN TAXI INDUSTRY

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, I fully agree with the
hon Cronin on the issue of taxi violence which we have experienced here in
the past few weeks.

Our labour laws are very clear. They allow people to withdraw their labour
or engage in any industrial action, and we will always support that. We
will also continue to engage anybody, including taxi owners and operators,
on any matter regarding which they may or may not be satisfied with the
government. But, we want to emphasise the point, there will be no
negotiations whatsoever between government and any criminals or
perpetrators of criminal acts. [Applause.] So, we will do everything in our
power to protect our communities.

Here in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces there are people who have
already been arrested because of that. We will continue to do that and make
it very difficult for anybody to commit crime in our country. I thank you.
[Applause.]

                          TRIBUTE TO JULIUS MALEMA
               ANC’S EFFORTS TO REDUCE OVERCROWDING IN SCHOOLS
                          SPENDING OF ANNUAL BUDGET

                            (Minister’s Response)
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I will try to inform Mr Malema
that the hon Van der Merwe wishes to establish an association with him. I
am sure that they will have a very happy discussion together. [Laughter.] I
would have thought, as a senior member of this House, that the hon Van der
Merwe would have said something far more sensible and mature. Nevertheless,
I will convey his view.

With respect to the Budget, Madam Speaker, clearly, the areas of education
that the hon Wright has referred to; the excellent focus that the hon
member from the DA referred to; the focus of the Minister of Finance on the
key challenges of the country and the continued effective management of the
micro-economic fundamentals, as well as the socio-economic challenges and
objectives of our country - all of these do illustrate the targeting of our
key priority areas as the ANC of health, fighting crime, promoting quality
education, ensuring that there is rural and youth development and, of
course, job creation. All of these are priorities that Minister Manuel has
spoken to are well in line with the manifesto of the ANC, which indicates
to the people of our nation that together we can indeed do more.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I think we have one slot if anyone would like to take it. Yes.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: That is very generous. Thank you very much,
Madam Speaker. Maybe it is because maths is a challenge in education, as
the hon member said, although I would remind him that in the 2008
examinations we had the largest number of young people in our country
passing mathematics at higher grade equivalent level than we ever had
before. [Applause.] Therefore, the programmes that our country has begun to
put in place in order to support more and more young people to succeed in
mathematics and science are beginning to bear results and we will intensify
our efforts at improving literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science
outcomes throughout the education sector.

I met with vice-chancellors of universities yesterday, and some of them
informed me about the calibre of pass that they have noted amongst new
students, particularly in terms of the performance of young people in some
of the tests in numeracy and writing skills that the universities have
asked young students to do. So, there is progress but it is incremental,
depending on our effort. As members would be aware, Madam Speaker, it is
going to be a long haul.

Finally, I certainly know that this government and the ANC government that
will be elected with a significant majority on April 22, will continue
their commitment to accountability through contact with the people and will
indeed work, as Parliament has done, to ensure that democracy,
participation, good governance and service delivery are brought closer and
closer to where our people are. Thank you. [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 17:11.
