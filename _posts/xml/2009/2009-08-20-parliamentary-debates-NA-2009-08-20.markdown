Agreed to.

                Time allocation for political partY RESPONSES

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Hon Speaker, hon Deputy President, I
move the draft resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as
follows:

   That the House resolves that, notwithstanding Rule 106(5), the time
   allocated for party responses to executive statements for the remainder
   of the Fourth Parliament be as follows: ANC: 9 minutes; DA: 4 minutes;
   Cope: 2 minutes; IFP: 1 minute; and all other parties 1 minute each.

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: Mr Speaker, on behalf of the IFP I rise to object
and request an opportunity to motivate the objection.

The SPEAKER: The objection of the IFP has been noted. [Interjections.] Go
ahead with the motivation, but only for one minute.

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: May I motivate, Mr Speaker?

The SPEAKER: Go ahead, but only for one minute.

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. We object on two grounds.
Firstly, we object to the practice of replacing and amending a Rule of our
National Assembly Rules for the entire term of Parliament without due
process, because in that way we can very well amend all the Rules.

Secondly, the Rules give equal time to each political party and this
amendment moved, is contrary to the prescription of the Constitution to
protect minorities and give equitable time rather than proportional time to
minorities. By reducing the three minutes which each political party has in
terms of the Constitution to one minute, really eliminates the opportunity
of meaningful debate on significant aspects of these proceedings. Thank
you.

Mr S N SWART: Thank you, Speaker. The ACDP also wishes to lodge its
objection. May I also address you on this issue?

The SPEAKER: Also one minute, hon member.
Mr S N SWART: Speaker, I also want to join the sentiments expressed by my
colleague from the IFP, that it is ludicrous to participate in a discussion
or comment on the statement made by a Minister in one minute. The Minister
in this next instance will be given 20 minutes and we believe that it is
also unconstitutional that parties should be given one minute to respond.
Thank you.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Speaker and Deputy President, I think
it will be important that we don’t fabricate a new concept of due process
and try to apply it to a House that already knows what due process is. In
this House, we have a structure that is called the “Chief Whips’ Forum” and
that is where, in terms of due process that is required, we process the
issues.

There was a meeting of the Chief Whips’ Forum, where the parties were
represented, including the IFP, which is introducing this new concept of
due process, and we agreed on the time allocation that we have just
proposed. So, all we are now doing is making a formal proposal that was
already adopted by all the parties that were represented.

I think, hon Ambrosini, as a lawyer you will very well know that if you are
absent and we are quorate we are entitled to take decisions, and we took
this decision that we are putting before this House. Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, since there has been objections, I now put the
question. Those in favour will say “aye” and those agaist will say “no”.
The ayes have it.

Agreed to (Inkatha Freedom Party and African Christian Democratic Party
dissenting).

 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR SOUTH
           AFRICA’S RESPONSE TO THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Hon Speaker, hon Deputy President,
and hon members, the international economic crisis and the local recession
threatens to wipe out our economic gains. If the trends continue, we could
soon find ourselves back to where we were five years ago.

Our gains are being seriously eroded but we will recover if we take the
right steps. We need to use the crisis as an opportunity to mobilise the
nation around a programme to defend the economy and to further strengthen
it and to defend jobs.

I am addressing the House today to share with hon members the steps that
government is taking to address what is the most serious economic challenge
since the advent of democracy. The recession was triggered by the global
economic crisis and South Africa lagged behind many other economies in the
timing of the impact on our production, employment and economic
performance. Initial signs were evident from late last year, but the
economic data released this year has confirmed the scale of the impact on
our economy.

We have recently experienced what has been described as the worst quarterly
economic performance in 25 years with serious declines in both
manufacturing and mining production. The latest manufacturing data, for
June this year, shows that estimated monthly manufacturing production has
shrunk by 17,1% and monthly sales have dropped by 19,6% compared to a year
ago. Second quarter production shrunk by 18,7% and sales dropped by 20,2%
compared to a year ago.

Manufacturing output has been declining since about mid last year. It has
now reached levels last seen some five years ago. If these trends persist,
it means that four years of modest manufacturing growth since January 2004
has been reversed by the dramatic decline in the physical volume of
manufacturing production in the past 12 months. June statistics, the latest
that we have, have indicated a 7,3% drop in mining compared to the same
month a year ago.

Employment data have shown a large increase in unemployment. The Quarterly
Employment Survey of Stats SA for the first three months of this year
recorded 179 000 job losses.

The Labour Force Survey for the second three months of this year recorded
267 000 job losses and noted that 302 000 people have become too
discouraged to seek employment. Retail sales have declined, with June 2009
figures showing a 6,6 % drop in sales compared to the same month a year
ago. This is, therefore, taking us back to mid-2006 levels. As
retrenchments and job losses increase, they impact on consumption, leading
to lower demand, which could result in a renewed round of job losses.

The total output of the nation, as measured by GDP, declined by 3% for the
second quarter of 2009. We have now had three successive quarters of a
decline in output. Company capacity utilisation, which measures the extent
to which we use the available productive capacity of the nation’s
workplaces, has declined as has the stock of capital in a number of
manufacturing sectors. Capacity utilisation is at levels last seen in 2001
and we are deeply concerned at the prospect of a permanent decline in
productive capacity as factories close rather than simply reduce output.
Liquidations and insolvencies show a worrying trend, as do increased claims
from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, UIF.

In these trends, South Africa is facing the same pressures felt by many
other countries with the most serious economic challenge since the Great
Depression. What started as a financial crisis has rapidly become a crisis
in the productive sector of the economy, and employment has been hit
particularly hard.
With both developed and developing countries, monetary and fiscal policy
has been concentrated on shoring up aggregate demand as the impact of the
credit bubble collapse impacted on the real economy. Interest rates have
been cut and some central banks have used quantitative easing to further
respond to the crisis.

Public sector spending has been ramped up and countries now run large and
growing budget deficits. The US and the UK, for example, are now running
deficits of 13% and 14% respectively. Global prospects are still uncertain,
with evidence that the fragile signs of recovery are largely driven by the
effects of the dramatic and co-ordinated government stimulus packages that
have pumped liquidity into the global economy at levels not seen in our
generation.

International experience has shown that financial crises leave large
employment and social damage in their wake even when economies recover.
Employment growth in particular lags economic recovery, sometimes by
considerable periods of time. It is in this context that government has
stepped up efforts to address the impact of the global crisis on our
economy and our people.

Fiscal policy has remained expansionary in spite of falls in tax revenues,
and the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates repeatedly over the last six
months. Earlier this year, government, organised labour, business and
community organisations adopted the Framework for South Africa’s Response
to the International Economic Crisis. That document sets out our collective
response to the international economic crisis, which is widely recognised
as the deepest and most serious economic crisis in at least the last 80
years.

The framework, which provides the basis for a wide range of actions needed
to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the country and our people, was
founded on the following broad principles:

   The risk of unfairly placing the burden of the economic downturn on the
   poor and the vulnerable must be avoided; activities aimed at
   strengthening the capacity of the economy to grow and create decent jobs
   in the future must be protected and supported as far as possible; planned
   high levels of investment in the public sector, particularly
   infrastructure, must be maintained and the private sector must be
   encouraged to maintain and improve, wherever possible, their levels of
   fixed direct investment and continue with corporate social investment
   programmes; and interventions must be timely, tailored and targeted as is
   appropriate.

The Framework recognises the social partners’ collective responsibility to
work together to withstand the crisis and ensure that the poor and the most
vulnerable are protected as far as possible from the impact of the crisis.

Noting the country’s  well-developed and advanced system of social
dialogue, a strong institution in the form of Nedlac and a tradition of
working together as constituents to address the social challenges, it seeks
to draw on these strengths in developing and adjusting South Africa’s
response to the crisis and implementing its various commitments. In
addition, the framework recognises the importance of ensuring that the
economy is ready to take advantage of the next upturn and that the benefits
of such growth are shared by all our people.

In today’s statement, I would like to brief hon members on the progress we
have made in implementing the framework thus far. In so doing, I would like
to draw attention to the context within which this implementation has taken
place and, in particular, to point out that following the appointment of a
new Cabinet and the reorganisation of government functions, government has
worked closely with social partners to speed up implementation.

President Zuma highlighted the centrality of this work in his state of the
nation address on 3 June 2009, when he said, and I quote:

   It is important now more than ever that we work in partnership on a
   common programme to respond to this crisis. We take as our starting point
   the Framework for South Africa's Response to the International Economic
   Crisis, concluded by government, labour and business in February this
   year. We must act now to minimise the impact of this downturn on those
   most vulnerable.

Following the state of the nation address, the task teams provided for in
the framework were reactivated. In early July, we agreed to a set of
priority areas and all parties rolled up their sleeves to produce action
plans to respond to the crisis.

There was a new energy and focus to the response. In all, hon members may
be interested to know that 19 meetings have been held since 1 July by the
various committees responsible for forging a united position - this is some
three meetings a week. More importantly, the energy produced solid results.

On 5 August, the leadership team met with and briefed President Zuma on the
progress we had achieved up to that point. That leadership team will be
meeting again tomorrow.

To date, we have prioritised the following 12 areas of work: a training
layoff scheme for workers at risk of retrenchment; combating customs fraud;
support for distressed sectors; social assistance, including child support
grants and old age pensions; stronger competition in the food supply chain;
food relief; assistance by the Industrial Development Corporation and
refocusing its mandate; availability and flow of credit; Expanded Public
Works Programmes; leveraging jobs from public procurement; expanding public
sector employment in areas of critical need; and public grant
conditionalities to ensure that state support achieves the desired results.

In  six  of  these  areas,  we  concluded  agreements  that  are  now  being
implemented:  Firstly,  to  meet  the  challenge  of  companies  retrenching
workers as a result of loss of orders due to  the  recession  we  set  up  a
National Jobs Fund to finance a training lay-off scheme.

The scheme entails enrolling workers in training programmes for a period  of
up to three months. The principle behind the scheme is to use the period  of
industrial slack to train and reskill workers.

The scheme will be available to workers earning up to R180 000 a  year,  and
the key design elements of the scheme are that it is  available  to  workers
as an alternative to retrenchment. During  the  period  of  the  scheme  the
employment  relationship  with  the  company  is  maintained,   a   training
allowance of 50% of basic wages up to R6 239  per  month  will  be  paid  to
workers on the scheme, and participating employers will carry the cost of  a
basic social package to ensure that death, disability and  funeral  benefits
are not suspended during this period.

Training is left to industries and companies  to  define,  but  we  provided
three guidelines: The training should be of value to the company  concerned;
it can address generic and adult literacy and numeracy needs; and it  is  an
opportunity to  roll  out  and  disseminate  information  and  communication
technology skills on the shop floor.

The Minister of Labour’s  work  in  mobilising  all  the  resources  of  his
Department and reporting agencies has been invaluable in making it  possible
to launch the scheme in September this year. An amount of R2,4 billion  will
be placed in the fund, drawn from resources in the National Skills Fund  and
the UIF.

In order to ensure its  successful  implementation,  it  will  rely  on  the
collective efforts of a number of state entities: the NSF and the  UIF;  the
Setas; the CCMA; some government  departments  such  as  the  Department  of
Labour, responsible for co-ordinating and  finalising  the  drafting  of  an
implementation guide in collaboration with the  CCMA  and  social  partners;
the Department of Trade and Industry,  responsible  for  ensuring  that  our
distressed sector support is co-ordinated with the training lay-off  scheme;
and the Economic  Development  Department,  responsible  for  assessing  the
economic and developmental impact of the training lay-off scheme.

Most importantly, it requires partnerships between business  and  labour  at
workplace level.

The training lay-off scheme is the first of its  kind  that  government  has
launched and we  have  designed  its  implementation  to  be  as  simple  as
possible.
A key implementation agency will be the CCMA. The CCMA will  help  companies
and unions to conclude their training lay-off agreements. The CCMA  has  now
trained about 250 staff members, mainly commissioners, on the training  lay-
off scheme and its  implementation.  It  has  a  toll-free  number  and  has
published a guide to the training lay-off scheme on its website.

The Setas have been asked to set aside resources for the  financing  of  the
training courses themselves and  to  identify  appropriate,  short,  focused
training courses. Special board meetings of Setas  are  now  being  convened
and a number of Setas have advised they will take part in the training  lay-
off scheme.

I call on the Seta board members from business and labour to  do  everything
in their power to ensure full and effective participation by Setas  so  that
workers and companies can obtain the benefit of the training lay-off  scheme
as soon as possible. Indeed, Speaker, here is an opportunity  for  Setas  to
show their value-add and to convince even  the  sceptics  that  they  are  a
vital part of the training delivery machinery and  are  flexible  enough  to
respond to new and unusual circumstances.

Secondly, to address high levels of illegal imports and customs  fraud  that
has led to many thousands of job losses, the capacity  of  SARS  to  address
customs  fraud  has  been  strengthened.  The  Minister   of   Finance   has
facilitated a renewed focus by SARS on measures to improve its impact.  SARS
has now reported significant progress in respect of investigations  and  the
confiscation of goods.

A number of companies  are  currently  under  investigation  for  smuggling,
round-tripping, abuse of incentive arrangements, quota  fraud,  rebate  item
abuse and under-declaration of value.

In the clothing and textiles sector, by way of illustration, some  immediate
outcomes  of  the  antifraud  campaign  are  as  follows:  In  respect   of,
smuggling, four companies are being investigated and  the  intention  is  to
initiate  criminal  proceedings;  round-tripping,  15  companies  are  being
investigated  and  the  support  of  neighbouring  customs  is  required  to
finalise these investigations; export  incentive  abuse,  14  companies  are
being  investigated  and  some   duties   have   already   been   recovered;
counterfeits, during raids a number of goods have been seized; quota  fraud,
four companies are  being  investigated  and  will  be  criminally  charged;
rebate item abuse,  three  companies  are  under  investigation  to  recover
duties; and in  respect  of  under-declaration,  five  companies  are  under
investigation and will be criminally charged.

Thirdly, to address huge job losses in certain sectors of  the  economy,  we
have facilitated discussions at sector level between  business  and  labour,
and measures to address  their  immediate  problems  have  been  identified.
These include support for distressed companies in the automotive  sector;  a
rescue package for the clothing and textiles industry; increased  incentives
for  the  manufacture  of  capital  equipment;   transport   equipment   and
fabricated  metal  products  linked   to   South   Africa’s   Infrastructure
Development Programme; and payments  by  government  to  small,  medium  and
micro enterprises and other businesses within 30 days.

In the auto sector, business and labour have formulated  a  commitment  that
provides that companies receiving crisis-related assistance must  commit  to
a moratorium on retrenchments for the  duration  of  the  assistance  period
with a provision that variation to this commitment, in  cases  where  it  is
necessary  for  a  firm’s  survival,  be  accompanied  by  requirements  for
independent verification of financial and other  relevant  information.  So,
our social partners have really been working hard.

Fourthly, to address the problems of access to credit and  working  capital,
the IDC has made R6 billion available over the next  two  years  to  respond
directly to the crisis. Some applications have  already  been  received  and
approved.

The IDC has 49 funding applications in the pipeline, 23 of  which  are  from
existing IDC clients while the remaining 26 are from new  or  potential  IDC
clients.


From 1 April 2009 to date, eleven  financing  applications  from  distressed
companies totalling R743 million have been approved. We will now  work  with
the IDC to improve the employment impact of its funding.

Fifthly, to address food price pressures on consumers at a time  of  falling
family  incomes,  the  Competition  Commission’s  investigations  into   and
prosecution of firms in the food supply chain alleged  to  have  engaged  in
various forms of prohibited anticompetitive conduct have been stepped up.

Seven parts of the food supply chain are now the  subject  of  attention  by
the  competition  authorities:  in  respect  of  bread,  the  commission  is
prosecuting two separate cases that have  now  been  consolidated  into  one
case, and is investigating a new  case;  with  the  milling  of  maize,  the
commission  is  referring  the  case  to  the   Competition   Tribunal   for
prosecution; in the dairy sector,  a  case  is  before  the  tribunal;  with
poultry, one case is before the  tribunal,  with  the  wider  conduct  being
investigated by the commission; in fertilizer, settlement has  been  reached
with one company, with others being prosecuted; in fats and oils,  there  is
an investigation by the commission; and with  regard  to  supermarkets,  the
commission has commenced its investigation. These are firm and  clear  steps
taken by the commission to address food price increases.

Finally, Speaker, to address the growing debt faced by  many  consumers  and
households, the National Debt Mediation Association, a  business  initiative
to assist over-indebted consumers, has been established  to  provide  rules,
standards and processes to address debt restructuring.

These six measures, hon members, constitute  a  solid  start  to  our  joint
endeavours, and I wish to thank the leadership of the  social  partners  and
government departments for their hard work to have achieved this.

I wish to advise this august House that we are  now  simultaneously  working
on two fronts: to properly implement the measures we have announced, and  to
identify new areas in the framework that can progress to a conclusion.

We recently briefed MECs of six provinces, KwaZulu-Natal,  Gauteng,  Western
Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State and Limpopo on  the  package  and  they  have
endorsed the approach in the framework. Provinces will now identify ways  in
which they can align their own responses  to  the  recession  with  the  six
areas that have been identified so that these measures can have the  biggest
possible impact. The  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal  has  taken  the  lead  in
convening an economic recovery and jobs summit.

The ministerial cluster on Economic Sectors and Employment was convened
this week to receive a report on implementation, and a number of areas were
identified that needed to be addressed in the next phase. They include
strengthening the use of co-operatives to address the crisis, fast-tracking
work on green jobs, identifying measures to deal with persons in vulnerable
situations, including women and rural and informal sector workers.

In particular, we want to find ways of drawing more South Africans, through
their community and NGOs structures into the partnership to respond to the
recession. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr D T GEORGE: Speaker, a rescue plan in response to the international
economic crisis implies the need for an immediate response to an immediate
threat. Government did not respond immediately, neither was its response
aimed at the immediate concerns arising from the economic downturn.

There is a fundamental difference between structural determinants and
cyclical changes - a conceptual divide that government would do well to
understand. Structural problems require long-term policy solutions, while
cyclical issues require action in the short term. This difference should
inform the approach that we need to take in determining the response to our
crisis.

The global economic downturn is a cyclical phenomenon, where financial
markets stopped functioning as they should, due to a shortage of liquidity.
It was a monetary crisis requiring an immediate monetary solution. That is
why governments intervened to act as the bank of last resort, and
thereafter introduced stimulus packages in an attempt, in the short run, to
smooth the worst of this severe downward phase of the economic cycle.

What is our government doing? The Minister mentions a very long list of
activities that government plans to implement to address the impact of the
crisis. In particular, these include strengthening the capacity of the
economy to grow, public sector spending, corporate social interventions and
cushioning the impact on the vulnerable.

He mentions training initiatives, addressing competition, expanding public
sector employment, and training for retrenched workers – a very broad sweep
of activities, required for the functioning of an economy. Clearly, our
government is focusing on structural problems, which it should have tackled
a long time ago, rather than addressing the immediate cyclical issues.

A year ago, the International Panel on Growth presented its findings on the
structural problems in our economy. Its key findings were that very few
South Africans were working, the less skilled needed to be absorbed into
the economy, and the binding constraints on the speed limit of our economy
needed to be relaxed.

These problems require our attention, but it is not the place of a
temporary rescue plan to try and address deep-seated problems in the
economy. These problems can be resolved through systemic structural
changes, such as a liberalised labour market that will encourage job
creation, scrapping the ineffective Seta system in favour of an effective
apprenticeship system, and trade policy that accommodates small and large
exporters.

If these structural problems are not addressed by means of adequate
structural changes, then our economy will not be able to take full
advantage of the next upward phase of the business cycle. Resolving these
structural problems will take time even if government commits itself to
action, but this will not resolve the cyclical problem that we have now.

South Africa is no exception; many businesses cannot draw credit to invest
or pay their own suppliers, and are thus forced to close down and retrench
workers. Keeping economic activity alive through this cycle will retain
jobs and this is where government should focus its efforts. Business
enterprises need access to appropriate credit facilities that they cannot
obtain from conventional sources. If the government had responded quickly,
South Africa would not have seen the number of job losses experienced thus
far.

Across the world, unions and business are making agreements on how best to
keep people in jobs. We need to have these conversations in South Africa,
and government needs to make the environment easier to do this. Government
needs to respond now by taking resolute action on the immediate threats to
our economy and, in this way, demonstrating that it is willing and able to
perform its role as facilitator, not controller, of economic activity.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L S NGONYAMA: Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon members, we thank the
government for this initiative to help the South African people to grow and
restore our economy.

In the light of the current domestic and international economic crisis, we
need an extraordinary plan, commitment and discipline. However, we need to
remain cautious and vigilant as far as the opportunity that lies before us
is concerned, because a grant of this magnitude can create a marked
difference for the people of South Africa.

It is within this context that we propose that the two most important areas
we need to consider are the small to medium enterprises that employ the
largest portion of the South African workforce, and the shortage of skilled
workers in specific industries and we therefore call for targeted training.


The questions we need to ask are the following: What type of intervention
will yield the most important and effective results? What instruments do we
need to use? Which of the industries in our economy have the greatest
potential to anchor it? How can we best provide skills to satisfy the
demand in these industries to ensure sustainability?
The issue, therefore, is sustainability. Training without guarantee of
absorption can be very counterproductive. How then do we support SMMEs to
weather the current economic climate and prevent further retrenchments?

What we need, at this point, is an activist state, a state that is
disciplined, a state that is rooted in ensuring that we deliver on the
needs of the people.

At the current stage, in our view, we need interventions in five areas.
These are agriculture, infrastructure development, manufacturing, the
service industry and knowledge-based industries. This implies truly
targeted training.

We propose that a detailed study be undertaken to ensure that the
allocations made are used to their fullest potential for the recovery and
sustainable growth of our economy. We also propose that a panel of experts
be established to determine the areas that represent the greatest need.
This panel of experts should study the weaknesses that we have experienced
in South Africa – the weaknesses of Setas that have failed our country.

It is also essential to engage our society at large. We want to submit
that, while we agree with the participation process that the Minister has
alluded to, a participatory mood within this context has not been created
in the country. We have not seen full participation of the people. Thank
you. [Time expired.]

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: Mr Speaker, in my ridiculously short minute I can
only note that the government’s response, as outlined by the Minister,
seems to be based on the notion of a temporary crisis, a period of bad
weather, a cyclical period of downturn which will bring us back to where we
were before it all started. It therefore reflects the notion: Let’s try to
freeze the present situation until the weather improves and we will be
fine. I hope he gets it right.

I, however, beg to differ. I think that this crisis is a structural crisis.
It needs to be addressed in the context of what can survive in a future
environment characterised by massive manufacturing capacity having been
moved around the world by the effects of the crisis itself.

A crisis is a time for opportunities. It is a time in which bold actions
can be taken. It is a time to look at where South Africa is going to be
after the crisis - whether we will develop the capacity to produce products
for the global market.

In that sense, government should also take the opportunity to take bold
measures to develop an industrial policy for the country - a new industrial
basis for after the crisis. This might not seem to be the time to do so,
but it is the time in which the need for survival may press us to take such
bold action.

By the same token, let us liberalise the market, as Dr George was saying.
Let’s finally fulfil the promise of getting rid of exchange controls, which
has been echoing in this Chamber for many years. Let’s look at the skills
within the market, the monopolies ...

The SPEAKER: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr M G ORIANI-AMBROSINI: My one minute?

The SPEAKER: It’s more than one minute, hon member.

Mr S N SWART: Speaker, the ACDP welcomes the briefing by the Minister.

We wish to point out that today’s Financial Mail states: “It’s a sign of
how bad our economic condition has become when economists express relief
that real GDP contracted by only 3%.”

And we know we still have a long way to go, with the economy expected to
contract by a full 2% this year.

For South Africa to emerge from recession, manufacturing and retail must
recover, requiring a global recovery to raise demand for our manufactured
exports and revival for the stressed South African consumer.

The former appears to be on track if you look at Japan, Germany and France,
which are exiting recession, and the US, UK and Europe, which are showing
promising signs – they are speaking of “green shoots”.

However, the recovery for the South African consumer will take much longer,
with household debt levels at record highs and ongoing job losses.

We believe that the measures announced today by the Minister will go a long
way. The challenge, however, will be in the implementation. They must be
properly implemented; therein lies the challenge. I thank you.

Ms E M COLEMAN: Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon Deputy Speaker, members
of the executive, hon colleagues, I greet you all. Let me start by
appreciating the Minister’s initiative of tabling this statement. I believe
it will help to clarify issues around the framework response to the public
and the people affected so that, in turn, those affected can begin to take
the necessary steps to provide for their own wellbeing.

In the same breath, I would also like to take this opportunity to applaud
government, under the leadership of the President, together with other
stakeholders, our social partners, who participated in this agreement
process, on their sterling work. It takes people who have themselves
experienced such difficulties to be able to adequately respond in the
manner you have. In other words, to understand it, you should have lived
it. Otherwise you will respond like other members here are responding. This
is what we mean when we say: Working together, we can do more.

I also want to remind you that the social partners are also from the
business sector, unions and civil society; it is not only government.
Therefore, it would be wrong to direct all issues to government, because
this is the country’s response and the country, through various social
partners, have participated in this particular response plan.

The framework response, as reported today, is highly commended and it could
not have come at a better time. We all know that the most severely affected
in this regard are the previously disadvantaged individuals, those who come
from the poorest of the poor communities and backgrounds. Hence, we will
urge that the framework response, objectives and intentions are implemented
without failure.

From our side, as legislators, we will be following the implementation
process and we will help, through our oversight, to ensure that no worker
is compromised by either government bureaucracy or the companies concerned,
under the training lay-off scheme.

We appreciate the fact that no additional money is going to be transferred
to the training lay-off scheme from the National Revenue Fund. This is due
to government’s appreciation for the fact that we are already in a
recession and cannot continue to overburden the government fiscus and
should rather use flexible means to achieve the intended goal. This is
applauded and should be encouraged, especially due to the fact that amongst
the participants were stakeholders from the civil society who ordinarily
would have expected government to foot the bill without any compromise.

We also request the Minister and the task teams involved in the crafting of
this response plan to ensure that the process after the companies’
applications is not derailed or does not take longer than anticipated, and
that Setas’ courses must respond to our economy’s needs.

We are excited about the fact that the implementation of the plan will
start as early as September this year, and that there are companies that
have already applied for both the training lay-off schemes and the IDC’s
stimulus fund for the distressed sectors.

We need, as the House, to support this initiative and this particular
response plan, because our role is to ensure that that plan gets
implemented. We should, therefore, strengthen our oversight role so that
the timelines, as set by government and its social partners, are met
without any failures. I want to conclude by commending the steps taken,
especially against those who are defrauding customs. Halala, government!
Continue with the good work. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY –
     SHORTLIST OF CANDIDATES FOR APPOINTMENT TO BOARD OF HUMAN SCIENCES
                              RESEARCHE COUNCIL

Mr E N N NGCOBO: Speaker, hon Deputy President, hon Minister of Science and
Technology, hon Ministers and Deputy Ministers present here, hon members
and the guests of Parliament present today, CEO of the HSRC, director-
general and your delegation – if at all they are here – please allow me, on
behalf of my Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology, to present to
this honourable House a reconstituted shortlist of candidates for the board
of HSRC that will govern this important research institution. This
institution forms part of the Department of Science and Technology family
of entities.

The list of candidates who are being presented before this honourable House
today is a culmination of a painstaking exercise by the Portfolio Committee
on Science and Technology over a period of about a year to date. With this
exercise we sought to update section 2 of the Human Sciences Research
Council Act of 1968, Act No 23 of 1968, through the repealing of section 8
of the Human Sciences Research Council Act of 2008, Act No 17 of 2008.

The objective of this latter amendment has been to promote human sciences
research of the highest quality in South Africa in order to improve the
understanding of social conditions and the process of social change
connected with the political transformation processes that have been
happening in our country since the advent of democracy, as led by the ANC,
in 1994.

The HSRC board will, in accordance with this amending Bill, consist of a
chairperson designated by the Minister and no less than six but no more
than nine members plus the CEO, who is a member by virtue of his or her
office.

The Minister, after appointing a panel of experts to compile a shortlist of
no more than 20 persons from the nominees, will then refer the shortlist to
the portfolio committee for concurrence, in accordance with the provisions
of this Act.

Indeed, the portfolio committee recommended that the list of candidates be
revisited in order to reflect the few recommendations advanced by the
portfolio committee on that day of the presentation.
The Department of Science and Technology indeed addressed those concerns
and submitted a revised list to the portfolio committee. The portfolio
committee then concurred with the revised list.

As an institution of research, the HSRC is tasked with a variety of
responsibilities to promote research in the field of human sciences in
order to improve the quality of life of all our people. These range from
research analyses of housing delivery problems to children-led households
resulting from the HIV and Aids pandemic challenges, poverty and
unemployment challenges, analyses of economic and social gains arising from
the 2010 Fifa soccer games, political and economic stability challenges for
our African region, etc. There’s a long list of what the HSRC does.

It is indeed an important research institution when it comes to research on
the sociopolitical or economic challenges facing our nation and the world.
It is therefore imperative that we establish a board of capable men and
women that would be up to the challenge. We think that the shortlist
presented to you today consists of people who are up to that challenge.

It is, therefore, my pleasure to appeal that this House ratify the
shortlist of candidates for the board, as presented in the ATC of 9 July
2009, page 48, as it is only when we work together that we can do more. I
thank you and especially my fellow portfolio committee members, who have
worked so hard over the said period to conclude this task. Thank you very
much. [Applause.]

There was no debate.

Declarations of vote:

Ms S V KALYAN (DA): Speaker, the chairperson of the portfolio committee has
outlined the role of the HSRC board, but the DA would like to use this
opportunity to raise a few matters of concern.

First of all, the contracts of members serving on the board expired on
October 2008 and owing to parliamentary delays, the matter was only
referred to the Speaker for consideration on 15 April 2009, by which time
the third Parliament had already risen.

Was it a case of passing the buck or a case of the failure of Parliament to
do its oversight work efficiently? The x-criterion for representivity was
initially not applied, and the department noted these concerns and came
back with a more representative list.

Some of the qualifications of the shortlisted candidates do not comply in
the strictest sense with the requirements as stipulated in the Act.
Questions for the Minister to consider when making her final choice are:
What value do persons who serve on a wide range of boards add? Does such a
board member have time to do justice to the task at hand or might not a
possible conflict of interest arise?

The DA also asks the Minister to consider it very carefully when appointing
members who have served on other boards and whose performance has been
questionable. Last, but not least, the Minister should guard against
political appointments.

The portfolio committee has made specific recommendations both to
Parliament in respect of its oversight, and to the Minister to review
legislation regarding the processes leading to the appointment of members
of the board. We sincerely hope that this matter will be properly
addressed, and urgently.

In conclusion, the DA wants to place on record its appreciation to the
current board for agreeing to stay on despite the end of its term, and
wishes the new board well in its deliberations. [Applause.]

Mr P F SMITH (IFP): Speaker, colleagues, just from the IFP’s perspective, I
would like to say that in the end, all the parties agreed to the names
proposed. However, I must say that the processes leading up to that was
less than ideal.

We were presented with a list of names through the internal processes of
the department and the committee, which were frankly ridiculous. The
Minister is entitled to make the choice herself. The function of the
process before then is to provide her with a short list of sufficient names
for her to be able to exercise her mind. And what, in fact, we received was
something that would have almost compelled her to take all the names on the
list, bar one or two, and that is completely unacceptable.

The list was not balanced in respect of the legal requirements of what had
to be included in the list. It was not racially balanced; it didn’t
adequately deal with skilled incumbents who might have been kept on to do
another term.

So we are happy with the outcome, but I do think that in future we should
reflect upon the processes that go astray. So we wish the Minister well in
choosing from the list that she has.

I do think that she could have had a few more options, but what she has is
a good, sound basis. Thank you.

The SPEAKER: I shall now put the question.

Question put: That the following shortlist of candidates be approved for
consideration for appointment to the Board of the Human Sciences Research
Council: Ms P N Gasa, Prof R Hassan, Prof M T Leshabari, Dr P Gobodo-
Madikizela, Mr T P Masobe, Dr F G Netswera, Ms P Ntombela-Nzimande, Prof T
Pillay, Prof L Qalinge, Mr A Samassekou, Prof A Sawyerr, Dr S Zinn, Prof P
Zulu, Prof A Lourens, Dr B O Tema, Prof P Naidoo and Prof E C Webster.
Question agreed to.

Shortlist of candidates accordingly approved.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND
   ADMINISTRATION - RECOMMENDATION OF CANDIDATES FOR APPOINTMENT TO PUBLIC
                             SERVICE COMMISSION

Ms J C MOLOI – MOROPA: Speaker, Deputy President and hon members, the
Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration would like to
present the report on the nomination of the National Public Service
Commissioners.

Just as a reminder, hon members, we must put before us here that the Public
Service Commission is an independent and impartial institution, established
in terms of the Constitution of 1996, with its powers and function to
investigate, monitor and evaluate the organisation, administration and
personnel practices of the Public Service, amongst others. Its mandate
entails the evaluation of achievement and lack of achievement in these
programmes in government.

In terms of section 196(7) of Chapter 10: Public Administration in the
Constitution, it is clearly stated that –

  (7) The commission has the following 14 commissioners appointed by the
       President:


          a) Five commissioners approved by the National Assembly in
             accordance with subsection 8(a); and


          b) one commissioner for each province ... in accordance with
             subsection 8(b).


In other words, we have nine commissioners from the provinces and five
national commissioners. In all, we have a total of 14 commissioners. A
commissioner is appointed for a term of five years, which is renewable for
one additional term only. So, in other words, they cannot go on to a third
term in terms of the Constitution.

This year, in June, the term of office of two Public Service commissioners
came to an end after being renewed. One of them was the serving chairperson
of the commission, who will be familiar to most members, namely Prof S
Sangweni.

The vacancies meant that the Public Service Commission remained with only
three out of five commissioners. The Portfolio Committee on Public Service
and Administration was tasked on behalf of Parliament to advertise,
shortlist, interview and nominate the preferred commissioners. The
portfolio committee then reports the outcomes to Parliament for adoption,
with a view to recommend the candidates to the President for appointment.

Speaker, it is along these lines that a subcommittee was appointed by the
portfolio committee to act as a panel in order to shortlist, interview and
recommend to the National Assembly the successful candidates. The panel
consisted of the following members: Hon J C Moloi-Moropa (ANC), hon E
Sulliman (ANC), hon E Rasool (ANC), hon N E Gcwabaza (ANC), hon A M Dreyer
(DA) and hon L Adams (Cope).

Consensus was reached on the 14 candidates who were shortlisted for
interviews. All candidates were highly qualified and experienced in various
ways. I must indicate to the House that the subcommittee was such a
dedicated team, united around one goal: to get the best out of those who
were interviewed. The subcommittee gave consideration to candidates’
experience, qualifications, gender, age, knowledge of the Public Service
and the Public Service Commission.

After consideration of the subcommittee’s report, the portfolio committee
recommends the following candidates for nomination as national Public
Service commissioners: Ms M J J Matsomela and Mr B Mthembu.

In the event that these candidates are not available to serve on the
national Public Service Commission, the committee recommends that the
following candidates be considered for appointment in the order in which
they appear below, the third person being Adv R K Sizani and the fourth Mr
G Aboobaker.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the panel, which was a
subcommittee constituted by the committee, on the good work done in putting
the interests of the country first, in order to achieve the best selection
from amongst the nominated candidates. It will always be my wish to work
with such a dedicated team, and I congratulate them on the good work done.
Thank you. [Applause.]

There was no debate.

Question put: That the House approve the nominations of Ms M J J Matsomela
and Mr B Mthembu for appointment to the Public Service Commission and of
Adv R K Sizani and Mr G Aboobaker as supplementary nominations.

                        AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY

                            (Member’s Statement)
Ms N M TWALA (ANC): Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The ANC-led government is
continually implementing land reform and agricultural development
programmes, which include a comprehensive support package for farmers,
especially women farmers and rural entrepreneurs.

The Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Land Administration
has committed itself to introducing programmes that are aimed at animal
production and forestry. The Vula Mathuba Programme, as it is known, is
already supporting 76 students who are studying scarce skills at tertiary
institutions. Amongst those skills are the following: veterinary science,
crop production and agricultural economy.

Together with our people, the ANC tirelessly works to ensure that the
agricultural policies we implement have a positive impact on households,
food security, food prices and environmental sustainability. Thank you.

                    NATIONAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SCHEME

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr W G JAMES (DA): Deputy Speaker, the ministerial committee that is to
review the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, chaired by Dr Marcus
Balintulo, is obliged to report to the Minister of Higher Education and
Training within six months after the commencement of their work, which is
likely only in December 2009, as its date of appointment was on 08 June
2009.

One of the tasks of this committee is to undertake a review of the Means
Test and to provide guidelines to determine the criteria for eligible
students. Many parents - some of whom have contacted me directly - already
pressed, as we all are, by the current recessionary climate, are unable to
access National Student Financial Aid Scheme funds and are ineligible for
student bank loans.

If he, therefore, has not done so yet, and I am sorry he is not present,
the Minister of Higher Education and Training must provisionally adjust the
criteria and set aside adequate funds as a temporary measure to meet the
needs of students who have been admitted to universities but whose parents,
regardless of their race, simply cannot afford the money. Thank you.

                      STATE OF HOSPITALS IN FREE STATE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D A KGANARE (COPE): Madam Speaker, I rise to express my shock at the
level of health service at Free State hospitals. These hospitals are
generally understaffed and consequently overcrowded. At the national
hospital there is usually only one doctor on duty at night. It is normal
for patients to wait for up to eight hours in an emergency waiting area
without being attended to by a doctor.

Patients sometimes sleep on the floor for up to six days before they are
provided with a bed. The medical staff at this hospital are helpless, with
a high number of patients to deal with. Nurses and matrons tell stories of
people dying in their chairs.

The issue of understaffing is also a normal thing at Pelonomi Hospital. The
shortage of pharmacists demands that they be pulled from other regions,
once a week, to help with sorting, packaging and sending medication to the
different regions. When this happens, regions are left without pharmacists
to attend to patients.

It is only an extraordinary person, with a social conscience, who will be
able to feel and experience the pain, agony and trauma experienced by our
people as they sit there for hours on end waiting for a nurse or doctor to
ease their pain.

Those who only visit these areas accompanied by bodyguards with much
ceremony and sirens blazing will forever live in their world of self-
delusion, premised ... [Time expired.]

              BRANCH COURTS COMMENCE WITH OFFERING FULL SERVICE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M GUNGUBELE (ANC): Hon Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, hon members,
last Tuesday, 11 August 2009, the branch courts started to offer full
services to communities in townships and rural areas that had no access to
justice services offered by the main courts.

Fifteen branch courts across the country are now enjoying the status of
being full service courts with improved access to the justice system
following the extension of their services. The extension of services to the
current branch courts will bring great relief to affected communities, and
enhance their access to justice consistent with the provisions of our
Constitution. The launch of these courts has taken us forward in terms of
promoting justice, in particular to the historically disadvantaged
communities, even though they provide limited services to these
communities.

Due to these efforts, people don’t have to travel long distances in order
to access services such as child maintenance, protection orders, deceased
estates, adoption orders or legal remedies to any civil disputes.

This is consistent with government’s effort to prioritise service delivery
by bringing facilities and services to areas where people reside and
establish a new, modernised, efficient and transformed criminal justice
system so as to develop the capacity for fighting and reducing crime in
real terms. Thank you.

            BRUTAL MURDER OF PREGNANT WOMAN DURING WOMEN’S MONTH

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs C N Z ZIKALALA (IFP): Deputy Speaker, Nompumelelo Ndlovu, who was
believed to be seven months pregnant, was beaten to death in broad daylight
on one of the busiest streets in Pietermaritzburg’s central business
district. It is alleged that Ms Ndlovu was attacked without provocation and
hit repeatedly with an iron bar.

The IFP offers its condolences to the family and friends of Ms Ndlovu, and
all the other women of South Africa who are senselessly murdered. We might
have celebrated Women’s Day recently and we continue to honour women during
the month of August, but the abuse of women continues unabated.

While mainstreaming gender issues, passing the right legislation and
highlighting the plight of women, these efforts are, however, not enough
and will be undermined if we do not create a culture of respect for women.
Young boys must learn from an early age that girls and women must be
respected. This should be ingrained in our culture. For this to happen,
South African men must play a more active role.
I, therefore, appeal to South African men, starting with all of you sitting
in this House today, to be the role models that our youth need, and become
active role-players in the promotion of women’s rights ... [Time expired.]

               SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS OF WOMEN

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms P TSHWETE (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the ANC-led government continues to
raise awareness about the sexual and reproductive health rights of women,
and to strengthen the enforcement of these rights by ensuring that they are
incorporated in the broader health programmes.

The ANC-led provincial government of KwaZulu-Natal has launched a campaign
called the Phila Ma Project. This initiative is aimed at raising awareness
and educating women about cervical cancer.

The Department of Health chose to launch the campaign officially in the
Amaoti community hall. This area is one of the poorest areas in KwaZulu-
Natal and the high poverty rate shortens the lifespan of women. During the
day, the women of Amaoti and the surrounding communities were given free
cervical cancer screening. These services are to be rolled out throughout
August as part of the Women’s Month programme.
The ANC will accelerate the campaign of health promotion and disease
prevention by changing values and norms through community action.
Furthermore, communities will be encouraged to adopt healthy diets and
exercise, and take part in the campaign against drug and substance abuse.
Thank you. [Applause.]

  CONFUSION CAUSED BY RENAMING AND REORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr P J C PRETORIUS (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, thus far, the reorganisation
and renaming of government departments has not been a smooth process. Some
confusion still exists, most notably in the portfolios of agriculture,
forestry, fisheries, and water and environmental affairs.

The name of the department or portfolio named “Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries” clearly indicates that fisheries is a substantive component of
that portfolio. There can be no other interpretation.

The reality, though, is that only a tiny part of fisheries, namely
aquaculture – that is fish farming – falls under the portfolio. Aquaculture
production represents a mere 0,4% of all fish production. This means that
99,6% of fishery-related matters, including marine and coastal management,
permits, quotas, resource management, etc, therefore fall outside the brief
of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

The department responsible for this 99,6% of fisheries affairs is indeed
the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs. Nothing in the name or
portfolio of that department suggests that fisheries are part of it. This
is a confusing and unsatisfactory situation which should be corrected.

We call on the President and his advisers to take a fresh look at the names
of these two departments and, or, to reorganise them. Thank you.

   CRIPPLING EFFECT OF STRIKES AND UNREASONABLE DEMAND FOR HIGHER WAGES ON
                                   ECONOMY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr C P MULDER (VF Plus): Adjunkspeaker, die veelvoudige stakings in
verskeie sektore van die ekonomie is nie net besig om voor 2010 die
internasionale beeld van Suid-Afrika as ’n stabiele demokrasie geweldige
skade te berokken nie, maar is ook besig om die ekonomie te kniehalter.

Vakbonde, in veral die staatsdiens, het die leiding geneem met die eise om
onrealistiese salarisverhogings en aanpassings. Munisipale amptenare se
verhoging van 13,5% is en bly onrealisties, en dis die gewone man in die
straat wat daardie rekening sal moet betaal.

In die huidige internasionale ekonomiese klimaat het die vakbonde en
werkers eerder op eie gewin gekonsentreer as om aan die breër samelewing te
dink.

Verhogings en salarisse hoër as die inflasiesyfer het ’n kettingreaksie-
effek op voedselpryse en die ekonomie in die geheel, en van president Zuma
se beroep op werkers om vreedsame onderhandeling oor salarisverhogings het
niks gekom nie.

In dieselfde periode waar werkers gestaak, optogte gehou en medewerkers
geïntimideer het, het miljoene ander Suid-Afrikaners hul werk verloor.

Die werkloosheidsyfer staan tans op meer as 23%, terwyl nog afdankings
duisende werkers in die myne en verwante bedrywe in die gesig staar.

President Zuma het in sy openingsrede gesê dat die regering in die komende
jaar ten minste 500 000 nuwe poste sal skep. Die regering kan nie hierdie
beloftes nakom as hy nie daarin kan slaag om vakbonde en werkers sover te
kry om vreedsaam oor salarisse en realistiese salarisverhogings te
onderhandel nie.

Die ANC-regering moet daarom sy vennote soos Cosatu in die bek ruk om Suid-
Afrika se groter ekonomie te beskerm, eerder as om aan daardie politieke
druk toe te gee. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement
follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER (FF Plus): Deputy Speaker, the many strikes in various
sectors of the economy are not only causing immense damage to the
international image of South Africa as a stable democracy prior to 2010,
but they are also hampering the economy.
Labour unions, especially in the Public Service, have taken the lead in
demanding unrealistic salary increases and adjustments. The increase of
13,5% for municipal officials is and remains unrealistic, and it is the
ordinary man in the street who will have to foot the bill.

In the current international economic climate the unions and workers have
focused on self-gain rather than the broader community.

Above-inflation-rate increases in salaries had a chain reaction effect on
food prices and the economy in general, and nothing came of President
Zuma’s call on workers for peaceful negotiations with regard to salary
increases.

In the same period, when workers went on strike, held marches and
intimidated fellow workers, millions of other South Africans lost their
jobs.
The unemployment rate is currently determined at more than 23%, with
thousands of workers in mining and related industries facing the
possibility of losing their jobs.

President Zuma said in his state of the nation address that the government
will create at least 500 000 new jobs in the coming year. The Government
will not be able to keep this promise if it fails to bring unions and
workers round to negotiate peacefully about salaries and realistic salary
increases.

The ANC government must therefore pull its partners like Cosatu up short in
order to protect the South African economy, instead of succumbing to
political pressure. Thank you.]

[Mr L SUKA (ANC): The people’s party, the ANC, believes that it is
everyone’s right to be provided with a house; living with dignity and in
peace and harmony is the right of every South African citizen.

The metropolitan municipality of the city of Port Elizabeth, known as
Nelson Mandela Bay, which is led by the ANC, has embarked on a campaign of
ensuring the construction of quality houses, especially for the citizens of
this country.

The construction of these houses will focus more on people who are living
in informal settlements and places that are prone to flooding during heavy
rains. The ANC-led government will continue developing residential areas
that are close to the places of employment or workplaces, educational
institutions and healthcare facilities. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.
[Applause.]]

  IMPLICATIONS OF MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION’S DECISION TO REDESIGN MATRIC
                                 CERTIFICATE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr J C KLOPPERS-LOURENS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the decision by the Minister
of Basic Education, Ms Angie Motshekga, to scrap hundreds of thousands of
specially watermarked papers for matric certificates so that redesigned
ones with a larger and more prominent South African coat of arms could be
printed instead, shows that she is driven by arrogance and superficiality,
and that she has her priorities in completely the wrong order.

The DA fully supports the inclusion of the coat of arms on the matric
certificate. It is an important mark of national pride. However, the coat
of arms is already prominent on the certificate. If its size and position
needed to be changed, the change could have waited until next year, when no
additional expenses would have been incurred.

For security reasons, the certificates are printed on watermarked paper
which is produced overseas. If the cost of the paper for each of these
certificates were R10, the cost of the scrapping exercise would be a
staggering R6 million. It may well have been more, depending on the cost of
the certificates.

If we add to this the inconvenience and cost to universities, who now have
to pay the department for statements confirming the results, as well as the
strain being placed on learners, then it is impossible to justify this act.
It appears that the Minister is focusing on everything except improving the
dismal quality of education received by most South African children.

                        DISMISSAL OF MUNICIPAL MAYORS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr P B MNGUNI (Cope): Deputy Speaker, this country is governed by the
Constitution, which makes provision for three interrelated, independent
spheres of government.

Unfortunately, there was the intervention of Luthuli House in the past
three months whereby the mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality
was summarily dismissed without due process being followed.

It seems that the government does not understand the limits of its power
neither does it have respect for the Constitution. Cope therefore urges the
relevant Minister to ensure that corrupt, nonperforming or underperforming
municipality mayors be dismissed or removed in terms of due process.

They should not be dismissed with unnecessary wastage of public funds or
legal challenges to provincial and national interventions. I thank you.

                       SCHOOL MATHEMATICS COMPETITION

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms B T NGCOBO (ANC): Somlomo ... [Deputy Speaker] ... Advances in science
and technology depend on a solid foundation at school level. Without a
thorough foundation in mathematics, careers in science, engineering and
technology will be closed to young learners, the majority of whom are from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

The ANC congratulates the City of eThekwini on hosting the 10th
Invitational World Youth Mathematics Intercity Competition from 5 July 2009
to 10 July 2009 at the Durban City Hall, in collaboration with the
Association for Mathematics Education of South Africa.

Over 300 junior high school students representing 19 countries from all
over the world converged in Durban to participate in the competition. This
presents an opportunity for young people not only to participate in a
friendly way, but also to share experiences, cement international
friendships and foster mutual understanding.

South Africa was represented by 141 schools from the eThekwini
Municipality, with eight of those schools falling under the Department of
Education’s Dinaledi schools programme. Thank you. [Applause.]

                      STATE OF LAND BANK INVESTIGATIONS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr R N CEBEKHULU (IFP): Deputy Speaker, the troubles at the Land Bank have
been covered extensively in the media, and the work that this important
institution is mandated to do effectively has been crippled by the corrupt
behaviour of some of its officials.

We note the hon Minister of Finance’s comments earlier this week that the
Land Bank is on its way to recovery. This is a positive sign and also the
first step towards the Land Bank operating efficiently and fulfilling its
mandate. However, we must not forget that the dishonesty of officials and
other people caused the Land Bank to be in this miserable state.

While we do understand that investigations are ongoing, there must be
transparency in this process, and the people who were involved in corrupt
dealings, both Land Bank officials and the beneficiaries of illegal loans,
must be exposed and brought to book.

South African taxpayers need to know that their interests are being looked
after and that corruption is not tolerated. They need to know the names of
the people who abused their money and what action is being taken against
them. I appeal to the Minister to provide this House with a detailed update
on the investigations and to furnish us with a list of names of those who
have been implicated in corruption at the bank, as well as what action is
being taken against them. The IFP also hopes that every effort is being
made to recover the funds that were disbursed illegally. I thank you.

       WORLD’S LARGEST SINGLE OPTICAL TELESCOPE AND SA LARGE TELESCOPE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms S V KALYAN (DA): Speaker, Spain recently opened the world’s largest
single optical telescope. Called the “Gran Telescopio Canarias”, it is a
10,4-metre-long mirror composed of 36 hexagonal segments. It is the latest
edition to the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory perched about 2 400
metres above La Palma, one of the Spanish Canary Islands. Congratulations
to Spain!

If we, in South Africa, succeed in attracting the Square Kilometre Array,
we will join the ranks of those who host some of the world’s largest
telescopes - an exclusive club indeed.

Unlike that of Spain, ours will be a radio telescope, the only one of its
kind in the Southern Hemisphere. We would then be able to join path-
breaking research on the nature of the universe, such as the recent
findings that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in the universe may be
more compact than was once thought - prompting a re-evaluation of some of
the assumptions relating to the evolution of galaxies.

                      STATE OF HOSPITALS IN FREE STATE
            BRUTAL MURDER OF PREGNANT WOMAN DURING WOMEN’S MONTH
                      STATE OF LAND BANK INVESTIGATIONS

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION: Deputy
Speaker, may we express appreciation for the statements made.

I would like to respond to the hon Kganare, although he has taken flight.
The last sirens that visited hospitals were when the hon Kganare was an MEC
in the Free State province. He raises quite an important issue. The sirens
have stopped since then, Mbhazima. This is quite an important issue. If we
want to see an improvement of services, this should not be a governing
party issue. All of us as public representatives are equally responsible
for oversight in those areas that are under our care.

I think we will find out many things in engaging with hospitals. One issue
is that the country is not producing sufficient pharmacists. So the public
sector battles to attract pharmacists, and even more so now because large
chain stores have pharmacies. As a result, the public sector battles. Where
we are able to attract these pharmacists, it is primarily in Gauteng and
the Western Cape. In fact, the cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town attract
pharmacists, so other provinces are battling.

This is not for a lack of attention to detail. The country isn’t producing
sufficient people with Mathematics and Science who choose pharmacology as a
profession. This is a big issue, but it is not a party political issue.

The hon Zikalala raised the issue of attacks on women. I’m prepared to take
up the challenge with other men and say that we must be role models. It’s
not a women’s struggle, it’s a people’s struggle. I think we need to be
active in our communities, and people must see what these issues are about.
[Applause.]

I am sorry I didn’t get the hon member’s name, Deputy Speaker. I think the
sentiments are correct at one level about corrupt officials or corrupt
beneficiaries not being tolerated. But I think we aren’t being fair on the
new chief executive of the Land Bank to ask him to name these people. I
think he has acted as we have required of him. The first thing he had to do
was to ensure that there were forensic reports by professionals and that
those were handed over to investigating authorities in the police. He has
done so. When people are charged, their names will be a matter of public
record. You shouldn’t ask him to act as though he is a prosecutor and a
judge in this matter.

The other mandate we gave him was to stabilise the institution, and he has
done that with aplomb. Now that this has been attained, I think the Land
Bank is in a better position to deal with newly settled farmers and to
ensure that it can fulfil its developmental mandate. But it hasn’t been
possible to do so in an environment where the Land Bank’s books were in a
state. I’m sure we can look forward to a far more developmental role for
the Land Bank, sound in administration and an institution that doesn’t
tolerate corruption. Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker.

                      STATE OF HOSPITALS IN FREE STATE

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Ms T V Tobias): Deputy Speaker,
I have partly been covered by the Minister in the Presidency. For those who
don’t know Pelonomi Hospital, it is a provincial hospital in the Free State
which services all the regions in the province. It is one of the best
trauma hospitals in the country. Therefore, you will understand why
everybody will go to Pelonomi Hospital.

If there is a terrible accident that has taken place in the country and one
can’t be treated, one is then taken to Pelonomi Hospital. It is the best
hospital for midwifery in the country. We have the best experienced
midwives in the country, hence everybody wants to have their babies at
Pelonomi Hospital.

As part of my constituency work, I spoke with the MEC of Health, Ms Sisi
Mabe, who assured me that medicine has been supplied not only to Pelonomi
Hospital, but also to all hospitals in the Free State, including clinics.
So, it is very important for Mr Kganare to update his information because I
am talking about work I’ve done in the last week when I was doing my
constituency work in the Motheo region.

Lastly, pharmacists have been employed at Pelonomi Hospital, hence it
shares its resources with a private hospital that has been established
right in the hospital. So, an impression should not be created that
government is not doing its work because we want cheap political point-
scoring. Only facts must be stated because some of us come from this
province. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
                    NATIONAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SCHEME

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION: Deputy Speaker, there is a question, which
I will indeed refer to my colleague, around the reconsideration of the
National Student Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS, and considering learners who
are already in the system to make sure that they are not prejudiced because
of their colour, and that they are also assisted during the current
economic environment.

The one issue I want to respond to, which I really think is a very
unfortunate misinterpretation and a misleading of the House, is on the
issue of certificates. The truth of the matter is that the current
certificates were incorrectly done. I think everybody’s philosophy is that
if something is wrong, you correct it. You correct it now; you don’t
postpone the correction.

The certificates, as the member correctly alluded to, came out wrongly.
Umalusi accepted that they had not done the certificates according to
specifications. We agreed with Umalusi that matric certificates are papers
of pride for our children. They must get them right for them forever. I
think it is correct for our children to wait for the correct certificates
until the end of August - this very August – when they will get their
certificates. The delay was because of the paper which is imported. But I
think we all agree that if something is wrong, we correct it; we correct it
the first time around.

Umalusi requested that we give back this year’s batch of wrong certificates
and that they will correct them next year. I said they should correct them
now for all our children. I am not sure what is wrong with correcting what
is wrong at the time when it is wrong and giving our children the correct
certificates, which they will have forever. I think I was quite correct,
and I stand by that.

I think it is again unfortunate that a member would really assume that one
has the lowest level of vanity such that they delay certificates for some
personal glory. I think it is unfortunate and very sad for a member to
reduce one’s sense of self to that. This was a personal attack. I think it
is unfortunate because this was not for me but for the benefit of the kids.
[Interjections.]

Stop howling at me, because I kept quiet when you were talking. [Applause.]

                    NATIONAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SCHEME

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. In
response to Mr Pretorius’ input on the reconfiguration of the national
departments and the allocation of responsibilities, I would like to say
that this is a matter government is working on. I do recall that the
Minister in the Presidency had made a public statement indicating the
timelines that government had given to itself in order to resolve all the
issues of mandates and allocation, both of structures of government as well
as areas of responsibility.

We are fully alert to the issues that you have raised, and we are working
very hard to ensure that they are resolved as speedily as possible, in the
interests of service delivery. It is an ongoing programme that government
is engaged in, but we are very alert to the challenges and difficulties.

I welcome the statements by hon Ngcobo with respect to the Maths Olympiad.
I am happy to know that there are many maths competitions and activities
that are supporting the endeavour of the Education department as well as
that of Science and Technology, to ensure that we have many more young
people who are competent in these important areas.

We do congratulate eThekwini for the work that they are doing to support
this particular aspect of our developmental goals.

With respect to the hon Ms Kalyan and the Square Kilometre Array Radio
Telescope programme, I am pleased to report that we are making progress.
The first dish is up. We will be unveiling it towards the end of this
month. Good collaboration between scientists across the world and South
African scientists has led to the very positive progress, which is an
important bid by South Africa.

The six initial bidders have been reduced to two. The remaining are South
Africa and Australia. And, if the Tri-Nations is the record to go with, we
know where the bid will go. We are working hard to ensure that South Africa
does well.

I will convey the views of the member of the DA concerning the National
Student Financial Aid Scheme. I would suggest that members should also make
submissions to the committee appointed by Minister Nzimande, so that the
very good suggestions that are being made are taken account of by the
review committee. Thank you.

                        DISMISSAL OF MUNICIPAL MAYORS

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS: Thank you,
Deputy Speaker. I want to clarify to the hon Paul Mnguni of COPE about what
he said concerning the Mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality,
Mr Gwabeni. He said that Mr Gwabeni’s party has taken a decision about him
– it has the right to do so, and I think we all know that.

In January this year, there was a strike that lasted for three months in
that district. I went there to intervene. I negotiated with the unions to
resolve the strike. After the negotiations, the provincial government
appointed an acting municipal manager because the municipal manager was
dismissed. There was no leader, the sheep had no shepherd, but the Mayor
didn’t welcome that intervention.

After three months of the acting manager’s stay in office – without being
welcomed – he uncovered a lot of misdemeanours, wrongdoing,
maladministration, corruption and nepotism.

On 1 July 2009, the provincial government acted in terms of section 139 of
the Constitution, by taking away the administrative and financial powers of
the municipality. Mr Gwabeni, without following any due process - Chapter 3
of the Constitution, to be precise, which requires that a person must
engage with another sphere of government where there is a dispute - went to
court. He didn’t follow the clause. That means he was in violation of the
Constitution. Despite that, he continued to engage in this process, which
was problematic in a way. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, your time is up. I only allowed you a few
extra minutes to continue because I was also interested in the conclusion
of this story. Maybe you can conclude it outside for the hon member of
COPE. [Laughter.]

  THE STATE OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES
                         ARISING THEREFROM URGENTLY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr S L TSENOLI: Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, Ministers, Deputy
Ministers, members, this topic is inspired or prompted by the fact that
last year, 2008, constituted the 10th anniversary of the White Paper on
Local Government. We couldn’t engage in that evaluation at that time
because we went into an election period.  Now that we are back, it is
important to reflect on this issue.

But the other important reason, naturally, is that we have just come from a
decisive conference and an election that gave us an important mandate to do
things differently this time and, in fact, act to improve the quality of
service to the people in the country as a whole. This reflection,
therefore, is an important one for us in Parliament, so what we are calling
for is that this matter be seen to be particularly urgent.

It is made urgent especially because of the presentation we just had
earlier on by the Minister of Economic Development on the global crisis and
its impact on our society as a whole.
In fact, this represents one of the biggest challenges that municipalities
face - that if a crisis is allowed to reverse the gains we’ve made it will
perpetuate a crisis that the poor have been left with for a long time,
which the ANC-led government and Parliament have taken significant steps to
reverse. It is for that reason that in reflecting on the state of municipal
governance, we identify factors that are crucial to doing that exercise,
including a brief reflection on some of the instruments that we used to do
so.

We also need to persuade the public out there that the message of the ANC
that we need to work together is indeed correct and that the government is
demonstrating this in practice and in action, for example, by firing
corrupt people and taking action against those who do not do their work
properly. This process, which has been led by the President, is the correct
path, and the announcement of the presidential co-ordinating committee that
includes Premiers and mayors is an important vehicle that is going to be
used to achieve this objective.

Also, it is useful to note that last year was also the first time that we
received the annual report on municipal performance, which naturally we
couldn’t deal with in this Parliament because of the elections. When we
looked at that report it was already inadequate in that many municipalities
had not complied - they had not given their annual reports which they were
meant to do according to the law so that the provincial and national
departments can do their reports, and so on.

But also, we came to the conclusion that some of the reports that were
presented were quite frankly works of fiction, they were not based on the
actual performance of the municipalities as reflected by reality, and that
correction was needed there. There were also catch-up reports that reported
on previous years that were already outdated.

Therefore, they couldn’t give us reliable assessments of things and where
they were. This is why it is absolutely necessary that going forward we do
things differently. We must ensure that each municipality undertakes to
provide an accurate and reliable report according to the law so that the
provinces themselves, as well as the national departments, present us with
reports that we can rely on.

Just recently, but also consistent with the previous report of the Auditor-
General - which is another state institution that provides observations and
therefore assessments of municipalities – the report concluded that while
there are skills shortages at national and provincial levels they are
“thinnest”, to quote the word he used, at municipal level.

The challenge, therefore, for doing the work properly there requires urgent
attention in the area of skills and skills development. But it also
requires the political leadership requirements to create an environment
which enables the skills that are there to be kept, to retain them there
and to attract them as well - both of people who work for the
municipalities as administrators, and also of those who make themselves
available to become councillors, and those who make themselves available to
partner with municipalities in their civil society organisations and as
individuals to bring about a different system of work at municipal level.

The other important state mechanism that does this is the Demarcation
Board. When they spoke to the committee, they indicated that many provinces
were not, in fact, using the capacity assessments that they were obliged to
do by government as an instrument in order for provinces to make
interventions in those municipalities. These things were not used, and
therefore, must be used this time around. It is crucial that they are used
as a basis for dealing with these issues.

It is important that the topic speaks about the state of local governance,
meaning that it is not just about what government does, but what it does
with people on the ground. Historically, the democratic movement has worked
with NGOs both in local and in rural local governments to provide support
to the work that was being done to bring about change in the localities,
and so on.
Post 1994 they have played an important role in the reconstruction process.
Some of them have come together to constitute the Good Governance Learning
Network, GGLN.  They have for the first time compiled a report, and we
would like to say from this podium that we appreciated its presence,
because it represents the input of people who work with municipalities from
outside and, therefore, it gives us valuable information that we can use.

We do not necessarily always agree on things, but some of the issues that
they raised are critical, especially public participation which is one of
the most important requirements that municipalities need to be on top of to
perform their work properly.

In other words, the work, for example, the fact that the Department of Co-
operative Governance and Traditional Affairs is undertaking to lead an
enquiry that would lead to a turnaround strategy is crucial, and it must
take on board some of this work that has been done in civil society. This
must happen inside the government itself.

I also want to mention our interaction with the Public Service Commission.
The work that they do is crucial and as the Constitution says, it needs to
be replicated towards municipalities; the useful information that emerges
from the reports that they produce is equally valid for use at municipal
level.

Therefore, the priorities that the new Parliament and government now have
of principally dealing effectively with poverty and inequality in broad
terms, and specifically with issues of health, education, rural development
and combating crime - to mention those four – make up a crucial area in
which municipalities are going to play an important role. And they cannot
do so if institutionally they are not well capacitated and are not in a
position to undertake their job properly.

With regard to the protests that have taken place, the count that we
received from both Salga and others, who are local government watchers, is
35 municipal areas. But this is not taking place throughout these
municipalities. It is in specific wards in those municipalities and in many
of those instances there are understandable explanations. This means that
there are reasons that can be traced that led to those protests, that the
impatience of people often is justified in those areas. But in general, it
is the requirements for our intervention both at parliamentary and
government level that will turn things around at that level.

So, these protests are an indicator, not an exaggeration, of the need for
us to intervene. It is a requirement for the period in which we are in to
reconfigure, not only municipalities but the state as a whole, to become
developmental, that is, decisive and action-oriented to bring about the
kind of programmes that people on the ground require. Thank you.
[Applause.]
Mnr W P DOMAN: Voorsitter, elke ideologie en gepaardgaande beleid word deur
die harde werklikheid van die praktyk getoets. Kommunisme en apartheid het
nogal lank geneem om deur die praktyk ontbloot te word, maar die ideologie
van die nasionale demokratiese revolusie van die ANC, waarvolgens kaders
ontplooi word as burgemeesters en topamptenare, met die gepaardgaande
luukshede en uitspattige vergoeding te midde van totale onbevoegdheid in
baie gevalle, het minder as nege jaar geneem om deur die praktyk ontbloot
te word as ’n stelsel wat nie dienste lewer in munisipaliteite nie. Daarom
het ons nou al hierdie opstande.

In die negentigerjare met die geleidelike transformasie van plaaslike
regering is goeie munisipale diens gelewer, maar sedert 5 Desember 2000, na
die eerste volle demokratiese verkiesing, is die nasionale demokratiese
revolusie voluit toegepas en swak dienslewering het dit nou ten volle
ontbloot as ’n stelsel wat nie kan werk nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Chairperson, every ideology and accompanying policy is
tested by the harsh reality of practice. It took quite some time for
communism and apartheid to be exposed by practice, but the ideology of the
ANC’s national democratic revolution, according to which cadres were
deployed as mayors and top officials, along with the luxuries and
extravagant remuneration in the midst of total incompetence in most cases,
was exposed by its practices in less than nine years as a system that does
not facilitate municipal service delivery. That is why we are having all
these protests.

With the gradual transformation of local government in the 90s, municipal
service delivery was good, but since 5 December 2000, after the first full
democratic election, the national democratic revolution was implemented in
full force and poor service delivery has now exposed it completely as a
system that cannot be successful.]

Therefore, the DA fully agrees with the topic of this discussion. It is a
governance problem, and it is brought about by an ideology that
demonstrated that it cannot deliver and will lead to more protests.
Therefore, we also agree with President Zuma’s pronouncements last week
that the ANC will no longer wait for the laws of the country to kick in,
but will hold its mayors and councillors personally accountable and remove
those who transgress or do not perform.

This view that it is the ANC, as a party, that must take responsibility,
and the very fact that we, at long last, are allowed to have this debate in
Parliament, which the DA has been calling for since last year, bodes well
for a possible turnaround strategy for municipalities. This is because we
have honesty here, and we have openness. This is progress, and the hon
Tsenoli also talked in this vein today, with openness, in addressing the
serious issues that we have.
However, Chairman, we must start by acknowledging that it is a governance
problem, and then we must do something about it. Therefore, the DA calls
for the ANC to stop deployment and to let the local people decide on merit.
Hold individuals responsible and do not allow them to hide behind the
collective or else individuals will never perform, but they will rather
only cement their own positions by appointing buddies and awarding
contracts to well-connected friends. At the moment, at municipalities, it
is more important what your position in the party is than what your
obligations are to the public office you occupy.

This is when governance at municipalities goes all wrong. Let me give you a
few examples: an executive mayor who doesn’t act on the wrongdoing of an
official because the official is high up in the ANC, and right there you
have the collapse of discipline and performance at that municipality. It
can also be the other way around, where mayors and councillors meddle in
the domain of officials and actually force them to do illegal things just
because they believe that they are politically untouchable.

Another example is an MEC who doesn’t act against the nonperformance or
even corruption of an executive mayor or municipality out of fear of
political retaliation. Then ANC politics is more important than what the
laws of the country in terms, in this case, of co-operative governance
demand of the public office of the MEC. Or you have the situation where the
South African Municipal Workers’ Union, Samwu, through their powerful local
bosses at certain municipalities actually run those municipalities, instead
of the duly elected office bearers.

The governance shortcomings are further demonstrated in what is the
priority at many ANC-led municipalities: an expensive mayoral car, overseas
trips, large advertisements in papers, always with a picture of the mayor
and other seniors, and excessive spending on nonsensical community projects
that only benefit a few, instead of aiming to deliver the basic services
that should be the core function of a municipality. So, I want to reiterate
that it is a governance problem that must be sorted out by the governing
party within its own ranks, or else poor service delivery will show up the
shortcomings of this ideology more and more.

Apart from this governance problem, I want to state categorically that a
municipality needs skilled and dedicated officials to deliver services.
Even if councillors are failing dismally, a decent level of services will
be delivered if the municipality has competent and hardworking officials.
It is common knowledge that the implementation of the national democratic
revolution, whereby cadres must occupy all positions, has led to an exodus
of skills and experience from local government.

To get service delivery back on track, as a short-term measure,
interventions at a substantial number of municipalities will be necessary
to allow for the appointment of competent administrators. Some service
delivery achievements have been registered with partnerships with the
private sector, whereby professional and technical experts have been
parachuted into municipalities to assist them. We need much more of this.

Baie munisipaliteite het so ’n slegte naam by professionele mense dat hulle
weier om direk vir ’n munisipaliteit te werk. Hulle verkies eerder om,
byvoorbeeld, deur die Ontwikkelingsbank van Suider-Afrika by ’n
munisipaliteit geplaas te word.

Oor die lang termyn is volhoubare opleidingsprogramme ook nodig om
kundigheid te verbeter, maar dit is baie belangrik dat die hele kultuur wat
tans by munisipaliteite se werkerskorps aanwesig is, omgekeer moet word
sodat dat daar groter toerekenbaarheid, hardwerkendheid, beloning vir
uitnemendheid, en trots op skoon oudits en op hoë standaarde is.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Many municipalities have such a bad reputation with professional people
that they refuse to work directly with a municipality. Instead they prefer,
for instance, to be placed at a municipality via the Development Bank of
Southern Africa.

Sustainable training programmes to improve skills are also needed in the
long term, but it is important that the entire culture that currently
prevails among the worker corps of municipalities be reversed in order to
promote greater accountability, diligence, reward for excellence, and
taking pride in clean audits and high standards.]

You know, it will be one of the most shocking studies if someone were to
list the municipal managers of the 283 municipalities since 2000 and what
happened to each of them. The list of those who were prosecuted for
corruption and maladministration is endless, not to mention those who
simply ran away to avoid prosecution, and there is even a number of them
who just continued with their bad habits in other municipal positions.

In this regard, the DA welcomes Minister Shiceka’s strong stand on corrupt
officials all over the country. We fully grant that South Africa has a
skills shortage, and especially municipalities in the rural areas are
battling to attract professionals and technical people. If the prevailing
culture at many municipalities is not turned around, service delivery will
remain poor. The time is long overdue for municipalities to appoint on
merit and provide for career development on performance, rather than misuse
the substantial power it has in this regard.

The Municipal IQ foundation found that by mid-July this year 24 major
protests had been recorded. This is close to the entire total, namely 27
for 2008 and 31 for 2007, and is likely to exceed the peak of 35 in 2005.

Minister, the DA supported the budget this year because it believes that
under your leadership the budget and its programmes can make a difference
for the better. Then we must address the real issues, of which I’ve only
addressed two today, that are hampering service delivery. At the
municipalities where the DA governs, it applies the ideology of an open-
opportunity society. We appoint on merit, we prioritise service delivery
and, therefore, those municipalities excel. I thank you. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr T BOTHA: Hon Chair, let me thank the ruling party for opening this
debate on this crucial issue of service delivery. Hon Speaker, it is the
state’s responsibility to ensure that citizens of this country receive
quality services. When the executive promises to deliver services to the
citizenry, it first has to ensure that it has both the capacity and the
resources to fulfil that constitutional mandate. The ruling party cannot
justify its failures by blaming them on a third force or, even worse, on
the previous administration, an administration it was part of.

It is public knowledge that approximately 90% of municipal water-treatment
facilities in this country, which treat bulk-water supplies from dams and
rivers, need replacement. The sewerage systems in Gauteng are said to be
operating at 102% over their capacity, a situation that is untenable and a
time bomb that, if not attended to, will collapse ablution in this busy
city region.

In places such as Umtata, although the water and sewerage systems are
within the city, the council has no control over the provision of these
services. The sanitation services are rendered by the district authority of
the O R Tambo District Municipality, while the King Sabata municipality
oversees power and roads. This unwieldy situation was brought about by the
ANC-controlled O R Tambo District, supported by the provincial government
in 2003. [Interjections.] I was not there. [Laughter.] It was not motivated
... Listen to this; listen to this before you talk. It was not motivated by
any desire to ensure efficiency of service delivery, but driven by the
political desire to punish the UDM-controlled municipality.

This situation has, unsurprisingly, therefore resulted in the collapse of
services in the town, with the city bursting at the seams, as there is no
planning that has been put in place for the ever-growing population that
now has more than doubled from 400 000 to over a million people – without
services being upgraded. This conduct of placing party politics above the
interests of citizens is at the heart of the crisis in local government.
This behaviour results in the appointment of incompetent ANC deployees to
run municipalities and the appointment of ANC-connected contractors to
deliver services.
Hon Speaker, while Cope wishes to condemn the violent destruction of
property by the protesters, we are equally convinced that these citizens
have legitimate complaints and demands. They have been let down by
successive ANC governments at local government level. They are equally
shocked that the government’s first reaction has not been to listen but to
condemn and to duck responsibility by blaming the so-called previous
administration.

We are of the view that the ruling party has created unrealistic
expectations which are not matched by deliverables. Let us remind you, hon
members, that it was the ANC conference in Stellenbosch that resolved to
address the challenges of cross-border municipalities. [Interjections.]
This was resisted by its allies, the SACP, who went on to mobilise the
community of Khutsong until this decision was reversed.

Has government learnt anything from this fiasco? It seems not, to me.
Ironically, it is this lack of backbone that gives communities the
impression that if you are unruly, you will get your way and, in fact, you
will be rewarded by doing what you are doing. An example of this shocking
value system is that of Jomo Mogale, a teacher who rendered the schooling
system ungovernable in the same community of Khutsong. Today he is
reinstated and branded a good teacher by the current government.

The government will not solve these problems by continuing to transfer
functions to municipalities without the commensurate budget. The revenue
bases of the municipalities are shrinking and their populations are
growing. This situation, coupled with nonpayment for services, has reached
crisis proportions and requires long-term solutions.

Cope calls for a national indaba in which all sectors of civil society come
together to deliberate on the solutions to this crisis so that government
can stop using stopgap measures to solve what is an endemic problem.

We therefore believe that three critical things must be addressed. There
must be an audit of municipal management which must take place throughout
the country. The multimillion-rand projects that have been awarded to
incompetent companies owned by civil servants need to be reviewed and
stopped in order for the resources to be directed or redirected to service
delivery. Government must put in place an early warning system to avoid the
unnecessary takeovers of functions belonging to local authorities as a
crisis management solution, because these takeovers do not solve the
problem. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): Thank you, hon member. I’m glad
that when you referred to me as “Speaker”,but my parliamentary boss was not
here otherwise you would have gotten me into trouble. [Laughter.]

Mr P F SMITH: Thank you, Chairperson. Colleagues, I think that if we were
to be honest with each other in this House today, we would have to admit
that the state of our municipalities is not what was expected a decade ago
and that the hopes and expectations of millions of people have, in fact,
been dashed.

It is also true, of course, that the state of local government in the
country is uneven and the most serious situation pertains to the poor and
largely rural municipalities, many of which are in a critical state and
are, in fact, sometimes barely functional.

Now, the starting point in looking at this very poor state of affairs is
the Constitution, or rather, the manner in which the provisions of the
Constitution have been inadequately implemented. I just want to highlight
two pertinent issues here. There are many which the other speakers have
referred to.

Firstly, the drafters of the Constitution placed an injunction on the
national government, which is given the power to raise national taxes, to
share the income so raised between the three spheres, including the
respective municipalities, and I quote:

  ... to ensure that they are able to provide services and perform the
  functions assigned to them.

Now, unfortunately, notwithstanding the significant increases in
disbursements from the national government – and I acknowledge that local
government financing has never been adequate - there is absolutely no way
that the financing of poor rural municipalities, even at today’s levels,
has ever been sufficient to address historic backlogs or current needs or,
in fact, even to fulfil the developmental role they have been given.

Secondly, the drafters of the Constitution placed another injunction on
government, both national and provincial, to support municipalities. Now,
it was understood by all that the enormous delivery tasks facing
municipalities required that everybody work together and that
municipalities would need lots of support to make this happen. But instead
of doing this, too many municipalities were thrown to the wolves and left,
effectively, to their own devices to fend for themselves as best they
could.

In desperation we had Project Consolidate, which was meant to have been a
short-term measure, but has now become quasi-permanent. But at least it
showed us what support means and what can be achieved. In our opinion, a
lot more could have been done in the past in respect of years gone by,
which would have made all the difference and this debate today would have
been of a different tenor.

So where do we go from here? Well, I want to make just two points perhaps
as a starting point. Firstly, we have a Constitution: Why don’t we just
implement it for a change? Secondly, if we really want to know what has
gone wrong, I think we need to start by looking at the top rather than at
the bottom. What’s going wrong at the bottom is a consequence of what’s
gone wrong at the top.

Unfortunately, I feel that government’s response to the problems has been
inappropriate. The single Public Service story is just going to nationalise
poor governance, and the notion of more intervention powers – which is now
this constitutional amendment we’ll be looking at – is completely
unnecessary. Government has a whole armoury of intervention weaponry and it
doesn’t need more.

What we really expect is a mantra from the Minister and the Deputy
Minister. Every day they should wake up and say: “More resources, more
support, more resources, more support!” If you do those two things, we will
see a difference. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr J J MCGLUWA: Thank you, Chairperson. This debate on local government and
service delivery is long overdue, and it is an extremely critical and
important issue. Today we can see how serious the ANC takes this debate if
you note all the absent MPs here today. Where are the MPs? They have all
gone.

The ID supports the Minister in his attempts to address the challenges of
poverty and poor service delivery. The role of Salga must be reviewed to
ensure the implementation of national programmes.

Many municipalities are abusing the indigent grant given by national
government to help the poor. In some cases, these grants are being used to
pay salaries.

The performance bonuses paid to municipality managers must be linked to
actual achievements in service delivery and should not be interpreted by
municipal managers as an extra perk for them. We in the ID believe that
payment of performance bonuses for municipal managers must be determined by
the national Minister and not by the local municipality. Currently, the ID
has a performance agreement with its councillors and we would like to
advise that the ANC and all other parties do likewise. Thank you. [Time
expired.]

Ms D G NHLENGETHWA: Chairperson and hon members, the 2009 ANC Election
Manifesto clearly states that we must be proud of our past and be confident
of the future. For 97 years the ANC has led the struggle to bring about a
South Africa that belongs to all people, black and white. We moved on to
embrace the unity of all South Africans, irrespective of race, colour,
culture and religion.

This unity is the source of our strength and inspired many who sacrificed
their lives for us to attain our freedom and helped us to cope with and
tolerate each other in the ANC. The 1994 and 2004 elections were about the
aspirations and the collective desire for a better South Africa and a
journey to bring an end to the legacy of apartheid.

Fifteen years into our democracy, together we have achieved much in
building a new society, uniting all our people in reducing poverty. Much of
the economic and social devastation of apartheid as well as its scars are
still with us. However, in December 2007, the ANC met in Polokwane where
delegates brought messages from South Africans of different cities and
towns and from different rural areas. They brought these problems and we
talked about those that we know: the challenges of unemployment, poverty,
and challenges of poor service delivery.

We heard and shared experiences about many municipalities which are
dysfunctional. During the door-to-door campaigns, we heard what people
said. In our resolutions, as the ANC, we agreed to come up with a
turnaround strategy which would be an intervention to overcome all these
challenges.

With the changing conditions, environment and political consciousness we
will turn around all the so-called instability in municipalities. We have
283 municipalities and 48 district municipalities in this country.
According to our statistics, we had only 24 protests about service
delivery. But now it seems, Mr Doman, as if the whole country is
ungovernable.

Yini ihaba kangaka? [Why are you exaggerating so much?]

We know that some of the communities have valid reasons for why they are
protesting. We know that some communities demand proper consultation and
some are complaining about poor service delivery and public participation
in some structures; and poor financial management and fraud and corruption
in others. In those affected municipalities, the department has managed to
use section 139 as an intervention strategy required by the Constitution.
There is also a team from the national Ministry that is travelling around
the country doing interventions, interviewing communities and holding
meetings with stakeholders. The Sunday Times newspaper dated 16 August 2009
also published the Mpumalanga report on this.

Sihlalo siyati futsi kutsi tonkhe letiphitsiphitsi naletibhelu lesitibonako

UMhlonishwa, babe Zuma ukhulumile ngelilanga lekubekwa kwakhe
njengeMengameli walelive, watsi:

   For as long as there are communities without clean water, decent shelter
   or proper sanitation, we shall not rest, and we dare not falter, in our
   drive to eradicate poverty.

Nantsi-ke sisho njalo. (Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, we also know that some of these protests, riots and conflicts
that we see amongst community members, are caused by the issue of
boundaries, for example, we saw it happening in the Matatiele and Moutse
municipalities.

As a committee, we agreed with the Minister, Mr Sicelo Shiceka, that we
will resume the programme of visiting all these places to find out which
municipalities people want to belong to. We know as the House that these
protests will not end if legal steps are not taken.

Another issue which we have identified as a cause of these protests is the
movement of people from one place to another, which we call migration. More
informal settlements without clean water and proper sanitation are created.
People move to a place where they see an opportunity to benefit. So they
move to these places to search for jobs.

The hon Mr Zuma on the day of his inauguration as President of the country,
said:

   For as long as there are communities without clean water, decent shelter
   or proper sanitation, we shall not rest, and we dare not falter, in our
   drive to eradicate poverty.

We also share the same sentiments.]

Chairperson, part of the turnaround strategy is that municipalities must
have debt recovery plans that will address backlogs over the medium term
and the long term and the capacity to generate revenue. In this regard,
ultimatums of implementation are crucial to be able to achieve the target
date for 2011.

In order to make sure that the disseminated information reaches the
intended beneficiaries, ward councillors must be revived and be supported
with the necessary tools of their trade, such as offices in which to
operate. That is when councillors will be vibrant in calling report-back
meetings and be accountable to the communities they serve.

The latest Markinor public opinion and perception surveys of May 2009 show
that the majority of our people have very low levels of confidence in their
municipalities. This negative perception of the state of local government
is also common across all parties.

With the intervention that we have put in place, the ANC is very confident
that we will bring back confidence and hope to our people by rooting out
all the corruption and throwing out all the rotten apples which do not want
to deliver.

We are now approaching the local government elections. By going back to the
people and listening to their views, we will be able to get individuals who
influence people to protest against those who are in authority, so that
they can be elected to those positions.

Since we are nearing the end of the month of August, I would like to
congratulate women in the provincial and local governments who successfully
had their 7th Summit in Bloemfontein from 16 to 18 August 2009. We hope
that their discussions will enable us to get 50% representation of women in
the forthcoming local government elections.

To conclude, I would like to extend my sympathy to those families who have
been affected by these protests, some of whom had their houses burnt down.
We all know that the victims of these incidents are women and children. We
urge those perpetrators to stop this. It is barbaric and inhumane. We know
that they are doing this for political gain. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Voorsitter, ek wil net vir die agb lid sê as sy
sekere vrot appels gaan uitgooi, gaan sy ’n skok opdoen, want sy gaan
agterkom op party plekke gaan sy die hele sakkie moet weggooi. [Gelag.]

Die onderwerp van hierdie debat is die noodsaaklikheid om die uitdagings
van plaaslike regering aan te pak. Ons mislei onsself. Dit is nie
uitdagings wat daar bespreek moet word nie, dis krisisse! Ek wil sover gaan
om te sê die onderwerp behoort te wees “die noodsaaklikheid om die totale
ineenstorting van plaaslike regering aan te pak”.

Die agb Tsenoli het hier kom spog dat die probleem oor korrupte amptenare
aangepak word en dat daar teen hulle opgetree word. Ek wil vir hom geluk
sê, maar ek het reeds by verskeie geleenthede van hierdie einste podium
gevra dat die agb Minister regulasies moet uitvaardig wat bepaal dat ’n
bepaalde amptenaar wat onder dissiplinêre verhoor is by één munisipaliteit
nie by ’n ander munisipaliteit aangestel kan word alvorens daardie
dissiplinêre verhoor afgehandel is nie.

’n Tipiese voorbeeld is die munisipale bestuurder van Klerksdorp. Ek het
dit al hóéveel hier genoem! Hy was aangekla van diefstal, bedrog en
korrupsie, en vóór sy saak afgehandel is by Kroonstad, is hy aangestel as
munisipale bestuurder van Klerksdorp.

Die HUISVOORSITTER (Mnr M B Skhosana): Agb lid, u tyd is verstreke.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Dan sal u begin optree! Dankie. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, I just want to say to the hon member
that if she is going to get rid of certain bad apples, she is going be
shocked, because she will realise that in some instances she will have to
throw away the whole bag. [Laughter.]

The subject of this debate is the urgent need to address the challenges of
local government. We are deceiving ourselves. It is not about the
challenges that there should be a discussion, but rather about the crises!
I will go as far as saying that the topic should be “the urgent need to
address the total collapse of local government”.

The hon Tsenoli came here and he boasted that the problem of corrupt
officials is being addressed and that action is being taken against them. I
want to congratulate him, but from this very same podium I have asked the
hon Minister on several occasions already to issue regulations stipulating
that when a particular official is facing disciplinary action at one
municipality, such official may not be appointed at another municipality
until that disciplinary hearing has been concluded.

A typical example is the municipal manager of Klerksdorp. I have already
mentioned it here so many times! He was accused of theft, fraud and
corruption and, before his case was concluded in Kroonstad, he was
appointed as municipal manager of Klerksdorp.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Then you will be taking action! Thank you.]

Mr S N SWART: Speaker, the ACDP shares the view that the state of service
delivery in many of our municipalities is appalling. Minister Shiceka was
very frank during his Budget Vote earlier this year when he said:

   It is a crying shame that after 15 years of democracy, parts of our
   country still reflect a legacy of apartheid and the unacceptable face of
   underdevelopment, poverty and marginalisation.

And in commenting on the deplorable state of certain municipalities, he
stated further:

   The extent of the breakdown in trust is so great that it is placing our
   democratic state at risk.

We thank him for those frank words. We have also seen a number of areas
being engulfed by service delivery protests. Twenty four is too many, hon
member. Clearly, we in Parliament must exercise a far greater and more
robust oversight function. We welcome the Minister’s commitment to deal
quickly and effectively with corrupt officials. Citizens are crying out for
better service delivery.

Should these issues not be urgently addressed, we will continue to see
protests and demonstrations that can, indeed, place our democratic state at
risk. I thank you.

Xitsonga paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D W MAVUNDA: Chairperson and the House at large, I stand before you to
illustrate the relationship and co-operation between traditional leadership
and representatives of the municipalities or local governments.

There is no doubt, Chairperson, that in some parts of our country since the
establishment of local governments or municipalities in 2000, infighting,
lack of consensus and failure to work together between traditional
leadership and municipalities has always been there. That has resulted in
the lack of service delivery for the people.]

In a true sense, there is no structure or leadership in our rural
communities that does not want development in their respective areas.
Traditional leaders, church leaders, or democratically elected leaders are
always concerned about their status and the status of the communities where
they live.

Secondly, the two components that I have mentioned, the local
municipalities and the traditional leadership institutions, were both
established by legislation, they are entrenched in the Constitution of our
country and have the same common purpose, which is to serve the needs and
interests of the previously disadvantaged communities.

The unfortunate situation between the two components has caused and
perpetuated a nightmare for the underdeveloped rural areas and the rural
communities. Interestingly, Chairperson, this House has promulgated laws
and Acts to distinguish between the roles of the two institutions, their
respective duties and functions, as well as their legislative mandate for
operating and servicing the previously disadvantaged and underdeveloped
rural communities.

For example, section 5(2) of the Traditional Leadership and Governance
Framework Act of 2003 provides for the partnership between municipalities
and traditional councils, where those partnerships must be based on the
principles of co-operative governance.

However, the two parties chose not to abide by those Acts; instead, they
fought for power to rule over the same previously disadvantaged
communities. This has posed a very serious challenge for our municipalities
as there is a lack of legislative compliance.

This was because the two parties did not have insight into the legislation
or a proper interpretation of the Act – something that needs to be looked
into. There is no sign of a serious commitment to consultation between the
two components.

Community development has since been paid lip service in most of our rural
communities because, in reality, there are no clear policies or programmes
to deal with this.

We, therefore, call for the publication and immediate implementation of the
Communal Land Rights Act of 2004, which provides, amongst other things, for
the establishment of the land administration committees by the local people
themselves.

Their functions, amongst other things, are to ensure the allocation of new-
order rights to all persons, including women, people living with
disability, youth and all vulnerable community members.

The fast-tracking of the Land Management Bill, which also provides for
working together with our people in the rural areas, will ensure a
comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land, agrarian reform
and food security, as alluded to by the President of the country in his
state of the nation address.

Consultation by councillors with community members on key strategic
policies and decisions is a great necessity, for example, on the revision
of the Integrated Development Plan, IDP, tariffs, indigent programmes, and
so on.

Again, section 81 of the Municipal Structures Act states categorically that
any municipality that wants to bring any development to an area within the
jurisdiction of a particular traditional leader, must have proper
consultations with the said traditional leader and other relevant
stakeholders.

However, councillors in some other municipalities chose not to have such
consultations, and such practices have led to confrontation and retarded
the needed development in those communities. In order for proper and
comprehensive rural and community development to take place in our rural
communities, there must be peace and stability at the level of community
leadership.

The fact that Chapter 6 of the Traditional Leadership and Governance
Framework Act 2003 makes provision for the establishment of a commission to
deal with dispute resolution concerning customary laws and customs in our
communities and with traditional leaders, speaks for itself. It is
something that should be very desirable.

Community development programmes and strategies can only be conducted and
implemented in communities where there is peace, no infighting between the
leaders of various stakeholders of that community and where co-operation
and working together prevails.
We therefore call upon the Ministry to speed up the process and pave the
way for the Department of Community Development and Land Reform to operate
with ease in the best interests of our communities.

We also call for the speedy establishment of the department of traditional
affairs as already discussed and agreed upon. This will serve a better
purpose in the smooth running of community development programmes and local
economic development.

Ku dya ngopfu a hi ku hlula ndlala. Ndza khensa. [These few words will
suffice. I thank you.]

Ms M WENGER: Mr Chairperson, once again local government finds itself in a
crisis, and the latest violent demonstrations bear testimony to this. We
find communities without water, sanitation or electricity, and without
decent roads, schools and clinics. Fifteen years down the line they are no
better off but are, in fact, worse off as the recent recession finds more
and more people unemployed.

During July, the DA’s parliamentary leader the hon Athol Trollip, hon Doman
and I visited hotspot areas around the country and found the situation
disastrous. Promises were made and expectations created in order to win
votes, but the same individuals who had made those promises are nowhere to
be found post the election. The frustrations of these communities are
ignored.

The placing of a few police vehicles outside the informal settlements, as
we have observed, will not change the mood within the townships. Service
delivery issues, as well as housing, need to be addressed as a matter of
urgency and should dominate debates in this House.

The time is now. We must take action to help communities that are living in
squalor and rat-infested townships. We must take steps to assist
communities living in unacceptable living conditions where adults and
children alike are exposed to infections and diseases as part of their
daily lives.

Most of the people we spoke to during our visits have been on the housing
waiting list since 1996. What has happened to that list of 1996, Minister?
Why have the people on those lists not yet received their houses? Who are
the people who are receiving preferential treatment, and why?

We met with some who have now, out of sheer frustration, moved into RDP
houses built in their own areas, but allocated to other people. We also saw
first-hand the quality of these houses: The structures are falling apart,
water connections as well as sewerage systems are not connected and there
is no electricity. How could such a project be signed off and the
unscrupulous contractor paid?

We need to ask these questions so that the problems can be addressed, and
those involved must be held to account. The fact of the matter is that our
citizens deserve better. Let us learn from good examples such as those set
by Helen Zille, the best mayor in the world! [Interjections.]

Salga has, on behalf of the municipalities, without the correct mandate,
negotiated a 13% increase which municipalities have not budgeted for. This,
Minister, will put further strain on municipalities and will result in less
services being delivered. Work ethics and productivity, strangely, were not
addressed in these negotiations, thus making municipal labour very
expensive. Vandalism of council-owned assets and private property should be
billed to the unions.

Furthermore, the exorbitant membership fees to Salga which run into
hundreds of millions of rands, should rather be used for service delivery
instead of being wasted on a structure that does not really represent the
true views of its members.

Finally, I would like to address the financial viability of municipalities.
The rates and taxes accounting systems have been changed. But instead of
improving the situation, billing has been plunged into disarray, and now
accounts are not sent out on time. As a result, outstanding debt owed to
municipalities is increasing, further crippling efforts to improve service
delivery.
Credit control measures are not taken seriously, and debts keep on rising
without action being taken. Shortfalls cannot be addressed simply by
raising taxes simply to balance budgets. Our rates base is overloaded
already, and we are facing a situation where residents can no longer afford
it. Only when debt control measures have been addressed can we begin to
provide free and proper services.

A few days ago we learnt of problems facing Tshwane. Not only did they
exhaust the R500 million overdraft, but now they cannot pay Eskom or Rand
Water. We also found that at the end of June 2009, debt owed to them
amounted to R3,4 billion, and that a huge chunk of it is owed by government
departments.

A leading jurist once said:

   If government becomes a law-breaker, it breeds contempt for the law. It
   invites anarchy.

In order to prevent anarchy, we must ensure that our government and its
representatives are held to account. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS: House
Chairperson, colleagues, members of this august House and members of the
public, this debate is taking place in an important month, a month that is
important in the struggle for women’s emancipation. It is also dealing with
an important topic that touches the lives of all our people. Local
government is the structure that touches everyone.

Ifana noNdabazabantu ... osithinta kusukela sizalwa ukufinyelela ethuneni
uma ujabulile ukwazi ukuthola-ke isithifiketi somshado yindlela akuthinta
ngayo uNdabazabantu, Umnyango Wezasekhaya. (Translation of isiZulu
paragraph follows.)

[This is like Home Affairs ... which has your particulars from birth to
death; if you are lucky you can even get your marriage certificate which is
one of the ways in which the Department of Home Affairs works for you.]

I have listened to everyone who engaged on this critical subject matter,
and we have heard views from various parties. The ANC also raised critical
issues and at the same time talked about the best practices that are
prevailing. There are those who are cynical when raising their issues, as
if there is nothing positive that has been done here.

We would like to commit ourselves here in this House, as a big family for
local government, to build a local government that is efficient, effective,
responsive and accountable. We are telling you that this is the task that
we are going to do in the next coming five years. By the year 2014, we
should all be able to experience the four things that I have spoken about.

We are also saying that it is important that all of us in this House should
rise above petty political differences and also our ideological
orientation, and ensure that we all contribute to building local
government, not only for ourselves but for our children and future
generations. It is in our interest that we do so.

As the department, we have unleashed a comprehensive assessment of each and
every municipality in this country, because we would like to understand
what is happening. We do not only have to understand that, but we should be
able to come up with solutions that are tailor-made and are specific to
each municipality.

We can’t use a one-size-fits-all approach to deal with the issues of the
local government, because where these challenges are experienced, they are
not the same. This revolutionary process is driven at the provincial level
by the MECs, and co-ordinated at the national level by the Department of Co-
operative Governance and Traditional Affairs. At the same time, we believe
that the consolidated reports that come from municipalities should be
approved by provincial Cabinet, that is, the provincial executive
committees at that level.

They should be able to do so by the middle of September and ensure that
there is an outline of the state of municipalities in each and every
province - a process that is driven at a political level, and that is going
to enjoy political oversight.

Those reports should be sent to my department at the national level, so
that we can outline the state of municipalities in South Africa. We should
be able to take the report to the summit. We would like to have a national
indaba, as it has been raised by Cope. We agree with you on this one and
the process will be undertaken. We would like to hold this national indaba
at the end of October, where all of us would be able to engage on the state
of municipalities and begin to draft a turnaround strategy for local
government in this country.

Now we are saying to everybody who would like to express their views and
opinions to come forward to the conference. Governmental and
nongovernmental organisations, including universities and learning
institutions, should be able to come and contribute in taking this process
forward. From our side, we are saying that this turnaround strategy should
be approved by Cabinet before the end of this year. Next year we should be
able to implement the turnaround strategy that has been agreed upon by all
South Africans.
Once we have come up with a turnaround strategy for each and every
municipality, people should be able to engage and say how they would like
to be governed in their own localities. At the end of the day, they would
be able to monitor the implementation of a turnaround strategy. We don’t
want to allow anyone to be left out. Wonke umuntu makaze ngaphambili.
[Everybody must come on board.]

Together, we should be able to turn this country around. That is why we are
saying we should rise above petty political things because local government
is a matter that concerns everyone. You can’t afford to politicise it. We
should be able to confront the issues and to engage from the side of the
Ministry. We are also going to engage Cope, the DA and all other opposition
parties so that we are able to find solutions for South Africa, because it
is in our interests to do that.

We believe that there is a requirement from you. The requirement is that
you should accept that the outcome might require us to amend the laws. One
of the major weaknesses that you have in the local government legislation
is that there is no oversight, and there is no separation of powers between
the executive and the legislative component. That is within the
Constitution. It might mean that for us to be able to deliver services to
our people, we should be able to ensure that we amend the Constitution. At
times we should be able to amend the laws so that we are sharper at the end
of the spear in dealing with these issues.
We are calling upon you, so that when that time comes you would be able to
support us. You should be able to agree with us that that should be done in
the interests of the country and its people, wherever they are. We are also
saying that in dealing with the turnaround strategy, we should agree that
all of us should make a contribution where we live, because every public
representative who is here has his or her own municipality.

The question that we should be asking ourselves is: What is your
contribution to your own municipality? Because you are not just an ordinary
citizen, you are a public representative who is supposed to be playing an
oversight role wherever you are and wherever you stay, to ensure that local
government is taken forward.

We are calling upon you to give us reports on whatever you’ve experienced
in your own areas, good or bad, so that we are able to take the best
practices forward and at the same time deal with and undermine the negative
tendencies that are prevailing in our municipalities. We are the first to
admit that not all is hunky-dory in municipalities. Together we can find
solutions and ensure that we take these processes forward when dealing with
them. Therefore, we believe that all of us, together with this Parliament
as an institution and as individuals, should ensure that we make local
government everyone’s business.

We should be able to ensure that in the next five years, in local
government, we don’t speak in the same way, in all respects.  I won’t talk
about the content of the state of the municipalities because due process is
unfolding and is taking place. Let’s await that process to go forward. We
will be able to report on the outcomes of the state of the municipalities
in this House so that it engages itself with that process.

From our point of view we would like to agree with some members on the
issues raised concerning corruption, that it does not have any place in
this country. Together we should be able to combat corruption, uproot
nepotism and state that it is not allowed. I would like to indicate that
the issue of nepotism and appointing people from the same party is not only
an ANC matter. Let’s talk about the DA here. The DA has removed almost all
Africans who were in leadership positions in the city of Cape Town.
[Applause.] One of them was the most able person, Mr Nhlakanipho Nkontwana,
who is now my special adviser. He was one of the best people who performed
his work very well. Last year, his achievement was the amendment of the
Constitution which was presented in this House concerning the issues of
Merafong and the law within a period of three months. That has never been
done anywhere in this country.

Therefore, the issue of removing people is not only an issue of the ANC.
You have recently removed a woman, Ms Majiet, who was the head of the
Department of Local Government in this province. She is a disabled woman
who was removed by the DA. Her sin was that she was not appointed by the
DA.

Therefore, the issue of nepotism is not only an ANC matter. I think we must
all agree that people should be appointed based on merit and not because of
their political affiliation. That should be applicable to all of us here.
[Applause.]

Here in the Western Cape almost 86% of the municipalities which are under
the DA have not submitted their financial statements to the Auditor-
General. Those are the facts and realities. If the information was not
submitted to the Auditor-General, it means you would not be able to check
whether monies were used judiciously and for the right purpose.

Therefore, when we are debating here at the podium, let’s not pretend to
the gallery that we are holier than thou in the areas where we are
governing.

Let’s work together in addressing our weaknesses. It should not be a party
political matter. It should be a matter of governance because it is in the
interests of this country. That is why I am saying there is no person who
can throw stones when living in a glass house. Let’s all address these
issues as we go along.

I also agree with the view expressed by the FF Plus when it raised issues
that there were challenges in some municipalities, for example, Klerksdorp.
I would also like to say that it was not correct to mention that we should
call a crisis debate, as if the sky was falling. However, we agree that we
should look at the regulations and the things that should be done.

We agree with some views expressed by the DA, Cope, FF Plus, ID and also
the ACDP, and we are saying that we should see the good points in building
local governments.

From our side, we are going to be engaging with the opposition because we
believe that we have nothing to fear and nothing to hide. Let’s work
together to build these municipalities. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S L TSENOLI: Chairperson, it is quite unfortunate that during this
month, Women’s Month, the issue of Shanaaz Majiet has been raised. The
Minister spoke about her. We talk about this issue today because it is
Women’s Month. Here is an interesting fact about her.

The Public Service Commission does interesting reports, as I mentioned
earlier. One of those reports did a sample of national and provincial
departments in terms of their performance in relation to the nine values.

The best performing departments were led by Shanaaz Majiet and Portia
Molefe, who is from Public Enterprises. The best performing departments!
[Applause.] But the next thing, amongst other things, she is shafted.
[Interjections.] Because of that, you are supposed to be proponents of the
rule of law. [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): Order, order!

Mr S L TSENOLI: Those are allegations. What are you assuming - that she is
guilty? You are being presumptuous. You must wait until you hear what
happens there.

The point we are making is that you should stop being holier than thou. You
act like a person with a hammer - everything is a nail. You absolutely do
not see the valuable and good things that are happening in Johannesburg. In
the centre of Jo’burg and outside the centre of Jo’burg, the place is
upside down with construction and reconstruction, the rebuilding of
infrastructure that was meant for a limited white population that must now
take on a bigger, inclusive population. You don’t talk about that. All you
see is what you think is going wrong.

If you travel throughout the country you will see that there is
construction, there are cranes, but you don’t speak about them, because,
hey, you are carrying a hammer, you are looking for nails, and this is not
it. [Laughter.] [Applause.]
So, whilst the Minister is correct that we must be objective, we must alert
you to the fact that although we value your opinion, we value them as
opinions. They are not the truth, okay. There is a distinction between the
two. [Interjections.] So we must subject them to the reality that we deal
with in our work.

It is important to note that we haven’t sufficiently dealt with the impact
of migration and urbanisation on our country. This is because some of the
biggest challenges that municipalities are facing, especially the large
ones, are the growing populations.

Unfortunately, owing to the system of financing and financial
determination, the amount of money that goes to these municipalities from
national and provincial coffers does not meet the growing requirements of
these municipalities.

Yet people must receive services and they must consume those services, so
this is a global phenomenon. It is caused by a crisis of poverty that, as I
said earlier, is not caused by us but by a system that is unsustainable
that we must deal with in the long term.

So, in a sense, those issues are not just municipal problems. They are
problems of a global system that is inequitable, that we must address and
that we must root out so that we deal with the effects on our poor
communities in our country. And this crisis is not spoken about often
enough. What it requires of us is not only resources but an understanding
of the conditions that give rise to poor performance.

Surveys have been conducted that show that a lack of capacity is sharpest
in the poorest areas in our country. The reason is because the people in
those areas, who don’t have any capacity to write home about, gravitate
towards where they think they can earn more money, have better resources,
and so on. And who gets left in those areas? So, some of these issues, as I
have said, require, as the Minister has correctly said, “a national coming
together” to identify these issues. [Laughter.] Absolutely necessary! It is
correct.

So, there is no truth in suggestions that municipalities were ever left to
fend for themselves. That is not a reflection when you study the
intergovernmental fiscal flow. Instead, you see a rapidly growing financial
injection into provinces and municipalities. It’s recorded, unless you do
not read or, if you read, you don’t comprehend the stuff that has been made
available by Treasury.

In fact, one of the biggest improvements in transparency is in the
municipal local government review. That has more information that shows a
systematic increase in resources that has been going on. We agree fully. It
is completely inadequate. It should have been more than that, but that is
because we are talking now not just about problem solving but paradigm
shifting initiatives that must take place this term. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]
Debate concluded.

       a) Letter from the Minister of Public Enterprises dated 22 July 2009,
          to the Speaker of the National Assembly explaining the delay in
          the submission of the Annual Report of the Pebble Bed Modular
          Reactor (Pty) Limited (PBMR) for 2008-2009.

          Request for Extension on the Submission of PBMR 2009 Annual Report


          In order to avoid a qualified audit PBMR has to demonstrate that
          it has sufficient funding for the 12 months following the
          signature date of the audit. Without Government underwriting of
          the closure cost or guaranteed funding allocation from Government
          through the MTEF, PBMR will receive a qualified audit on 30 July
          2009.


          In order to avoid a qualified audit PBMR is requesting that the
          submission of their Annual Report be delayed, thereby delaying the
          date for audit signoff and essentially giving them more time to
          sort out the funding requirements.


          I have granted them permission to delay the submission until 31
          October 2009 on the basis that the Department of Public Enterprise
          is compiling a Cabinet Memorandum to brief Cabinet on PBMR’s new
          business case and that until Cabinet meets to make a decision on
          the future of PBMR, the release of the annual report will be
          delayed to avoid the consequences of a qualified audit report.
