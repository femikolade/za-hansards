                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Deputy Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of this House I shall table the following motion:

   That this House, noting that –


     1) the ruling party held its 52nd national conference in Polokwane in
        December in 2007;


     2) the lead-up to this conference was characterised by bitter in-
        fighting between the two factions that eventually emerged, and that
        service delivery in many parts of the country was brought to a
        standstill as a result;

[Interjections]

     3) the conference itself was characterised by unruly behaviour
        including booing and disrespect shown towards the chairperson, which
        portrayed a negative image of our country to the world;


     4) the conference resolved ...

[Interjections.]


Can I have some protection, Deputy Chairperson? I am reading a motion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL (Ms P M Hollander): Hon members,
thank you! Can you please give the hon member a chance to complete his
notice?

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Thank you very much.

     4) the conference resolved to disband the Scorpions, the most effective
        crime-fighting unit in our country in living memory; and
     5) a number of individuals were elected to the National Executive
        Committee after having been found guilty of defrauding Parliament,
        and further noting that, as a consequence to the Polokwane struggle,
        speculation is rife that a further purge of senior office holders in
        this august House is imminent;

     6) therefore resolves -

           i) not to allow the struggle for the soul of the ANC to affect
              the effective functioning of this House, and its
              indispensable oversight role; and


          ii) to call on Luthuli House to respect the leadership in this
              House of the hon M J Mahlangu.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you very much, Deputy Chairperson. I
would request that, in future, the Table staff should alert the presiding
officer if the Chief Whip’s hand has been put up first when we deal with
notices of motion.

Deputy Chairperson, I would like to put a notice of motion:

    That the Council –


      1) notes that –
          a) the ANC held its 52nd national conference at the University of
             Limpopo, in the great north of our country;


          b) this occasion provided an opportunity to reflect on the
             achievements of this great movement as it has worked, together
             with the masses, first to defeat the apartheid system, and
             then to vanquish the legacy of racial oppression and gender
             inequality; and


          c) for five days the country and nations across the globe
             observed the vibrant democratic debates about the future of
             our movement and the nation it leads;


      2) takes this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected leadership
         of the ANC, which includes, among others, members of the NCOP, the
         hon Mr Sicelo Shiceka and the hon Ms Nosipho Ntwanambi, who are
         collectively fired up with passionate selflessness and steeped in
         the vintage traditions of our movement to bear the huge
         responsibility to catalyse our people’s aspirations for a social
         order and commitment of continuing our work to liberate our people
         from the consequences of poverty and the entanglements of the
         legacy of apartheid;


      3) also takes this opportunity to congratulate the ANC for
         successfully hosting such a watershed conference and the newly
         elected President of the ANC, Jacob  Zuma, for his election as the
         12th President of the ANC, succeeding an illustrious list of names
         such as John Langalibalele Dube, Sefako Mapogo Makgatho, Pixley ka
         Isaka Seme, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, Oliver Reginald Tambo and
         many more;


      4) however, notes the barrage of vicious personal attacks and public
         conflations by certain leaders of the opposition who designated
         themselves “spokespersons” of the ANC and featured quite
         prominently in the mass media, commenting on proceedings and
         decisions of the ANC in Polokwane with the sole intention of waging
         vicious attacks and smear campaigns against the character of the
         ANC and its leadership; and


     (5)    takes this opportunity to condemn such behaviour that was
         intended to undermine and distort the fundamental key and
         historical ideals within which the ANC elects its leaders.

Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): I just want to
correct something before you speak, hon member. There is nothing in the
Rules that says you have to speak first, Chief Whip, and notice was not
given to me that you would speak first. Thank you.

Mr A WATSON: Madam Chair, I did rise on the point of order, but you asked
me to wait. The point of order is that the Rules determine that no member
may make a motion on the subject of a motion that has already been stated.
I ask you to check the Rules, and to make a ruling at your leisure. Thank
you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Does any other
member wish to give notice of a motion? You may proceed, sir.

Mr A WATSON: Dankie, mev die Voorsitter. Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek
namens die Demokratiese Alliansie by die volgende sitting van die Raad die
volgende mosie gaan stel:

    Dat die Raad –


     1) met skok kennis neem van die onaanvaarbare toestande wat steeds
        heers in die Plaaslike Munisipale Raad van Mbombela in Nelspruit,
        hoofstad van Mpumalanga;


           2) kennis neem dat ondanks –

        a) talle pogings die afgelope twaalf maande, sedert Februarie 2007;


        b) herhaalde vermanings van die DA-raadslede;

          c) my eie toesprake, versoeke en onderhoude met die provinsiale en
             nasionale leierskap; en


          d) uiteindelike ingrypings van die provinsiale wetgewer ingevolge
             artikel 139 van die Grondwet –


        die Mbombela-raad steeds lamgelê is weens onduidelikheid oor
        die wyse en besondhede van die beoogde ingrypings en die
        gevolglike minagting van raadsbesluite deur mnr Dladla, die
        munisipale bestuurder; en


      3) die agb Voorsitter van die Raad derhalwe versoek om opdrag te gee
         aan die betrokke Gekose Komitee om ‘n dringende in sito-besoek aan
         Nelspruit te bring en om toe te sien dat sake genormaliseer word
         om dienslewering te herstel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A WATSON: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I hereby give notice that at
the next sitting of the Council, I will move the following motion on behalf
of the DA:

    That the House –


      1) notes with horror the unacceptable conditions which still prevail
         in the Mbombela Municipality in Nelspruit, the capital of
         Mpumalanga;
           2) notes that despite –

          a) various attempts over the past twelve months, since February
             2007;


          b) repeated warnings by DA councillors;


          c) my own speeches, requests and interviews with the provincial
             and national leadership; and


          d) eventual interventions by the provincial legislature in terms
             of section 139 of the Constitution –


         the Mbombela Council continues to be incapacitated because the
         process and details about the planned interventions were unclear,
         resulting in municipal manager Mr Dladla’s disregard for council
         decisions; and


      3) therefore requests the hon Chairperson of the Council to instruct
         the concerned select committee to pay an urgent in sito visit to
         Nelspruit to ensure that matters are stabilised and service
         delivery is reinstated.]


The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon Deputy Chairperson, I will move
at the next sitting of this House:


    That the Council notes –


     1) that the 52nd national conference has come and gone;


     2) that this conference has once more reaffirmed the centrality of the
        ANC in the body politic of South Africa; and


    calls on all small opposition parties to mind their own business and
    says: “Hands off the ANC!”.


[Applause.]

Mr J W LE ROUX: Dankie, Adjunkvoorsitter. Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op
die volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:

    Dat die Raad kennis neem dat –

      1) die gebrek aan kundigheid in ons administrasie die land in chaos
         gedompel het;


       2) die elektrisiteitskrisis die ekonomie reeds miljarde rande gekos
          het en dit terwyl kundige mense by Eskom uit hul poste ontslaan
          is;


      3) ons onderwysstelsel klaaglik misluk terwyl bekwame onderwysers in
         die privaatsektor werk;
      4) die regering nie sy burgers teen misdadigers kan beskerm nie en dit
         terwyl bekwame polisielede by die huis sit; en

      5) ondeurdagte regstellende aksie deur die ANC ons land van kundigheid
         beroof het terwyl ons infrastruktuur in duie stort.

Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. I hereby give notice that
at the next sitting I will move:


   That the House notes that –

     1) the lack of capacity in our country’s administration has plunged
        our country into chaos;


      2) the electricity crisis has already cost the economy billions while
         competent people were dismissed at Eskom;


      3) our education system is lamentably failing while qualified teachers
         are working in the private sector;

      4) the government is unable to protect its citizens against criminals
         while competent members of the police are sitting at home; and
      5) ill-considered affirmative action by the ANC has robbed our country
         of expertise while our infrastructure is collapsing.

I thank you.]

Ms H LAMOELA: Dankie Voorsitter. Ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:

    Dat die Raad kennis neem dat –


      1) ondanks die feit dat ons gesondheidsorg groot tekorte aan
         professionele gesondheidswerkers ondervind, ons nou ook sukkel met
         vertragings rondom die bou van beplande hospitale – ek verwys
         spesifiek na Upington waar werkloosheid seëvier en waar die bou
         van die plaaslike hospitaal uitgestel is en dat hierdie stap
         veroorsaak het dat pasiënte nou 300 km ver vervoer moet word vir
         spesiale mediese sorg;

      2) gister, tydens so ‘n rit, twaalf pasiënte waarvan twee kinders
         was, op pad na De Aar tragies in ‘n ongeluk gesterf het;

      3) ons Grondwet voorsiening maak vir gehalte-mediese sorg aan
         landsburgers en dat dit kommerwekkend is om te besef dat ons weer
         eens in ‘n grondwetlike krisis gedompel is, omdat siek plattelandse
         pasiënte nie hul grondwetlike reg kon uitoefen nie;

      4) ons plattelandse dorpe nog steeds swak gesondheidsorg beleef en ons
         ‘n dringende beroep op ons Minister van Gesondheid doen om
         onmiddellik die nood van die platteland aan te spreek;

      5) daar geen plaasvervanger is vir lewe nie en plattelandse pasiënte
         se grondwetlike reg op gehalte-gesondheidsorg gister weer eens
         benadeel is; en

      6) medelye betuig aan die gestorwenes se naasbestaandes en glo dat ons
         Hemelse Vader se genade alleen die verlies sal kan vul.
         (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms H LAMOELA: Thank you, Chairperson. I hereby give notice that at the
next sitting I will move:

    That the House notes that –


     1) despite the fact that our health care is experiencing a shortfall
        of health-care providers, we are now also struggling with delays
        around the construction of planned hospitals- I am referring to
        Upington in particular where unemployment prevails and the
        construction of local hospitals have been postponed and that this
        has resulted in patients now having to be transported 300 km away
        for specialised medical care;


     2) yesterday, during such a trip, twelve patients, two of whom were
        children, died tragically in an accident on their way to De Aar;


     3) our Constitution provides for quality medical care for all citizens
        and it is distressing to realise that we are once again immersed in
        a constitutional crisis because ill patients from rural areas were
        unable to exercise their constitutional right;


     4) our rural towns are still experiencing inferior health care and we
        urgently appeal to the Minister of Health to address the plight of
        the rural districts immediately;


     5) life is irreplaceable and yesterday the constitutional right to
        quality health care for rural patients was, once again, violated;
        and


     6) our condolences are conveyed to the relatives of the deceased with
        the belief that only the mercy of our Heavenly Father can
        compensate for their loss.]


The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon Deputy Chairperson, I want to
rise on a point of order and want to know whether it is permissible for a
member to make a speech whilst rising on a notice of motion. Thank you.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Madam Deputy Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it
parliamentary for the hon member to say that ...

... die ANC is ligsinnig? [... the ANC is frivolous.]

That is an insult to the ANC and she must withdraw.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Lamoela, can I
have ... [Interjections.] Order! Order! For the last time, order! Thank
you!

Hon Lamoela, was that part of your notice?

Ms H LAMOELA: Yes, because of the comment that came from the hon member
from the ANC, I had to say that. These are people! They are human beings
and not animals! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Lamoela, you are
wrong. Will you please withdraw what you have said? [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Withdraw!
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Lamoela, will
you just withdraw that part where you said ...

... hulle is ligsinnig? [... they are frivolous?] [Interjections.]

Hon members, could you please give me a chance, I am busy with Ms Lamoela?
I am busy with Ms Lamoela! Will you please sit down? Will you please sit
down?

Ms H LAMOELA: Madam Chair, I will withdraw it, but I will take it up in the
media so that everybody can know. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! Members,
order! Hon members, I will not call this House to order again! Could you
please give one another a chance to state your case?

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr John Gomomo)

The Chief Whip of the Council moved without notice:

   That the Council –

     1) notes –
        (a)      with deep sadness and an utmost sense of loss the passing
             away of a stalwart, a pulse of our movement and a true servant
             of our people, the Hon Mr John Gomomo at the age of 62; and


        (b)      that Mr Gomomo, a cadre of the ANC and distinguished
             veteran of the liberation of our people who dedicated his life
             to dismantling the shackles of poverty  and repressive labour
             laws in our country, will be buried on Saturday, 9 February
             2008, at KwaNobuhle, in the Eastern Cape;


      2) remembers that the political contribution of Mr Gomomo spans from
         being a leader of the trade union movement in South Africa and
         combatant leader of the people of South Africa whose contribution
         in the transformation of South Africa extends beyond the peerless
         contribution he made to the workers’ movement with thousands of
         workers that were faced with the everyday brutality of the
         apartheid government and who now enjoy a deep sense of security
         that today their lives are better and they know for sure that their
         well-being is protected;


      3) takes this opportunity to dip its head for comfort on the shoulders
         of a nation in mourning and on the chests of so many of our people
         who are mourning with the Gomomo family by virtue of the life he
         shared with our nation; and

      4) extends its deepest heartfelt condolences to the Gomomo family,
         friends, comrades and the nation at large and hopes that they will
         find comfort in knowing that his dedication, words and deeds will
         serve as a living memorial, setting an outstanding example of a
         leader born for our people who dedicated his life for their
         liberation.


May his soul rest in peace!


   When we are weary and in need of strength,
   We will remember you.
   When we have decisions that are difficult to make,
   We will remember you.
   When we have achievements that are based on your strength and dedication,
   We will remember you.
   As long as we live,
   Your spirit shall live!

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         SOUTH AFRICAN CRICKET TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Madam Deputy Chairperson, I would like to move without
notice:

   That the Council –


     1) notes and congratulates the South African Cricket team, the
        Proteas, on their five-zero ODI series win over the West Indies;


     2) wishes to thank Shaun Pollock, one of the world’s greatest all-
        rounders in the game of cricket for his great sportsmanship
        displayed throughout his career;


     3) recognises the contribution he has made towards the success of the
        Proteas over the last 12 years; and


     4) further notes that he is a true son of this country and has been a
        proud ambassador for South Africa on and off the sport fields of
        the world.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                MICHAEL MBANJWA - DUSI CANOE MARATHON WINNER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs A N D QIKANI: Madam Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –


1) notes that –


           a) history was made in South Africa’s Dusi Canoe Marathon early
              this year, when Michael Mbanjwa  became the first black
              winner in the 57-year history of the event;


           b) the victory of Mbanjwa is a humble journey of an ordinary
              South African who defied all odds from the humblest of
              beginnings to become a South African hero and a celebrated
              ambassador of our people;


           c) in 1997 Mbanjwa was on his way to a game of soccer when he
              was stopped  by Lembethe, who told him to give canoeing a try
              and he gave it a go, having seen paddlers in this famous
              race; and


     2) takes this opportunity to congratulate this hero of our people and
        hopes that his victory will remain an inspirational story of a
        nation in the making, determined to overcome all adversities to be
        the champions of the world.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               PROVINCES UNDERSPEND ON COMMUNITY LIBRARY GRANT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D ROBINSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –

     a) notes that many provinces have underspent on the Community Library
        Services Grant and that in some cases library buildings are
        standing empty, without staff or books;

     b) exercises its oversight function in regard to the spending of the
        grant with due diligence;


     c) condemns this lack of service delivery to the people, especially
        the youth;

     d) affirms that the relevant people should be held accountable for
        this; and

     e) believes that well-equipped and well-staffed libraries are central
        to ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to education and
        personal development and that a culture of reading is an important
        part of our national development.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! The hon
member has moved a motion. Is there any objection to the motion? Is that an
objection? Please raise your objection, hon member.

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Chairperson, all libraries are empty. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): In light of the
objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. This motion without notice
will now become notice of a motion.

        DEATH OF 12 PATIENTS BETWEEN KOOPMANSFONTEIN AND DELPORTSHOOP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –


      1) notes with sadness the death of 12 patients who died when a patient
         minibus carrying 27 patients overturned on a road between
         Koopmansfontein and Delportshoop in the Northern Cape;


      2) further notes that the horrific incident happened in the early
         hours of the morning on 5 February 2008, when the driver lost
         control of the patient minibus and it overturned and rolled several
         times; and

      3) takes this opportunity to convey its heartfelt and deepest
         condolences to the families of the deceased and all the people of
         the Northern Cape for this immense and horrendous loss of human
         lives.

May God be with them and we wish them strength in this trying and difficult
moment.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chairperson, this is the second occasion in this sitting
that members of the ANC laugh audibly when the deaths of fellow South
Africans are being debated and I call on you to rule on that, please. Is
that parliamentary?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! That is not
parliamentary! I was going to check on them, but I first had to complete
these motions without notice.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! I want to
remind members of this House that you still have the holiday spirit. Please
conduct yourselves as members of this House.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                           (The late O J Tlhagale)

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chair, on behalf of the DA, I would like to move a
motion without notice:

  That the Council –


     1) offers its condolences on the tragic passing away of one of its
        colleagues and North West representative, Mr O J Tlhagale;


     2) remembers that he was a very kind and gentle soul and a real
        gentleman; and


     3) expresses its heartfelt sympathy to his family and friends.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! Is that an
objection, hon member?
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, it is not an objection;
it is just an amendment on behalf of the whole House. We did raise this
matter in the multiparty whips meeting and agreed that a motion will be
moved. Mr Watson was there on behalf of the DA. So, we just want to put it
on record that this motion is on behalf of the whole NCOP. Already, Mr
Kolweni was going to do that as a provincial whip of the North West. We are

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Deputy Chair, I move without notice:

   That the Council –


     1) notes with a great sense of pride and appreciation that –


          a) the North West police have arrested more than 9 000 people
             during a crime-prevention operation lasting three months,
             which was put in place in October in the build-up to the
             festive season;


          b) out of the 9 185 people who were arrested, a staggering 4 472
             were arrested in connection with serious crimes such as
             murder, attempted murder, rape, assault and robbery;


          c) close to 1 700 were also apprehended for crimes committed with
             an economic motive such as housebreaking, theft of cellular
             phones, theft of a motor vehicle, theft out of a motor
             vehicle, stock theft and fraud;


          d) more than 500 illegal liquor outlets as well as 41 licensed
             premises were closed, and a further 111 licensed premises were
             charged for contravening the Liquor Act, drugs such as dagga,
             cocaine, ecstasy, mandrax and heroine were confiscated, as
             well as the arrest of 53 people and the seizure of 169
             firearms and more than 1 000 rounds of ammunition; and


          e) in the Gauteng province, over 107 people were arrested in the
             past 24 hours in places such as Hillbrow, Braamfontein, Berea
             and Joubert Park for crimes such as murder, robberies,
             housebreaking, theft and fraud;


     2) takes this opportunity to congratulate the North West and Gauteng
        police for this outstanding and sterling work and hopes that this
        will send a clear message to those who seek to use ANC resolutions
        to incorporate the Scorpions into the South African Police Service
        that the SAPS is demonstrating the capacity and sting to tackle
        crime in this country; and


     3) hopes that the process of the incorporation of the Scorpions will
        be speeded up with the expediency that was expressed by the ANC
        conference.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       GRANT FRAUD BY PUBLIC SERVANTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms J M MASILO: Deputy Chair, I would like to move without notice:


   That the Council –


       1) notes that –

             a) a total of 6 693 public servants were convicted for
                defrauding the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) with a
                savings value of R 7,7 billion by the end of December 2007;

             b) about 5 391 disciplinary case files of public servants
                convicted of defrauding the Sassa have been handed over to
                their respective national and provincial departments for
                disciplinary action to be taken; and

             c) in April 2005, hon Minister Skweyiya tasked the Special
                Investigating Unit to investigate fraud, corruption and
                maladministration which then plagued the social grant
                system, and that the unit discovered people with permanent
                positions in the Public Service deliberately misrepresenting
                their positions so as to obtain social grants;

       2) further notes the reaffirmation of the ANC’s 52nd conference,
          held in Polokwane last year, that central to the task of social
          transformation of the South African society is the role of the
          government in confronting the challenges of poverty and
          underdevelopment, and that our grant system has been instrumental
          in this regard; and


       3) takes this opportunity to call on all people of South Africa to
          work with the various structures of government that are working
          tirelessly to address the problem of abuse and draining the
          resources intended for addressing the challenges of poverty in
          our country.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                PERFORMANCE OF BAFANA BAFANA IN GHANA HAILED

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council –


     1) welcomes the spirit, determination and improved performance of
        Bafana Bafana in the 2008 African Cup of Nations in Ghana;


     2) regrets that they were eliminated in the first round;


     3) hopes that in future they will perform even better than they did
        this time; and

     4) believes that the current African Cup of Nations competition was a
        dress rehearsal and will stand them in good stead as they build to
        the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr A WATSON: Madam Chair, I don’t have a motion, but would you allow me to
make a correction in regard to our apology regarding to the motion on the
late Mr Tlhagale? I will be very brief.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! Can I just
stop you there, please? Can I give you my decision at the next meeting?

Mr A WATSON: I just want to correct something, Madam Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): No, it is not
necessary as the motion has gone through already. [Interjections.]
Order! You didn’t have your hand up all the time, hon Mzizi.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Chair, thank you for your indulgence. I won’t go to
other things. I hereby move without notice:

   That the Council –


     1) notes that a promising 17-year-old golfer from Soweto, Siphiwe
        Siphayi, is competing in the South African Amateur Strokeplay
        Championship currently under way at the Paarl Valley Country Club;


     2) further notes that Siphiwe won a number of tournaments last year,
        some of which were against older opposition;


     3) acknowledges that smaller sports such as golf should also be
        promoted and encouraged amongst previously disadvantaged South
        Africans and not just bigger sports such as rugby, soccer and
        cricket; and


     4) wishes Siphiwe and all the other young golfers the best of luck.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   CHACE ON TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY BILL

                           (Consideration thereon)

Ms J M MASILO: Deputy Chair, I thought that this statement would be read by
one of our male comrades or members, because they are talking too much
about the termination of pregnancy and are also talking about us as women;
but they have refused.

Hon Deputy Chair, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. The objectives of this
amending Bill are the following: To allow midwives as registered nurses who
have undergone the prescribed training to perform terminations of
pregnancy, since prior to the promulgation of the Bill registered nurses
were not allowed to perform terminations; to do away with the designation
by the Minister on facilities where terminations of pregnancy may take
place, which is the lengthy process; to empower the Member of the Executive
Council of the province responsible for health in that province to approve
those facilities; to allow all public and private facilities that have a 24-
four-hour maternity service to terminate pregnancies of up to and including
12 weeks without seeking the approval of the Member of the Executive
Council concerned; and to empower the Member of the Executive Council
concerned to prescribe by regulation the requirements and conditions
applicable to facilities where termination of pregnancy may take place.

For the purpose of consistency, the Minister must: Approve the regulations
before they are implemented; require the Member of the Executive Council
concerned to report annually on the number of facilities approved by him or
her; and require the relevant heads of the provincial departments to submit
certain prescribed information to the Director-General of Health and make
it an offence for any person to terminate a pregnancy unlawfully or allow
termination of pregnancy at a facility which has not been approved.

This will impact on the lives of women in South Africa, because some women
have resorted to using backyard facilities to terminate unwanted
pregnancies. In some instances, these facilities have caused the death of
some women. No adequate statistics are available in this regard, yet it is
estimated that prior to the promulgation of the Choice of Termination of
Pregnancy Act, many women lost their lives in this way. This amending Bill
provides access to safe facilities of termination.

The amending Bill promises quality health care provisions to women who
choose to terminate their pregnancies from the beginning to the end of the
health service provision continuum. By so doing, it upholds the right of
citizens, including women, to quality health care. Women are now guaranteed
clinical observation following a termination of pregnancy. The Bill further
ensures that women have the right to decide whether or not to have
children, as this right is fundamental to their physical and psychological
wellbeing.

To conclude, the changes made to the principal Act through the introduction
of the amending Bill meet the objectives intended. On the whole, it upholds
the constitutional right of all citizens, including women, to quality
health care. It certainly ensures women’s best health care services by well-
trained medical practitioners, institutions and facilities officially
recognised to meet the stringent requirements of law to perform a
termination of pregnancy. Thank you.
Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Thank you, hon
Masilo. That concludes the debate. I shall now put the question. The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether
all delegation heads are present in the House. Are all delegation heads
present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces the opportunity
to make their declaration of vote if they so wish.

I shall now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall do this in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against or abstain from voting.

Constitution.

I conclude these proceedings, I have an announcement to make, and this
comes from the Chief Whip, that all provincial whips, party whips and
representatives are to proceed to the National Assembly gallery for an in
loco inspection on sitting arrangements for the sate of the nation address.

COMMITTEE REPORTS


   National Assembly and National Council of Provinces

1.    Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Defence (JSCD) on Oversight
    Visit the South African Army Combat Training Centre, Lohatla, Northern
    Cape

    1.      Introduction

               ▪ Mr J Schippers (ANC)
               ▪ Mr J Ramrock ( Committee Secretary)


     3.     Findings.


     General C Gagiano, Chief of the Air Force, assisted by Brigadier
     General C J Delport, Officer Commanding Air Force Base Makhado,
     addressed the delegation on the history of the base. Makhado AFB was
     established in 1987, some 20 years ago. It is the second largest air
     force base in the country, behind Waterkloof AFB. Makhado AFB is a
     combat base that only operates with fighter aircraft and is recognized
     as center of excellence.
     The base plays an important strategic role in the SADC region.
     Neighboring countries like Angola and Zimbabwe participate in fighter
     training exercises conducted at this base. Border patrol operations are
     also performed, and have resulted in the arrest of countless illegal
     immigrants from for instance Zimbabwe.
     Serious breaches on security have been identified with aliens gaining
     access to the premises.
     Force preparations, so that individuals can be combat ready, is also
     done at the base.
     Some of the challenges faced included shortage of staff at the health
     center, scarcity of water and road transport. Discussions are on-going
     with the local authority with the laying of a water pipeline that will
     assist the base.


            3.1 Combat flying school.


            Lt Col D J Van der Linde, Officer Commanding Combat Flying
            School, addressed the delegation on the function of the school.
            The phasing out of the Cheetah training aircraft in 2005 has
            created a problem concerning combat training. Students are
            trained on the Cheetah in preparation for flying the recently
            acquired Gripen combat aircraft. It takes about 2 ½ years to
            complete training to fly the Gripen. The school presently has
            106 students. The most senior black within the Air Force is a
            major, who joined in 1994. All the instructors are white, while
            there are 45 black and 55 white technicians that have been
            trained, 5 of these are women. The demographics are slowly
            being corrected, but much work still needs to be done. The
            problem related to the small seat in the Hawk aircraft is being
            addressed to try and accommodate all students. Almost 250
            technicians resigned from the Air Force last year (2006), with
            most joining the private sector. Language proficiency, lack of
            computer skills and the type of psychometric testing done was
            identified as some of the major challenges faced by previous
            disadvantaged candidates who wanted to join the Air Force.
            The Air Force is under- funded and needs, at least, R1.2
            billion to be used on infrastructure. Interaction to address
            the budget challenge is currently taking place with DENEL.
            3.2 Air Servicing Unit.


            Lt Col D J Blom, Officer Commanding 3 Air Servicing Unit (ASU),
            addressed the Delegation on the role and functions of the Unit.
            One of the main aims of the Unit is to be the benchmark for
            aircraft maintenance in the SAAF. Clients include visiting
            squadrons from other countries. On avionics the Unit looks at
            fault isolation, fault verification, performance verification
            and repair. Some of the challenges facing the Unit include the
            sequence of construction of Gripen facilities vs Cheetah/Hawk
            support, the Cheetah phase-out period, scarcity of resources
            and the difficulty in retaining skilled staff.


            3.3 Tour of the Base.


            The Delegation was taken on a tour of the base which included
            visiting the Centralised Training Centre, the Operational
            Flight Trainer and the 2 Squadron.    Lt Col D Dormehl, Officer
            Commanding 2 Squadron, briefed the Delegation on the functions
            of the Squadron.
            Members observed attempts on integration but noted that
            transformation remains a challenge.


  4.  Conclusion.


   The Delegation commended the good work done at the Base and will continue
   to monitor progress that had been made to some of the challenges faced by
   the Base. The Committee also requested that the Inspector General ensures
   that problems that were identified at the Base are corrected.
