                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that
on the next sitting day of the House I shall move:

  That the House debates the recent appointment of the Speaker of the
  National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, as Chairperson of both the ANC and the
  ANC political committee, and the effect this will have on her ability to
  act with the impartiality that is required of the Speaker of Parliament.

[Interjections.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Hon Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP, I give notice that I
shall move:

  That the House –

     1) calls on the Minister of Health to lobby at the United Nations for
        the World Health Organisation to recover its independence from the
        International Atomic Energy Agency, especially in the area of
        ionising radiation;

     2) notes that, in the past, the WHO has been paralysed in its struggle
        against passive smoking because it has been infiltrated by the
        tobacco lobby;

     3) in the same way, particularly in threats to health from ionising
        radiation, the WHO is paralysed by the nuclear body which is
        incomparably more powerful;

     4) is horrified by the hundreds of studies in the Ukraine, Belarus and
        the Russian Federation which have established that there has been a
        significant rise in all types of cancer, causing thousands of
        deaths, an increase in infant mortality, spontaneous abortions,
        deformities and genetic anomalies ...
The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on a point of
order ...

The SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Deputy Chief Whip?

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, the convention
has arisen here, and I think it is generally respected by all parties, that
when we give notice of a motion, it is a brief, succinct statement on the
topic that we want to have debated. This is actually an abuse of that
process – to smuggle in a motion or to actually make an extra statement.
Could we appeal that we don’t do that?

The SPEAKER: Hon Dudley, please can you rethink your statement; it sounds
more like a statement actually.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Calling on the House?

The SPEAKER: Hon Dudley, just go and look at reformulating and resubmitting
at the right time through the right mechanism.

Mr D V BLOEM: Speaker, I am rising on a point of order on the first
statement by the Chief Whip of the Opposition.

Speaker, if there is anything wrong in you, as a member of the ANC, being
elected by the ANC to be ...
The SPEAKER: Hon Bloem, you are now debating the issue. I really don’t want
...

Mr D V BLOEM: I think it’s out of order, Chairperson. [Laughter.]

Mr W P DOMAN: Thank you, Speaker. I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


     1) debates the unrest in a number of municipalities across the country
        due to these municipalities’ failure to deliver basic services; and


     2) considers possible solutions to the problem.


Mr G G BOINAMO: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:

  That the House -


  (1) debates the failure of the Department of Education to provide proper
        infrastructure to schools across the country, in light of the recent
        tragedy that occurred at the Hlalanikahle Primary School in
        Mpumalanga, at which eight learners fell into a pit toilet in the
        first week of the school term and two died instantly; and


  (2) debates possible solutions to this problem.

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move, on
behalf of the DA:

   That the House debates the current situation in the Department of Home
   Affairs and the work of the strategic intervention team designed to turn
   around the department.

           LAUREUS WORLD TEAM OF THE YEAR 2008 AWARD TO SPRINGBOKS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

   That the House -

     1) notes that on Monday, 18 February 2008, in St Petersburg, our
        national rugby team, the Springboks, won the 2008 Laureus World Team
        of the Year Award;


     2) further notes that our national rugby team won this award because of
        their brilliant performance in winning the 2007 Rugby World Cup and
        going through the tournament unbeaten;


     3) recalls that the Laureus World Sports Award is the only global
        sports award honouring the best sports women and men across all
        sports codes each year; and


     4) congratulates the Springboks on winning the 2008 Laureus World Team
        of the Year Award.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Agreed to.

                INTERNATIONAL MOTHER LANGUAGE DAY 21 FEBRUARY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


   That the House -

     1) notes that today, 21 February, the world is celebrating
        International Mother Language Day;
     2) further notes that International Mother Language Day was proclaimed
        by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational,
        Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in November 1999 and
        that this international day has been observed every year since
        February 2000 to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and
        multilingualism;


     3) recognises that languages are the most powerful instruments of
        preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage and
        that all moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will
        serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual
        education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and
        cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity
        based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue;


     4) believes that language keeps traditions alive, inspires knowledge
        and respect about our past and the planet on which we live, and it
        links communities across borders and beyond time;


     5) recalls that primary among the objectives of building an equal and
        just society should be our collective determination to promote and
        celebrate our multiculturalism, which gives our country its unique
        identity, and


     6) commends the work done by Unesco in raising awareness and deepening
        the understanding of the importance of language.


I thank you.

Agreed to.

                       CONDOLENCES TO FAMILY OF TEBOGO

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnu E T XOLO (ANC):  UKhongolose  uthanda  ukuzwakalisa  ukudabuka  okukhulu
akwedlulisela emndenini wakwaNdlovu ngokwedlula  emhlabeni  kwendodana  yawo
uTeboho  obaziwa  kakhulu  kubathandi  bomculo  wekwaito  ngokuthi   uZombo.
UTeboho ube nomnikelo omkhulu awenzile ukukhulisa umculo wekwaito waze  waba
nokwamukeleka ezweni.

Kwathi ekupheleni  kweminyaka  yenkulungwane  namakhulu  ayisishiyagalolunye
namashumi ayisishiyagalolunye,  ikhono  emculweni  wekwaito  lase  liphezulu
kakhulu. UTeboho ungomunye wabantu abasha baseNingizimu Afrika  owayenekhono
nesiphiwo  okwathi  umculo  wakhe  waba  nomnikelo  omkhulu  ekuhlanganiseni
izinhlanga ezahlukeneyo kwezomculo, ubuciko ezweni lethu.

Ngalesi sikhathi wayecula enkundleni  ebambisene  no-Arthur  Mafokate  kanye
neqembu elalibizwa ngokuthiyi-Abashante. Ukufa kube yisela elebe leli  qhawe
ebelinekhono legolide futhi kwavula  isikhala  esikhulu  kubathandi  bomculo
wekwaito.  Sithi  emndenini  wakhe   kanye   nabathandi   bomculo   wekwaito
akwehlanga   lungehli,   balale   ngenxeba.   Sengathi   umhpefumulo   wakhe
ungamukeleka  ngokuthula  emhlabathini  wasebaphumula.  Ngiyabonga  Somlomo.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu member’s statement follows.)

[Mr E T XOLO (ANC): The ANC would like to extend its heartfelt condolences
to the Ndlovu family on the passing of their son, Tebogo, who was
affectionately known as “Zombo” to Kwaito music fans. Tebogo made a huge
contribution to the growth of Kwaito music until it was recognised in the
country.

By the end of the 1990s, the talent in Kwaito music was of a very high
standard. Tebogo was one of the youth of South Africa who had a gift and
talent, and his music made a huge contribution in uniting different races
in music and arts in our country.

At that time, he was singing as a back up singer for Arthur Mafokate and
the Abashante band. Death is a thief which has deprived us of this hero who
had a golden talent and has opened a huge gap amongst Kwaito music fans. We
convey our condolences to his family and Kwaito music fans. May his soul
rest in peace in Heaven. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

             ANC WITHDRAWS CHANCELLOR HOUSE FROM HITACHI AFRICA
                            (Member’s Statement)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION (DA): Madam Speaker, the assurances given
to Parliament this week by Eskom’s CEO Jacob Maroga and Public Enterprises
Minister Alec Erwin about the probity of ANC Chancellor House’s estimated
R5,8 billion stake in the construction of two new Eskom power stations
should be of little comfort to the South African taxpayer.

The fact remains that this deal constitutes a glaring conflict of interest
which, in the interests of good corporate governance, should never have
been allowed to go ahead, especially given that the Chairman of Eskom,
Valli Moosa, is also a member of the ANC’s fund-raising committee.

The impression of wrongdoing is further underscored by the failure to put
the second of these deals out to tender. This raises serious questions
about whether due diligence and sound corporate governance procedures were
circumvented to benefit the ruling party. The ANC’s subsequent decision to
withdraw from these multibillion-rand contracts with Eskom does not absolve
the ruling party of any wrongdoing either. Given that their stake is worth
approximately R5,8 billion, withdrawing Chancellor House now from Hitachi
Africa could quite simply be viewed as the ANC cashing in early and seeing
the party benefit to the tune of hundreds of millions of rands.

The only way for the ANC to dispel the perception of any kind of wrongdoing
is for it to come clean on the exact amount it will benefit from
disinvesting from these deals, as well as giving the assurances that any
profits made will be ploughed back into South Africa in the form of
charitable donations. I thank you.

   CALL FOR HEALTH PRACTITIONERS TO EMBARK ON COLLECTIVE COURSE OF ACTION

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs S A SEATON (IFP): Madam Speaker, the appalling conditions of our public
health care facilities are sufficient cause to drive health practitioners
away from the public sector.

However, the IFP believes that “packing for Perth” has its own set of
problems and is not the solution. We urge the medical practitioners to make
a difference in South Africa with a collective, concerted course of action.
Make more use of your collective voice before resorting to your legs.
Registered practitioners and academics should petition the Minister; lobby
MPs; align themselves with opposition parties that support freedom of
choice; participate in local community forums; hold hospital managers,
medical boards and health councils and representatives accountable, and not
accept the current situation with politically correct silence.
If the disenchanted health professionals use legal mechanisms of protest,
and do so loudly and energetically, they could surprise themselves at the
scope for a positive protest in South Africa. Thank you.

                         ASSAULT ON NWABISA NGCUKANA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms M V MERUTI (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC expresses its shock and outrage
at the sexual harassment and assault of Nwabisa Ngcukana who had her
clothes allegedly torn off by taxi drivers at the Noord Street taxi rank in
Johannesburg.

Nwabisa reportedly had her private parts groped, had alcohol poured on her
head and was called names for wearing a miniskirt in public. The ANC wishes
to remind those involved in this brutal attack that the Constitution and
our laws criminalise this type of behaviour and entrench the right to both
gender equality, freedom and security of the person. This disgraceful
episode deserves the condemnation of all South Africans.

We call on the SA Police Service to work tirelessly to bring the culprits
to book. We believe that Nwabisa needs a lot of support in pressing
criminal charges against her attackers and in laying a claim for damages
against them. We call upon all the people, including taxi associations, to
fight against gender-based violence. I thank you, Madam. [Applause.]

             LATEST DEVELOPMENTS WITH REGARD TO CASE OF FOUR MEN
                            CHARGED WITH ROBBERY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Nk N C NKABINDE (UDM): Somlomo namalungu ale Ndlu ahloniphekileyo, i-UDM
iqaphela ngokucikeka izehlo zakamuva ecaleni lamadoda amane. Amanye awo
amalungu amaphoyisa asolwa ngokuntshontsha izigidigidi zamakhulu zamarandi
esisefeni semali samaphoyisa. Amalungu ale Ndlu azokhumbula ukuthi
lantshontshwa kanjani ikhulu lezigidigidi zamarandi esikhumulweni
sezindiza, i-O R Tambo, kwathi kamuva ingxenye yayo yatholakala. Yaphinde
yantshontshwa futhi esisefeni semali samaphoyisa eMpumalanga Randi.

Isimo salobu busela ngokungangabazeki sashiya kunokungqubuzana
nokungathembani phakathi kwamalungu amaphoyisa. Inani elingatheni labasolwa
laboshwa nesamba semali kulona. Nokho ingxenye enkulu yale mali
ayikakatholakali. Abanye babasolwa baphenduka ofakazi benkantolo.
Okudabukisayo ukuthi ofakazi ngamunye ngamunye bayabulawa ukuze icala
lingakwazi ukuqhutshwa.

Lokhu kuthumela umyalezo okungeyiwo wokuthi uma unemali eningi,
ungayisebenzisa ukuvimbela ukusebenza kwengalo yomthetho. Kubonakala
sengathi kuzogcina kusetshenziswa imali yabakhokhi bentela ukubuyisa le
mali eyantshontshwayo. Leli cala likhombisa ngokusobala ukuthi kunesidingo
sophiko oluzimele olulwa nobelelesi, njenge-Scorpions olunamandla
nokuzimisela ekubopheni izihlakaniphi nezigilamkhuba ezisebenzisa
izikhundla zazo eziphezulu emphakathini ukuqhwaga nokubulala uma zifuna.
Ngiyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu member’s statement follows.)

[Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): Madam Speaker, hon members of this House, the UDM
notes with disgust what has happened lately in the case of four men. Some
of them are members of the Police Service who are alleged to have stolen
millions of rands from police safes. Members of this House will remember
how R100 million was stolen from O R Tambo International Airport, and at a
later stage, part of that money was recovered. Yet again, another amount of
money was stolen from the police safe in the East Rand.

Theft of this nature has really created conflict and mistrust amongst the
members of the Police Service. A small group of suspects were arrested for
being found in possession of cash. However, the larger part of this cash
has not yet been recovered. Some of the suspects turned state witnesses.
What saddens usthe most is that witnesses are murdered one by one so that
the case cannot proceed.

This sends a wrong message which says that if you have a lot of money, you
can use it to prevent the rule of law. It looks as if taxpayers’ money will
be used to pay back the stolen money. This case clearly shows that there is
a need for an independent unit to fight crime, such as the Scorpions, with
power and determination to arrest smart criminals who use their high
positions in communities to rob and kill as they wish. Thank you.]

  MINISTER SHOULD REPORT BACK TO PARLIAMENT ON VAN ZYL SLABBERT COMMISSION
                                   REPORT

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs P DE LILLE (ID): Madam Speaker, on 7 August 2006 I asked the Minister
of Home Affairs whether the report of the Van Zyl Slabbert commission on
the South African electoral system had been evaluated, whether the
government had accepted the recommendations contained in the report, and
whether the proposed new electoral system would be put in place by 2009.
This was her response, and I quote: “Yes, indeed, government received the
report of the Van Zyl Slabbert commission and noted its contents on 5 March
2003.”

As members may recall, Cabinet instructed the Minister of Home Affairs to
distribute the document to the media and the public, and this was done.
Furthermore, it was agreed that the current government, constituted on the
basis of the 2004 elections ... [Interjections.]

The Minister says now that the matter has been raised in the House and that
“I will, as the Minister present, present it to Cabinet for further
consideration and will certainly report back to Parliament at an
appropriate time.”

On 27 February 2007, I repeated the question, and the Minister said:


  The general thrust of what I said was that the matter will be presented
  to Cabinet for further consideration, and a report-back will be given to
  this House at an appropriate time.

And she said that it was premature for me to ask another question. I’ve
submitted another question today, 21 February 2008, and I’m making a call
on the Minister to please respect Parliament. If she promised that she
would come back to us, why is it taking almost more than two years? The
report was done in 2003, and it is now 2008. Thank you.

     PLANS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AFRICAN COMMAND ON AFRICAN SOIL REJECTED

                            (Member’s Statement)

Adv Z L MADASA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC would like to reiterate its
objection to the ongoing preparations by the US government to establish
what they call “an African command” on the African continent, which we
believe is a euphemism for stationing military bases in Africa.

The ANC knows that SADC has formally rejected the establishment of Africom
on the continent. The ANC further notes that the AU is in the process of
establishing regional standby forces in order to react rapidly to any
regional conflict in Africa, and that any foreign assistance with peace in
Africa should be towards the strengthening of the existing standby forces.

The ANC’s 52nd conference in Polokwane reiterated that Africa requires a
united continent, capable of engaging other powerful nations and in line
with the ANC’s vision of building a better Africa.

The ANC calls upon the AU member states, the parliaments of Africa and
civil society to unite in their resistance to the establishment of Africom
on the continent. Thank you. [Applause.]

                    QUIET DIPLOMACY APPROACH NOT WORKING

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M V NGEMA (Nadeco): Madam Speaker:

   A state is not a mere society, having a common place, established for the
   prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange ... Political
   society exists for the sake of noble actions, and not mere companionship.

As I read this quotation from the philosopher and Greek critic Aristotle, I
found it very descriptive and applicable to the attitude at times portrayed
by the ruling party in the manner in which it conducts some of our national
affairs.

We, as Nadeco, believe that it is crucial for every member of the House to
constantly revisit the significance of their role and the people we
represent. As the people of Zimbabwe head to the polling stations next
month, and as hundreds of Zimbabweans continue to stream across the borders
of this country, fleeing political instability and seeking food, shelter,
employment and security, this government needs to ask itself how long it
will continue to maintain quiet diplomacy.

This country is a beacon of hope for the rest of the African continent.
Africa looks upon South Africa to maintain the momentum of this continent,
breaking the shackles of poverty and ensuring political stability and
economic development. I thank you.

                        CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr L M GREEN (FD): Madam Speaker, since 1994, a number of political parties
with Christian principles have either been elected to Parliament or exist
as small entities around the country. In recent months, however, the need
has arisen to establish within society a more cohesive Christian democratic
movement aimed at creating a political platform with the objective of
electing to Parliament members schooled in Christian democratic values.

The Christian Democratic Alliance has emerged as such a vehicle. The CDA
aims to promote a political forum by translating moral and ethical
standards based on Christian values to inform our political thought, which
principally aims to define power as “delegated authority to those governing
over the nation” whilst also respecting the interdependent relationship of
other forms of authority, such as family, civil society, religious
institutions and the individual.

Christian democracy is a political philosophy that, together with liberal,
conservative, Marxist or socialist ideologies, competes for political
space. Christian democracy should not be confused with church doctrine or
selective Biblical interpretations, since histories of countries worldwide,
including our own, are replete with examples which used religion to justify
the abuse of power.

It is the intention of the CDA to build a broad alliance to align all like-
minded parties at national, provincial and local levels who share these
common values, and the CDA ... [Time expired.]

   COLLUSIVE TENDERING AND MARKET ALLOCATION BY SOME PHACEUTICAL COMPANIES

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs S V KALYAN (DA): Madam Speaker, according to the Competition
Commission, Adcock Ingram, Dismed and Thusanong Health Care were engaged in
collusive tendering and market allocation. These actions are in
contravention of section 4 of the Competition Act.

This type of conduct is specifically designed to avoid competition between
the colluding firms and the manipulation of prices for pharmaceutical and
hospital products. Further, the colluding firms agreed among themselves who
would win the tenders. They also agreed, or arranged between themselves,
that the winning firms would cede portions of the tender to one of their
colluding partners. The investigation found that this illegitimate conduct
came to the attention of several board members of Tiger Brands, but no
action was taken.

Health care costs are escalating and collusive behaviour of such a nature
is undoubtedly one of the contributing factors to higher prices in health
care markets. Such behaviour is further indicative of the existence of a
drug cartel and is most reprehensible.

The DA calls for the full arm of the law to punish this collusive behaviour
and for the report to be made public.
                 FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN EASTERN CAPE EDUCATION

                            (Member’s Statement)

Nksz M V MAKHANE (ANC): Somlomo, umbutho wesizwe i-ANC, wenza
isibhambathiso nabantu sokuba, mhla sifumana inkululeko yethu kweli lizwe,
imfundo iya kuba simahla, ibe sisinyanzelo, ivuleleke kuye wonke umntwana,
singajonganga bala lamntwana. Imfundo enomsila iya kuthi ixhaswe
ngurhulumente ... (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Ms M V MAKHANE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC, made a promise to the people
that when we gained our freedom in this country, education would be free,
compulsory and open to all, irrespective of their colour. Higher education
would be subsidized by government ...]

The SPEAKER: Could we have sound, please?

Nksz M V MAKHANE (ANC): Urhulumente wephondo leMpuma Koloni ubekele bucala
imali eqikelelwa kwizigidi zeerandi ezingama-85. Le mali ibekelwe
ukuncedisana nabafundi abadinga inkxaso-mali yokufunda.

Ukusukela kunyaka ka-2002, urhulumente waseMpuma Koloni okhokelwa yi-ANC
sele encede abafundi abangama-900 ngenkxaso-mali. Inxalenye yaba bafundi,
ekugqibeni kwayo izifundo zayo, iye yaqeshwa ngurhulumente wephondo.
Urhulumente okhokelwa ngumbutho wesizwe i-ANC uya kuthi gqolo ngokuphuhlisa
izakhono zolutsha ukuze lukwazi ukuthabatha inxaxheba kuqoqosho lwelizwe.
Ukhuthaza ulutsha ukuba luziqeshe. Enkosi. (Translation of isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms M V MAKHANE (ANC): The Eastern Cape provincial government has put aside
approximately R85 million. This money is allocated to support students who
need bursaries.

Since 2002, the Eastern Cape government, led by the ANC, has helped 900
students with bursaries. After completing their studies, some of the
students were employed by the provincial government. The government, led by
the national organisation, the ANC, will continue developing the skills of
the youth so as to enable them to participate in the country’s economy. It
encourages them to engage in self-employment. Thank you.]

                   WARNINGS OF LOOMING WATER CRISIS IN SA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M W SIBUYANA (IFP): Madam Speaker, the current energy crisis, and the
events which led to the occurrence of this dire situation, should serve as
a warning to government and its various entities about the importance of
proper planning and forecasting.

We must learn from the mistakes that led to the energy crisis and make sure
that they are not repeated. It is with this in mind that the IFP urges
government and the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to heed the
warnings of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which has warned of a looming
water crisis in South Africa.

They mentioned many areas of concern, including the need for the proper
protection of water catchments as well as the fact that 98% of available
water resources are already fully utilised and that the country could run
out of water by 2025.

There have been a few incidents of concern recently such as the radioactive
pollutants in Wonderfonteinspruit, west of Johannesburg, and the sewerage
leak into the Umhlatuzana River which killed many fish in Durban harbour.
While it is important not ... [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

            SISTER ETHEL CONGRATULATED ON HER WORK IN MISSIONVALE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs J CHALMERS (ANC): Madam Speaker, Missionvale is situated in Nelson
Mandela Bay and has a large population, 80% of which are unemployed.

Twenty years ago, Sister Ethel, an Irish missionary, started her missionary
work under a tree in the area. Since then, Sister Ethel, in collaboration
with the community and the municipality, has established a community
clinic, a crèche, and a food garden and care centre for vulnerable women
and children.

Last year she took the initiative to start the construction of a hospice
centre that caters for terminally ill patients in the area. She has
recruited 200 volunteers from her home country - County Clare, Ireland - to
build a large hospice in record time and share their expertise with locals
at the same time. A final batch of volunteers arrived last weekend to
finish the project. As a result, hundreds of local unemployed women and
children were taught skills in brickwork, carpentry and plumbing. Much of
the support she has received in building her care centre over the years has
come from Ireland. Her centre has been visited by the Queen of England, the
late Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela and many other leaders.

Sister Ethel was one of the eminent persons invited to attend this year’s
opening of Parliament and, in his state of the nation address, President
Mbeki thanked Sister Ethel for her efforts.

The ANC congratulates Sister Ethel for her efforts as well as her team of
volunteers on improving the lives of the people in Missionvale and the
practical efforts she has undertaken in the building of a caring society.

             ISSUES AROUND HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M WATERS (DA): Madam Speaker, the shortage of doctors and nurses is
crippling health care in South Africa. Mpumalanga, for example, has a 92%
shortfall in the number of doctors it needs. Yet this government continues
to treat health workers with complete contempt and disrespect. For example,
Dr Colin Pfaff was recently charged with misconduct because he tried to do
the best for his patients by offering them the best treatment he could. I
am glad to say the protests from the DA, doctors’ associations and civil
society have resulted in the charges now being dropped.

Newly qualified nurses are still in a state of confusion because the
national Health department has not yet got around to setting the date for
the commencement of their community service – and we are now going towards
the end of February. This morning the DA received a plea for help from a
community service dentist in the Eastern Cape who began work on 1 January
and has still not been paid.

It is high time that the government showed its commitment to improving
health care services in this country by changing its attitude towards
health workers.

The DA calls on the Minister of Health, firstly, to request MECs for health
not to act against doctors implementing dual-therapy treatment regimes;
secondly, to postpone the implementation of community service for nurses
until next year in order to put a stop to the uncertainty; and, thirdly,
investigate the failure of some provincial governments to pay community
service professionals. I thank you.

       PASSING AWAY OF VETERAN ACTRESS AND BUSINESSWOMAN ASHLEY CALLIE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr H P MALULEKA (ANC): Madam Speaker, death has again robbed the nation of
one of its inspiring talents.

The ANC conveys its condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of
Ashley Callie. Ashley will always be remembered by many South Africans for
the role she played in the television industry. Ashley was a well-loved
South African actress and businesswoman best known for her role as Leone
Haines in SABC3’s Isidingo.

Miss Callie made a significant contribution to laying a solid foundation in
the redefinition of “Proudly South African” television content. She acted
well in her role to not only bear testimony to the innate talent in many of
our young people but to pave the way for a television audience to recognise
and accept a nonracial society. Her role as an actress contributed greatly
to social cohesion as well as in building a nonracial democratic South
Africa.

Ashley won the award for Best Actress in a Soapie at the inaugural Safta
Awards – the SA Film and Television Academy Awards - which were held at
Gallagher Estate in Johannesburg on 28 October 2006. May her soul rest in
peace. [Applause.]

 COLLUSIVE TENDERING AND MARKET ALLOCATION BY SOME PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, on the matter of
collusion or collusive behaviour that the hon member of the DA referred to,
I’d like to draw attention to recent developments.

Members would recognise that, in recent months, we have seen increased
activity by our competition authorities in the areas of steel, bread, milk,
banks and also the case referred to by the hon member.

We have also, in the recent past, conducted a review of our competition
legislation in which we looked at the experience of having and applying the
new legislation and the new institutions.

Generally, the view is that we do need to strengthen the law in certain
respects and the institutions. As a result, this is one of the issues that
we are going to be bringing to Parliament - to consider amendments to the
competition legislation this year. This is generally in line with the
stance of the government and the stance of the ANC in that we do need to
promote the competitive environment in South Africa in a way that enables
more and more players to come into the market and participate.

Also, we have a strong view regarding the pricing behaviour of particularly
monopoly companies, and practices such as import parity pricing. We are
also introducing legislation to strengthen consumer protection, and the
Credit Act is one example of this.

So these things are all reflective of the general stance of the government
and the ANC towards these matters. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.
[Applause.]

                         ASSAULT ON NWABISA NGCUKANA

                            (Minister’s Response)


The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Madam Speaker, I
am responding to the statement made by the hon Meruti regarding a sad
incident that happened in Gauteng. Sadly, this incident has happened for
the second time in which women are told what to wear.

The last incident happened in KwaZulu-Natal where a woman was forbidden to
wear pants. She was dragged and beaten up and told not to come near the
hostels wearing pants.

I feel greatly saddened by the fact that these incidents are happening in
this day and age, but I think we also need to change our strategy in
tackling this scourge in our country. We need to hear – vocally - men
condemning these sexist acts against women and children. We need to hear
more men coming out in condemnation of these incidents. [Applause.]

Also, our education should not only happen when men are grown-ups. It must
start in our homes, where it must be said that a boy is no better than a
girl-child. Then this education must continue in our schools.

What I want to emphasise is that we should all jointly stand up as South
Africans citizens, men and women, and condemn these acts and these sexist
acts. Thank you. [Applause.]

             ISSUES AROUND HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SOUTH AFRICA
 COLLUSIVE TENDERING AND MARKET ALLOCATION BY SOME PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

                           (Minister’s Responses)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, you will understand that I’ve got
quite a few responses to make.

The first response will be on what I would term the misdirected collective
force in the medical fraternity that’s been called for. I think the hon
member must remember that medical practitioners do take an oath in which
they pledge to protect patients and humanity.

It is therefore, I think, irresponsible for the member to mobilise the
Pfaff fraternity to violate the rights of the patients. At the same time, I
call upon him to encourage the patients to take care of their health. I
think that’s what the hon member should do.

The second issue I would like to comment on is about the pharmacist who has
not been paid since January. Well, I regret this if this has happened, but
I don’t think I can be sent to collectively tell all the provinces that
they haven’t paid pharmacists.

I think what the member should have done, as he always does, is to write a
letter to me - sometimes he writes very impolite letters, I must say – to
say that a particular province didn’t do this and, Minister, could you
please investigate. I will do that, so I await your letter to do so. That
would be very helpful. Nevertheless, thank you very much for having brought
this to our attention. I will also bring up matters of such a nature at our
meeting with the MECs. But it is not helpful just to refer collectively to
provinces in this House, as I can’t then act immediately.

The third issue is about dual therapy. I think the member wrote to me and I
answered him. I don’t know what he seeks to do now. He knows the
circumstances around which that occurred. The regulations were not in place
yet. The province had not adopted the policy and those guidelines.

Surely, in this country we can’t have chaos with everybody just doing what
they want to do? Tomorrow we’ll find that patients are allowed to commit
suicide, to do all manner of things just because a particular doctor wants
to do so. I think it would be absolutely irresponsible.

But I would like to announce to this House that we have now developed the
policy and guidelines on dual therapy. They are on the website, and I
invite all of you to read the foreword by the Minister, because I think it
tells a story.

The third issue is about community service and that we must either stop it,
postpone it or, indeed, scrap it, because we were irresponsible not to
issue a register. Let me just say that the regulations are ready and they
will be implemented retrospectively. It would be irresponsible indeed to
prolong or interrupt community service for the nurses. They require it so
that they can provide us with the quality service we require of them. We
will indeed implement the regulations retrospectively.

In any case, it’s not as though this House did not know. It is not as if
the whole nation didn’t know that there was going to be community service.
This had been announced and it was postponed because certain things had not
been done but, ultimately, we all accepted in this House, when I made the
statement, that indeed community service was going to start in January. It
is going to continue, and, as I say, the regulations are ready.

The third issue is also about ...

The SPEAKER: That’s the fifth one actually, Minister.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Yes, it is indeed, Madam Speaker. I did say there
were five and I have addressed almost all.

The last issue is about the pharmaceutical companies and how they colluded
and fixed medicine prices. In this regard I’d like to thank the hon member
for her comment. We feel exactly the same, because, indeed, this impacts on
the affordability and accessibility of medicines. I hope that the hon
member will indeed wholeheartedly support the Department of Health as we
seek to amend the National Health Act in terms of the escalating health
costs in the country. I am relying on his support so that there won’t be
any opposition to that amendment. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, some of
the statements seem to be notices of motion. I’m not sure whether the
Minister could respond to the opportune way in which the hon Green
announced the formation of a party that I’m sure he will jump to, some time
soon. So, I wasn’t quite sure what the executive was supposed to do with
that particular statement, and one or two others.

On the matters related to education ...

[... I will start off by saying that today is International Mother Language
Day, and therefore, I will speak in Setswana. I would like to thank the
Eastern Cape province for helping our children to register in universities
and universities of technology. This is something that all provinces should
do. We all know that the money that we have to pay for our children in
universities and universities of technology is sometimes a little.

Minister Manuel told us that we are going to increase bursary scheme funds
to enable South African children to register in universities and
universities of technology. We now ask our children that when they get to
the university, they should not vandalise lecture halls, prevent other
students from attending lectures, break windows and anything that might not
be in line with education in the university.

South Africa has funds available to assist destitute students whose parents
are unemployed and cannot afford to pay fees in universities and
universities of technology. Going around telling South African children
that if you commit crimes you will be admitted in a university even if you
do not have the money is to deceive them. We appeal to you not to do that.
Our universities in South Africa belong to all of us. Let us protect them!

Secondly, what I would like to talk about is something we said we should
keep a close eye on - Africom; we should completely not allow it in Africa.
I tend to agree with those who said so.

Thirdly, I am pleased to hear Mrs Tshabalala-Msimang saying that our people
should buy medication at an affordable price. She’s been saying this for
quite some time and I am glad that today even the DA agrees with her. They
have realised that there are some who are exploiting consumers by fixing
the prices of medication in pharmacies. The Minister has been talking about
this for quite some time. We do not like what they are doing and I trust
that we will demonstrate this on their companies’ doorsteps. They are
siphoning money from patients in South Africa.]

Mandigqibezele, Mam’uSomlomo, ngokuthi sibulela kakhulu ngomsebenzi omhle

umsebenzi kaSista Ethel ngumsebenzi omhle kakhulu.

Sivumelana nenkokeli yethu ukuba ngokwenene masimbulele uSista Ethel

(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I must conclude, Madam Speaker, by saying we are very grateful for the
good work that Sister Ethel is doing in Missionvale. Once, while on a
flight, I met an old man who had been to Robben Island, who came to me and
said that I must help Sister Ethel to enable her to build classrooms and
pay the teachers. I promised to visit Missionvale to see how we, from
education, can help. And, Sister Ethel’s work is very good.

We agree with our leader that, really, we must thank Sister Ethel for the
good work that she does in Missionvale. I thank you, Madam Speaker.]

                           PROPOSED SCHOOL PLEDGE

                    (Statement by Minister of Education)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to make a statement on the proposal that there should be a
national schools’ pledge that has a daily and visible role in all our
schools, and that it be shaped in a manner that serves to expand the
curriculum focus on values, while supporting nation-building and collective
and individual commitment to the pursuit of positive values and a shared
community resolve to do our best for ourselves, our school, our community
and our country.
The pledge reads as follows:

  We, the youth of South Africa, recognising the injustices of our past,
  honour those who suffered and sacrificed for justice and freedom. We will
  respect and protect the dignity of each person and stand up for justice.
  We sincerely declare that we shall uphold the rights and values of our
  Constitution and promise to act in accordance with the duties and
  responsibilities that flow from these rights. !Ke e: /xarra keo. Nkosi
  Sikelel’ i-Afrika!

There have been vigorous - energising in some parts, offensive in others -
encouraging and thought-provoking responses to this proposal.

I must immediately apologise to the public of South Africa for having
apparently created the impression that the proposal would not be up for
debate. Some commentators appear to believe that schools have already been
directed to implement this schools’ pledge.

What has been done is to indicate that we believe that there should be a
schools’ pledge. I continue to believe so, and I continue to believe that
teachers should assist the learners to learn to recite a schools’ pledge.
Once the public comment phase has ended, we will consider the proposals and
then provide a schools’ pledge to all our schools.

These reactions, which have ranged, as I’ve said, from strong support,
lukewarm reception, hostile, aggressive and offensive have been
interesting. On the side of some strong support, we had an interesting
editorial in the Cape Times yesterday, and if I might quote it:

  The proposal ...

I repeat –

  The proposal to introduce a pledge in schools has generated much sound
  and fury and very little real debate. This is difficult to understand. At
  this stage, the pledge suggested by Education Minister Naledi Pandor is
  just that, a suggestion. The Cassandras, who say this is simply an
  attempt to impose ANC propaganda on children, clearly have not given the
  issue much thought.

This is not me; it’s the editorial in the Cape Times –

  After all, what can be wrong with expressing our unity as a nation, our
  hopes for the future of our country, and an acknowledgement of the
  history that informs our society? This is what we - and people throughout
  the world - do every time the national anthem is sung. In the United
  States, the school day starts with the pledge of allegiance.

  So, we should step back and apply some thought. If the concept of the
  pledge is not intrinsically flawed - which it is not - then how should we
  go about constructing it? The idea that the pledge should be linked with
  school work on the duties and obligations which flow from the rights
  enshrined in the Constitution is a good place to start. If it could
  encapsulate core values that inform a detailed examination of the moral
  challenges children will face - and continue to face throughout their
  lives - so much the better.


  This is not to suggest there is some kind of blueprint for life, but
  rather that children must be helped to work their way through the complex
  issues that define living. The Constitution provides a useful template
  for how the debate about the pledge and any ethics syllabus might be
  constructed. The Constitution is, above all else, a rigorously
  antipartisan document. It is inclusive and egalitarian. And it is a
  living work, requiring constant thought and debate.

This captures the aim of the pledge as well as the bill of responsibilities
that we’ve published.

Mr Mandela once said, while serving as President of the ANC and even as
President of our country, “Never, never and never again shall it be that
this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by
another.”


If this pledge plays a small role reinforcing this, then it will have been
a success.

It seems that for the lukewarm respondents, the notion of a pledge has
odious memories of authoritarian governments that impose their values on a
society. Some have even commented that the pledge reminds them of the
apartheid state’s imposition of various rituals.

I remind hon members that our country is a democratic state; a new, young
democracy - one being built and shaped by all of us, from the roots
upwards. Our intention is to support young people to understand the values
we have all agreed are necessary at the earliest possible stage. This is a
simple addition to the current national curriculum, which is underpinned by
the core values elaborated on in our Constitution.

Commentators are right, I believe, that mere recitation would not be
enough, hence the importance of the link that we would have to establish to
this values-based curriculum practice.

The hostile and aggressive respondents seem, collectively, to be against
the second line in the pledge that refers to recognising our past. They say
that this is the ANC forcing guilt onto their children. Since all learners
will have this pledge in their schools, I do not understand this fear. This
may be an admission of guilt by the adults who are so fearful of that one
sentence in the proposed pledge.

I agree with them that we should not burden children with the sins of their
parents, but I disagree that learners should be denied knowledge of all our
past. Erasing memory of past injustice erases the new endeavour to build a
just nation.

Nevertheless, as I’ve previously indicated, all are welcome to make
submissions that might improve the current wording. Hopefully, the final
wording of the pledge will refer to values, will promote nation-building
and will seek personal commitment to the good of all.

Apart from the important matter of the core values that draw our nation
together, I hope that all of us will honestly admit that we have called for
multifaceted responses to the ill-discipline and careless attitude to
values we see in our society today. South Africans have called on education
authorities to do more to inculcate a more caring and considerate conduct
in our young people.

As I have indicated, our curriculum, primarily in the life orientation
learning area, seeks to do just that. However, given our history of a
society that was divided by violent repression and the absence of an
inclusive democracy, our interventions need to go beyond a learning area
into practices that will, in the words of Rabbi J Sachs, who was quoted by
J Kearney in a recent edition of the Cape Times just a week ago, teach our
children that “Freedom is not, as so many have thought, a matter of
political or military victories alone. It involves ‘habits of the heart’”.

That is what we hope the cumulative effect of a schools’ pledge, of the
bill of responsibilities and of the life orientation programme might be:
the encouragement, the emergence, and the inculcation of “habits of the
heart”.

Finally, allow me to refer briefly to the bill of responsibilities that we
have drafted together with the National Religious Leaders’ Forum. Its core
purpose is to draw our attention, and particularly that of our youth, to
the fact that the constitutional rights have companions that are called
“responsibilities”.

Many people have said that this has been a neglected part of our civic
education as a people and as a country. We drafted that document for
debate, discussion and education on the link between rights and
responsibilities. We hope all South Africans will give increased attention
to actively shaping a society that is fully deserving of our great
Constitution and all the freedoms we now enjoy.

I close by quoting, once more, former President Mandela, who said:
“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the
world.” We hope, through crafting a pledge to guide our youth, we will help
in laying that platform for change that former President Mandela referred
to. I thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Me D VAN DER WALT: Agb Adjunkspeaker, om ook op Internasionale
Moedertaaldag te bewys dat ek as Afrikaanssprekende ander se moedertaal
respekteer, gaan ek vandag my toespraak in Engels lewer. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Ms D VAN DER WALT: Hon Deputy Speaker, in order to prove on International
Mother Language Day that I, as an Afrikaans-speaking person, also respect
other people’s mother tongues, I shall deliver my speech in English today.]

The DA welcomes the idea of a pledge of allegiance. We have said on a
number of occasions already that this could be a powerful way to build a
sense of identity and a common purpose. In fact, the DA put forward its own
proposal for a pledge in June last year, long before the President took it
up in his state of the nation address. We have asked for further public
input on our pledge already, and we will be making our own submission on
the basis of the input we receive.

However, there are two considerations that must be taken into account
before we start expecting our schoolchildren to recite a pledge. Firstly,
it is absolutely critical that there be proper consultation. We all know
that feelings about culture and language run deep in South Africa and that
our views on these matters are often very different. If a pledge is forced
on our children it will not be accepted, and the government must not regard
this as a cheap quick way to impose its own world view on society. One
month is not long enough for proper consultation. The period needs to be
significantly extended.

This pledge must be a creation of the people, including the learners who
will recite it, and not of the state. Therefore it is not acceptable that
government has made itself the judge and jury on this matter.
Responsibility for accepting and considering the public’s inputs must be
given to an independent task team of credible experts and not the
government.

Another area where questions of identity and culture have had to be
confronted is in relation to place names, and the SA Geographical Names
Council has been created specifically to manage this process. It is staffed
by independent experts and it is required to ensure that specific
consultation processes are followed before names are changed. We should
perhaps look to this example in deciding on a pledge.

Secondly, South Africans need to believe that the principles embodied in a
pledge are principles that apply to everyone, including our leaders and
including the President him or herself.

Putting the Constitution and its values at the heart of any pledge of
allegiance is to be welcomed. At a time when our democracy is under threat
in a number of different ways, it is important to encourage a culture of
constitutionalism in our youth. But how many politicians in the ruling
party can themselves, in all honesty, say that they are willing to pledge
allegiance to the Constitution when our Constitution requires of Members of
Parliament that they not “use their position to enrich themselves”? Why do
we still have 32 Members of Parliament who have effectively admitted guilt
in the Travelgate Scandal, but who still hold tightly onto their seats
today?

Our Constitution creates a clear separation of powers in order to ensure
that our government is accountable to the people, yet we have a situation
in which the Speaker of Parliament, who is supposed to be a neutral
referee, is also both the Chairperson of the ANC and the Chairperson of the
ANC’s political committee, and therefore cannot possibly be impartial.
[Interjections.] We cannot, for example, have a situation in which, on the
one hand, we are talking about including the concept of the supremacy of
the Constitution in the pledge and, on the other hand, we have a possible
future President of the country saying that the ANC is more important than
the Constitution.

We all need to commit ourselves equally to the ideals that we want to have
expressed in this pledge. A pledge will work only if everyone is committed
to it. Let us work hard to make sure it happens. Let us spend time thinking
about how we can do this in a way that everyone feels included, and let us
expect of ourselves that we embody the principle it contains as much as we
expect of others. I thank you - “Dankie” and “Ke a leboga”. [Thank you.]
[Applause.]

Ms C N Z ZIKALALA: Madam Deputy Speaker, looking back in history, Prince
Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the IFP have always advocated the teaching of
ubuntu-botho in our schools. We believe in an education system built on the
cornerstones of ubuntu and we believe that the restoration of the culture
of Ubuntu-botho and the inculcation of the revolution of goodwill in all
schools and institutions of higher learning have always been the answer to
the many crises that beset our education system and our society at large.

However, these ideas of the IFP were turned down by the ANC government
years ago as useless notions and were never implemented in schools, we
believe, to the detriment of all school learners. Nature, as the saying
goes, does not allow a vacuum. When the ANC-led Department of Education
abolished school prayers, thereby depriving schools of choices, there was a
void. Furthermore, the ANC-led Department of Education has made it
practically impossible for educators to discipline learners, and the
consequence of this is now very clear to all of us. Our schools have become
havens of violence, drug abuse, ill-discipline and gross disrespect for
public property.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon member! There is a point of order. Hon
Minister?

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: ... [Inaudible.] ... the opportunity to
make statements on the issue of the school pledge to be abused by
opposition parties as a means of attacking the government. Both the
speakers, the previous one and this one, have said nothing about the
relevance of the pledge, whether it is valuable, and whether it is
acceptable. [Interjections.] They have used this platform merely to attack
the governing party. We can take on anyone when it comes to the cut and
thrust of politics.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon Minister! That is not a point of order.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: I don’t think the podium should be abused
in this manner. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: I do believe the Minister is also now using an opportune
... [Interjections.] I think, on a point of order ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I ruled. I said that was not a point of order.
Please sit down, Mrs Seaton.

Mrs S A SEATON: Thank you. Absolutely!

Ms C N Z ZIKALALA: Late last year, we were confronted with the news that
80% of nine and 10-year olds in government schools could not read at the
required level. Worse, between 86% and 96% of children who speak and were
tested in African languages did not reach the mark.

The IFP believes that a school pledge can be useful in bringing about pride
and reconciliation in our country. We, therefore, in principle support the
taking of a pledge by learners, but with the following provisions. One, the
wording of such a pledge must be appropriate to the developmental age of
the learners; two, the wording of such a pledge must be ideology-free and
must have been agreed to by all stakeholders, and three, such a pledge must
have as its objective nation-building, social cohesion and the inculcation
of respect for human dignity and respect for public property as well as the
inculcation of a human rights culture.

The IFP believes that debate on this topic should be welcomed, and we call
on all South Africans to deliberate and contest government’s proposal to
improve it. I thank you. [Applause.]

Nkskz S N SIGCAU: Sekela-Somlomo obekekileyo namalungu ngokubanzi,
isibhambathiso sesikolo sibekwe ngendlela. Kodwa, ngaba siyimfuneko na?
Ngaba uMhobe weSizwe uyasilela na ukukhuthaza abemi beli ngembali nekamva
lobunye?

Esi sibhambathiso sisikhumbuza kakhulu ngesamaMelika ezikolweni. Nangona
singabuthandabuzi ubunganga belaa lizwe, akufuneki sizeke mzekweni ngokuthi
sililandele kwinto yonke eliyenzayo.

Kukwakho ingxaki ngokubhekisele kwingcombolo equlathwe kwesi sibhambathiso.
Sisibuyisele endulo kunokuba sisibhekisele phambili. Amazolo abalulekile,
akukho ntandabuzo ngoko. Kodwa unqontsonqa wesibhambathiso kukubangwa
kwentsingiselo, ukuya empumelelweni, ukwakha ikamva eliqaqambileyo
nokukhuthaza okuhle kweli lixa.

Esi sibhambathiso side kakhulu. Siyi-UDM sithi ukuba abantwana bethu
kufuneka besifundile kwaye besicengceleze ngeqhayiya, kufuneka sibe
sifutshane. Amazwi angama-76 made kakhulu xa ethelekiswa nesibhambathiso
samaMelika, ekucacileyo ukuba sinenkqubela-phambili.

Esi sethu siya kunganiki mdla kubantwana abancinane. Ulwimi
olusetyenzisiweyo lunzima kakhulu. Ndimhlonipha nje umbhali, kodwa
untsonkothile wagabadela ngokubhekisele kumagama awasebenzisileyo.
Ngokucacileyo, umntwana ominyaka isixhenxe uya kufumana ubunzima ngala
magama.

Okubhaliweyo kuyasilela ukuveza indima yoMhobe weSizwe. Ukuba akukho enye
into engenziwa ngokubhekisele kwesi sibhambathiso, urhulumente makenze
ukhuphiswano lukazwelonke ukuze kukhethwe esona sibhambathiso siphume
emagqabini, njengoko kwakwenziwe ngokubhekisele kwiimpawu zesiswe.
Ndiyayishiya le ndawo. Enkosi ngokundiboleka indlebe. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

[Ms S N SIGCAU: Hon Deputy Speaker and members in general, the school
pledge has been properly formulated. However, is it really necessary? Is
the national anthem falling short in promoting nationalism, historical
background and diversity?

This pledge reminds us more of the American schools’ pledge. Even though we
do not doubt American sovereignty, it is not necessary for us to follow
everything that they are doing.

There is also a problem with regard to the information contained in the
pledge. It takes us back instead of forward. Yesteryears are important;
there is no doubt about that. However, the gist of any pledge lies in its
meanings, success, and the building of a bright future and the
encouragement of virtue.
This pledge is too long. We, as the UDM, say that if our children have to
learn and recite it with pride, then it must be short. Seventy-six words
are too many when compared to the Americans’ which encourages progress and
development.

This one of ours will not instil interest in our children. The language
that has been used is very difficult. I respect its author, but I think he
has used a deep language that is not understandable. It is obvious that a
seven-year-old child would have a problem understanding these words.

What is written falls short of clarifying the role of the national anthem.
If there is nothing that can be done to improve the pledge, the government
must then run a national competition to choose a suitable pledge, as it was
done in the case of national symbols. I am done. Thank you for listening to
me. [Applause.]]

Mr M H HOOSEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the proposed national school pledge,
introduced by hon Minister Naledi Pandor a few days ago, has been met with
mixed reactions across our country, and the Minister alluded to that
earlier on.

As the ID, we believe that the idea of a pledge is a fairly good one, and
we understand the motivation behind the Minister’s intentions. However, we
note with concern the lack of proper programmes for children to understand
the vague principles that they are being asked to pledge allegiance to.
Reciting a pledge every morning, without first understanding the very
basics of the pledge and the Constitution, amounts to indoctrination and
will not achieve the desired results.

Of particular concern to the ID is the absence of proper consultation. If
you want to unite people around the pledge, then you must allow them to
participate in the decisions we take as government.

The principle of consultation is non-negotiable, and Parliament must take
note of the constitutional judgments which referred weak legislation back
to Parliament.

Of the 110 judgments passed by the Constitutional Court, 55 of them were
against government. This represents 55 violations of the Constitution in
such a short period of our young democracy. Our Constitution is more
democratic than the drafters itself, many of whom are sitting in the House.

The ID therefore calls on government to pledge that they shall honour and
uphold the principles of the Constitution at every sitting. I thank you.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Deputy Speaker and hon Minister, the ACDP is of the opinion
that the proposed new school pledge will create unnecessary problems as
government once again appears to be running roughshod over the sentiments
of the majority of South Africans who hold to Christian values, and quite
possibly many minority groups as well.

While the ACDP supports a constitutional democracy, it voted against the
Constitution precisely because certain clauses diametrically oppose
Christian values. For example, the Constitution is recognised as a higher
authority than the Almighty God, protects the right to life of murderers
and rapists, but denies the right to life of innocent unborn children, and
it opened the door to pornography and same-sex marriage.

The ACDP will reject ... [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: [Inaudible.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Hon Minister, you are right that the first impression was
problematic as it came across as a fait accompli. However, your assurances
that this is not the case are encouraging. We appreciate the apparent
commitment by the Minister to listening to the public on this issue. For
example, for some, it may be that they take issue with remembering the
past, but for others it is simply the oath itself because people have a
very strong belief that it is against their religion to take these oaths,
and for many it is simply the issue of certain clauses in the Constitution.
The ACDP will reject any attempt by government to impose a pledge that does
not enhance education, does not encourage self-discipline, ignores moral
values and takes away individual freedom of choice. So, while the ACDP
would like to see this pledge scrapped, we have actually called on the hon
Minister, at the very least, to recognise that parents and learners may
have objections - and they would have a right to object - and that we would
expect and ask for you to facilitate an opt-out option, which, of course,
in itself is sad because it creates divisions.

The Catholic Institute of Education and the Catholic Schools’ Proprietors’
Association are reported to have said that there is an urgent need to
promote social cohesion, national unity and to develop moral citizens, and
that schoolchildren reciting an inadequately phrased pledge will not
necessarily become moral citizens.

The ACDP has said the proposed new school pledge would divide and not
unite, and the public response to date certainly bears this out. This would
be most unfortunate. Ngiyabonga. [Thank you.] [Time expired.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Adjunkspeaker, ek wil nou net sê dat ek sien die DA
lid gaan na die Minister toe. Ek weet hulle stem saam, maar hulle hoef
darem nou nie oor te stap na mekaar toe nie. Agb Adjunkspeaker, daar word
groot gewag gemaak van die aanhef van die grondwet wat deel is van hierdie
eed, maar ons weet, en die agb Minister het daarna verwys, dat dit net die
eerste deel is, want die tweede deel waarna daar baie duidelik verwys word,
ook na erkenning, word weggelaat. Met ander woorde, die eerste deel wat net
verwys na die ongeregtighede van die verlede, wil die agb Minister daar hê.
Wat sê daardie tweede deel? Die tweede deel sê, “Ons respekteer diegene wat
gewerk het om die land te bou en te ontwikkel en glo Suid-Afrika behoort
aan almal wat daarin bly en in ons diversiteit verenig.”

Nou wil ek vir die agb Minister sê, u respekteer met ander woorde, nie die
mense wat die land gebou en ontwikkel het nie. U het nie vanmiddag iets
nuuts hier kom sê nie, inteendeel, u het eintlik hier kom sê hoekom u nie
verder aan die tweede deel aandag wil gee nie: u dink ons is skaam oor ons
verlede. Nou laat ek vir die agb Minister sê, ek is nie skaam oor my
verlede nie. Ek is trots op my geskiedenis. Nie die Minister of die ANC
regering sal my skaam maak vir my verlede nie.

Ek wil vir die agb Minister ook verder sê dis juis die blanke jeug en die
kinders van vandag wat die slagoffers van regstellende aksie is, wat nie
eens gebore is in apartheid nie, wat die prys daarvoor moet betaal. Ek wil
vir die Minister sê u onderrok hang uit. U wil die Pandor-eed misbruik om
ons kinders te indokrineer en by hulle ’n skuldgevoel op te wek dat hulle
die verlede en daardeur ook hul herkoms, net boos en verkeerd was. Die
Minister wil beslag lê op ons kinders se gewete onder die dekmantel dat ons
mekaar se regte moet respekteer.

Agb Minister, ons sal dit nie toelaat in die VF Plus nie. Ons verskil van
die ANC en die DA en ek wil vandag vir u sê dat u artikel 15 van die
Grondwet moet onthou wat sê dat ... [Tussenwerpsels.] ... ons elkeen die
reg op ’n vry gewete het. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Deputy Speaker, I would just like to mention that I
have observed the DA member going to the Minister. I know they agree with
each other, but they don’t have to cross over to each other.

Hon Deputy Speaker, much ado is being made of the preamble to the
Constitution that forms part of this pledge, but we know, and the hon
Minister has referred to it, that it is only the first part, as the second
part, in which there is also a clear reference to recognition, has been
omitted. In other words, the Minister wants the first part, which only
refers to the injustices of the past, included. What does the second part
say? The second part says:

   We respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
   believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our
   diversity.

Now I want to put it to the hon Minister: In other words, you do not
respect the people who built and developed the country. You have not said
anything new here this afternoon. On the contrary, you have actually come
here to say why you will not give any further attention to the second part:
you think we are embarrassed by our past. Allow me to say to the hon
Minister that I am not embarrassed by my past. I am proud of my history.
Neither the Minister nor the ANC government will make me embarrassed about
my past.

Furthermore, I also want to tell the hon Minister that it is precisely the
white youth and children who are today the victims of affirmative action,
who were not even born during apartheid, but who have to pay the price for
it. I want the Minister to know that she has revealed her true colours. You
want to misuse the Pandor pledge to indoctrinate our children and to
inculcate in them a sense of guilt that their past, and therefore also
their descent, was just evil and wrong. The Minister wants to take
possession of our children’s consciences under the pretext that we should
have mutual respect for each other’s rights.

Hon Minister, in the FF Plus we will not allow this. We differ with the ANC
and the DA and I want to say to you today that you need to remember Article
15 of the Constitution which says that ... [Interjections.] ... everyone
has the right to freedom of conscience.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Deputy Speaker, while the people of South Africa cannot
forget about the atrocities of the past as the wounds run too deep, our
children need to be able to focus on deepening democracy and holding the
South African flag high, and on ensuring that they continue giving back to
the development of our country into a land of milk and honey.

Regardless of one’s religious creed, the school pledge is a form of prayer
to a higher being and the universe. Thus, as we all know, the law of
attraction says the more you think about what you do not want, the more you
invite it into your experience as the universe responds.

Therefore, it is based on this premise that we would not want our children
to be caused to speak about apartheid every day, since they still have the
opportunity to learn about our past in their history lessons.

The children of South Africa should have a pledge which will evoke the
emotions of patriotism, honour, dignity and respect, emotions which will
allow them to be model citizens and a nation of achievers, which will
strive to promote the success and prosperity of their land.

The ruling party has the privilege of leading us by their mandate. Thus,
there is no need to rush to implement the pledge. I must say, Minister,
that I wrote this before you gave the assurance that this is not a fait
accompli. Thank you, Chairperson. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Motlotlegi rre Mfundisi nna ke ipela ka loleme lwa ga
mme. [Hon Mfundisi, I am proud of my mother tongue.]

Today is International Mother Language Day.

Rre I S MFUNDISI: Motlotlegi Motlatsa-Sebui, le ditokololo tse di
tlotlegang tsa Ntlo e, re lebogela gore go nne le tšhono ya go akantshanya

[Mr I S MFUNDISI: Hon Deputy Speaker and hon members of this House, we are
pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the proposed pledge, and that
there will be a survey as time goes on.]

The UCDP is in principle not averse to the school pledge. As we have just
indicated, this pledge is not to be seen as cast in stone. We accept what
the Minister has just said and we hope we will deepen the debate around it.

The American pledge, on which the proposed one is based, was introduced in
1892 and debated by the public to the extent that Congress had an input as
to how such a pledge would affect the nation. It was no surprise that in
1954, Congress, under President Eisenhower, added the words “under God” to
indicate that all people are subservient to the living God.

Our concern as the UCDP is that the pledge, in its present form, is more
humanistic. It portrays more of a world view.

In the state of the nation debate last week, I proposed that as we are
concerned about the declining morals among our pupils, boy-scouting and
girl-guiding as character-building movements should be introduced. The
scout promise is very simple and goes like this:

   On my honour I promise that I will do my best
   To do my duty to God and my country;
   To help other people at all times;
   To obey the Scout Law.

Reference is made to the country, the people and God. It is simple and
straightforward. From our position, we maintain that there is no need to
keep harping on about the injustices of the past when there is a future to
look forward to.

We in the UCDP maintain that the pledge may be too difficult for primary-
school children, unless they will be made to recite it like parrots without
understanding it. Thank you. [Time expired.]
Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, we South Africans are plus/minus 14
years into democracy and have accepted each other regardless of colour,
creed, race and culture, recognising the injustices of the past. The MF is
concerned as to what will be the understanding of the public and their
reaction in respect of the pledge.

Hon Minister, arising from the comments of various newspapers, it seems as
if there has to be much more public participation and total understanding
before the pledge is implemented, and possibly, we should look into
rewording the pledge. Therefore, the MF kindly requests that more time be
given to the public to comment further in respect of the pledge. I thank
you.

Mr N T GODI: Madam Deputy Speaker, comrades and hon members, the APC
welcomes and supports the school pledge. We dare say that anyone opposed to
the pledge does so for wholly unpatriotic reasons.

The democratic dispensation has, correctly so, emphasised the rights of
individuals and society. However, it now needs to be balanced by
introducing and stressing responsibilities that go with these rights,
especially for the young ones. The future that we want to build, the values
that our youth must live by and the shaping of their outlook cannot be left
to chance.

If we appreciate the challenges out there of poor discipline, truancy,
violence in schools, drug abuse, and dysfunctional families and community
life, then we certainly do need an intervention that seeks to help our
young people focus properly in the best interests of society and their own
future. We need to bring up the youth to be conscious of its
responsibilities to society that is patriotic and lives up to the values of
ubuntu.

This is a national cause that requires us to rise above our narrow partisan
positions. The APC encourages parents, teachers and us as members to join
hands in this national effort to promote and explain the rationale behind
the pledge. The introduction of the school pledge is one of the most
important milestones in our dialectical march towards a consolidated
nationhood. Responsible citizenry is not just wished for; it is built
consciously. The school pledge is one such effort. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Deputy Chairperson, first of all, let me thank the Minister
for her linguistic skills. I appreciate that she can speak the languages as
proficiently as she did.

Let me say that, in response to the President’s state of the nation
address, the hon Holomisa repeated that this nation requires a national
indaba or convention to deal with various national issues. In his reply,
President Thabo Mbeki welcomed this view together with that of the hon Dr
Buthelezi and the hon Mgabadeli.
It is more sensible to deal with the issue of the proposed school pledge
after hearing what the national indaba has to say on such a matter. At the
moment this pledge is not unifying this nation; it is controversial.

Among other things, the proposed school pledge reads: “We honour those who
suffered and sacrificed for justice and freedom.” In practice, this has not
happened after 12 years. Some freedom fighters have been overhonoured at
the expense of others. Important places have been named in a sectarian way.
The selected freedom fighters have been given state funerals, but others
who have a matchless history of struggle have been ignored. There is the
“Sobukwe Clause”; there is Sharpeville and Langa; there is Robben Island;
there is the Soweto uprising; there is the expulsion of apartheid South
Africa from the United Nations; there is the battle of Villa Peri where
General Gerald Kondlo of the Azanian People’s Liberation Army fell. They
are heroes.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Dr S E M PHEKO: Heroes are heroes.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order ... [Inaudible.] [Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: They must be given honour, equal honour. Thank you. [Time
expired.]
Mr L M GREEN: Deputy Speaker, before I speak on the issue, let me inform
the hon Minister of Education that I have no intention of jumping to
another party. Hon Minister, you should know, being part of the tripartite
alliance, what an alliance is. You join as a party and not as an
individual, and you retain your individual party structure and leadership
before and after elections.

Be that as it may, the FD does not have any objection to a school pledge in
principle if it will help to nurture among our youth a respect for a group
of values centred around responsibility, citizenship and personal
wellbeing. As we all know, a pledge formulated in the year 2000 does exist
with the Education department and which, according to our views, captures
the primary ethos and spirit of our Constitution in language that resonates
with the emotional, intellectual and spiritual intelligence of the child.
The old pledge aims to heal all scars of the past, which include hurts from
the history of racism, the Anglo-Boer War and many other hurts, including
apartheid laws. It seeks to bring not only schoolchildren, but also the
nation as a whole onto a course of reconciliation. Like the national
anthem, which is supported by all our communities and which is sung at all
our national events, a school pledge should evoke the same pride and
support by all our citizens. The old pledge reads, and let me quote:

  I promise to be loyal to my country, South Africa, and do my best to
  promote its welfare and the wellbeing of all its citizens. I promise to
  show self-respect in all that I do and to respect all my fellow citizens
  and all of our various traditions. Let us work for peace, friendship and
  reconciliation and heal the scars left by the past conflicts, and let us
  build a common destiny together.

What a wonderful quotation we have here. What a wonderful way to give
support through this kind of pledge.

I would like to ask the hon Minister to tell the House whether she has any
reservations concerning the old pledge. I’m talking about the 2000 pledge,
the pledge that I have just read now.

The FD wishes to recommend that, if not, then let’s use both pledges to put
forward for public participation in order for the people to decide, or
rework the new pledge to reflect elements of both.

In conclusion, a school pledge must of necessity be apolitical. It must be
free from any form of indoctrination, while being fundamentally educational
in nature with the intent to develop a child’s keen interest to pursue
knowledge and to learn to live and engage in a society blessed with a
diversity of cultures. So, as I have said, as the FD, we do not have any
objection to a school pledge. I thank you.

Prof S M MAYATULA: Chairperson and hon members, my aim in this presentation
is to clear up a number of misconceptions and myths which have clouded the
debate on this issue. The Minister has referred to some of them.

The biggest misconception is that this is the final version of the pledge
and that the people of our country will not be given any chance to make
their contributions. Surely, the interested parties could not be expected
to comment on nothing? The pledge, as it stands, will be gazetted and every
citizen of goodwill will have time to comment and add value to it.

The following are some of the statements reflected in the print media on
which I would like to comment, and the hon members on my left even had the
same kind of thinking. According to Taryn Hodgson of the Christian Action
Network,

   It appears the ANC are planning to replace prayer and Bible reading in
   schools with a new religious rite ... complete with an oath of allegiance
   to the secular Constitution.

Nowhere in our Constitution or in the statutes is anybody prevented from
praying, reading the Bible or worshipping in any form whatsoever, and
wherever, including in our schools.

In the school that my Christian granddaughter attends, the Muslim community
has requested and has been allowed to take their children at 12:30 on
Fridays to engage in their religious activities. What prevents us as
Christians from doing the same thing?

As a Christian I sometimes find it difficult to understand the
fundamentalist approach of some of my Christian friends, who want us to
force down everybody’s throats one and only one religion: the Christian
religion.

Ewe, Mhlalingaphambili, mna ndiyakholelwa ukuba likhona izulu, kwanokuba
indlela eya ezulwini igqitha kuYesu ebethelelwe emnqamlezweni. Bakhona
abathi akukho nto ilizulu. Abanye bathi indlela eya ezulwini igqitha
kwizinyanya. Abanye bakhonza imifanekiso eqingqiweyo. Khon’ ukuba bakhonza
ihagu okanye idonki, indikhathaza ngabuni loo nto? Ndingubani mna ukuba
ndingabanqanda, ndibabonise in dlela yokukhonza? Khon’ ukuba baye kungena
esihogweni? Yeyabo leyo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Yes, Chairperson, I believe that there is Heaven; you go to Heaven through
Christ on the cross. There are those who say that there is no Heaven.
Others believe that the way to Heaven is through ancestors. Others worship
idols. Whether they worship pigs or donkeys, how does that concern me? Who
am I to stop them or show them how to worship? Even if they go to Hell,
that is their problem.]

According to Jody Kollapen, the head of the SA Human Rights Commission,
“The proposed pledge for schools should include practical programmes if it
is to be effective as a tool for nation-building.” Mr Kollapen is right to
call for practical programmes, but I want to assure him that these values
are already included in the curriculum. I would like to refer him in
particular to the life orientation syllabus in which these values are
contained. The pledge is meant to reinforce these values.

Mr Kollapen goes on to quote some white South Africans who reacted by
saying: “I’m not going to allow my child to say this pledge while there are
some crooks in power;” or, “I’m not going to pledge allegiance to corrupt
politicians.” People in power, whether corrupt or not corrupt, come and go.
This is not a pledge to politicians; it is a pledge to our country.

Bagotywa bebatsha abantwana. [The earlier the guidance of children starts,
the better.]

Despite the ills of society, let us work together to win for our children a
better future. The pledge will go a long way towards this goal.

I fully agree with Brian Westgate, who proposes that the pledge should be
“tailored to better suit the whole nation” . He goes on to say: “Surely a
pledge should have the purpose of generating love and respect for one
another as well as patriotism in drawing us together as a nation?”

If we accept that this pledge is just a draft - I’m now addressing the
members - the members have now gone a step further to comment on the pledge
in that it is short, it is long, it is not doing ... [Interjections.] This
pledge is going to be gazetted so that we can add exactly that. Once we
have added those, we’ll come with a new pledge which all of us are going to
own. I think somebody over there said that this must be driven by experts.
Surely, we are here as experts who have been elected by our people to drive
these values?

The hon Sigcau referred to the content again when she said, that it is
taking us back. I don’t know why. It is too long; the language is
difficult. The Gazette is there: Look at it; make your proposal; make it
short and make it understandable. We will look into that.

The hon Hoosen said that this was indoctrination. He said there was no
consultation. Again, you would say that if you think that this is a
finished product, but consultations will happen. I think the hon Dudley
said that this was dividing rather than uniting. I don’t know what is doing
that because, as we speak, we don’t have a pledge as yet. It behoves all of
us to come up with a pledge which is going to be uniting.

The hon Groenewald said, on the content of the pledge, that he is not
ashamed of the past. We constantly stand at these platforms remembering the
Holocaust, remembering this and that which happened long ago, so that we
know where we have come from and don’t go back there. When we say this is
the issue, we are not saying people must go back there. At least, if you
know where there is a hole, you will not get caught in that hole again. I
must tell you: This is the hole. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                    PUSHING BACK THE FRONTIERS OF POVERTY

                           (IPU Topic for Debate)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson and hon members, poverty in
its many forms and manifestations continues to be a serious challenge in
our country, in the Southern African Development Community region, on the
continent of Africa and in the developing world in general.

The plight of millions of people in the SADC region, on the African
continent and in many countries in the world means that those of us who
serve our people must work together as national governments, and come
together in regional platforms and internationally to collaborate so that
we can contribute to pushing back the frontiers of poverty and engage the
poverty challenge.

In our country, fighting poverty demands an undying commitment from all of
us as national departments, provincial departments and local government.
Ensuring that our policies and programmes talk to each other in an
integrated and coherent manner, and are well co-ordinated is a challenge
that we must pursue.

Indeed, the interventions that have been made by government in the past 13
years in the fight against poverty have been monumental. As we continue to
endeavour to make the lives of our people better, especially the poorest of
the poor, poverty and inequality remain critical challenges. However, our
government and other committed sectors in the country created a vision and
declared 13 years ago that the eradication of poverty was a war that we
must win. In our Constitution, in our policies and programmes, our efforts
are continuing and growing in this regard.

The eradication of poverty and the eventual transformation of South African
society is indeed a long journey that is still far from its destination. To
many of our people the very meaning of social transformation means freedom
from hunger, disease and want, including the provision of proper shelter,
quality health care and quality education and assistance from the
government in cases of severe need and destitution.
Pushing back the frontiers of poverty did not just begin with the political
liberation gained in 1994. It started with our rebellion and fight against
colonial domination and exploitation in the workplace and the dispossession
that were part of the discriminatory laws and system of the past. The
rallying call of the ANC has been the eradication of poverty and the
creation of a just and caring society defined by nonracialism,
nondiscrimination of vulnerable groups such as the aged, orphans and the
disabled, women and children, and nonsexism. It is this quest for a better
society that continues to be the compass of our collective struggle against
poverty.

The reality is that the fight against poverty was only given impetus after
1994 when a legitimate government was elected into power by the mass of our
people. In turn, this government realigned the departments and agencies of
the state so as to chart a new course of action in matters of social and
human development.

The starting point of this process lay in the creation of a whole set of
new institutions, policies and legislation to enable the new government to
create a new society altogether. In this regard, nation-building became a
key imperative of the transformation agenda. The new institutions, policies
and legislation emboldened the transformation of the country. In very
important ways, these policies and legislation allowed the government to
open up new opportunities for the citizens to advance themselves in
different areas of human endeavour.

The attainment of our political rights in South Africa enabled us to then
begin tackling the question of socioeconomic rights. We believe that the
two are not mutually exclusive.

It is this belief that prodded us to arrive at a Constitution that
entrenched these socioeconomic rights. Today all South Africans have the
right to access to different social services such as water, sanitation,
shelter, social security, health, education and housing. This Constitution
mirrors the collective will of our people to create a caring society.

Amongst many other interventions, our fight against poverty is driven by
social assistance in the form of many social grants that are a central
feature of our security system. About 12,5 million South Africans receive
social grants; seven million of these beneficiaries are children. There is
strong evidence that South Africa’s social grants are well targeted and
account for a substantial share of the income of poor households.

Grants are associated with a greater share of household expenditure on food
and therefore contribute and lead to improved nutrition for many people
living in poverty. In particular, the child support grant contributes
significantly to the health of young children.
Our stated position is that child poverty is an extremely unique form of
poverty that requires long-term solutions. Nevertheless, the thinking in
the government also rests on an appreciation of the multidimensional nature
of poverty. Therefore multipronged interventions are relied upon in the
fight against poverty.

Our continuing fight against poverty and making sure that we push back the
frontiers of poverty involves different departments intervening in areas
such as education and skills acquisition, land restitution, youth
development, microfinancing, housing, the provision of clean water and
sanitation, early childhood development, the Expanded Public Works
Programme, HIV/Aids programmes, crime prevention, health and many other
interventions.

It is also from this position that we see the growing of the economy as an
important dimension towards poverty eradication. Economic growth must be
linked to the goals of social development, and a stable and growing economy
must translate into positive outcomes in the areas of human and social
development. Our growth must be shared and its fruits spread, most
importantly, to those households living in poverty.

The commitment of our government to poverty eradication has seen the
formulation of a national comprehensive antipoverty strategy that will
ensure that all our efforts in all government departments address the
poverty challenge. Our departments in government seek to provide a safety
net for those unable to earn sufficient income; to build social cohesion
through the removal of risk, and to develop social, cultural and democratic
engagement in the country.

We strive to help individual families, groups and communities to engage
with the economy and society through quality education and health care,
access to infrastructure, safety and security and cultural and sports
development.

As an example, the Department of Social Development meets some of these
obligations through community development, retirement reforms, income
security and social welfare services. Furthermore, evidence-based research
for policy decision-making has become one major thrust in our undertakings.
In this way, our interventions are clearly informed by research that is
guided by empirical experience and evidence.

The journey that we began in 1994 is gaining momentum in that our people
can be catered for from birth to old age through the creation of quality
jobs and social programmes and interventions. This means therefore that an
integrated and holistic approach towards poverty eradication has become our
second rallying call after liberation. It is in this spirit that the
antipoverty strategy for South Africa has been conceptualised. This
strategy is underpinned by key pillars. These pillars cover basic income
security, household services and housing, investment in human capital,
comprehensive health care, the creation of economic opportunities, access
to assets, and social cohesion.

Our commitment to a better life for all is not only confined to being
within our borders. We are also involved in international solidarity
efforts, especially on the African continent. Our struggle for liberation
predisposes us to help in the reconstruction efforts in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and in Burundi, and with peace efforts in Sudan and
Zimbabwe. There are also partnerships with our compatriots in countries in
the South which are important in shaping global discourse around poverty
and social cohesion and inclusion. We aim to find ways of reshaping
processes of globalisation in a humane way. Our participation in the India-
Brazil-South Africa trilateral arrangement is thus significant. Interaction
with our counterparts in Latin America, from Chile or Mexico, will also
help in shaping new agendas and antipoverty measures by offering
alternative models.

Pushing back the frontiers of poverty is a commitment we have championed at
various levels and we shall continue to do so. We all have a common agenda
around human dignity and the rights of our citizens. Indeed, it is these
people who voted us into power in the first place, so, as we share our
views on this issue of poverty, let us not forget our primary custodians:
the common people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J SELFE: Mr Chairperson, this debate is taking place because the subject
for discussion is also the theme of the forthcoming Assembly of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union, to be held in Cape Town between 13 April and 18 April
this year.

Perhaps because of our fairly busy schedules, I find that far too few MPs
are aware of the IPU and the work that it actually does. When people ask me
what the IPU is, I say that the IPU is to parliaments what the United
Nations is to governments. In just the same way as governments need to meet
to act collectively to deal with the challenges facing us all, so do
parliaments. Indeed, parliaments must scrutinise and ratify treaties that
are negotiated at the United Nations and in other multilateral forums.

Parliaments must hold their executives to account for the conduct of
foreign policy and they must pass the legislation necessary to give effect
to international treaties and conventions. For these reasons, it is
essential that the IPU and the UN work closer together to develop common
solutions to overcome global problems.

Clearly, one of the most serious challenges facing the world is the
reduction of poverty. This challenge is, of course, very real in South
Africa. When a homeless person dies in the middle of a metropolitan area,
as one very recently did in the centre of Cape Town, it should bring home
to all of us the very extensive nature of this challenge.
But to deal with this challenge, we must also understand what it is we are
dealing with. During November of last year, a polemic developed between the
SA Institute of Race Relations, on the one hand, and the President and Mr
Netshitenzhe, on the other, concerning whether levels of poverty had
increased or decreased in South Africa under the ANC’s administration.

Much of this polemic centres on how one defines poverty, and at what level
one can be said to be “living in poverty”. The polemic spawned a whole
debate surrounding the terms such as “money-metric poverty”, the “poverty
gap” and the “severity of poverty”. Participants in this polemic chose
different sources of information and of measurement.

The polemic certainly gave rise to very heated exchanges. In his letter in
ANC Today of 16 November to 22 November 2007, for example, the then
President of the ANC said:

  The South African Institute of Race Relations relies on a definition of
  poverty that is radically different from the one spelt out in the RDP and
  described by Statistics SA. Necessarily, this produces a distortion of
  our reality which amounts to a falsification of this reality.

The SA Institute of Race Relations cited a study conducted in 2006 by
Global Insight Southern Africa. Other studies, such as that conducted by
the United Nations Development Programme, came to different conclusions
using different methodologies.

Yet even the UNDP, quoted approvingly by Joel Netshitentzhe, indicated that
while the proportion of people living in poverty had fallen in percentage
terms between 1995 and 2002, 48,5% of the South African population were
still living in poverty at the end of this period. Even Mr Netshitentzhe
conceded that 21,9 million people in South Africa were living in poverty in
2002.

The point I am really trying to make is this: While economists and
statisticians argue about the definition of poverty and its extent, none of
us in this House, and none of us in this nation, can deny that nearly half
of our population is still living in poverty. It doesn’t really matter
whether this figure is increasing or decreasing in absolute or in
percentage terms, there are still too many desperately poor people in South
Africa, people who must, on a daily basis, struggle simply to stay alive.

The question is not so much who is living in poverty and how many are
living in poverty, but what must be done, as the ANC always puts it, “to
push back the frontiers of poverty”.

The President announced in the state of the nation address the institution
of a war room on poverty. Good and well, but who are the generals to
command this war, and what are the strategies that are going to be
employed?

Up until now, the government’s chief mechanism to alleviate poverty has
been rolling out various forms of social grants. The number of
beneficiaries grew from R2,6 million in 1994 to R10,5 million in 2005 and
to R12,5 million this year. This comes at a cost: Social grants cost R10
billion in 1994, rising to R55 billion in 2005. This gives rise to
questions about sustainability and affordability in the long-term.

The growth in employment has been less impressive: The number of employed
people in South Africa increased from 11,1 million in 2001 to 12,8 million
in 2006, despite an average rate of economic growth of 4,5% per year over
this period.

If we really want to win the war against poverty, we must create jobs so
that people themselves can get ahead. Social grants obviously have their
place, as do programmes such as the Expanded Public Works Programme, but
these should be used as a safety net for those who, for reasons they have
no control over, cannot look after themselves. These should not be the
dominant feature of our antipoverty efforts, and they certainly should not
entrench dependency.

So what should the state be doing? In the sort of society we want to create
in South Africa, one’s path in life should not be determined by one’s birth
but rather by one’s talents and one’s efforts. The role of the state must
be to empower individuals and to facilitate their development whilst
individuals should be left to determine how best to direct their lives.

This does not imply a minimalist state. The state obviously plays a crucial
role in development, but the objective of development must be to expand the
choices and broaden the opportunities of ordinary citizens, and especially
the poor.

In South Africa, which must overcome the legacy of underdevelopment and
discrimination, the state has a cardinal role to play in ensuring access
for all to quality education and skills development by ensuring access to
capital, by providing decent health care and sanitation, and by
facilitating economic growth through the provision of infrastructure and a
competition-friendly regulatory environment. In short, the state must give
a hand-up, not a hand-out.

We are pleased to note that many of these principles have seen expression
in yesterday’s Budget. If we put these measures in place, we will indeed
provide ladders for people to lift themselves out of poverty and we can
indeed push back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, Mr Selfe has concentrated a little on
poverty in South Africa. I think the idea of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
is more to look at poverty in the world.

I’ve listened to poverty eradication debates for too many years to recall.
I’ve listened to them in Washington, London, Geneva, Strasbourg, Beijing,
Cuba, and in many other cities of the world. I’ve listened to too many firm
resolutions on how we are going to eradicate poverty.

I’ve heard about time schedules, of cutting down poverty by certain target
dates, and of percentages to be reduced. But, in the end, these appear to
be only words, words, words; just more and more resolutions and resolutions
and resolutions all over the world on how to eradicate poverty. And the end
result in the world: the rich get richer and the poor poorer. That,
unfortunately, is the end result. Very little comes from the millions of
words spoken from dozens of podiums over many decades on how to eradicate
poverty. Call me a pessimist if you so wish, because I am going to say we
will once again be faced with words and resolutions at the forthcoming IPU
meeting - words, words and beautiful resolutions on how to eradicate
poverty. Thereafter, it is going to be the same: the rich will get richer
and the poor poorer.

So what are we to do about this? There can be only one solution, and that
is to create the will to eradicate poverty – I repeat, the will to
eradicate poverty - because that does not exist at this stage.

This has been the same with global warming. It took years to foster a
strong political will to do something about global warming. It took Al Gore
getting his teeth into global warming for things to start happening. To
eradicate poverty, you need more than one Al Gore. You need many of them.

The time has arrived for many dozens of prominent persons from all over the
world to form a strong structure to address world poverty. The Bill Gates
types of billionaires, retired prominent politicians, academics, churches,
statesmen, ordinary people, and others from the entire spectrum of world
society should get their teeth into world poverty. They must demonstrate
the will to eradicate poverty. They must form a massive structure to do so
and produce results – more than just words and beautiful resolutions.

In conclusion, let it therefore be written that it was in Cape Town in the
year 2008 that the solution was born on how to really eradicate poverty.
The world has to unite against poverty. Thank you. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Hon Chairperson, I think the hon Van der Merwe must just
keep quiet if he is tired of debating. We have to continue to debate or
present a debate. [Interjections.]

My job is to explain why we are affiliated with the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, what the IPU is, and how we can make it work. Before I do so, on
behalf of the ANC, I would like – as we debate the relevance, importance
and the role of the IPU in the fight for a better life for all – to pay
sincere tribute to the Cuban people and their leader, Fidel Castro, as he
retires voluntarily from leading the Cuban revolution.

The honourable Castro and the Cuban people dedicated their lives for almost
50 years, since their revolution in 1959, to fight for a better life for
all in the world. It is their personal sacrifice in the fight for self-
determination and political freedom that has contributed to the defeat of
apartheid and the attainment of our freedom in 1994. It is apposite to
note, as a lesson for us in South Africa post-1994, that the sustainability
of the Cuban revolution against the imperial might of the USA – hardly 50
kilometres away from Havana – can be safely attributed to the discipline of
their leadership and their people. The Cubans long understood the
inextricable nexus between the character of the cadre and the successful
execution of their revolution. Long live Fidel Castro, long live!

What is the IPU? We must answer this question in order to continue to
mobilise our people to support our efforts to mobilise international
solidarity for a better life for all. We can only do so if we continue, as
this debate seeks to do, to close the gap of knowledge between us, the
people’s representatives, and the people we represent. Our Constitution
enjoins us, as Members of Parliament, to ensure that there is public
involvement in the affairs of Parliament.

The letters “IPU” are the abbreviation for Inter-Parliamentary Union – what
I call a parliament of all parliaments of the world. Parliaments from all
over the world are represented in the IPU by multiparty delegations chosen
by domestic parliaments to represent their countries at the IPU assembly
each and every year.

The IPU is led by an executive committee at the helm of which is the
president, and there is a secretary-general who runs the administration of
parliament. The office bearers of the executive of the IPU are elected to
their positions by the governing council, which comprises delegations of
all parliaments that are members of the IPU.

Like domestic parliaments, the IPU has standing committees that deal with
different subjects that are of international importance. For example, there
is the subject on international peace and security. Recently, a new
committee was formed that looks at the relationship between the United
Nations and the IPU in order to forge links between these two important
international bodies.

A question may arise in the minds of some in this House and the public at
large as to whether it was necessary for the democratic Parliament post-
1994 to be affiliated with the IPU and spend money on subscriptions and the
travelling of delegations of the IPU around the world.

Speaking for the ANC, since inception, the ANC - like the Cuban leadership
- understood that mobilisation of international human solidarity is a
critical pillar of the struggle for a better life for all. This strategy of
creating international allies is born out by the proper objective analysis
that poverty and underdevelopment are a result of an inequitable global
economic order that is deliberately inflicted on the weaker nations by
imperialist and colonial forces.

The ANC understands that whilst the elite leadership of neo-colonial forces
may use state power and economic might to continue to exploit the weaker
states and peoples of the world, the masses in those dominant states are
not necessarily in support of those oppressive tendencies. We have seen
progressive masses all over the world protesting, as with the Iraq war,
against exploitation and repressive regimes anywhere in the world. The ANC
has long believed in the people’s power as a strategic tool in the war
against poverty.

At the Polokwane conference, the ANC restated its long-held view of the
need to engage in international bodies and resolved that:

  We need to respond to the challenge of imperialism. The ANC needs to
  strengthen itself and other progressive forces and develop a common
  agenda with an objective of realising a better life. Such a world order
  must be characterised by, inter alia, greater equilibrium between the
  poor and the rich. In this we are guided by the ANC principles for a
  better life for all and a vision for a better Africa and the world.


  The international front was one of the key pillars of the struggle that
  led to the defeat of the apartheid regime and remains one of the
  catalysts in the creation of a better world.


But how, in reality, has our Parliament engaged with the IPU to realise
this vision of a better life for all? Successive South African IPU
delegations have interacted with other progressive like-minded members of
delegations from other parliaments to ensure that the agenda of the IPU
remains focused on the issues of social injustices like poverty. But the
IPU, like other international bodies, is a terrain of contestation, of
opposing political views.

From South Africa, especially in the ANC, we continue to interact with
other delegations in order to put the issue of economic development
permanently on the agenda of the IPU. The topic we are debating today
“Pushing back the frontiers of poverty”, which will be debated by the IPU
when the assembly takes place in South Africa, was the suggestion of this
Parliament.

As members may have noticed, the President, Mr Mbeki, in the state of the
nation address, also committed the government to establishing a war room
against poverty. This is so because of the genuine commitment of the ANC
and its allies to ensuring a better life for all. It is not a coincidence,
therefore, that our Parliament has also put the eradication of poverty as
the central concern of the IPU.

Some may say that the issue of fighting poverty, as they have said today,
has long been canvassed. I sincerely believe that a public representative
who does not know where the poor live ought not to be in the House.
According to reports of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Africa has
about six million refugees and about 12,7 million internally displaced
people in 20 countries. Africa, according to this report, remains the
largest recipient of humanitarian assistance as a result of natural
disasters, conflicts and the inequitable global order.

These statistics are not only a depressingly frightening indication of the
magnitude of human suffering, but are also a revelation of the extent of
the deliberate infliction, by the powerful, of wounds of exploitation on
the innocent masses.

But none of these lofty ideals can be a success without the dedication of
the critical agent for change, which is the Member of Parliament. We, as
MPs, need to redouble our efforts to ensure that the monies that are paid
by our government at domestic level, international level and in terms of
the United Nations that are meant to eradicate poverty are, in fact, used
for that purpose. We must use our positions to change the situation.

To answer the hon Selfe, therefore, the generals to fight poverty are the
MPs themselves. We must do so as enough money has been spent in South
Africa, on the continent and globally to fight poverty, but this money does
not reach the people. We must ensure that the money reaches the people.
Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chairperson, hon members, the origin and the intentions of
the Millennium Development Goals adopted nearly a decade ago by the nations
of the world can be traced back to the central question that we are
debating today: How do we reduce widespread poverty in the developing
world? If we are concerned about pushing back the frontiers of poverty,
then we need to look no further than the targets that were set in pursuit
of the MDGs.
We don’t need, as an individual Parliament, or collectively as the Inter-
Parliamentary Union, to reinvent the wheel. We must ask ourselves: What
have we done to realise the MDGs and, indeed, what have all the IPU members
done? Where has the achievement of the MDGs featured on our individual and
collective agendas?

Across vast areas of the planet, millions upon millions of people still go
without the most basic housing, access to clean water, decent sanitation,
reliable energy, proper education, basic health care or meaningful work.

Achieving these goals when the global agenda is dominated by war and
conflict is difficult, just as the international economic and trade agenda
is more concerned with disputes, self-preservation and turf wars, which
push the question of fairness and collective action against poverty to the
sidelines. Yet, it is patently obvious that continued widespread poverty is
detrimental to the political, economic and social objectives of the nations
of the world.

It is our duty, as a nation and as a collective in the IPU, to put the
Millennium Development Goals back at the top of the international agenda to
remind ourselves and the rest of the world that the poverty that grips so
many is a stain upon our humanity and makes a mockery of all our so-called
great achievements. I thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Hon I E Jenner, I am told that this
is your maiden speech. Welcome!

Mr I E JENNER: Thank you, Chairperson.

Agb Speaker, ek staan vandag hier namens my party, die OD, om ons standpunt
met betrekking tot armoede uitwissing te stel. In die eerste plek wil ek my
dank uitspreek teenoor my party leierskap wat my in hierdie posisie geplaas
het, en hulle verseker dat ek my taak na die beste van my vermoë sal
verrig.

Armoede is ’n universele probleem wat geen kleurgrens, afkoms, lokaliteit,
geslag of politieke affiliasie ken nie. Die armoede vraagstuk in ons land
vereis kollektiewe en universele verantwoordelikheid. Hoe ernstig is ons
regering werklik met armoede uitwissing as soveel lede vandag afwesig is
vir so ’n belangrike debat? Die OD is die eerste party wat bereid is om in
die openbaar te erken dat die uitdagings wat armoede teweegbring, politieke
grootmoedigheid vereis asook ’n inklusiewe benadering en eenheid van
poging, maar bowenal ’n nuwe verbintenis tot die sosiale kontrak tussen die
burgers en die regering. Die mense van die kontinent sit in afwagting om te
sien hoe die resultaat van kollektiewe verantwoordelikheid ‘n inwerking op
hul lewens het.

Ons ondersteuningsbasis bestaan hoofsaaklik uit die armstes onder die armes
en dus is dit ons pleidooi dat armoede nie langer as ’n politieke speelbal
gebruik kan word nie. Armoede werk verskillend op in verskeie gebiede,
afhangend van die verskillende faktore en plaaslike dinamika. As die
president van ons land ernstig was in sy benadering in sy staatsrede, “All
hands on deck,” is die OD die eerste party wat sal deel vorm van hierdie
eerste linie van verdediging in die stryd teen armoede. Ons sal die
regering deeglik monitor in die implementeringsfase om seker te maak dat
die programme, projekte asook die oplossing sover moontlik, die hele nasie
bereik.

Die OD wil die noodkreet van die armes van die kontinent herbevestig dat
“genoeg is genoeg.” Die OD sal die regerende party se politiek toets, want
die agb Minister van Finansies het herhaaldelik in sy begrotingsrede gesê,
“We are in this together.” Ons wil ook ’n beroep doen op die regerende
party om die departemente in rat te kry, om seker te maak dat die stryd
teen armoede die aksie sal bespoedig en die passie sal ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dankie. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Speaker, I stand here today on behalf of my party, the ID, to state
our position on poverty eradication. Firstly, I want to express my
gratitude to the leadership of my party who placed me in this position and
I want to assure them that I will perform my task to the best of my
ability.

Poverty is a universal problem that goes beyond the borders of colour,
origin, gender or political affiliation. The problem of poverty in our
country requires collective and universal responsibility. How serious is
our country really about poverty eradication if so many members are absent
today for such an important debate? The ID is the first party that is
prepared to publicly admit that the challenges that poverty poses, require
political magnanimity as well as an inclusive approach and a united effort,
but above all a new commitment to the social contract between citizens and
government. The people of the continent are waiting expectantly to see the
results of collective responsibility impacting their lives.

Our support base comprises mainly the poorest of the poor and that is why
it is our appeal that poverty can no longer be used as a political toy.
Poverty impacts differently on different areas, depending on the various
factors and local dynamics. If the President of our country was serious
with his approach in his state of the nation address of having “all hands
on deck,” then the ID is the first party that will be part of this first
line of defence in the struggle against poverty. We will monitor government
thoroughly in the implementation phase to ensure that the programmes,
projects as well as the solutions reach the nation as far as possible.

The ID wants to reconfirm the cry of the poor of this continent that
“enough is enough.” The ID will test the politics of the ruling party,
because the hon Minister of Finance said repeatedly in his Budget Speech,
“We are in this together.” We want to appeal to the ruling party to gear up
the departments to ensure that the fight against poverty will speed up and
the passion will ... [Interjections.] Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr H B CUPIDO: Hon Chairperson, may just I congratulate the hon Jenner on
his maiden speech ... sy nooienstoespraak. [His maiden speech.]

Chairperson, according to a survey done by the Global Insight Southern
Africa, Regional Economics Focus 2005, there happens to be a disturbing
increase in the number of people living on less than one dollar per day
from 1996 to 2004. During 1996, the proportion of people living on less
than one dollar per day was 4,5% and this increased to more than 9% during
2004.

It was also found that the situation worsened for those in the lower income
brackets, while those who started off with more had better financial gains.
It is, therefore, proven again that those who have, will receive more, and
for those who do not have, from them even more will be taken.

Ek kan met die agb Koos van der Merwe hier saamstem dat die rykes sal ryker
word en tot in die bestryding van armoede sal die wat die armoede bestry
aan die einde van die dag eintlik iets daaruit kry. [I can agree here with
the hon Koos van der Merwe that the rich will become richer and even in the
fight against poverty those who fight it will, in the end, benefit from
it.]

The poor will always be with us. The ACDP, therefore, would like to
congratulate the hon Minister of Finance on yet another attempt to drive
back the frontiers of poverty through the announcements in his Budget
Speech yesterday. More and better management of funds can only address a
small part of what is really needed to combat poverty in our country. I
also want to agree with the hon Minister’s address this afternoon in which
he mentioned the responsibilities and functions that the different
departments need to play in order to combat poverty.

The bread price, as addressed by the ACDP in this House, and the price of
maize should receive greater attention from our government. South Africa’s
able-bodied citizens should realise that without self-employment or self-
empowerment, better education and hard work, driving back the frontiers of
poverty becomes impossible. People must be prepared to play an active role
in the economy of our country. No sweat, no sweet!

Success comes by working hard and not giving up on oneself and the ones
that you love. The development of personal capacity and the transfer of
skills from one generation to another will make a difference in driving out
poverty. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr T M MASUTHA: Hon Chairperson, colleagues, as a country and a people we
have come a long way to where we are today despite the many challenges that
still persist. The liberties that we enjoy, the economic stability or even
prosperity that is increasingly being enjoyed by many amongst our people
across the racial, gender and other divides should never be taken for
granted. More amongst our people who live in rural, peri-urban and other
historically marginalised areas have access to clean water, electricity,
decent housing, health care and free education.

Through its progressive labour market and human resource policies, the ANC-
led government, together with other social partners, is slowly making a
dent in the unacceptably high levels of unemployment. This is made possible
through robust economic growth and efforts to increase skills levels,
especially amongst the youth. The Joint Initiative for Priority Skills
Acquisition, the government’s flagship programme for job creation, for
example, created some 18 319 jobs in the past year.

The General Household Survey covering the period of 2002 to 2006 reveals,
amongst other things, that among learners aged between seven and 15 years
attendance rates rose from 96,3% in 2002 to 97,9% in 2005, even though it
declined slightly to 97,7% in 2006.
Education has been identified by the ANC Polokwane conference as a critical
priority, hence the massive allocation of over a R100 billion announced in
the Budget Speech yesterday by the Minister of Finance. An amount of R1,2
billion was allocated to further education and training colleges last year
to reinforce government’s skills drive.

Regarding access to health care, there was a decline in 2006 in the
percentage of persons covered by medical aid schemes: 13,7% in 2006
compared to the 15,2% in 2002, hence there is the need to move with some
speed towards the implementation of a national health insurance system to
increase access to health care for all as per the resolutions of the past
national conferences of the ANC.

However, some 320 447 HIV/Aids patients were receiving antiretrovirals, of
which 32 312 were children by the end of 2007. In addition, some 68 178
community caregivers were receiving stipends by the end of 2007. The
percentage of households that live in informal structures though, commonly
referred to as shacks, rose from 12,7% in 2002 to 14,5% in 2006, continuing
to be a major challenge.

The percentage of households that receive government housing subsidies
increased from 5,5% in 2002 to 9,6% in 2006. However, 260 000 units are
currently being delivered per annum through human settlement programmes.
The percentage of households that use electricity for lighting rose from
75% in 2002 to 81% in 2006 and, at the end of 2007, some 3,3 million
households had access to electricity.

It is heartening to note government’s commitment to continuing to make
electricity more accessible to the poor even in the face of prevailing
shortages. Use of municipal services for refuse removal increased steadily
from 55% of all households in 2002 to 60% in 2007.

The percentage of households that have access to piped water in their
dwelling or on site rose from 66% in 2002 to 75% in 2007 and 68% of the
poor population in general. The percentage of households that used bucket
toilets or had no toilet facilities declined from 13,2% in 2002 to 8,2% in
2005, although it increased slightly to 8,6% in 2006, suggesting a need to
intensify the campaign to eradicate this challenge completely in our
country. Outstanding buckets, however, were reduced to 103 716 households
out of a total of 300 000.

With regard to the social safety net provided through our social assistance
programme, it is pleasing to see the significant growth in the take-up rate
of various forms of social grants which currently total some 12,4 million
beneficiaries compared to just of over 2 million at the dawn of our
democracy.

Today some 2,2 million senior citizens are receiving the old age grant
which, following the Minister of Finance’s Budget Speech yesterday, will
increase to R940 per month together with the disability grant. The three
grant types aimed at supporting children, namely the child support grant,
the foster care grant and the care dependency grant for severely disabled
children, have experienced exponential growth.

Today some 8,2 million children from poor households are receiving the
child support grant which was only introduced, by the way, in 1996-97. Let
me pause here to remind us that we couched the concept of a primary
caregiver as the beneficiary of the grant, that is, the child support
grant, who may not necessarily be the biological parent of the child,
precisely in order to ensure that the money is given to the person who
actually looks after the child.

I therefore urge grandparents who care for their grandchildren whilst the
parents of the children are away or simply unable to do so to insist that
they be the ones that receive the grant because the grant is meant to
contribute towards the care of the child.

Foster care grants had increased in the past few years from about 50 000
beneficiaries to some 435 000 beneficiaries by the end of last year, whilst
the care dependency grant rose to 102 children. Both these grants provide
vital support to abandoned, orphaned and abused children as well as to
severely disabled children respectively.
This is welcome news indeed, thanks to the Minister of Social Development
who spoke here earlier and has pushed for this massive increase because, in
the past, African children particular struggled to obtain foster care
placements on the assertion that they were in any case cared for within the
extended family. This excuse was used as a pretext to exclude African
children.

As the ANC we have reaffirmed our commitment to addressing poverty and
inequality, hence the massive allocations that have consistently been made
in the Budget to social spending. On the back of macroeconomic stability,
we have developed an antipoverty strategy that addresses the income aspect
and social poverty with the objective of eradicating poverty and creating
employment.

In terms of our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals to halve
poverty and unemployment by 2014, we are doubling our effort to fulfil and
realise the Millennium Development Goals in terms of education, health
care, accommodation and the provision of basic services. I thank you. [Time

Mr M V NGEMA: Ngiyabonga Sihlalo. [Thank you, Chairperson.]

In the short time allocated to me, allow me to make two points. The
eradication of poverty largely depends on, firstly, ensuring that the rural
poor are provided with opportunities to play an active role in the economy
by identifying knowledge and policy gaps that could help governments build
infrastructure that is geared towards improving the working and living
conditions of the poor. This can be achieved by building infrastructure to
ensure that the rural poor have access to energy and water.

Secondly, governments need to facilitate intraregional trade and
investment, and address the special needs of land-locked countries in order
for them to access the rest of the world.

Africa is unfortunately characterised by high levels of mortality, high
levels of absolute poverty, a rise in malnutrition, disease and low
literacy levels. In a study done by the Southern Africa Trust, it was
discovered that Southern Africa needed new and improved routes to ensure
that the rural and urban poor are enabled to participate in development
opportunities. In particular, proper roads would provide access to jobs,
markets, social services and health facilities.

The study found and pointed out that integrated development planning was
lacking. While the Southern African Development Community-corridor approach
is potentially useful, weak organisation within the secretariat hampers the
roll-out of effective transport progress. Thank you, Chairperson. [Time
expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Ngiyabonga Sihlalo. [Thank you, Chairperson.]
It is clear that delivery has not been as easy as it appeared it would be
in 1996. Our government has been grappling with challenges in every sector,
and the people of our country remain disillusioned with the one-track
desire for transformation and a better life.

We agree with the hon President that the vision and mission of the South
African government remains the same: to deliver a better life for all and
acquire a true democracy free of poverty and societal inequalities. But how
correct are we if we say that government is on track and acting efficiently
in line with this?

It is criticism that paves the road to success and it is honest to say that
we are challenged in delivery. We aim at diminishing poverty, but we are
challenged by the growing cost of living. We are funding housing, but
housing is challenged by contractual letdowns. We are striving to provide
potable water, electricity and sanitation facilities, but we are challenged
by power outages and threats of water shortages. We are servicing the young
by introducing no-fee schools and feeding schemes, but we have the private-
sector hiking up the bread price.

Poverty kills as it affects our people, but we need to focus on the roots
of this societal retardation and halt the factors that hinder our growth
and the advancement of our people.

We as Parliament need to look at addressing the cost of living and
introduce measures that may serve as a balance of costs in view of basic
necessities such as food, transport, medical costs, bond rates and the
accessibility of all facilities. We strongly suggest that we increase our
allocation to pensioners, who cannot possibly survive on the present grant
they receive per month, and that we also look at extending the child grant
to 18 years of age. As a legislature it is incumbent on us to oversee and
institute legislation that will benefit our people. I thank you. [Time
expired.]

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: House Chair and hon members, in this debate I
wish to focus on the ANC’s work since 2004. In the manifesto in 2004, the
organisation called on South Africans, saying: Let’s have a contract to
create work and to fight poverty together.

South Africans voted in large numbers, heeding this call, and they were
saying to the ANC: “You are our party of hope; we believe in your policies
and together we will walk this path of darkness,” meaning the darkness of
poverty.

Indeed, the ANC committed itself to doing this work and the following has
been done. In the first sitting of the third democratic Parliament, on 21
May 2004, President Thabo Mbeki said we are committed to:

   ... move our country forward decisively towards the eradication of
   poverty and underdevelopment in our country, taking care to enhance the
   process of social cohesion ...


   ... achieve further and visible advances with regard to the improvement
   of the quality of life of all our people, affecting many critical areas
   of social existence, including health, safety and security, moral
   regeneration, social cohesion, opening the doors of culture and education
   to all, and sport and recreation.


   ... successfully addressing the important challenges of persisting racial
   and gender inequalities, the disempowerment of our youth and people with
   disabilities, and proper care for children and the elderly.

In 2005 the President, in the state of the nation address, said to all
South Africans: “Vukuzenzele”.

Ka Sesotho ba re: “Ha ho kgomo ya boroko, tsoha o i ketsetse” [People
should wake up and do something for themselves].

This is translated as people should wake up and do something for
themselves.

In 2006 South Africans agreed that today is better than yesterday and
tomorrow will be better than today. Parliament then passed legislation and
allowed government to draw up programmes that engage our communities to
work together with government in alleviating poverty.

To quote a few pieces of legislation, last year we passed the Further
Education and Training Bill and also education amendment laws to empower
our people by making resources available for youth, especially young girls,
to acquire skills in technical colleges. This legislation is also
empowering parents to have a say in the education of their children. In
terms of housing, Parliament passed legislation that allowed the department
to allocate funds for the poor. I am talking here about the RDP houses, and
we know at present that the subsidy has risen from R23 000 in 2004 to
R36 000 in 2007.

Tše kamoka tše ke mphiwafela. [All of these are for free.]

When we talk about health, there is free health care for pregnant women and
children under the age of six. Le yona ke mphiwafela. [It is also for
free.] On electricity, our people are receiving free electricity that
allows women to do other jobs, especially rural women, rather than taking a
long time picking up wood in the veld. This electricity is free. Ke
mphiwafela mo bathong ba rena. [It is for free to our people.]

There is also water supply: 6 kilolitres per household in urban areas, and
in rural areas we know that there are taps close to our homes that allow
women to fetch water nearby. Le wona ke mphiwafela. [It is also for free.]

Now, if we look at all these programmes providing shelter, land, housing,
water, health and education, and also looking at the indigent policy,
surely our government is committed to changing the lives of our people? And
when we talk about changing the lives of our people or of pushing back the
frontiers of poverty, we are talking about really changing the lives of
women, because we also know that when Africa is spoken about they show a
face of a woman and a child who are hungry and half naked. So by taking
care of this, we are really changing the image of the continent as well.

I also want to call on you, hon members, not to undermine the impact of
these policies and programmes, because as women we know that we are the
worst hit by poverty and this contribution as small as it is, it does
change women’s lives.

Surprisingly, we know that even in a household where the husband or the
wife is not working, at the end of the day, the husband will look to the
wife, hoping to have something to eat but from where, because he knows that
he did not give money. This is a question that you should ask yourself. We
know that women are providers, poor as they are.

In conclusion, I want to raise a few things. I must first say that I
appreciate Madam Speaker’s effort to allow Parliament to give a mandate to
the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegates and to also to give a report-back
to this House. Clearly, this shows how important these topics are and how
willing we are to strengthen those institutions we are participating in at
an international level.

Now, for all of us as parliamentarians to change the lives of the people in
our countries and succeed in eradicating poverty, there are four things I
identified that I would like to share with the House. Firstly, we must pass
legislation that creates a good environment for practising or allowing
trade and making business easy. This will also attract investment in our
countries.

We should also make available soft loans for our people to access capital
so that they can start their own businesses and be self-reliant. We must
also focus on the youth, because they are the future. So, for the
sustainability of the economy in our country, we have to empower the youth
especially the girl-child. We must ensure that our girl-children acquire
the necessary skills, especially business skills, in order for them to be
able to be proud mothers with financial independence.

We know that the economy is decisive. If we apply our minds to implementing
the correct measures in the economy, surely we will eradicate poverty and
our country will become developed. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon members, fighting the scourge of hunger,
poverty and the marginalisation of any person is a fundamental obligation
of any government, and parliaments have the key oversight role to ensure
that these obligations are met.

Over the past few years we have seen the prices of basic food products such
as maize, bread and milk escalate enormously. Food prices are one of the
two major contributors to rising inflation in South Africa today, but
rising food prices are also a global phenomenon and most experts expect the
trend to continue. The escalation is already having a disastrous impact on
the poor and on low-income households, and any further rises will
significantly increase food insecurity in many households.

It is still sad that for many countries in Africa, and after decades of
independence from colonial rule, poverty is still hugely endemic to sub-
Saharan Africa; while in other developing countries, especially Asia and
South America, a marked decline in poverty has been recorded over the last
decade. According to former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, poverty on
the sub-continent, between 1981 and 2002, has continued to climb to more
than an alarming 300 million people. This was said in a speech at the Inter-
Parliamentary Union assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, on 17 October 2006.
To push back the frontiers of poverty, Africa may, for the foreseeable
future, still have to rely on debt relief from rich countries. The G8
countries along with a number of donor agencies are committed to providing
debt relief of more than US$36 billion to the poorest countries over the
next 40 years.

Foreign financial aid will continue to be poured into poor countries to
assist with various developmental needs. However, poor countries are still
experiencing certain constraining conditions when it comes to accessing
foreign funds. Afro-pessimism remains one of the key challenges that
require action from African governments. Although African governments have,
over recent years, developed initiatives to deal with their own problems
among themselves, the timeframe required to measure the success of these
initiatives is still too short. Despite this limitation, there are still
disturbing trends in some African governments to suppress democracy and
transparency, which impact on the rate of development in those countries.

In conclusion, the key to effectively fight poverty is to strengthen the
role of parliaments on the continent. Any poverty-reduction strategy will
have very little impact if it is not accompanied by broad-based
participatory processes, upholding sound democratic legislative procedures
and holding the executive to account. I thank you.

Ms N C MADLALA-ROUTLEDGE: House Chair, we are having this debate in
preparation for our Parliament’s contribution to the IPU conference. As
outlined earlier by others, the theme we are going to be debating is
“Pushing back the frontiers of poverty in the context of globalisation,
international trade and regional integration.”

I also want to add my voice to thank the Speaker for allowing this debate
to happen and to congratulate the staff, who are working very hard
preparing us for this very important conference that is going to be taking
place in our country.

The IPU is an important platform for representatives of parliaments
worldwide to deliberate on issues that are new and unresolved on the
international agenda before they are placed on the agenda of the United
Nations. This deliberation in the context of the IPU helps develop clarity
and understanding of the issues at a global level rather than in our zones
of comfort or discomfort, in the North or the South.

As a host and one of the countries of the South, South Africa would want to
make a significant input to the understanding of poverty in the context of
globalisation. This debate will help us develop the input of the delegation
that will be representing our Parliament and our people.

I’ve used the word “deliberation” rather than “debate” in the spirit of the
IPU, where the intention is not to win arguments, but to facilitate common
understanding and clarity on issues before taking a position. Another
example of how the IPU does this is that delegations are allowed to split
their votes when they hold different positions. It is about trying to find
a creative way forward when confronted with seemingly intractable problems.


I was therefore disappointed when I listened to hon member Selfe who
decided to devote his speech to attacking the government. I think what this
debate is about is for us, as the South African Parliament, to prepare
ourselves for what we are going to be saying at that conference. I don’t
think he had actually considered what the topic was and what this debate is
about.

I want to talk about globalisation. Descriptions of globalisation refer to
the integration of a country’s politics and economics into a single world
market, operating according to a global set of rules. The rules are
intended to apply equally to rich industrialised countries and poor
developing countries.

Globalisation is being facilitated by the introduction of new information
technologies that have made international interaction more rapid, but it is
also a process of restructuring the entire global economic system.

Changes in the world economy and globalisation impose important challenges
on the South. The impact of globalisation is highly uneven and unequal. It
is both an economic and a political process that produces losers as well
winners, leading to a widening of the income gap both within and between
countries. Increasing inequality will eventually lead to a global economic
and social crisis.

Selective globalisation benefits the rich. Global negotiations are rapidly
moving towards a free market in foreign investment and services. Protection
and subsidies by developed countries in textiles and agricultural markets
create obstacles for exports in areas where developing countries are
currently competitive, thus reducing the benefits of globalisation for
development in poor countries.

Indeed, we would expect the hon members of this House to contribute to help
us look at how the rules of trade could be reformed so that our countries,
which are struggling because of the protectionism that is happening to the
north of us, could benefit. In this case, we are then calling on all
members to think very carefully about how our delegation should represent
not only our situation as South Africa, but also that of developing
countries of which we are part.

We cannot ignore or evade globalisation. Some governments have taken a
decision to engage proactively with globalisation. It is the best of times.
It is the worst of times. The South sees globalisation as a source both of
opportunities and of threats, and recognises our strengths and weaknesses
in engaging with it. When we talk of world poverty, it is for us to look at
all of these issues from the perspective of how globalisation affects
particularly us, the developing countries.

The rapid expansion of world trade creates possibilities for a developing
country to boost its economic growth by increasing exports as well as
simultaneously diversifying exports to reduce dependency on primary
products. The threats are that developing economies are unable to enter
protected markets and absorb the shock of rapid capital movements. The rich
industrialised countries enter developing country markets and displace
local manufacturing.

What do we learn from international experience? Developing countries should
formulate policy to counter polarisation and marginalisation. The South
needs to recognise that globalisation has created an imperative to protect
domestic policy and sovereignty and actively engage in the international
arena. The South must strive to maximise opportunities and become an active
force seeking to bring about changes in the global environment that will
benefit the vulnerable. These contradictory objectives need to be balanced
and managed by developing countries.

Developing countries are raising concerns in international forums, such as
the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Africa, Caribbean, Pacific-European
Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The problems of developing nations must
become the concern of industrialised countries. The instruments for global
change also include the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the
Southern African Development Community and the African Union. Developing
countries must assert a united position on the international agenda. But
can we unite our positions?

The policies have to be sensitive to the power imbalances between and
within countries and to the social and economic needs of the poor and
vulnerable.

How can the South survive? It is argued that protectionism of industry in
the South has to be reversed and that commodities and products have to
learn to compete in international markets and against imports as imposed by
the present world economic order. We saw yesterday when our Minister of
Finance was presenting the Budget that we are all affected by what happens
in other countries.

Protectionism has been practised everywhere, enabling many countries to
industrialise. A great deal of protectionism remains in the advanced
countries. The key seems to be in the correct sequences of integration into
world markets. Too rapid integration poses the danger of losing local
firms, shedding jobs and undermining the existing economy. Firms need time
to build up their presence overseas, experiment with product design and
gear up to face international competition.

One of the most difficult issues in sequencing is the phasing out of
domestic tariffs. To strengthen productivity and effectiveness, developing
countries need time to adjust through the gradual phasing out of tariffs
and the addition of various forms of support measures. Decisions are
required on which sectors of industry should be given priority, and I think
this is what we are doing in our country when we develop our industrial
policy.

The growth model imposed on developing countries tends to restrict them
from producing and processing raw materials for export. The argument is
that industrialised countries have a comparative advantage in
manufacturing, machinery and finance, so developing countries should focus
on minerals and other primary commodities, making them vulnerable to
reductions in commodity prices and escalating prices of finished goods,
thereby leading to trade imbalances and foreign debt. The result of such
policies is de-industrialisation, Third World debt, the informalisation of
employment and increasing unemployment.

In recent years, the value of primary commodity imports of the advanced
countries fell heavily as prices have fallen. The result is that developing
countries have received less in foreign revenue. This reinforces the
argument that developing countries must diversify their economies and their
export commodities as an insurance against falling commodity prices. A
sound industrial policy must ensure that some production is dedicated to
exports, some of the domestic market and some for the region.

It is often argued that for the South to become a major exporter, foreign
direct investment, FDI, is needed to rebuild industry. This is partly to
compensate for the low level of savings, hence low domestic investment.
Experience elsewhere is that FDI may crowd out domestic investment,
displacing local capital by foreign capital, thereby advantaging the
latter. Much of present-day foreign capital inflow is short term and
speculative and not long term. Speculative “hot money” is harmful since it
flows in and out rapidly destabilising the economy.

The days of import substitution industrialisation, that is assisting the
local manufacture of goods that replace imported goods, seem to be over
because of international pressure mounting for the opening up of markets.
The conventional wisdom of the Washington Consensus was that a single set
of policies and prescribed macro variables would fit all countries. This
has not worked and is now giving way to a more flexible, nuanced approach.
The pressure for conformity imposed by rich industrialised countries is
negatively affecting poor developing countries.

It is argued that integration into the global economy is inevitably
accompanied by a period of painful transition. In South Africa, there have
been substantial job losses in some industrial sectors, though there have
also been improvements in others and in the informal sector.

Has integration had an impact on employment and poverty? It is clearly
insufficient that skilled jobs be created only in the modern export-
oriented industrial sectors, while vulnerable communities become dependent
upon the social responsibility of the affluent and those employed,
excluding the poorer communities from economic activity. Sustainable
employment is the only redress for societies experiencing poverty. I thank
you, hon members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
