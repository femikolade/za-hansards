Mrs C DUDLEY: Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP I give
notice:

   That I shall call for the House to debate the need for a pro-active
   strategy to be urgently implemented in order to remove illegal and

      1) notes that on Wednesday, 30 January 2008, Alex Harris and Sibusiso
         Vilane returned home victoriously after becoming the first South
         Africans to walk unsupported and unassisted to the South Pole;

      2) further notes that Sibusiso is the first black man to trek to the

         first black man to summit Everest in 2003;

      3) expresses its appreciation for the dedication and sacrifices made
         by both men and their families during these severely challenging
         times; and

         and making such unforgettable history.

Agreed to.

       RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON PRESIDENT’S STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS

The SPEAKER: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President and
hon members, 2008 is a different and a special year for the third
Parliament. It requires our alertness, and our sense of urgency. It
requires indeed a different approach to other years because all of us want
to spend enough time doing as much political work as is possible. I am
quite sure, hon Holomisa, that you agree with me.

And so it is that we have been in touch with the Leader of Government
Business in respect of looking at ways to tighten up our co-ordination
between Parliament and the executive to do everything that we have to do,
but to also do it well. We will all remember that we ended on a bit of an
unfortunate note last year when we encountered difficulties whilst
processing the Children’s Amendment Bill. We promised to go and look at
what the problems are in the processes within Parliament. We did that on 23
January and we are going to provide a detailed report about what we
discovered. We are looking at those issues even as we realise the fact that
2008 is going to be slightly shorter because we all want to rise a little
earlier than normal. There has to be careful focus on the processes as we
deal with the, likely to be big, legislative programme.

This year also, as we come out of the 52nd conference of the ruling party,
we are conscious of some important dates. The hon Nelson Mandela, the first
democratically elected President of this country, will be turning 90 this
year. [Applause.] We believe that this is an occasion to celebrate and to
be marked not only by all South Africans but also by this House. I will
mention the second date that I wish to highlight a bit later.

I also want to touch on the issue that hon Holomisa raised yesterday: First
of all, regarding the letter he referred to, it seems that his office and
the Office of the Speaker have no record of such a letter. [Interjections.]
However, the issue that he raised is an important issue, as he was
referring to the state of the nation debate of 2007. Hon Holomisa had
raised the need for Parliament to consider forming a steering committee and
perhaps looking at a few issues around which we, as South Africans, should
deepen the debate.

During the course of last year, there were some comments about that issue,
including what I thought were misunderstandings of what the President
actually said in response to hon Holomisa. I would like to quote the
President’s response in 2007. He said:

  Parliament will, in its wisdom, decide what to do with this suggestion.
  If Parliament, which represents the will of the people, constituted such
  a steering committee from within its ranks and it asked me to suggest
  three domestic topics that might be addressed, I would suggest that these
  should be: Firstly, social transformation, including the important issues
  of national and social cohesion and a national value system; secondly,
  the eradication of poverty; and, thirdly, the reduction and eradication
  of crime, especially crimes against the person.

The President went on to say that:

   ... as we consider this proposal, we would need to bear in mind that
   these are matters that would require us to be very patient and to take
   our time considering them, processing them and coming up with whatever
   resolution we would want to come up with.

It so happened that although a proposal had been processed within the
structures of Parliament and was ready by the end of the year for
consideration by political parties, it was overtaken by other pressures on
Parliament, and therefore it will now be again submitted to political
parties and then Parliament will, in its wisdom, decide how to deal with
the suggestion. So hon Holomisa would then have another opportunity really
to write the letter that he claims to have written, that somehow your
office is not aware of.

Talking about social cohesion, I would like to refer to a second date, as I
was saying earlier on. This year is a year full of anniversaries and
important dates, and we need to consider, as South Africans, how to use
these days to enrich ourselves and to enrich the future. These dates that I
am going to mention to you relate to the history of this country and the
participation of South Africa in a war that happened in Angola in a place
called Cuito Cuanavale 20 years ago. We have initiated a process where some
stakeholders came together in December and had a workshop on how to mark
this 20th anniversary in a manner that is not gloating about who won and
who was defeated, but in a manner that assists us to learn lessons that
enable us to heal, to reconcile and to teach our children the lessons of
the past. These lessons must in fact make them better future citizens
ensuring that the future will never become the foreign country we’ve been
to in the past, the one that hon Kader Asmal was referring to here
yesterday.

We understand that there are some fellow citizens who have difficulty
coming to terms with history and we want to assure them that our intention
is actually to extend a hand of healing. When we convened the stakeholders’
forum, we also invited South Africans who had fought as part of the South
African Defence Force, precisely because, as we have discovered, there are
many of them who are still very much in pain because of what happened then.
So we thought it is our responsibility for purposes of indeed building the
nation to maintain that we all belong to this country. We did,
unfortunately, find that we were only able to attract one person from the
other side. Therefore we hope that within this House there will be hon
members who are willing to assist so that we can come together and come to
terms with our past, and all the wrongs that we did, and in this way move
forward on a better basis.

We also take this opportunity to refer to an appeal that is in the January
8 statement of the ANC that we should work towards the achievement of a
better Africa and a better world. In that respect I want to refer to the
fact that tomorrow, 14 February 2008, South Africa ... [Interjections.] ...
celebrates Valentine’s Day ... the women of Africa are being hosted by
South Africa at a congress of the Pan-African Women’s Organisation that
opens tomorrow and goes on until the the 17th. If you look at past Hansards
you will come across a debate of this House that was about the Pan-African
Women’s Organisation. I must say when I read the contents of that debate I
am very proud of being a member of this House, especially now that congress
is meeting from tomorrow until 17th. It is by way of such gestures and
contributions that South Africa is moving to a better Africa. At the same
time, as we know, we will be hosting the Inter-Parliamentary Union in April
this year. We will be hosting more than 140 parliaments here in Cape Town
this year, 2008. So we start this year very conscious of the fact that we
have a very busy year ahead. But if we work together and focus on where we
need to improve our functioning and tighten up our interactions, we will
make it, and indeed we agree with the President that it is a year of
Business Unusual. However, it is going to be a year that we will look back
upon with pride that we were actually able to do all the things that we
needed to do. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, hon
President, and Deputy President, Minister Erwin in his response to the
power outages at Koeberg during December 2005 raised the prospect of
sabotage, or as he later put it, outages as a result of human
instrumentality.

What is his response now? In a broader sense, does not sabotage again come
to mind or is it again human instrumentality? This time not by an act of
commission, by throwing a bolt into a reactor, but by omission which is a
failure by government to act. One thing is certain: we are solely
responsible for hampering our own economic growth by failing to plan and
act according to projections in 1998 that predicted the current scenario.

I have to agree with Alistair Sparks when he says he cannot recall any
other event in recent history that has so shaken the confidence of ordinary
South Africans in the future of this country as the result of the
incompetence revealed by the breakdown of our largest and most important
state corporation. It is a disaster of monumental proportions as far as
national morale is concerned.

It is impossible to calculate, at this stage, the full economic impact of
the power crunch. The consensus forecasts of economists, however, put GDP
growth this year at just over 3%; well down on the average of 5% over the
past four years. But, critically, what exactly does this mean in terms of
jobs? Azar Jammine of Econometrix notes that the year-on-year job growth
reached 193 000 jobs last year when the economy grew by 5%. At 3%, we will
be lucky if we create 100 000 jobs this year and with 386 000 students
passing matric last year, there is a real prospect of an increase in
unemployment. What is the impact on existing jobs?

We have heard the mining industry, the manufacturing industry, in
particular the textile industry, sounding grave warnings that retrenchments
are imminent. But the greatest danger and the greatest damage which is
being done is to that of investor sentiment, both domestic and foreign;
fragile at the best of times and now turned negative. This is being helped,
of course, by Eskom’s honest assessment that South Africa should be closed
for business to new big industrial projects till at least 2012.

But this negative sentiment has a broader impact, namely the whole question
of our current account deficit which was estimated at     R130 billion last
year. This we know has been covered by huge inflows on the financial
account as investors have been attracted by South Africa’s growth
prospects. The power outages have, however, had a material effect on
investor’s expectations for growth and profitability. Since the power
crunch, foreigners have turned net sellers on the equity and bond markets
and rates have weakened. Foreign investment in the JSE was R64 billion last
year, an average of R5 billion a month. In the month of January alone this
year, foreigners had disinvested R7,8 billion in the JSE. The last time
foreigners dumped stocks to this extent was in 2003 but that was in the
current account. The deficit was 1,1% of GDP and now it is over 8%.

As a result of this exodus we have seen, the rand has fallen, signalling
that offshore investors will take profit on their South African portfolios
and move their funds to more stable currency areas. This fall in the
currency should have augured well for exports; however, the power crunch
puts a large question mark over this potential, most probably resulting in
a further widening of the deficit due to the widening imbalance in the
trade account. This is the result of hesitant exports on the one hand and
the rising cost of imports on the other hand. One has in mind the huge
higher import component of the infrastructure roll-out, as well as, of
course, oil with its secondary and third round inflationary consequences,
and all this signalling a lengthening of the higher interest rates circle
with even throttling down of economic growth.

And so the failure to act has led this country from boom to the brink of
recession. The hon President says: ``Let us move beyond recriminations’’. I
agree, but first we must address the question of accountability of those
responsible. Firstly, Minister Radebe who was Minister of Public
Enterprises 10 years ago was warned over a period of five years that Eskom
had insufficient capacity to keep pace with the country’s rate of
development if no new power stations were built - yet he failed to act.

Secondly, the Deputy President who was then Minister of Minerals and Energy
signed the White Paper in which the dire warnings on capacity were made,
yet failed to act during her term as Minister. She made the excuse that we
had been a victim of our own success. No, hon Deputy President, we were a
victim of our own lack of planning. Failing to plan is planning to fail.
But the truth is it is not just a demand problem but also a supply one.
Current demand stands at between 33 000 megawatts and 34 000 megawatts,
slightly less than the demand experienced at 36 000 megawatts in the last
winter. Yes, the demand did increase by 4,9% over the same period last
year, but the real problem was an operational one. It was the fact that
Eskom was only producing 80% of its capacity due to scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance - put simply, bad management - of which the
Minister of Public Enterprises seemed blissfully unaware.

He made bold claims in August 2005 that one of South Africa’s economic and
industrial strengths is the quantity and efficiency of its electricity
supplies. In February 2006 he said: “You cannot find as reliable and as
long-term an electricity contract in the world today as Eskom can give.”
And in January 2007 he said: “I am confident that South Africa as a whole
will not be plunged into darkness”. On Monday he said: “The crisis will be
over in six months”. Well frankly, Mr Minister, your credibility is shot to
pieces. Nobody believes a word you say any more.

Ministers, Mr President, need to be accountable, but what of Eskom, their
directors and senior management? They need to be held accountable as well.
A shortage of skills was the real culprit largely caused by putting
political correctness before competence. Two years ago the Financial Mail
interviewed Eskom’s managing director of human resources, Mpho Letlape,
where she is on record as saying that over the next five years, as it
embarks upon its R84 billion infrastructure programme, Eskom has to appoint
two new staff every working day. It is adamant that one of them will be a
black woman; not an engineer, not a technician, not an accountant, not a
project manager, but a black woman. What a misplaced sense of priority when
race and gender trump skills that are needed. Eskom’s lack of foresight
went further ... [Interjections.] They halved their workforce from 60 000
to 30 000, shut down training programmes and left stockpiles and spare
parts at hopelessly inadequate levels. [Applause.][Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President Mbeki, Madam
Deputy President, hon members ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, I think there is a point of order. Please
take your seat.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Deputy Speaker, I am terribly sorry to Minister
Radebe. On a point of order I just need an explanation on whether it is in
fact parliamentary and acceptable that the hon member should find that
black women and engineers are mutually exclusive. Is that what he means? I
want an explanation from him. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Then you have missed the point of my
speech!

Mr C M LOWE: We already know you’re stupid; you don’t have to show it!
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members! Hon member, I don’t think you have to
reduce the debate to that. There is no hon member who is stupid in here.
There is a question that has been asked and I want to address that point.
The point has been raised by Minister Sisulu, and we will look into the
text and come back to you before the end of the debate; probably this
afternoon. Thank you very much.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, more than nine decades of
relentless struggle have placed the ANC as the custodian of our
democratisation process and the leader of the people of South Africa.

Ms M P MENTOR: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Are you allowing me,
Madam Deputy Speaker? Is it parliamentary for Mark Lowe to shout at hon
Lindiwe Sisulu and say: ``We know that you are stupid, but you don’t have
to show it’’? Is that parliamentary?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I just said to him that he should not take the debate
to that level. No hon member in here is stupid, but if what you want is for
him to withdraw those remarks ... Hon Sisulu, please take your seat. Hon
Mentor, if that is what you are requesting, I may request the member to
withdraw those words.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: That word has been
used on many occasions in this House. It may be undesirable in many ways
... [Interjections.] ... and it has never been ruled unparliamentary to
date until now. You cannot expect the hon member to withdraw it. You really
cannot. It has been used many times on both sides of the House before
today.

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Deputy Speaker, in fact the Minister herself shouted
across that the members on this side of the House are stupid.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Seaton, you raise a point which obviously, from
where I am seated, I did not hear, but Hansard must have captured that. May
I when I come back with the ruling for the first member, also deal with
that? I wouldn’t like him to withdraw and not have the Minister withdraw if
they used the same word, that is. Also, it does not mean, hon members, when
wrong things may have been allowed that we therefore want to lower the
debates in this House to that level. We need to respect each other - we are
hon members – no matter how strongly we feel about issues. Let us deal with
those issues whilst respecting each other. May I then come back to this
later on?

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Deputy Speaker, the ANC has consistently pursued
a vision and values aimed at building the South Africa of our dreams - a
future built on peace and freedom, nonracism, nonsexism, equality,
democracy and prosperity for all our people. The Freedom Charter captures
the historic demands of the majority of South Africans whilst providing the
foundation of a common national agenda, which today finds expression in the
progressive Constitution of our democratic republic.

It is understandable, and I must say, well appreciated, that South Africans
are interested in developments within the ANC and in their own country.
After all, the ANC lives and leads and its health is directly linked to the
mood and progress of our nation as a whole. To this end, it is at times
like these that the ANC rises to the challenge and provides much-needed
certainty and leadership about the future of our beautiful land.

It is regrettable that the opposition is missing yet another important
opportunity to contribute positively to this national dialogue and ensure
that it joins hands with the majority in their collective efforts to build
the society that is envisioned in the Freedom Charter. The opposition
should see itself as part of the protected nation-building process
unfolding in front of our very eyes.

Our opponents are labouring under the false pretence that they stand to
gain if the ANC gets divided and weakened. The country needs a strong and
democratic ANC to continue to serve as the glue that holds our diverse
society together, as it has successfully done over the past 14 years. The
wellbeing of the ANC is so much a central part of the outlook of our
nation.

The narrow sectarian positions that the opposition parties have adopted in
the name of the electorate are short-sighted and reflect a continuous
refusal to reciprocate the spirit of generosity and reconciliation from
those oppressed under apartheid. It is time that all of us in this country,
jointly, use this time to mobilise the skills, knowledge and expertise of
those privileged by apartheid to contribute to our collective efforts to
eradicate poverty and to accelerate economic growth.

Instead the opposition has used this current climate to deepen uncertainty.
They choose not to promote the politics of accountability, mutual respect
and nation-building, but choose to attempt the impossible, which is to
reverse the much-needed progressive interventions such as Broad-based Black
Economic Empowerment, worker rights, health for all and other major
transformation initiatives undertaken by the democratic government led by
the ANC.

Only those with short memories will forget the national realisation of a
decade ago that political transformation without significantly improving
the lives of the majority will herald a new era of racial conflict. Freedom
will have no meaning for the majority of our people if the values enshrined
in our Constitution and the vision of Freedom Charter are not turned into
an everyday living reality.

Whilst many are  content  with  the  mere  attainment  of  a  constitutional
democracy and only seek to preserve  the  current  unequal  power  relations
bequeathed by apartheid, the historic mission of  the  ANC,  as  a  people’s
movement, is about the fundamental re-organisation of  social  and  property
relations, particularly in the context of  race,  gender,  rural  and  urban
relations.

The democratic movement of our country, led by  the  ANC,  has  always  been
driven by an understanding that there will never be genuine  freedom  unless
the legacy and material basis  of  apartheid  colonialism  have  been  fully
eradicated. In its pursuit of  its  strategic  goals,  the  ANC  has  always
relied on the active participation of the masses of our people as their  own
liberators - the makers of their own history.

The ANC gives voice to the voiceless and to  the  so-called  uneducated  and
unwashed masses. The ANC makes ordinary people from our townships,  informal
settlements, peri-urban areas, rural areas and hostels, and  those  who  are
homeless and unemployed, young and old, black and white to  be  the  masters
of their  own  destiny.  [Applause.]  Recent  events  in  our  country  have
confirmed that the ANC continues to enjoy the confidence of the majority  of
the people - they cannot be turned against their own movement - and most  of
all, that it will continue to mobilise all South Africans to define and  set
the agenda for social change  in  pursuit  of  the  goals  of  the  national
democratic revolution.

The President’s national call for the intensification  of  the  war  against
poverty is a clear illustration of our  understanding  of  what  constitutes
the single, most important challenge that continues to define the  lives  of
many in our society. The eradication of poverty and  inequality  is  central
to the historic mission of the African National Congress and its allies.  As
we intensify our efforts we, in the ANC, who are  working  with  the  people
are always willing to learn from our shortcomings, continue to evaluate  the
effectiveness  of  our  strategies  and  respond  more  effectively  to  the
challenges that we are facing.

The ANC, as the leading political and social force in our  country,  remains
the bearer of hope for millions of our people, and it is  one  major  reason
why we have peace and stability and not the anarchy, civil strife and  chaos
that accompanied political change in many parts of the  world.  The  history
of too many countries bears testimony to how unattended social and  economic
disparities may become seeds for future conflicts and divisions.

Our  country  has  made  impressive  gains  and  interventions  through  our
democratic government and has improved the lives  of  many  South  Africans.
The President took us to new heights with the  24  Apex  Priorities  in  the
fight against poverty and inequality, as well as setting South Africa  on  a
path of sustainable  growth  and  development.  South  Africans  across  all
divides should at this time join hands, fight  poverty  and  inequality  and
keep South Africa as the flagship of hope in the  democratic  transformation
of our continent and the world.

We must therefore call on all  South  African  patriots  -  irrespective  of
class, gender and political  affiliation  -  to  help  contribute  immensely
towards the resolution of the various developmental challenges still  facing
our country as opposed to reducing themselves to spokespersons of doom.  For
instance, the recent response by solidarity in assisting to recruit  skilled
personnel in the context of the energy challenges facing our  country  is  a
good example of patriots working for a better South Africa  irrespective  of
political or ideological affiliation.

The ANC  was  established  and  evolved  over  the  years  as  part  of  the
progressive  forces  fighting  for  freedom   from   colonialism,   national
oppression and capitalist exploitation.  The  ANC  is  part  of  the  global
forces committed to a  better  and  fairer  world  based  on  global  peace,
equality and friendship. The ANC is a radical and not a  narrow  nationalist
movement and will always stand for the downtrodden and for  the  fundamental
transformation of our society. The history of the ANC suggests that  it  has
always analysed the situation in an objective manner, and adopted a  set  of
strategies suitable to the challenges of the time.

The President’s state of the nation  address  has  really  defined  the  key
tasks in the current phase of our national democratic revolution. These  are
tasks that will ensure that the significant gains of the past 13  years  are
qualitatively transformed to serve as a foundation for  further  social  and
economic progress for a better future for our country.

As we accelerate the pace of change, as well as change the manner  in  which
we deliver it, Business Unusual has brought to the fore the question of  the
role and nature of the democratic state. As the ANC, and taking forward  the
goals of the national democratic revolution, we have  re-affirmed  the  need
to continue  transforming  the  state  to  serve  as  a  key  instrument  in
championing  the  cause  of  social  transformation.   We   speak   of   the
developmental state that will not suppress democracy and workers’  struggles
for better wages, but a developmental state that will  co-ordinate  economic
development and set the framework for social and economic development -  the
state that will drive infrastructure  development  for  the  future  of  our
country.

Our record, as the ANC government, speaks for itself. The democratic  state,
as a critical player in setting our country on a new growth and  development
path, has raised public investment in economic and social infrastructure  to
over R400 billion in the past few years. This increased investment will  see
our country moving from strength to strength. Some of  the  key  instruments
that we are using  through  public  enterprises  and  public  entities  will
ensure that we increase our  capacity  and  build  our  harbours,  airports,
railways, petroleum pipelines and  all  those  things  that  will  create  a
better life for all our people.

Over the past ten years, we have seen concerted efforts  to  improve  access
through the building of clinics as part of ensuring primary health care  for
all our people. The President’s address was therefore not only a  commitment
on the part of the ANC, but a call on the nation  as  a  whole  to  expedite
change and to recognise that this change will in many ways  benefit  all  of
us and ensure that our constitutional democracy is underpinned  by  equality
and prosperity for all, and that this is  our  generation’s  lasting  legacy
into the future.

In conclusion, not only are the people of our country calling on us not to
retreat from the project of constructing a national democratic society, but
the masses of our people want us to join hands in the march to freedom.
They want to participate and continue to be the builders of a better and
democratic future. To the ANC, this is the national democratic revolution
in action. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Deputy Speaker, hon President, Deputy President and hon
members, the announcement made yesterday by the Minister of Safety and
Security that the Scorpions will be dismantled and merged with the
organised crime unit of the police must be rejected with the contempt it
deserves. It is scandalous, highly questionable and irresponsible to target
a very successful crime-busting unit when South Africa’s crime levels are
among the highest in the world.

The Minister also said that the ANC was not being reckless in disbanding
the Scorpions. The truth is the ANC is reckless and I believe that this
decision is a serious blunder that will come back to haunt them in the near
future.

I want to remind members of this House that the Scorpions were constituted
following a careful study of policing systems in other countries. This was
made clear by the then chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice
and Constitutional Development, the hon Fatima Chohan, during a debate in
the National Assembly on 11 November 1999.

She pointed out that her committee had undertaken a visit to the United
States and Canada to study, among other things, their crime- fighting
structures and institutions. She continued to mention that the prosecution-
driven investigation was not only successful in the US and Canada but also
in Germany and Britain. In our case, in South Africa, the Scorpions have
had a success rate between 80% and 90% in all their prosecutions.

The ACDP wants to know why anybody in their right mind would want to
disband such a successful unit, except of course to serve their
questionable motives. May I also remind this House that the Scorpions were
instituted because of the failure of the SAPS to deal with organised crime.

When President Mbeki announced the formation of the Scorpions in June 1999,
he said it was a signal of government’s commitment to dealing with priority
crimes. Today, the ANC has discarded that commitment to the delight of
leaders of organised crime.

When the former New National Party leader raised what he described as
serious questions about the establishment of the Scorpions, the then
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development, Penuell Maduna, said,
and I quote: “The criminal element should be the only ones who are worried
about the Scorpions.” The hon President may or may not agree with members
of the public who suspect that it is the criminal element within the ANC
who are worried about the sting and success of the Scorpions that have no
regard for political connections. [Applause.]

Constitutional law professor George Devenish said that, and I quote:

   The proposed disbanding of the Scorpions must be seen for what it is - an
   unscrupulous attempt to centralise naked power in the hands of ANC
   politicians and their cadres deployed in the management echelons of the
   police.

Our nation is ravaged by crime, and it is therefore scandalous that the
decision to disband the highly effective and successful Scorpions will be
forced through this Parliament even though the majority of South Africans,
many of whom are victims of serious violent crime, are opposed to it.

Mr President, do you agree with those members of the public who say that
the real motive for disbanding the Scorpions is to protect powerful ANC
politicians from investigations? [Interjections.] Is it perhaps because the
ANC wants to remove the Scorpion investigators and prosecutors from the
Jackie Selebi case which is scheduled to be heard in August? Many surmise
that without those competent Scorpion prosecutors, the suspended National
Commissioner will be acquitted and this will pave the way for him to be the
head of the newly organised unit of the SA Police Service that has many
corrupt elements within it already.

On Monday, the acting head of the National Prosecuting Authority, Advocate
Mpshe, is reported to have filed an affidavit in which he said, under oath,
that not only information but also evidence of suspended Commissioner
Selebi’s wrongdoings was presented to President Mbeki and Justice Minister
Brigitte Mabandla. He also said that the President himself was fully
informed of the investigation against Mr Selebi and the nature of the
allegations against him.

He added that besides there being constant communication between Advocate
Pikoli, President Mbeki and Justice Minister Mabandla, Advocate Pikoli also
informed other officials, including Safety and Security Minister Nqakula
and Defence Minister Lekota of the corruption claims against Mr Selebi.

This stands in stark contrast to the claims made by the President last
month that he only became aware of the charges a few days earlier. To
compound matters, President Mbeki then told the media, and I quote:

   I have said this before, many times, that if there was anybody with
   information that shows Selebi has done wrong things, I would act on it.
   Nobody did, nobody came to me.
Mr President, the ACDP believes that in the light of the very serious
revelations contained in Advocate Mpshe’s affidavit, the President owes the
public an explanation and must tell the truth as to exactly when he became
aware of the serious allegations against Mr Selebi, and why he failed to
act then - immediately - to suspend him. The public is also owed an
explanation of how a draft copy of a top-secret letter, dated 7 May 2007,
from Advocate Pikoli to President Mbeki about Commissioner Selebi, ended up
in Mr Selebi’s hands.

The ACDP therefore renews its call for the disbandment of the Ginwala
commission and the reinstatement of Advocate Pikoli, particularly because
government was at all times fully informed of the case against Mr Selebi by
Advocate Pikoli himself.

These are very grave allegations that go to the heart of the President’s
integrity. The President must admit or deny that the main reason for
suspending Advocate Pikoli was not because of a breakdown in relations, but
a deliberate attempt to cover up for Mr Selebi.

Another major weakness I want to highlight is this government’s weakness in
the area of maintenance. Government has spent money on the construction of
new buildings and roads without proper maintenance plans, and, as a result,
the existing road infrastructure is deteriorating very fast.
While roads in Cape Town are not in a bad condition, one cannot say the
same about other cities, including Pretoria, our administrative capital.
Most of our roads are badly damaged and have potholes that are ignored by
the relevant councils. When the President spoke about building
infrastructure, I want to know whether the President also had road
infrastructure in mind. If yes, why is the maintenance and repair of our
roads not an Apex Priority?

In terms of the power crisis, the ACDP believes that some of the reasons we
have blackouts is because Eskom has neglected maintenance and failed to
plan for emergencies. It is also highly suspicious that the crisis occurred
so soon after the coming on stream ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President and
Members of Parliament, strong economies and successful nations are
developed over a long period through sustained investment in people,
productive capabilities and ensuring the greatest degree of participation
of people in all forms of economic activities. It is these ingredients that
were so sorely lacking in the pre-democratic South Africa - a South Africa
that bequeathed to a democratic nation an economy that was imploding.

This now seems like a long time ago as the structure and dynamism of our
economy has been changed so effectively. Against this, the sort of
apocalyptic projections on the economy by some analysts, economists and
commentators seem to apply more to the past than to the present, for the
promise and commitment of the ANC when it formed the first, second and now
third democratic government is undeniably being realised.

The South African economy of 2008 is, in both quantitative and qualitative
terms, a very different economy to that prior to 1994. It must thus be
shocking that some analysts, economists and commentators project the
likelihood of a recession in the current economic circumstances. And, of
course, when one becomes a cheerleader for bad news, it becomes quite
impossible to be positive about anything; to acknowledge even the most
compelling evidence of progress; and to relate to the full complexity of
issues facing our society.

But, of course, South Africa has the ANC - an organisation that is
balanced, systematic, disciplined and consistent - that uses the best
evidence from everywhere, including the developing world, in formulating
its policies and strategies. It is this capacity of the ANC which enabled
us to analyse the social and economic challenges facing South Africa and to
recognise that the South African economy needed to have the fundamentals
right.

The achievement of macroeconomic and financial stability over the years
since 1994 is a product of these qualities of the ANC - balance,
discipline, consistency and evidence. It is because of these and many other
such successes that, as a country, we began to aspire to bigger and better
achievements such as: the diversification of our economy; the pursuit of
accelerated and shared growth; and the transformation of the economic
structure inherited from our apartheid past to ensure inclusion, equity and
sustainable employment for our people.

Are we succeeding? Some of the evidence is that national income has risen
by 22% per person since 1999. Employment is rising faster than at any point
since the 1960s. Fixed investment has grown dramatically from 15% in 2004
to 21% in 2007. Paradoxically, it is now our achievements that present us
with new challenges. The speed by which we need to construct new buildings
and infrastructure is restrained by the 30% increase in the demand for
cement over the last four years, and therefore putting pressure on supply.
We now have 3 million more vehicles on our roads than in 2004 because
incomes are rising for more and more of our people, particularly for black
people. Between 2004 and now, over half a million vehicles have been
exported. Massive energy consumption, growing households and expanding
industries have resulted in an overdemand and of course much hand-wringing.


Indeed, it seems that we have grown so quickly that our house has become
too small. Hon members, is this then the end of growth? Students of
economics will tell you that economies do not come to a sudden halt, even
in the most extreme circumstances. It is like a giant ocean liner which can
go at a great pace when it picks up speed; it takes a long while before the
ship comes to a complete stop even if you have switched off the engine. And
so, yes, we do face new challenges, but our momentum will carry us forward.
Our economic engine is strong because the economy has, during the past few
years, undergone critical structural changes which will, to some extent,
cushion the impact of external shocks. We are therefore confident that the
consumer demand that we have seen, and that has fuelled our growth, will
not disappear overnight, because it is based on higher levels of
participation in the economy and rising incomes of people. Neither will the
ongoing investment-driven growth stop midway because the projects that we
are investing in are multi-year projects. The investment that is taking
place in South Africa today is an investment that is going to be sustained
over the next decade and even over 15 years. If we take a look at the
public transport investment programme, we will see that it is a programme
that is going to run until 2020.

J K Galbraith writes in The Affluent Society that economic life, like other
social lives, does not conform to a simple and coherent pattern. On the
contrary, it often seems incoherent, inchoate and intellectually
frustrating. Hon members, our economic journey has indeed not been
straightforward. The ANC government has from time to time made adjustments
wherever necessary to maintain the momentum of growth and enhance
transformation. We will continue to do so. This is especially so because
the world economy is changing rapidly. To stand still, will be to regress.

In moving forward, we recently assembled leading local and international
economies to benchmark our policies and vision for our economic future.
This exercise revealed a remarkable convergence of approaches on the way
forward and affirmed the foresight of the ANC’s stewardship of the economy.
This exercise also confirmed that, now, we have begun to claim our stake in
the world economy.

Our new relationships present more threats and opportunities. But, through
improved planning and consistency in policy implementation, we can
simultaneously reduce these threats and optimally exploit the
opportunities. So, in the cluster of economic departments, we are
undertaking economy-wide interventions in four broad areas to sustain the
step change in the economy’s growth rate and entrench its structural
transformation. Firstly, we have set out to enhance economic efficiency in
the South African economy, focusing on areas such as: improved and more
efficient public transport; Information and Communications Technology, ICT,
usage and uptake; skills development; economic regulation that is
efficient; as well as addressing the issues of competition in the economy.

Secondly, we are also undertaking very precise targeted efforts to promote
dynamic growth sectors in the economy across a whole range of sectors. I
will speak about those in a short while.
Thirdly, our commitment to broadening participation in the economy will
intensify. The South African small enterprise sector remains underdeveloped
to our detriment. Therefore, we are making a massive push to support this
sector, including co-operatives through financial and other measures and
stronger use of state procurement.

As we undertake these interventions to improve economic performance, we are
also giving special attention to four critical areas with the potential to
impact on and deepen structural change in the economy. These are the areas
of ICT infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, as well as ensuring
that we can reposition the energy sector and enhance our capacity to
generate energy to diversify our energy mix. I would like to say at this
point that there is no reality to the assertion that there is going to be a
halt to the investment drive to South Africa or that there is going to be a
halt to promoting South Africa as a destination for investment. There is no
reality in that we will not be able to support the Alcan Aluminium Smelter.
All of these matters are simply matters that are going to require better co-
ordination, planning and sequencing to make sure that the coming on stream
of the Alcan Aluminium Smelter, for example, is in line with the new
electricity generation capacity coming on stream.

Hon members, our strategies also involve the deepening of
industrialisation. In this regard it is befitting to recall what the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, RDP, said:
   Reconstruction of the economy must be linked to development. In the
   process, a more dynamic manufacturing sector will emerge as a growing
   source of productive and well-paid employment opportunities and
   industrial learning. The present weakness of the manufacturing sector
   must be judged in terms of the global trend, in which markets for
   manufactured commodities are growing more rapidly than those for natural
   resources.

For this reason, the central objective for the National Industrial Policy
Framework, NIPF, and the Industrial Policy Action Plan, IPAP, is to
diversify and strengthen manufacturing with an emphasis on nontraditional
tradable goods and services and labour-intensive activities. In this
context, we have identified four leading sectors in which we will undertake
targeted interventions. These are the areas of capital goods, transport
equipment and metals fabrication. This is an area that will ensure that we
can maximise benefits for the economy from the massive infrastructure
investment programme that is going on at the moment. We have identified the
automotive sector with a view to deepening the manufacturing aspect of
motor vehicle assembly to increase a local content. We have also identified
chemicals, plastic fabrication and pharmaceuticals, as well as forestry,
pulp, paper and furniture, with a particular focus on the more rural
communities.

We are doing work in many other sectors of the economy because, in the
South African context, in order to resolve the issues around jobs and
raising the rate of growth, we have to work across the economy in all
different sectors. There is a lot of other work that is aimed at enhancing
our industrial capabilities. We are confident that these initiatives will
strengthen competitiveness and contribute to growth and employment in these
and other targeted sectors. Certainly, in this context, financing our
industrial policy actions is critical and we are in a position to reap the
fruits of the prudent management of our economy as resources for supporting
industrial development are available. We will continue to employ these
resources as effectively as possible, counting on industry to reciprocate
through investment and value addition, and also with the understanding that
government support is not a perpetual thing.

Furthermore, we will maximise opportunities for industrial development in
the massive infrastructure roll-out programme, particularly with regard to
rail freight, energy products, airports and the upgrading of ports.

So, from our perspective, our successes are clear and we will remain firmly
on course. I think we can confidently say, Mr President, that the legacy
that you are going to leave for the next government is a legacy of an
economy that is including its people more and more. It is a legacy of an
economy that is growing at a higher rate than it has grown for more than
three or four decades. It is a legacy of an economy in which there is a
higher rate of investment than there has been for more than three decades.
It is a proud legacy that you leave behind, Mr President.

It is, however, obvious that even as we are making such good progress, the
complex process of economic transformation that we are undertaking is a
long-term effort. There will be challenges along the way and there will be
sharp debates both in government and in political parties and also in
society in general. In a way, these debates must continue and they are
necessary. They are necessary because the project that we are pursuing -
the national democratic project - is a project that contains what can
sometimes be seen as conflicting objectives. This is because as you are
trying to address the needs of the poor and the weak and the disadvantaged,
you are also trying to make sure that those who have resources invest their
money in this economy. Therefore, these debates are necessary precisely
because of those competing objectives that we pursue as government.

The debates are also necessary because we are dealing with a dynamic thing
called the economy – an economy that is ever-changing and that is ever
producing new challenges. Therefore, those of you who are scared of some of
the debates that we have should not be scared. We regard those debates as
necessary debates in order to make sure that we always find the best
balance out of the myriad of things that we have to address.

Therefore, Mr President, I would like to say that the legacy that you are
going to leave is indeed a good legacy of a healthy economy. It is also a
legacy of great clarity about the issues that still need to be addressed in
this economy. [Interjections.] Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker.
[Applause.] [Time expired.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Deputy Speaker, hon President, South Africa is at present
in the midst of a corruption crisis, in the midst of a service delivery
crisis, in the midst of an energy crisis and in the midst of a crime
crisis. In the Health department the President fired the wrong Minister and
now the ANC is closing the crime-combating unit, the Scorpions. The FF Plus
totally condemns this as a case of throwing out the baby with the
bathwater. These crises test the leadership of the President, but they also
test every one of us as elected representatives.

I experienced President Mbeki’s address as a departure from the cold and
business-like style which had characterised his term in office. The
President openly acknowledged what he called the deep sense of unease that
exists about where our country will be tomorrow. This differed from some
speeches in which the ANC tried to justify every problem or blame it on
apartheid. With this approach the President took on board not only the
concerns of his own party, but also those of our supporters. Our supporters
want to know that the President is aware of their problems.

In the face of the serious power crisis the President made a call for unity
when he urged South Africans to unite as never before and strain every
sinew of the nation’s collective body to address common challenges. The FF
Plus strongly criticised the government and Eskom about their extremely
poor planning, but we also reacted positively to the President’s call to
address these problems jointly.

Eergister het die VF Plus ’n lys van 1 800 name aan Eskom se topbestuur
oorhandig. Dit is mense met vaardighede wat vrywillig hul name op die VF
Plus se webblad geplaas het. Onder dié name is 145 ingenieurs, 92 mense met
MBA-grade en 42 persone met doktorsgrade. Een van die eerste vrae wat ek
van sekere ANC-lede hieroor gekry het, was of hierdie persone almal wit is.
Ek weet nie. Ons het dit nie op die webblad gevra nie.

Dis wel persone met vaardighede wat werkloos is en voel hulle kan ’n bydrae
lewer. In die middel van een van die grootste krisisse wat hierdie land nóg
beleef het, waarin die mynbou die eerste keer in 100 jaar tot stilstand
gekom het, is sommige ANC-lede steeds besig met rasse-ideologieë en
regstellende aksies.

Nou wil ek die vraag vra: Wat is vir die ANC die belangrikste? Is dit die
oorhaastige, rasbehepte transformasie by Eskom soos ons die afgelope tyd
gehad het of eerder die oplos van hierdie probleem wat duisende mense hul
werk kan kos? U weet, 15 000 mynwerkers kan hul werk verloor as dinge nie
opgelos word nie.
Kom ek vra, wat is vir die ANC die belangrikste: Is dit die oorhaastige,
rasbehepte transformasie by, byvoorbeeld, munisipaliteite of is dit
dienslewering waardeur miljoene mense water, toilette en huise kan kry?
Onthou, die meerderheid van hierdie mense is swart.

Nou sê ek vir u, geen organisasie in die wêreld kan steeds doeltreffend
wees ná só ’n groot omset in personeel soos ons die afgelope paar jaar by
Eskom gekry het nie. Hierdie is nie ’n rasseargument nie, dis ’n gewone
bestuurswaarheid.

As ek persoonlik nie ten minste 10 jaar ervaring in ’n spesifieke rigting
gehad het nie, wil ek nie hoof van Eskom, direkteur-generaal van ’n
department of hoof van ’n metroraad wees nie. Nou moet ANC-lede nie weer ’n
rasseargument hierin lees nie; ek sê dis normale bestuursbeginsels wat ook
waar is vir enige organisasie in China of Nigerië. Wat is die belangrikste?
Kom ons leer uit Eskom se ervaring. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The day before yesterday the FF Plus presented a list of 1 800 names to
Eskom’s top management. These are people with skills who voluntarily
entered their names on the FF Plus website. Among them there are 145
engineers, 92 people with MBA degrees, and 42 people with doctorates. One
of the first questions certain ANC members asked about this was whether
these people were all white. I don’t know. We did not ask for this
information on our website.
What I can say is that these are skilled people, who feel that they have a
contribution to make. In the course of one of the greatest crises we have
yet experienced, where mining has come to a standstill for the first time
in 100 years, some ANC members still indulge in racial ideologies and
affirmative action.

Now I want to pose this question: What is more important to the ANC? Is it
the hasty, race-obsessed transformation of Eskom such as we have seen
recently, or rather the solution of this problem, which could destroy
thousands of jobs? You know that 15 000 mineworkers stand to lose their
jobs if this matter is not resolved.

Let me ask what is more important to the ANC: Is it the hasty, race-
obsessed transformation at municipalities, for instance, or service
delivery which can provide millions of people with water, toilets and
houses? Remember, the majority of these people are black.

Now I want to say to you: No organisation in the world can remain efficient
subsequent to such a high staff turnover as we have seen at Eskom over the
past few years. This is not a racial argument, it’s a mere fact of
management.

As for myself, I would not want to be appointed as the head of Eskom, or as
director-general of a government department, or as head of a metro council,
unless I had at least 10 years’ experience in the relevant field. Once
again ANC members should not read this as a racial argument; I am saying
it’s merely sound management principles, which apply equally to any
organisation in China or Nigeria. What is really important to us? Let us
learn from the Eskom experience.]

Transformation rather than delivery became Eskom’s driving force. They
awarded themselves with big bonuses for achieving racial targets instead of
delivery targets.

U weet, Dirk Herman het navorsing gedoen oor die nie-aangewese groep by
Eskom. Wat het hy bevind? Dat 55% van hulle vervreemd voel en dat 77% voel
dat hulle binne Eskom nooit aan hul beroepsverwagtinge sal kan voldoen nie.
Daarom is dit nie vreemd dat daar verlede jaar 80 Eskom-vakmanne Australië
toe is nie. Hierdie maand alleen het sewe voormalige Eskom-ingenieurs by
Western Power in Australië begin werk. Ek sê vir u, Suid-Afrika kán dit nie
bekostig nie!

Verlede week het mnr Zuma in ’n toespraak, interessant genoeg, die volgende
gesê:

    As South Africans we must come to terms with the fact that the more
    skills we have in the economy, the more jobs we can create.

Ek stem daarmee saam. Stem al die ANC-lede ook daarmee saam?

Agb minister Nqakula het aan ons mnr Groenewald hier gesê van ons, toe hy
oor misdaad kla, hy moet die land verlaat. Verkies die ANC dit? Is dit hul
oplossing? Ek is jammer vir die ANC, maar oor 50 jaar van nou af gaan die
ANC reeds opgebreek het en nie meer hier wees nie, maar dan gaan ons nog
hier wees; daar is nie twyfel daaroor nie.

In Dar es Salaam by ’n konferensie het’n Tanzaniese parlementslid ernstig
met my kom praat. Wat sê hy vir my? Hy sê: Julle moet asseblief nie van jul
Afrikanerboere ontslae raak nie ...

Dis nou sy boodskap:


    Besef julle wat hulle vir julle werd is? Ek wens ons kon hulle in
    Tanzanië kry om te kom help om vir ons mense kos te produseer.

Ek het hom verwys na die tafel waar die ANC-afvaardiging gesit het en gesê:
“Gaan praat met hulle, nie met my nie.”

Ek het onlangs geluister na ’n Afrikaleier wat Suid-Afrika prys as die
ekonomiese reus van Afrika. Dis ’n prestasie, maar hy het my tog laat
wonder: Hoekom is Suid-Afrika die ekonomiese reus van Afrika? Is dit omdat
ons soveel minerale het? Nee, Angola en die Demokratiese Republiek van die
Kongo het méér minerale as Suid-Afrika.

Is ons die ekonomiese reus omdat ons olie uit steenkool kan maak? Nee,
Sasol se ou bietjie olie is maar ’n druppel in die emmer teen Nigerië se
groot hoeveelhede. Is ons die ekonomiese reus omdat ons sulke goeie
landboutoestande in Suid-Afrika het; ons voer tog kos uit? Nee, alle
klimaatstudies wys dat Suid-Afrika ’n semi-droë woestynland is met min
landboumoontlikhede. Mosambiek en Malawi het beter potensiaal as dit.

Is Nigerië met sy olie en Egipte met sy toerisme nie ekonomies sterker as
Suid-Afrika nie? Suid-Afrika is ekonomies meer as twee keer so sterk soos
Nigerië en amper drie keer so sterk soos Egipte. Suid-Afrika is ekonomies
80 keer sterker as die gemiddelde Afrikastaat. Ons het die beste paaie,
krag- en telefoonnetwerke in Afrika. Ons aandelebeurs is een van die tien
grootste in die wêreld. Ongeveer die helfte van alle teerpaaie in Afrika is
in Suid-Afrika. U weet, Nigerië het drie keer ons bevolking, maar net ’n
tiende van ons krag - u moet gaan kyk hoe lyk dit daar.

Nou sê ek, as Suid-Afrika nie die rykste is aan minerale het nie, nie die
meeste olie of beste landboutoestande het nie, waarom is ons dan die
ekonomiese reus? Omdat daar oor baie jare swartmense en witmense
gesamentlik ’n unieke bydrae gelewer het en kundigheid ingeploeg het om
Suid-Afrika te bring tot hy waar hy vandag is. Ek is trots daarop. Ek is
ook trots op die Afrikaner se bydrae daartoe.

Wanneer ek na die ANC se nuwe geskiedenisleerplanne en –boeke kyk, word die
Afrikaners spesifiek uitgesonder as diegene wat in die verlede niks goed
gedoen het nie en alles verkeerd gedoen het. Ek sê dit is feitelik verkeerd
en bied ‘n ongebalanseerde geskiedenis.

Ek stem saam met die President dat die huidige krisis vra vir samewerking
en vir “Business Unusual.” “Business Unusual” sal wees dat ons regstellende
aksie staak. Stel die beste persoon vir die werk aan. In ’n krisis behoort
dit nie saak te maak of hy swart, pienk of blou is nie.

In die verlede het ons ernstige probleme soos dié gehad en dit opgelos. In
die olieboikot het ons Sasol ontwikkel; in die wapenboikot het ons ’n
krygstuignywerheid ontwikkel. Ons kan dit weer doen en ook hierdie probleem
oplos.

Volgende week kom afgevaardigdes van vyf lande in Gaborone bymekaar en Suid-
Afrika is deel daarvan. Hulle gaan praat oor die Inga-hidroëlektriese
kragskema in die Kongo-rivier. As hierdie skema ontwikkel en voltooi word,
kan dit 90 000 Mw krag opwek. Dis genoeg om die hele Afrika te voorsien en
nog na Europa uit te voer. Sulke projekte is positief. Dit gee hoop. Dit
voorkom emigrasie.

Suid-Afrikaanse ingenieurs is reeds besig met die beplanning daarvan. Gaan
die ANC ook vra of hulle wit of swart is, of gaan ons die werk doen en
Afrika op dié manier red? [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[You know, Dirk Herman did research on the non-designated group at Eskom.
What did he find? That 55% of them felt alienated, and that 77% felt that
they would never be able to fulfil their professional aspirations at Eskom.
It is therefore not surprising that 80 Eskom professionals left for
Australia last year. This month alone, seven former Eskom engineers started
to work at Western Power in Australia. I am saying to you, South Africa
simply cannot afford this!

It is interesting to note that Mr Zuma had the following to say in a speech
he delivered last week:


    As South Africans we must come to terms with the fact that the more
    skills we have in the economy, the more jobs we can create.

I agree. Do all the ANC members also agree?

The hon Minister Nqakula said to our Mr Groenewald, when the latter
complained about crime, that he should leave the country. Does the ANC
prefer this? Is that their solution? I pity the ANC, but in fifty years’
time the ANC will be disbanded and will no longer be around, but we will
still be here; there can be no doubt about this.

At a conference in Dar es Salaam, a Tanzanian member of parliament
approached me in a serious manner. What did he say to me? He said: Please,
make sure you do not get rid of your Afrikaner farmers.

This was his message:


    Do you realise how valuable these people are to you? I wish we could get
    them to come to Tanzania, to help us produce food for our people.

I referred him to the table where the ANC delegation was sitting and said
to him: “These are the people you need to talk to, not me.”

Recently, I listened to an African leader who praised South Africa as the
economic giant of Africa. That’s an achievement, but nevertheless he got me
thinking: Why is South Africa the economic giant of Africa? Is it because
of our mineral wealth? No, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
are richer in minerals than South Africa.

Are we the economic giant because we can produce oil from coal? No, Sasol’s
insignificant quantity of oil is a drop in the ocean compared to the huge
quantity of Nigeria. Are we the economic giant because we have such
favourable conditions for agriculture in South Africa; after all, we export
food? No, all climate studies concur that South Africa is an arid semi-
desert country with limited agricultural potential. Mozambique and Malawi
have greater potential for agriculture.

Is Nigeria with its oil and Egypt with its tourism not economically
stronger than South Africa? South Africa is economically twice as strong as
Nigeria, and almost thrice as strong as Egypt. In economic terms, South
Africa is eighty times as strong as the average state in Africa. We have
the best roads, electricity and telephone networks in Africa. Our stock
exchange is one of the ten greatest in the world. Almost half of all tarred
roads in Africa are in South Africa. You are aware that Nigeria’s
population is thrice as big as ours, yet they only have one-tenth of our
electricity – you should see for yourself what things are like there.

The point I am making, is this: If South Africa does not have the greatest
mineral wealth, or the greatest quantity of oil, or the most favourable
agricultural conditions, why then are we the economic giant? Because for
many years, blacks and whites jointly made a unique contribution and
devoted their expertise to make South Africa what it is today. I am proud
of this achievement. I am also proud of the Afrikaner’s contribution
towards this achievement.

When I look at the ANC’s new history curriculum and textbooks, the
Afrikaners in particular are singled out as those who have done nothing
good in the past but who have done everything wrong. I maintain that this
is factually incorrect and portrays history in an unbalanced way. I agree
with the President that the current crisis requires co-operation and
“Business Unusual”. It would be “Business Unusual” if we brought
affirmative action to an end. Appoint the best person for the job. In a
crisis situation it should not matter whether this person is black, pink or
blue.

In the past we had serious problems similar to this, and we solved them.
Faced with the oil boycott, we developed Sasol; we responded to the arms
boycott by building our own arms industry. We can do it again and solve
this problem as well.

Next week, delegates from five countries will gather in Gaborone, and South
Africa is one of them. They will discuss the Inga hydro-electric power
scheme on the Congo River. Once this scheme has been developed and
completed, it will be able to generate 90 000 Mw of power. That’s enough to
provide for the whole of Africa, and to export the surplus to Europe. Such
projects are positive. They give us hope. They prevent people from
emigrating.

South African engineers are already involved in planning this project. Will
the ANC once again ask if they are black or white, or will we get down to
work and save Africa in this way? [Time expired.]]

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr President, a wise man spoke to his
son and told him: “Inside you, you have two wolves. The one is evil, and
the other is good. They fight for supremacy.” The son asked: “Which one
wins?” And the wise man replied: “The one you feed”

The President’s address on Friday was a damning indictment of the
government’s administration of South Africa. He indicated that it was now
necessary to switch to the gear of “Business Unusual”. Obviously, “business
as usual” landed our country in the quagmire in which we find ourselves.

What has gone wrong with “business as usual”?

Meneer die President, in die eerste instansie u en u administrasie het oor
jare heen onbevoegte persone aangestel om belangrike poste te beklee. Ek
verwys nie na “affirmative action”, regstellende aksie, nie; ek verwys
daarna dat u mense aangestel het wat dit verdien het op grond van hul
lojaliteit, nie omdat hulle die werk kan doen en vir ons mense kan sorg
nie.

Tweedens, meneer, die administrasie in Suid-Afrika het toegelaat dat
dissipline by die deur uitvlieg. ‘n Gebrek aan dissipline sien ons onder u
ministers; ons sien dit in die staatsdiens; ons sien dit veral ook in die
polisie, waar jy net nie meer mense kan vertrou om hul plig te doen nie.

Derdens, die administrasie het toegelaat dat oneerlikheid, korrupsie en
selfverryking op alle vlakke posvat en gedy, tot dermate dat op plaaslike
regeringsvlak daar nou skelms in munisipale poste aangestel word.

Meneer, die kersie op die koek: Dit het ‘n gewoonte geword vir die
administrasie om nie na die belange van die publiek en u eie mense te sien
nie, maar om die politieke mag te gebruik om u eie beskermlinge te beskerm
en te bevoordeel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr President, in the first instance, you and your administration have
appointed incompetent people to fill important posts over the years. I am
not referring to affirmative action; I am referring to the fact that you
have appointed people who owe their appointments to their loyalties, and
not to the fact that they are competent to do the work and care for our
people.

Secondly, sir, the administration in South Africa has allowed discipline to
be thrown out of the window. A lack of discipline is what we see among your
Ministers; we see it in the Public Service; above all, we see it in the
police, where people can no longer be trusted to perform their duty.

Thirdly, the administration has allowed dishonesty, corruption and self-
enrichment to take root and to flourish at all levels, to such an extent
that, at local government level, rogues are now being appointed to
municipal posts.

Sir, the cherry on top of the cake: It has become habitual for the
administration not to take care of the interests of the public and of your
own people, but instead to use political power to protect and to benefit
your own protégés.]

Nothing illustrates these four ills of our administration better than the
present saga involving electricity and the Pikoli/Selebi/Scorpions saga.
This saga must be judged against the alarming background of the public
having no faith in the police. This is shown through many reports and it is
shown in the fact that less than 50% of the public even bother to report
crime. They have no confidence. Now you want to close down the one light of
hope that we have.

In addition, we now learn – and I don’t know whether it’s true – that the
President was briefed repeatedly on the NPA investigation into Selebi. Now,
his statement that nobody had brought him evidence of wrongdoing on
Selebi’s part, has become questionable.

But, most alarming of all, the government is going ahead with disbanding
the Scorpions. Surely, it’s “business as usual”, or, rather, “business as
we have come to expect.”

Is there nobody in the ANC with integrity and the courage to stand up and
say “No”, because you know, hon members, that this is a step in the wrong
direction? You know that.

And you also know, as the hon Asmal has said, that 90% of South Africans
are proud of their country. Of course, it may be even more than 90%, but a
very small percentage at this stage is proud of their government. That is
the truth.

The government is failing ... [Interjections.] ... you included the very
people - your people - who voted it into power; your people who are
expecting you to deliver services.

Agb Speaker, Meneer die President, my familie en my mense ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] My primêre mense is die mense wat vir my gestem het.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Hon Speaker, Mr President, my family and my people ...
[Interjections]. My people are primarily the people who have voted for me.
[Interjections.]]

All the people! My family has been in South Africa for 330 years. We have
made a contribution ... [Interjections.] ... maybe even more than you have,
and I want to serve my country. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! If you have a question, please rise
and pose the question to the member. No questions?

Dr J T DELPORT: No, surely not; they won’t dare do that! The ANC has
achieved political power ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I’m trying to protect you, hon members. Please don’t
provoke the hon member.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Madam Deputy Speaker, would the hon
member be prepared to take a question? I know he’s a very brave man.

Dr J T DELPORT: Oh, from you, any time!

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Could you just clarify this question
of “your people”? Who are “your people”? I’d just like to know.

Dr J T DELPORT: If the hon member would just listen. I’ve said “my family”
are here. My family has been here for so long, even longer than the family
of that hon member who is sneering over there. I must tell you a story that
he told me at Kempton Park - when we were talking about bomb-throwing - but
we’ll come to that.

No, sir, allow us to serve South Africa. Allow us to assist in feeding the
good wolf of peace and prosperity. We want to do that.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, there is a hand.
Prof B TUROK: Madam Deputy Speaker, will the hon member take a question?
The question is ... sorry ...[Interjections.]

Dr J T DELPORT:  Who’s asking the question? Are you in two camps?
[Laughter.] ... [Interjections.] They represent the two camps! [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Turok was the first to ask for an opportunity to
ask a question.

Prof B TUROK: The question is a simple one: Why are you repeating the
speeches that we heard for the past two days?

Dr J T DELPORT: Because I can deliver the speech more effectively and I can
deliver it so that the people out there will understand. Yes, sir, please!
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: You don’t control the House, sir. I have to give the
hon member an opportunity to ask a question.

Dr J T DELPORT: Give me more chances to answer questions, Madam, and I will
sink them.

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: I don’t think the hon member has answered
hon Erwin’s question. Instead, he baited him about the length of residence
of his ancestors in this country. I still want him to clarify what he means
by “your people”.

Dr J T DELPORT: I mean, first of all - and I will repeat what is in my
written speech: “Mr President, my family has been in South Africa for 330
years.” [Interjections.] That’s my starting point. But I have many people
who vote for me and my party, and I speak on their behalf. Because I am an
Afrikaner, I speak Afrikaans, and I love this country. I’m a South African
and I can make a better contribution than you can! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon member! Hon Delport! Hon Delport! Hon
member, will you please stand there while I address you. When we stop you,
you have to leave the podium! You know as well I do, that you made
reference to those words several times before you came to that point about
“your family”.

I think that I need to come back to this point, also because I heard it
several times before this paragraph to which you are now referring, and we
will have a ruling later on. I’m just saying that, when I control the
House, and I tell you that your time has expired, please take your seat.

Dr J T DELPORT: I apologise, Madam Speaker, but I was never stopped. In
fact, you allowed further questions.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I did. I tried to stop you.

Dr J T DELPORT: If I was stopped, I ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you please take your seat now?

Dr J T DELPORT: I apologise.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker. May I ask you what you are going to
investigate about what Dr Delport said? Nobody took a point of order. How
are you going to investigate as to whether he said anything wrong? I mean,
there’s nothing to investigate.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, Mr Ellis, wait until that time when I deal with
that matter, and you’ll get the opportunity to say whether it is relevant
or not.

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, under which Rule are you going to carry this
out?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you please sit down?

Mr M J ELLIS: But what matter, Madam Deputy Speaker ...?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you please sit down? The hon member has been asked
about what he said in his speech. And then he says ... Don’t say “so what”,
Mr Waters, don’t say that! Are you interested in an explanation?

Mr M J ELLIS: I’m looking forward to it, Madam Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am addressing Mr Ellis. I don’t understand this
excitement going on here. The member did mention the words for which an
explanation was asked, and he said he never said them. So I’m saying that I
will get the Hansard, because he did say them. I’m also listening as I am
seated here. So when I come to that point, I will give you an opportunity
to address me. Sit down please!

Ms F I CHOHAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I never want to get on your wrong
side!

Members, Mr President, Deputy President, in her speech yesterday, the hon H
Mgabadeli reminded us that, after the advent of democracy, we had the truth
and reconciliation process. Ordinary South Africans were asked to forgive
the really hard, tough stuff – the loss of loved ones, murders, tortures in
detention, deaths in detention and abductions.

They were called upon by leaders, really great leaders, leaders like former
President Nelson Mandela, the late great Oliver Tambo, the giant intellect,
Govan Mbeki, nation-builders all. These were the leaders who called for
reconciliation, who called for forgiveness.

Yet again, with the special pardons, ordinary people who were victims of
human rights abuses will be asked to reach rather deeply to put the
interests of our nationhood, our oneness, ahead of our apartness. Again, by
and large, our people will do so. [Interjections.]

They will put ... all of our people ... Unlike you, I am talking about all
our people ...

Mr A H NEL: Madam Speaker, may I rise on a point of order?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is a point of order, hon member.

Mr A H NEL: What is the difference between the ``our people’’ that was used
now, and the statement that our hon member made earlier?

Ms F I CHOHAN: I’m happy to take the question ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is no difference because you are not asking a
question. You are not asking her to tell you what she means by ``our
people’’. During the previous speech, there was a question precisely so the
member could say who he was referring to. So that is the difference.
Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker ...

Mr A H NEL: Hon Speaker, may I then ask: Who are the people the speaker is
referring to as ``our people’’?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: You have, firstly, to ask whether she would like to
take a question.

Mr A H NEL: Will she take an answer, sorry, question?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: She won’t take an answer; she may take a question.
[Interjections.]

Ms F I CHOHAN: I’ll take a question.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you take your question, hon member?

Ms F I CHOHAN: I certainly will, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Interjections.] I’d
like to answer that question, if you don’t mind, hon member.

The answer ...

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: On a point of order, Madam Speaker, in order to
assist the House, I am prepared to assist the member in explaining the
difference between ``our’’ and ``your’’. [Laughter.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, I have already dealt with that matter.
Please take your seat. Hon Chohan, will you please allow the member to ask
you a question, because you said you would take a question?

Ms F I CHOHAN: Yes.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, it’s your time to ask the question.

Mr A H NEL: Hon Speaker, I would like to ask the speaker at the podium who
is being referred to as ``our people’’?

Ms F I CHOHAN: Madam Speaker, the first question he asked was what’s ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, no! You must answer this question.

Ms F I CHOHAN: I am answering. Yes. I want to answer him holistically and
fully because, clearly, he’s some stranger who’s been beamed down from
Mars. [Laughter.]

The first question that he asked was: What’s the difference between ``our
people’’ and what the previous speaker said? The difference is that I am
saying ``our people’’, and the previous speaker denied that he said ``my
mense’’ [my people].

Now, when I say ``ours’’, I mean us as South Africans. I mean South
Africans – black, white, and any other colour in between; South Africans,
all South Africans; all of them victims of human rights abuses during
apartheid. [Applause.] I hope that clarifies it for the hon member, because
this is an important issue that the hon member raised yesterday.

She said that it is important to put the interests of our nation ahead of
our apartness. She said that we do so with difficulty, but we do so. These
are not small things, she said, that we ask of people. These are tough
things, things that great leaders ask of people.

The hon member said, as well, that when these perpetrators of abuses asked
for forgiveness, it was readily available to them. But, she said that in a
time of a national crisis such as this, when we are faced with the energy
situation which requires a national effort, and when the President has said
``The buck stops here’’, then there is very little forgiveness.

Then, instead, you have a very comical scene of the two leaders of the
opposition parties in this House, the hon Patricia de Lille and the hon
Sandra Botha, rushing to this podium with their proverbial and profound
solutions to all our energy problems. ``Off with their heads,’’ is what
they proclaim. Very, very much like the proverbial Queen of Hearts in Alice
in Wonderland: Off with his head, her head, her head, and by the way, let’s
just dissolve Parliament, why don’t we. [Interjections.] That’s the
solution ... [Interjections.]

Where is the leadership? You want accountability; we want leadership from
you, and so do the people in South Africa, all the people in South Africa.
[Applause.]

In the Brazilian experience, as cited in the World Bank study, the
situation was very similar to what we have now. In 2001, Brazil experienced
the kind of crisis that we are experiencing now. The cause of it was a
sequence of years of drought. [Interjections.] They are very, very reliant
on hydropower in Brazil ... [Interjections.]

I’m not listening, because you are not making any sense, and if you were to
just listen, you perhaps will understand that this is not the time to be
“Mickey Mousing” about. [Interjections.] This country needs leadership; it
doesn’t need funny hairstyles! [Laughter.]

The Brazilians made a national effort. They made a national effort to come
together. Their grid would have been fine had they built sufficient
generating capacity. However, they were in a situation in 2001 where they
faced the national crisis. They needed to save 20% of their electricity
usage. The question was how to do it. The obvious answer was rolling
blackouts and quotas. They opted for the quotas. People were penalised
heavily for using more than their allocated quota. Repeat offenders were
cut off, and savings were rewarded. These were particularly hard times for
the people in Brazil.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, there is a point of order.

Mr A LEON: May I ask the hon member a question, Madam?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Will you take a question, ma’am?

Ms F I CHOHAN: Madam Speaker, I have literally 40 seconds left.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The answer is “no”.

Mr A J LEON: It will take two seconds.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Leon, the answer is “no”. Hon member, please
continue.

Ms F I CHOHAN: I’d prefer to finish my speech. [Interjections.]

Critical to this Brazilian experience, which was cited by the World Bank as
the best international experience at times of energy crisis, was the fact
that they were able to hold hands and pull through the hard times. They
were able to do it together, and they managed to do that. They managed to
do that with enormous success, but it was only because they were able to
pull together as a nation. [Interjections.] Yes, you do it during the rugby
championships and when we win the World Cup, but not when it really
matters!

In Brazil, because of the national effort, people were able to, within
eight months, meet the savings target. There were consequently no rolling
blackouts that became necessary. Industrial production actually grew, and
even the poor were able to contribute through incentives.

They commend, internationally, this practice, and I think in essence ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Ms F I CHOHAN: The question was posed by the hon member: Where is the
leadership, where is the nationhood, who do we look to, apart from the
Queen of Hearts? [Applause.]

                    WELCOMING OF FORMER WHIP DAVE DALLING

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, we are joined this afternoon in the
gallery by a former member, a former Whip of this House, Mr Dave Dalling.
Welcome. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President and the hon
members, over the years that President Mbeki has presented his account as
Head of State, we have had to contend with, among others, being on course,
having entered into a contract, the Age of Hope and currently “Business
Unusual”.

All these bring to mind what used to be a stock question in the Political
Science Department of Unisa in the 60s. And the question was: Why did the
ANC fail?

In the eyes of all, the ANC had done all necessary to take over the
government at the time. They had the Freedom Charter in hand, strategies
and tactics in place, their White, Green and Yellow Papers and perhaps
their army but just could not implement or deliver by taking over
government.

The situation is repeating itself - endless strategy meetings, briefings,
workshops, makgotla, izimbizo, etc – yet, after all these they cannot
implement and deliver.

The UCDP has, however, noted that the President has stated in his address
that in the spirit of “business unusual”, I quote: “... we cannot ... wait
for strategies and dialogues and workshops, important as they may be.” But
we all know that the ANC is betrothed to elaborate consultations at the
expense of service delivery.

It is unfortunate that this practice tends to rub off onto Bafana Bafana.
They make elaborate preparations, exchange good passes, build-ups, but fail
to deliver by scoring goals that matter and in the end they lose the games.


The government has missed the golden opportunity to capitalise on being
accepted by all across the board, because they have concentrated on
transformation at the expense of delivery.

It has been more important to belong to the ANC rather than being a loyal
citizen of South Africa. It is therefore not surprising that, nowadays,
even within the ANC ranks, those who are perceived as loyal to whoever,
lose hold of office and are systematically being sidelined. Those who
belong to other political parties can thus know that they have no future in
this country regardless of their colour.

When the Directorate of Special Operations, DSO, was launched with fanfare
in September 1999, no one in the ANC saw any wrong in it. One wonders
whether members of the directorate are at fault for calling on the struggle
heroes to account. Some are on record as saying they fought for the freedom
of this country and yet they are haunted by the Scorpions. The mandate of
the DSO is to fight crime without fear or favour.

Having heard and noted what Minister Nqakula has said on the matter, we
hope the President will come out clearly and state in unambiguous terms
that this directorate has come to stay to fight organised crime regardless
of its location and the perpetrators. The UCDP believes that the President
will live up to his word and appoint a co-ordinator of the criminal justice
system, as promised, to Business Unity South Africa.

It is unfortunate that in 2008, the international year of sanitation, the
government has yet to eradicate the bucket toilet system, though we were
promised that after 2007 all that would be history. For the record, there
are 46 887 buckets still in use. This, surely, Mr President, will blot the
good record already set en route to meeting the Millennium Development
Goals.

We hail the undertaking that tax incentives will be introduced to attract
investors. Factories are standing vacant in Mogwase, Kudube and Thaba-Nchu
because the new provincial government that took over in 1994 showed neither
respect nor regard for investors. The result was the latter’s departure
from the areas and the rise in unemployment and, subsequently, poverty.

The question of astronomical cost at Telkom has always found a room in
previous addresses with promises of reduction, but costs continue to rise
by the day. Apparently that is why it has not been referred to in the
particular speech. It is apparently unstoppable.

The issue of land reform remains a sore thumb to all South Africans across
all colour lines, political spectrum and religious formations. This has to
be addressed and dealt with and laid to rest.

While we welcome the raising of child support grants to include those above
the age of 14, and the lowering of pension age among men to age 60, thus
initially covering some 500 000 of them in an effort to alleviate poverty,
we in the UCDP have reservations about the fact that the country is
gradually being turned into a welfare state.

The introduction of the youth pledge in schools should have long been done.
We would even urge that character-building movements such as scouting and
girl-guiding be introduced too. After all, all of us in this Chamber have
subscribed to an oath to be in here.

The sooner the base slate changes on geographic and place names is
presented the better. Name changes are also a cause for polarisation in the
nation. We welcome this exercise as at times it tends to be used to get
even with some people. Who knows, in two years, all streets bearing the
name of Thabo Mbeki will have changed.

Elsewhere, we complained about poor service delivery which is the
responsibility of officials. But officials in this country are equally
politicians. In some instances, they hold offices higher than those of
their Ministers. There is bound to be a problem of delivery on these
matters. The President was right three years ago when he said learners must
learn, educators must educate, public servants must serve Batho Pele and
leave politics to political practitioners – the politicians.

Finally, there have been calls from some of my colleagues on the left that
Parliament should either be dissolved and there was a motion of no
confidence in the President, but we in the UCDP say this, as Shakespeare
put it in words through the mouth of Macbeth. I quote: “So far have I waded
in blood, that sitting down is as good as going forward.”

On that note we say to the President: Soldier on. Go on and make sure that
you deliver the country. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms T V TOBIAS: Mhlonishwa Sekela Somlomo ... [Hon Madam Deputy Speaker ...]

Mohlomphehi Mopresidente wa Rephaboliki ya Afrika Borwa. [The hon President
of the Republic of South Africa.]

... die agb Adjunkpresident van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika ... [... the
hon Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa ...]

... hon members, the leadership that the ANC provides to this country is
the best in the struggle for freedom against colonial and apartheid rule.
And at the end of the mandate of the third democratically elected
Parliament, the people are indeed still governing.

The confidence displayed by the masses of our people in the ANC-led
government humbles this organisation of our people and will therefore
continue to hold the fort up to a point where the national democratic
revolution has arrived at its logical conclusion.

The ANC conference in Polokwane, the January 8 Statement and the state of
the nation address gave us a clear mandate on what should be the focus of
both the government and the legislature in conjunction with key priorities
of both the above-mentioned institutions in the current financial year.

The President of the ANC, Comrade Jacob Zuma, in his opening remarks at the
ANC NEC lekgotla, said:


    We carry the hopes of our people. For a long time to come the ANC will
    remain the only political entity able to lead the country.

The President of the country, Thabo Mbeki, also said:


    What I do know and hereby make bold to say is: whatever the challenges
    of the moment, we are still on course!

Madam Speaker, I cannot agree more with the leadership of our organisation.
Therefore, we as the elected public representatives, from both sides of the
House, having listened to the President of our country outlining key Apex
Priorities should have the honour and decency to engage objectively in a
debate that would further enhance and clarify the policy position. Our
intentions should be to develop the socioeconomic conditions of the people
of South Africa and to avoid the gimmicks of justifying why South Africa
was better pre-1994. Cheap political point-scoring will not answer the
complex questions facing both the people and the second economy. We should
commit ourselves to working towards building a nonracial, nonsexist and a
democratic society and also not shy away from acknowledging the challenges
experienced by our government when executing its mandate.

We also need to subscribe to the notion of a united society, as reiterated
by the President. The Wordnet home page on the Internet describes or
defines unity as “an undivided, unbroken, completeness or totality, with
nothing wanting.” My own interpretation of this definition is that we as
public representatives need to commit ourselves to be complete and immune
from want and be able to achieve a better life for all.

Afro-pessimism, which still shows its ugly head, reduces African leadership
to a bunch of rogue elements and unwise women and men of little integrity
and the standards are set through Eurocentric ideas undermining the culture
and tradition of our people. And, it imposes its views, which our people
simply ignore, except that public representatives are left with the
temptations to justify their existence.

Going forward, we also have a responsibility to correctly interpret the
Apex Priorities and in relation to economic transformation, the development
indicators in the mid-term review of 2007 does report that the GDP was
intended to grow at 4,5% per annum from 2005 to 2009 and at 6% from 2009 to
2014 and the indicators reflected growth higher than the target. Of course,
we reached the target and went beyond. I think we should applaud our
country for that. [Applause.]

It further elaborates on the challenges that are brought about by the
growing economy which, I predicted, will form part of the basis of the
discussions today as people opposed to the ANC government do not
philosophically and objectively debate how economic growth can have both
negative and positive impacts on the lives of our society. Hence, the focus
on energy and the Directorate of Special Operations matters without looking
at the whole meaning of economic transformation and building a single
effective public policing service, and hence the comment by hon K R J
Meshoe, and to address the fact that 70% of our population did not have
access to material resources and protection prior to 1994. This is the
challenge that the government is besieged by.

As per the indicators, growth per capita has been at 4,5% and population
growth at 1,06% and the average wealth per person will rise to over 3%.
This, Madam Speaker, is a sign that our government is creating employment
for our people, and access to resources changes the provision of services
hence there is a strain on energy. Both services capital and otherwise were
affected, therefore, our government has also taken responsibility to
regulate the market. It has also invested in the industrial policy and this
allays the fears articulated by Robert Kuttner when he warned that:

   The global political economy is that nations are losing sovereignty to
   private actors and further reiterating that the state must take fiscal
   responsibility as it is the institution accountable to the people, vis-à-
   vis banks and private corporations.

Setjhaba sa heso, haholo-holo setjhaba se ha rantsho, sena ha se bolele
hore batho bohle ba fumantshitswe mesebetsi e bolokehileng ya boleng ba
boemo a hlomphehileng le merokotso e kgonang ho tsamaisa malapa a bona.
Hape, sena ha se bolele hore bofuma bo fedile, empa sena se bolela hore

mme o tla tswella ka ho theha mesebetsi e nang le molemo le ho fumantshwa
tsebo le bonono, re re: “Tsiya lala makwala re none”, mabapi le ho kgaoha
ha phephelo ya motlakase, hobane “E kgotswa e le maoto mane”. (Translation
of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Fellow citizens, especially the black nation, this does not mean that
everyone has found ideal and secure employment with enough benefits that
will enable them to advance the quality of their families’ lives. Again,
this does not mean that poverty has been eradicated, but this only means
that in the last 15 years our government has created jobs and reduced
poverty, and it will continue to create quality jobs and to provide
knowledge and skills. Therefore we apologise for the inconvenience caused
by power outages because “To err is human, to forgive divine.”]

As part of economic transformation and job creation, government committed
itself to at least halve unemployment between 2004 and 2014, to a maximum
of 14% by 2014. In the indicators it was demonstrated that unemployment
figures started falling in 2003 and it will continue to fall if the economy
keeps growing at the rate of 6% between now and 2014. We have increased our
investment in labour intensive programmes led by the Department of Public
Works. The trend analysis also noted the fact that unemployment is still
high among the youth, especially young women.

However, our government committed itself to creating one million jobs and
the progress report received on the EPWP in September last year indicated
that the EPWP will alleviate unemployment to a minimum of 40% for women,
30% for youth and 2% for people with disabilities by 2009 through labour
intensive projects, environmental and social programmes and also through
the development of learnerships and incubation programmes. By September
last year, 845 406, which is 124%, job opportunities were created. So, hon
Comrade Thoko, we are about to reach the one million target.
Congratulations! [Applause.]

The skills development of the youth has been addressed through government
intervention through the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition,
by building skills and capacity to stabilise the currency and close the gap
between the rich and the poor which is measured by the Gini coefficient
measures and our balance score card shows that we are on track.

However, there is still a need to merge Umsobomvu Youth Fund with the
National Youth Commission to establish one national youth development
agency as was resolved earlier to ensure an integrated approach towards
youth development. The youth and women formations in our communities should
also deal with issues of poverty and unemployment by engaging Umsobomvu
Youth Fund, the South African Youth Council and the South African Women in
Construction to make sure that development takes place.

The ANC conference also resolved that there should be no school fees by
2009 and also that the Department of Education will embark on the campaign
of the massification of literacy through different programmes which the
Minister of Education will present.

History has also proven that farmworkers continue to face challenges with
regard to proper services and landownership, and these challenges are
addressed through the land redistribution programme - through the willing
buyer, willing seller principle. As this programme is also faced with
challenges, our government will have to take a firm decision to expropriate
land as a final option because the property sections in the Constitution
are not adhered to. The property Act of 1975 is also not consistent with
the Constitution and by expropriating our government will be addressing
issues of equitable shares, landlessness and public interest.

Finally, this year we are celebrating the 58th anniversary of the ANC Youth
League’s 1948 programme of action of radical African nationalism; the 21st
anniversary of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale. We salute the cadres of the O
R Tambo generation, the Angolan, Namibian, and the Cuban revolutionaries
who participated in the battle for our freedom and thank the President of
the Republic for his “forward moving” marching orders.

This, Madam Speaker, is ``Business Unusual’’.

“Kgomo tseo le manamane a tsona”. Pula! [Best wishes, everyone. I thank
you.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam, our hon President has fallen victim to the party rule
and the system of deployment from the top which he himself developed and
drove. His party thinks it can tell the President of the Republic what he
must do, when he is in fact accountable to the people of South Africa
through their Parliament; not so, sir? He is not a mere deployee soldiering
on. His party thinks that it can tell MPs what to legislate and when, as in
the case of the Scorpions.

Xolela Mangcu recently quoted, in the Business Day, correspondence he had
received on the concept of deployment after Matthew Phosa’s threat to give
dissenting ANC leaders at all spheres and levels their “marching orders”.

”Deploy is a military term,” wrote his unnamed correspondent.

   For this term to apply to MPs is to negate the nature of Parliament and
   to confuse military order with civic responsibility. It imposes a form of
   order of dictatorial kind in what should be a forum of debate.

He continues: They have no individual moral agency; they are not answerable
to their own conscience so long as they remain ANC MPs.

Madam, I come from a political tradition in which the words of Edmund Burke
in 1774 to the electors of Bristol will always resonate, and resonate all
the more when Luthuli House has taken the place of any electors whatsoever.
I quote:


  It is a representative’s duty to sacrifice his repose to his constituents
  and to prefer their interests to his own. But his mature judgement, his
  enlightened conscience he ought not to sacrifice to any man.

“Government and legislation are matters of reason and judgement,” he wrote.
And what sort of reason is that in which the determination precedes the
discussion - the case of the Scorpions - in which one set of men
deliberated and another decide; and where those who form the conclusion are
perhaps 300 miles distant from those who hear the argument further in our
case.

Instructions issued which the Member of Parliament is bound blindly to
obey, arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and from the
Constitution.

ANC MPs in the first democratic Parliament, Madam, exercised individual
agency. Parliament is the legislative authority of the state. No one can
ultimately tell us what or how to legislate. Only the courts, another
separate arm of the democratic state, can reject our laws for
unconstitutionality. No one - not Parliament, not government, and certainly
not the National Executive Council, NEC, of the ANC - can tell the judges
how to exercise their consciences, their judgment and their agency.

Yet, we have witnessed in the weeks after Polokwane the new ANC leaders
attacking the Bench for assertions of independence. Moreover, telling
judges that a fair trial is impossible - shocking - and that judges cannot
be objective.

Now that is exactly the same spurious argument systematically made against
the media during the exact years of this hon President’s term, from the
media racism inquiry of 1999 right up to the Polokwane media policy, both
driven by people who do not wish the media to cover allegations or findings
of criminal conduct by ANC leaders, Ms Christine Qunta then, and members of
the NEC now.

The basic architecture of a constitutional democracy has been broken down
under this President’s watch. Your government, hon President, has tried to
take the running of the courts into their own hands. Your party, sir, has
been sending Parliament NEC instructions for so long that our unhappiness
about the location of the political leadership of the party in the same
pair of hands as the leadership of Parliament is simply not understood; our
unhappiness is simply not understood. Your party, hon sir, has brick-by-
brick begun removing the foundations of the freedom of the Fourth Estate,
right from the start with the Equality Act of 2000 and right up until the
Film and Publication prepublication censorship Bill of last year.

Now the ANC is in the hands of people who are so utterly ignorant or
alternatively so utterly hostile to the constitutional checks, balances and
fundamental freedoms that Mr Blade Nzimande thinks he can extend the purge
to the private press and get rid of Mathata Tsedu, and our fellow
negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa finds it necessary to write for the Sunday Times
to explain what a good idea a Constitution is and what it is for.

Have we lost everything 12 short years after we completed the final
Constitution? Now, the answer is: Not yet, but we may do so if we do not
correct this now. The older democracies are consolidated because they have
historically overcome episodes of regression and corrected themselves.
America self-corrects. It is doing so again now, but this is our first
test.

We understand that the hon President did not have much room to manoeuvre in
his speech, because the deployer has become the deployee, trapped in his
own system. Jeremy Cronin is now the new commander, that much became clear
to me yesterday, and since I do not think that the hon Jeremy runs South
Africa all on his own, I assume it is Gwede Mantashe and Mr Blade Nzimande
no doubt; in short, the SACP, hon Jeremy, embedded reds by the looks of it.

Now, we would have liked a speech, we would have liked a speech that
transformed the moment of crisis. The hon our President had it in him,
rhetorically at least, to be a transformative leader or he did when he made
the “I am an African” speech - before it all deteriorated into crony
capitalism. This will now be replaced by Cronin economics, judging by
yesterday’s debate.

We have to watch Barack Obama now to get our transformation fix. And every
time I do - and I’m a great follower - I remember what South Africa was
like when we reinvented ourselves during the transition. Now, the hon
Minister of Justice spoke nostalgically here about the Constitution as if
it were a dead letter. But we are still here as we were here, many of us,
here and part of its writing and we will keep it alive. Members of
Parliament I hope will - as the hon leader of the IFP said - fill the void
and rise to the challenge. It is not too late to correct, but if we fail
the first time there won’t be the second. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs L E YENGENI: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President and Deputy President,
Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, as early as in
1992, the ANC prepared itself for the challenges that would emanate from
the establishment of a democratic society. In anticipation of these
challenges, the ANC produced the document Ready to Govern. That document
acknowledged that South Africa had been a closed society with many
restrictions on the flow of information and that the structure of the
media, resources, skills, language policy and social deprivation had
undermined access to information for the majority of the population.

The Polokwane conference of the ANC, like many conferences before, took
resolutions that are aimed at transforming the South African media. Amongst
those are the unity and coherence of the movement. The ANC is one of the
oldest liberation movements on the continent and in the world over. It has
demonstrated a capacity to unite and to lead, contrary to what the South
African media and opposition parties are propagating.

This particular resolution is aimed at strengthening unity amongst
ourselves as the ruling party, the alliance partners and the broader
democratic movement.

The Polokwane conference took a resolution on the battle of ideas. The
essence of this resolution is that the ANC must take full responsibility in
communicating its views, policies and principles that have moulded it to be
what it is today.

It is not an accident of political history that the South African media and
the opposition are waging an ideological war against the ANC and its
leadership. There are pretences from certain quarters that those in the
media are innocent. They are not influenced or impacted by the political
dynamics of society, and their views are objective. They go further to say
that journalists and editors are independent, and that’s a myth.

The question is: Why is the media distorting or rubbishing the idea and not
entering into serious debate on the matter? Let the media publish the
entirety of the ANC resolutions so that our citizens are afforded equal
opportunity to engage and debate the matter rather than to be told by print
media what to think.

Whilst we are debating these issues, it needs to be stated categorically
that as long as we do not have diversity of views in the print media in
South Africa and do not have newspapers owned by the black and poverty-
stricken masses, these problems will exist forever. The ANC has always
championed the cause of diversity of views and ownership in the media.

The resolution on a 60% funding increase for the SA Broadcasting
Corporation, SABC, is aimed at freeing the public broadcaster from the
dictatorship of the commercials. We do not want the SABC to be the lapdog
of government, or of the ANC, or any other party for that matter. We want
them to be a proper public broadcaster that informs and entertains all our
people in their diversity.

The SABC must stop being the mouthpiece of big business and certain
powerful politicians. It must be a mouthpiece for expressing the noblest
aspirations of South Africans in their entirety.
The danger of not having the diversity of views and ownership in the media
is that one dominant view that reflects economic ownership patterns in the
print media is imposed on everyone without any alternative view finding its
way into the pages of newspapers.

For example, when the ANC leadership announced appointments of the Chief
Whip of the Majority Party and the caucus chairperson, we were told that
this was purging of the so-called Mbeki supporters.

The fact that the National Executive Council, NEC, took the decision that
these leadership positions must be held by NEC members so that the ruling
party is better able to exercise direct leadership of its MPs and caucus
has never found prominence in the pages of newspapers. What we are told by
all newspapers, without exception, is that the new NEC has a major problem
of purging those who did not vote for their preferred candidate at
Polokwane.

Of course, there has been no purging of anyone on the basis that they
supported someone else at Polokwane. My question here is: Why is there no
space given to the ANC leadership to explain themselves on these issues as
prominently as they are attacked on the front pages? The attack on the ANC
leadership for purging is a transparent attempt by the media and opposition
to intimidate the ANC leadership from resolutely implementing the Polokwane
resolutions.

Polokwane is a historic event for the poor masses of our country and,
therefore, it cannot be business as usual. That would be disregarding
people’s wishes. Why do we have a conference? The ANC will effect changes
whenever it deems it necessary.

Let us be clear that the media and the opposition can shout and scream;
they can jump up and down all they like - we will not be intimidated. Those
Polokwane conference resolutions will be implemented, and to prove the
correctness of these resolutions - come the 2009 general elections - the
masses of the people will vote for the ANC overwhelmingly and we will be
put back in government. [Interjections.]

Before Polokwane, the media and its bevy of analysts were full of horror
stories about what will happen if and when Jacob Zuma becomes the President
of the ANC. Polokwane has come and gone; Jacob Zuma is the President of the
ANC and the skies have not fallen. [Applause.]

The ANC is indestructible. We are now busy uniting our forces and
sharpening our spears in anticipation of taking on the opposition, together
with its media, during the 2009 elections. I have no doubt in my mind that
the ANC will emerge victorious, and the opposition and its media will
remain defeated, with their long and smelly tails between their legs.

The leadership that emerged from Polokwane was democratically elected by
the branch delegates of the ANC from the length and breadth of the country
through transparent democratic processes. The DA and the media may not like
Zuma and certain members of the new NEC, but we expect them to uphold and
respect the integrity and the outcome of that democratic process. Who said
we like Helen Zille? [Laughter.]

The cheap call by the DA and the ID to dissolve Parliament and pass a vote
of no confidence in President Mbeki cannot go unchallenged. The ANC rejects
these infantile cheap shots from this discredited bunch of complainers.
[Applause.] This President and Parliament are going nowhere.
[Interjections.]

Moulana M R SAYEDALI-SHAH: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of
order. Madam, is it not unparliamentary to refer to hon members as a
“bunch”?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Continue, hon member.

Mrs L E YENGENI: Comrade Mbeki will continue to be a pain in your necks not
only until the end of his term, but also until the end of his days.
Parliament will dissolve only after we have defeated you in the next
election, and you will be back in your few, little miserable opposition
benches. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,
hon Ministers and fellow colleagues, I kindly convey the best wishes of the
leader of the MF, Mr A Rajbansi, to the hon President, the Cabinet and to
our Madam Speaker for the important tasks that the ANC has entrusted upon
her.

South Africa has a multiparty democracy ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon Rajbally! I’m trying to get an audience.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam. So, am I getting an extra minute?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No. You are not getting an extra minute; you just
stopped your time. That was a good try.

Ms S RAJBALLY: South Africa has a multiparty democracy. We are pleased that
the President has met with the leader of the DA on many occasions. My plea
to the hon President is that he extends his courtesy to the leaders of all
political parties in his remaining period in office.

For the record, Mr President, Madiba has visited the leader of the MF to
have discussions with him on no less than 30 occasions in his Presidency,
and last year, he invited Mr and Mrs Rajbansi to have tea with him.
In your Apex Priorities, while we praise your programme, it is very
important that every opportunity must be given to everyone to become
skilled and, like in India, everyone must have the opportunity to become
self-made entrepreneurs. The mistake our country is making is that we are
spending too much money on high capital projects and not revitalising the
small ones. India and China are flourishing because every area has job
creation activities.

The grave concern in our country is about electricity, and very soon we
will have grave concern about water. The government has failed miserably to
provide funds for electricity infrastructure and Eskom’s greed to have
total monopoly is a cause of this - not from 1994, but from 1980. While the
present government has apologised, the decision to close down power
stations began with a decision from the previous government. Why is Eskom
calling back former engineers? Why are we getting rid of highly qualified
people, who can serve South Africa, because of their colour?

The new ANC treasurer, Mr Matthew Phosa, clearly explained the affirmative
action policy at the Polokwane conference. Every community must be pleased
with the explanation given by Mr Matthew Phosa, and government must ensure
that all levels of the ANC policy on affirmative action as expressed by Mr
Matthew Phosa is applied and not abused.

Private companies from anywhere in the world should be allowed in
partnership with the local black economic empowerment, BEE, policy to erect
the much needed power stations so that we can give the people hope for the
future.

We need a water policy that will enable us to get water from the Zambezi or
the Nile, or turn seawater into drinking water and recycle waste water.

Paying close attention to the hon President’s reference to Charles Dickens’
A Tale of Two Cities, I strongly agree that it is imperative to remind
ourselves constantly of our cause to instil democracy in every crevice of
society, whilst demolishing poverty and social ills. I, however, find it
just as imperative to measure progress against exactly two cities, that is
the apartheid regime and today’s democracy.

However, we have to realise that delivery has been hindered by the
overwhelming circumstances we have found ourselves in. I believe that it is
not the system of democracy that should be criticised, but the realisation
that delivery is not as clear-cut as one, two and three.

Many challenges arise and this results in a depreciation of community-
government confidence due to minimal communication and frosted
transparency. If we are to reaffirm that we remain on track, then we need
to inculcate a crystal clear, transparent and accountable government to the
people.

A true democracy is one that operates transparently and consciously fulfils
its duties of being answerable to the people. However, we need to also take
heed that the majority of South Africans are from impoverished households
and it is important to monitor and oversee the effective filtration of
these pleas to the various spheres of government. It is imperative to
measure constantly whether we are interactive with the South Africans from
all walks of life and that we are not hijacked by the aristocracy.

The electricity issue in South Africa has the entire country in panic. We
need to realise that while we have a greater need than supply we cannot
penalise the community for our shortfalls. We reaffirm the need to invite
foreign and local investments in power plants.

South Africa remains home to a number of illegal immigrants. We need to
strengthen our plight to curtail this problem. While we are proud and
supportive of South Africa’s work with the Southern African Development
Community, SADC; the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, Nepad; and
the African Union, AU, we believe we have a pivotal role to play in the
future of Zimbabwe where we need to intervene in assisting the Zimbabwean
people to achieve a successful democratic election and, like us, install a
government of choice.
The terror in Kenya, Chad and Darfur is horrific and we need to deploy as
much foreign assistance as we can to bring peace and stability to these
areas.

Returning home, South Africa remains riddled by crime and we are pleased
that the hon President highlighted it as a major concern. We do, however,
seek a constructive attack on the crime situation which poses a liability
for all sectors of society. We need to invest in our safety by investing in
the South African Police Service, SAPS, and ensuring that they are
sufficiently resourced to address crime.

We are supportive of transparency as a clear method to hold all sectors
under checks and balances. The reality of corruption in our system warrants
it and we don’t believe that any organ should reside without being
answerable to some sort of an independent body. We direct this to the
Scorpions who, in our opinion, should be allowed to act independently from
SAPS, in view of the seriousness of organised crime in South Africa and its
80% success rate. We believe that we need a specialised and independent
body to oust organised crime from within our boundaries, including our
political arena.

The 2010 Fifa games remains an exciting and important highlight on the
agenda. We have great faith in Bafana Bafana and their ability to transform
us into a winning nation. Certainly, with both rugby and cricket, we have
delivered and look forward to a few more great wins in the Olympics later
this year.
The MF, however, believes that our nation remains ignorant of the great
benefits of sports and recreation. Its expansion in the growth of women,
youth and the disabled is essential to deterring us from societal
inconsistencies of inferiority and crime.

We applaud that physical education is now part of the school curriculum and
we call for educators to be re-skilled to fulfil this task.

The MF notes that land restitution remains on the table and hopes this year
will find more settlement.

The MF applauds the hon President on the great service to the nation. Thank
you. [Time expired.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President,
hon Deputy President and hon members, let me start first by expressing my
humble appreciation to all South Africans for the overwhelming support that
they are giving us as we deal with the energy situation in the country.
South Africans have reacted positively to our calls in cash and in kind,
all of this done with one resolve - bringing stability to the electricity
system.

This has reminded me of the wise words of President Mandela when he was
appreciating such positiveness among South Africans. He said: “There is
goodwill among men and women of South Africa.”
I want to repeat what hon Minister Alec Erwin and the CEO of Anglo
American, Cynthia Carroll, said that there is no crisis in the country but
that there is an emergency that requires us to act swiftly, and acting
swiftly we are.

I want to invite all South Africans who still want to reach out to us and
offer solutions, as well as those who are looking for information and
wanting to raise concerns, to use the following toll free number: 0860 109
091. This number will become operational from 27 February 2008.

Mongameli obekekileyo, mandithathe le nxaxheba ukwenza umbulelo kuwe
noSekela Mongameli, ingakumbi ngokuncedisa ekukhokeleni eli phulo
lokubuyisela imo yombane waseMzantsi Afrika kwimeko yawo yanmgaphambili.
Ndiphinde ndibulele uKhongolozi ngokuzibophelela kwiphulo lokonga umbane
kunye nangokucela abantu ukuba nabo bathathe inxaxheba kweli phulo. Aba
bathetha kakhulu, bekwafuna nentloko yakho Mongameli ingathi ikhona imibuzi
ekufuneka beyiphendule, ngoba nanjengokuba ebetshilo obekekileyo
uMphathiswa uMdaladlana sele ingathi kuza kugwetywa kweli lizwe.

Ndinemibuzo ke embalwa nje endifuna bayiphendule: Babephi ngexesha
sasihamba kwizitalato ezimnyama eziqhumayo, kuthi kwakutshona ilanga woyike
nokuya evenkileni? Mna ndithetha ngeelokishi ezi zazakhiwe ngabo ngexesha
apho umbane sasingenawo ezindlwini phaya eziilokishini. Kwaye umbane
obhetele ubungowabelungu. Babephi ngelaa xesha iilali yayiziindawo
ezazibonwa njengezazihlala abantu abeye kulahlwa nabangakhathalelekanga
yada le meko yaqiniswa ngomthetho owazisa inkqubo kaZimelegeqe apho ke
kwatyiwa imali ngaphandle kokuphuhlisa iindawo zabantu neelali
ngokupheleleyo? Babephi aba Bantu Mongameli ngexa abantu ababehlala
kwiifama kwezi ndawo kuthiwa kusezitolosheni kunzima kubaqeshi babo nokuba
babatsalele umbane kwimizana nje yabo embalwa?

Zange bayenze loo nto kodwa loo nto Ibiza kunceda abasebenzi babo. Ubusithi
xa ubuhamba ngemoto udlula emaphandleni ubone ngokuqhakaza kombane ukuba
yindlu yomlungu leya. Asizange silive ilizwi laba Bantu ngelo xesha
bekhalima besithi kurhulumente wengcinezelo unyhasha amalungelo wabantu
ngokungabaniki iinkonzo ezisisiseko sokuphucula impilo yabo. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Babethule tu Mongameli, beyolelwe, bephila imopilo engcono beligcuntswana.
Thina Bantu bayiqhelileyo le nto sikulungele ukuvuka siyibambe. Kwaye siza
kuyibamba ngeempondo. Neli idabi siza kuliphumelela. Le nto yokwenza ngathi
bazintshatsheli namatshantliziyo alwela amahlwempu nempula zika lujaca
siyayazi ukuba ayinjalo kodwa kukubhuda nje kwepolitiki okungenanyaniso.

Phofu ke Mongameli mabayibulele iANC ngoba ibafundisile ngokuzisa
urhulumente wabantu nowahloniphayo amalungelo wabo. Le ngxolo ingenantsusa
nengamapholi yokuba lo rhulumente ubesisifede ekufezekiseni iimfuno zabantu
indikhumbuza ngowe1994 ngexa kwakuyimiqokozo ezivenkileni kuthengwa
iiparafini, amakhandlela ndibala ntoni na, kulungiselelwa umgweba owawuza
kuza nokuphatha komntu omnyama kuba nangoku sele sihambe umgama ongaka
ukuguqula impilo yabantu kusekho ooTomas noxa beyibona inguqu. Namhlanje ke
phantsi kolawulo lukaANC nokhokelo lwakho noMadiba sekusele imizi
engangezigidi ezibini kunye nama-300 000 ezingenamba kwezintandathu
esasizifumene ngalo we-1994. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Hon President and hon Deputy President, let me take this opportunity to
thank you for your leadership in the campaign to restore electricity
supplies in South Africa to the standard it was. Let me also thank the ANC
for committing itself to saving electricity and encouraging people to join
this campaign. Those who talk a lot and call for your head, Mr President,
have questions to answer as Minister Mdladlana has said that judgment day
is not far.

I have a few questions which I want them to answer: Where were they when we
had no lights in our dusty streets and were afraid of going to the shops at
night? I am talking about the times when we did not have electricity in the
houses that they built us in the townships they created and only white
people were supplied with electricity. Where were they when our villages in
rural areas were seen as the most backward places where people were not
respected and cared for, a situation which was enforced by the
establishment of homelands where there was a lack of accountability for
public funds and no development whatsoever? Where were these people when
farmworkers lived in barns because their employers did not install
electricity?

They did not do that even though it would have been helpful to their
employees. When you travelled past rural areas or villages at night you
would see one house with lights on and you would know that that was a white
person’s house. We did not hear these people telling the apartheid
government of their abuse of human rights by not providing others with
basic services. [Applause.]

They were quiet, happy and content as they lived a better life as a
minority. As we are used to such circumstances, we will survive and move
forward. This battle too we will win. That they are now champions for the
poor is a trick well known to us and we know it is mere politicking.

They should thank the ANC because it has taught them about democracy and
respect for human rights. This noise about the inefficiency of our
government to satisfy people’s needs reminds me about 1994 when people in
their numbers filled stores buying items like paraffin, candles, and many
other necessities because judgement day was soon due because black people
were going to be in power. We have come this far with transition but we
still have doubting Thomases among us. Today, under the ANC-led government,
and your and Madiba’s leadership, we have left 2,3 million unelectrified
house from the 6 million we inherited in 1994.]
The President in his state of the nation address said:


  The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the
  commitment that in the period ahead of us, it will do its best to live up
  to the imperative - Business Unusual!

Indeed, this is the approach that we have taken in dealing with the
emergency situation that we are experiencing today as a result; they are
beginning to show results.

Mr President, surely in spite of our achievements as a country we cannot be
complacent, it is not yet uhuru - freedom has not arrived yet. We want to
see our economy continuing to grow. We have worked hard to reach the levels
of growth that we see to date. It has been sweat and toil to deliver
electricity and other services to our people and this is unprecedented in
our country.

These are our gains, Mr President - the gains of the ANC in government, the
gains of the ANC as a liberation movement. And if anybody stands to lose,
or if something goes amiss, it will be us the ANC, but most importantly the
least privileged people of South Africa who will be the hardest hit. So we
do have an interest in those people and we shall defend our gains.

For us, the mandate that the ANC gave us to create a better live for all we
will pursue until indeed there is a better life for all. Mr President and
hon members, I would now like to report to the people of South Africa on
the developments thus far in the roll-out of the power conservation
programme which is a key strategy in our short-term to medium-term
interventions.

The energy efficiency roll-out plan is already in place. One vital
component thereof is the roll-out of the candescent fluorescent light
bulbs, which will commence at the end of February 2008. We will be
distributing the bulbs and the public will be asked to exchange their
energy inefficient bulbs for the energy efficient ones. We will start with
government buildings, targeting civil servants and parastatals, including
everybody within these institutions.

The broader programme will start in the Gauteng province and then it will
be rolled out to the other provinces, to major metros and cities, covering
all households and all energy users throughout the country. We plan to
supply the constituency offices as well. We also intend to launch the
Schools Energy Awareness Campaign in May this year.  Going forward with the
campaign, and while we work with local government, we will supply the
indigent households with free energy efficient bulbs until 2015.

We will continue to work with local government and all relevant structures
to solicit the services of CDWs – Community Development Workers - as well
as the National Youth Service - who will help us with the roll-out to
everybody.

The programme will be rolled out with the assistance of the energy service
companies and it has a potential to create a number of jobs as this will
involve largely a simple replacement of a bulb. The SA National Defence
Force has pledged to assist by escorting the teams that will be replacing
the bulbs at household levels to ensure smooth running of the programme. We
are working on the programme to ensure proper co-ordination of all these
efforts and initiatives.

I would like to bring to the attention of the hon members that there is a
policy intervention and legislative framework that underpins this process.
The electricity regulations have been revised to include energy-efficient
technologies. These regulations are out for broader stakeholder inputs and
comments are more than welcomed.

As we speak, Clicks has phased out the sale of incandescent light bulbs and
we hope to see more retail stores from the private sector join Clicks.

The solar water heating programme, which was piloted through the Central
Energy Fund has been completed with a total of 500 solar heating units
already installed in a number of households in the country. The preliminary
results indicates that solar water heating systems are energy efficient and
excellent at energy saving. The second phase of this programme will start
in the new financial year with a total of 90 000 solar water heating
systems installed in the Greater Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in Port
Elizabeth. The Eskom solar water heating programme is currently being
implemented and the intention is to roll out about a million units over the
next three years. As already indicated, we will be subsidising these
programmes.

The Department of Minerals and Energy, within the Renewable Energy Finance
and Subsidy Office, will also subsidise the roll-out of solar water heating
units and will provide a 20% subsidy for these units per household. We will
also implement the solar lighting project within the government buildings
and we are looking at reducing energy consumption by 10%. This will happen
by the end of 2008-09.

The project of solar traffic lights will be implemented jointly by the
Department of Minerals and Energy and the National Energy Efficiency Agency
and a number of municipalities which have pledged to invest in our
department in partnership with the National Energy Efficiency Agency. We
will invest R100 million. I must say that we are looking at having 200
traffic lights by the end of the first year. We have received a pledge of
R500 million which is going to fund this project. [Applause.] This project
is targeted for the end of March.

In conveying the message, Mr President, we will be using the champions that
you have mentioned in your speech. We also have 37 companies that are
signatories to the Energy Efficiency Accord, who will be utilised to assist
us in this campaign.

Mr President, what is important is that we allay the fears of our people
that the programme of delivering electricity as a basic service to them
will be affected. We will continue with the programme and it is important
because it impacts positively on the lives of our people.

There is a lot of noise concerning skill shortage and yet we do need to
transform. The very people who are now talking and who are being bold about
having expertise and experience were given an opportunity by their
government. They were novices and they were given an opportunity to grow
and develop and become the experts that they are today. We are not going to
compromise transformation. Our black people are going to get into these
institutions. [Time expired]. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker ...

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[I would like to thank President Thabo Mbeki for his speech that uplifted
the nation’s hope and joy, especially when we realised that the government
understands the process that should be followed to unravel the sins of the
government of oppression. I am moved by the determination shown by the
people’s party to do all in its power to ensure progress. Mr President, we
thank you.]

Madam Speaker, Mr President, it is only the ANC that stands ready to be at
one with the people of South Africa, at one in responding to their needs
and interests. They have no interest in an early election and in the kind
of theatrical histrionics we witnessed yesterday, which make a mockery of
our Constitution and our Parliament.

The hon chairman of the DA claimed yesterday that the ANC members were
listening attentively to the opposition, and he said it was admirable that
we did so. What he did not realise was that we were listening attentively
in a vain attempt to establish whether we would be presented with an
alternative set of proposals to the key strategies outlined by President
Mbeki. Sadly, and not surprisingly, all we got was sarcasm, cynicism and
nothing that could convince any South African that we have in the
opposition a party that stands as ready as the ANC to govern. [Applause.]

I also watched with great interest how the DA members listened to the FF
Plus leader, and I wondered if this was perhaps because that is their real
leader. The state of the nation address clearly indicated that the
government and the ANC remain true to the promise of a better life for all.
Our President also acknowledged that there have been challenges and
failings and outlined the steps that government will take to address these
matters.

It is only the ANC that understands what must still be done to build on the
successes achieved since the dawn of democracy. At the 8 January
celebrations, and on 8 February, the ANC called on all of us to become
partners in mobilising society for change, in mobilising society for the
good, and in mobilising for the building of a caring society in which we
all feel the positive impact of the changes that will emerge from
conducting Business Unusual.

The President’s call for Business Unusual in 2008 is a call for government
to perform more effectively than before and to serve the people even better
than before in the interests of social and economic development.

Few analysts have sought to explore why the ANC has called for mass
mobilisation at this time. The President reiterated that call from the ANC
when he said: “It is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every
sinew of its collective body to attain a dream.” Those calls come from our
belief that people’s power is a necessary part of the full definition of a
developmental state. In the struggle against oppression, people’s power was
a mighty sword for liberation.

The ANC is calling on the people to sharpen that sword of people’s action
once more to achieve that best of times President Mbeki so recalled through
Dickens in his call to action. The ANC call and the government programme
outlined in the state of the nation address, taken together, call for unity
in action. This means working together to determine solutions and to impact
positively on social transformation.

Unity in action requires that we should recognise that the challenges faced
by South Africa are shared challenges that all of us own. Thus, instead of
merely pointing fingers when there are challenges, what the time calls for
is what we should do in order to play a role and make a positive
difference. President Mbeki clearly indicated that we should ensure that in
our implementation, and in the policies that we develop, we must create a
caring society.

We heard yesterday leading members of this House claim that yesterday – the
past – was better than today. Now, I think we have to ask them: What part
of the past is being referred to? Is it imprisonment, is it deprivation, is
it torture, is it exile? Which part of the past?

We remain resolute in our belief that we must and will respond to the tasks
of today, the tasks of transformation. It is for this reason that among
many responses our government has responded to challenges faced by
communities in meeting the costs of education.

There has, of course, been criticism of the first year of implementation of
no-fee schools. And I have repeated that it is the first year and the first
time ever. The failings are undeniable, but the achievements are also
significant. In many schools this new policy has been welcomed as a very
positive development for many South Africans. Over 4 million children today
receive education for free. [Applause.] Yes, we must do better. We have
said that, but for a moment, just for a moment, imagine the impact of this
seismic shift for the children of South Africa.

It is, of course, deeply troubling that we have not lifted the percentage
pass rate for senior certificates, but it must be cause for positive
sentiment that thousands more complete school at Grade 12, that quality
exams are written, that many more children enjoy access to opportunities to
study mathematics and science. We are not fully there as yet, but we are on
the road and marching hand in hand with the people of our country.

Added to this is the success of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.
Over R1,3 billion will go towards assisting financially needy students this
year. Thousands of students are beneficiaries of this programme, and the
programme has been essential to transforming access to higher education.
Linked to this is the new bursary programme for FET college students and
the teacher-training bursaries for new teachers.

Of course, while there have been successes, there have also been
inadequacies. Some relate to our being very successful in promoting access
to schooling. We do not have adequate schooling facilities in all areas
because none were provided in many of these areas in the past that many
seem to extol today.

We will review our policies where necessary. We will target poverty more
precisely and sensitively, and we will improve financial support to
students in our drive to accelerate skills development and success in
higher education.

We are pleased that the priority skills intervention, Jipsa, which is led
by our Deputy President, has given a strong impetus to a number of
significant initiatives - expanding engineering access, strengthening
research in higher education, providing partnerships for graduate placement
and scarce skills development opportunities for young people, as well as
public-private partnerships in Information and Communication Technologies -
ICT development.

Despite the bedraggled criticism which is whining over here, we have always
had their negative comments on Setas. Some of these Setas have recorded
worthy skills achievement and we will go on to do even better through them
and our institutions of education.

The strongest levers for drawing maximum benefit from people’s power are of
course found very, very strongly and directly in education. Thus, all our
efforts must be directed at strengthening education to ensure people’s
development.

Our government has determined that every effort must be exerted to realise
the promise of the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, for the most
marginalised and vulnerable in our society. One of our most important
interventions this year will be the mass literacy campaign that we will
launch at the end of this month. “Kha Ri Gude” - “Asifunde”, “A re
rutaneng”, let us learn - is the campaign that will support access to
literacy for millions of South Africans. We will launch the first year of
the programme on 28 February. The campaign will be mass-based. It will seek
to reach every village, street and community centre. It will seek to
provide literacy to 4,7 million South Africans by 2012. It will seek to
meet our MDG target of halving illiteracy by 2015. We have worked hard to
prepare for the campaign.

“Business Unusual” means working hard, smarter and in the public interest.
We have developed a plan, materials and a full implementation strategy. We
will be asking you, hon members, to assist us in communicating the details
of the campaign and in mobilising participants to join and remain in their
classes.

What else then could we do to make the year 2008 unusually successful in
education? Firstly, all public servants in education must take on the
Business Unusual mantle. They should deliver on the promise of a better
life and make Batho Pele a reality by serving the people first. Text books
must get to school on time, and our professionals, the teachers, must
strain every sinew in responding to the call of the President of the ANC
that the non-negotiable must be adhered to in school and on time -
teaching; no harassment; and no abuse. Learners, too, must reflect Business
Unusual through discipline, respect for adults, hard work and respect for
fellow learners.

We seek to ensure that South Africans develop their potential to
participate and compete effectively in the global arena. There is nothing
unusual in that. We seek to ensure the revitalisation of research and
innovation in higher education so that our students and our professionals
stand at the forefront of innovation in their chosen fields. There is
nothing unusual in that. We have recapitalised FET colleges and redesigned
their curricular and we seek to ensure that many more South Africans than
ever before learn their skills and training in these FET institutions. That
is Business Unusual. We seek to ensure the promotion of Mathematics and
Science at schools. There is nothing unusual in that, all in the country
seek it. Business Unusual means we must succeed in expanding the pool of
success in these key learning areas.

We seek to ensure quality education for all children – one that lays the
foundation, builds on the foundation and maintains the intellectual
infrastructure. South Africa requires this infrastructure for its national
development.

Improved achievement for all in our education institutions would be, I
believe, very welcome “Business Unusual”. Each Member of Parliament must
exhort every school, college and university to do more. We should lead by
example through our discourse in this House. We must eliminate the view
that the public has that many in this House are amateur comedians
disdainful of our nation, our Constitution and our Parliament. It is
laughable to assume that you could secure a majority to ensure
disillusionment of this House. So, we can only cast you as an amateur
comedian when you make such a proposal. [Applause.]

There have been many lapses in this House on our part and I think we need
to be alert to the fact that many of our people are beginning to regard us
with some dismay as Members of Parliament. It is also very peculiar that we
want to be called honourables when in our approach to each other we tend to
be dishonourable by action or by word. [Applause.] So, I would ask that we
should pay attention to ourselves and how we reflect ourselves. That would
be unusual.

We have acted on the call to share nationhood and development action by
placing our constitutional values in a very simple schools pledge that we
asked the nation to comment on. The pledge is drawn from our Constitution.
It is in simple evocative language that promotes an ethos and values that
few would object to. I trust that Members of Parliament will support the
schools pledge and encourage young South Africans to reflect on the values
and attitudes it suggests. That would be, for many in this House, unusual
and absolutely correct. For those who view the proposed pledge with
suspicion, I refer you to a brief extract from a letter in the Cape Times
of this morning, and I quote:


   It is not difficult, Moses was saying, to gain liberty, but to sustain it
   is the work of a hundred generations. Forget it and you lose it. Freedom
   needs three institutions: parenthood, education and memory. You must tell
   your children about slavery and the long journey to liberation. They must
   annually taste the bread of affliction and the bitter herbs of slave
   labour. They must know what oppression feels like if they are to fight
   against it in every age.


   Freedom is not, as so many have thought, a matter of political or
   military victories alone. It involves habits of the heart.

It is these habits of the heart that we hope the pledge will inculcate.

Strain every sinew! That is how we will create unusual success. I thank
you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Mr M T LIKOTSI: Madam Speaker, the President of the Republic, the Deputy
President and members of the Cabinet, compliments of the ageing season to
you.

The President has spoken; we will keenly follow. We are going to be
vigilant in each and every step we take in conforming to the line of march
- Business Unusual. Since 1994, it has been business as usual on the
following challenges this country has faced: To loot the resources of this
country through extreme corruption; maladministration; high rate of
unemployment; increase in the abuse of women and children; abject poverty;
inferior and inefficient service delivery; the annual student strikes at
our institutions of higher learning; and the strikes by public servants on
their wage increases. Indeed it has been business as usual to accept the
stated challenges as norms and standards of our country. I hope it will not
be business as usual to power outages.

It must be noted that we are at the final round of our term of office. We
were given a chance of five years to show a political will to make changes
in our country, but it became business as usual to stick to the old pattern
of mismanagement. In the final year of our term of office, a new strategy
of Business Unusual is introduced, which will remain in the planning phase
for the remaining borrowed time of our term of office, only to be thrown
out through the window by the new incoming management.

Hon President and the Cabinet, there is much you have done since 2004 to
date - I must admit. Many people have benefited in many of the government
programmes – housing, education, health infrastructure and preservation of
their dignity as human beings. The truth must be told. Others who could not
have owned houses in their lives are homeowners today. Some who have been
unemployed for decades have tasted how it is to be employed. [Applause.]
Some have graduated as doctors while others are accountants. This country
is recognised internationally as a democratic country. I must thank you for
all such efforts. [Applause.]

As you have rightfully said, we must be vigilant as the challenges are
enormous. That is why you think due to a slow pace of service delivery,
there should be Business Unusual.
Comrade Cronin, just listen to this. The teachings of the late Kwame
Nkrumah have taught us about the stages of freedom we find ourselves in and
termed it neocolonialism - as he rightfully put it that no people can be
rightfully independent if their former oppressors control their industries
and trade; those who own the wealth of a country will by various means try
to interfere in the way it is governed so that nothing is done to harm
their interest. The country might seem to be free, but it is a shameful
independence because the people are not masters in their own houses.

The essence of neocolonialism is that a state which is subjected to it is
in theory independent. In reality, its economy and thus its political
policy is directed from outside.

The APC calls for an economic revolution in this country, period! I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy President, hon
Ministers, my colleagues the hon Members of Parliament, let me start off by
responding to the FF Plus on their call to do away with affirmative action.
I liked it when the hon Minister Mdladlana said that perhaps the correct
word to use for affirmative action is the Afrikaans equivalent,
“regstellende aksie”. I think it is the correct word because it says that
you are correcting something that is wrong.

If you remove the action that corrects something that is wrong, I’m not
sure what you are going to be left with. Therefore, it does not make sense
to me to ask someone to do away with that action which is correcting
something that is wrong; so I cannot understand the reasoning behind the
call.

However, as the ANC, we believe that there is no contradiction. The FF Plus
is saying to us that we have to make a choice between speeding up
transformation and slowing down service delivery. I think we need to say
that there is no contradiction in speeding up transformation and service
delivery as these go hand in hand. In fact, if you speed up your
transformation, you will speed up your service delivery.

What you need to do is just to make sure that there are proper mechanisms
to deal with transformation. Part of that is to make sure that you have
proper mentoring and you are prepared to transfer the skills.

I think that our resolve, as the ANC, not just to fight, but to kill
inequalities is going to be pursued forever. So we are not going to do away
with affirmative action. [Applause.] In fact, our advice would be that you
need to tell your constituency, which is mostly made up of employers, that
the sooner they implement affirmative action, the sooner we will stop
talking about it because there will be no inequalities.
Coming to your speech, Mr President, on Business Unusual, I just want to
share with the House my observations in the Free State and in the Eastern
Cape. There has been a campaign by the SA Social Security Agency - I think
together with Social Development - to take services to the people. I went
into this one community hall. In fact, I did not know that they were there
on the day; I just saw an army of vehicles. The hall was very full.

The town where I am deployed is a very small town with lots of farms around
it. The hall was fully packed with officials - with all their computers –
as well as doctors to attend immediately to people who would need help
there.

I was told that the intention was that as the people were applying for
their pension grants, by the time they walked out of that hall they would
know whether their applications had been successful or not - on that very
day. The same happened in the village that I went to.

That translated to, for instance at Heinneman township - at least on that
day, 500 households knowing that at the end of the month they would have
bread on the table. [Applause.] And after your speech, Mr President, I
said, you know Business Unusual did not start only when you delivered the
speech. The officials or government started with it last year already. For
those that think that it is something new, they need to know that we are
just accelerating it.

[Madam Speaker, allow me to take this opportunity to express my gratitude
for being able to participate in today’s important debate. Today’s debate
gives us an opportunity to look back and assess our role, as the ANC, since
we were elected into office by the public. We are not only doing this
because the general elections are around the corner, but we take an
interest in knowing how much has been done to change our people’s lives, as
promised.

We can use this opportunity to assess whether there are some unattended
issues, and if there are, we can then join hands and look at how they can
be addressed. When looking back, Chairperson, one of the things that I
noticed is that our government has so many services that can improve our
lives. On the other hand, I have also noticed that so many people are not
aware of these services.

Perhaps we should review our methods of informing the community about these
services. We sometimes distribute documents with disregard for the language
used in that particular community, as well as the level of their education.
I think, as the President has said, that we should do things in an unusual
manner or Business Unusual, and we should also change the methods that we
are using to inform the community. We should give ourselves time to ensure
that they do understand us.

I know that departments are trying their best, and are also in a drive to
inform the community, but I think, as community representatives, we are in
a better position to do even more - knowledge is power. I believe that
during this time when we, as the ANC, are propelling the call that this
should be the year to bring people together, to build a united nation
towards 2012, we should use this to transfer information to the people so
that they can be independent.]

... the year of mass mobilization to build a caring society ...

[Again, I acknowledge the decision of the big party, the ANC, to
reintroduce street committees. Those who had an opportunity to participate
in these committees during the apartheid era would know how helpful they
were. I sincerely hope that these committees will help to build a caring
society. I say this, Chairperson, because these committees will help us to
get to know the families residing in the houses and also to know about all
the good and the bad things happening in each and every street. We will
know which families are struggling - as the President has said that we
should identify them in order to fight poverty.

We will know of those who are sick and those who need to receive home-based
care, and those who do not take their medication and who end up having
infection s like XDR TB. We will know who is committing crime in our
streets and we will therefore manage to fight against crime. The Minister
of Minerals and Energy said that we should go out to educate people about
what they can do to save electricity.

I hope that if we use these street committees, we can play a big role in
fighting crime. There are many important things that we can achieve by
implementing these committees. My colleague, who is sitting next to me,
told me that we need to be aware of people disrupting these committees. But
I think the ANC will be in control.]

... my colleague next to me ... we must also be aware of those that abuse
those street committees. However, I think that the ANC will be in control.

jwalo ka wa basebetsi le thuto le emeng e mengata. (Translation of Sesotho
paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, let me touch on something important, which is a challenge to
us. Our big organisation, the ANC, made sure that any kind of
discrimination was abolished. It made sure that this was outlined in the
Constitution of the country and in many other laws such as labour and
education.]

Madam Speaker, whereas the rights of disabled people are protected through
the Constitution and many other policies in education, employment, etc., we
have not been able to move with the required speed to address these
problems. I could mention quite a few examples to back this up. For
instance, the inclusive education and the employment equity reports
indicate that we haven’t done as well as we should. The public buildings
are still very inaccessible.

With regard to health, hospitals still don’t provide services for disabled
persons. For instance, the CPR project, which is working very well in
Mpumalanga, has not been rolled out in other provinces. Sign language and
Braille are still a serious problem and this makes it difficult for deaf
and blind people to access information and devices. How can we be a caring
society without addressing these issues?

Regarding the issue of skills, we have not just complained as the ANC, but
we have noted, for instance, that Seta boards need to be strengthened. We
are calling on labour and business to deploy key people that can strengthen
these boards so that they can give direction and leadership to the Setas.

The Setas also need to be more accessible, especially in rural areas.
Municipalities and FET colleges need to assist in creating a space for
these Setas to operate. There is a need to embark on learnerships in
required skills, and not for the sake of service providers to earn money.
Our experience is that some service providers provide learnerships that do
not assist us to access jobs.

I raise these issues just to indicate the challenges we are still faced
with regarding inequalities and access to services. I believe that we can
overcome these challenges if we have dedicated programmes.

In line with the President’s call for Business Unusual, we will have to
change our attitude and have dedicated programmes. I have not dealt with
this matter in detail as I believe that we will be able to deal with
details when we engage with departments on budgets. We just raise these
issues as a matter of principle, that they need urgent attention.

The same can be said about domestic workers and farmworkers, who still
experience a lot of abuse. I believe that if we were to pool together all
our efforts, in a collective effort, these problems would not be
insurmountable. I thank you. [Applause.]
Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon President and hon members, allow me to
welcome the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party, as well as Mrs Muna
in the public gallery for taking her time to come and listen to our debate
this afternoon.

The President said in his speech, and I quote: ``I am confident that 2008
will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy.’’

In Christian symbolism, the figure 8 reflects a time of new beginnings,
implying a fresh start of being granted another opportunity to proceed
along a higher road. Our country is at an opportune juncture to proceed on
a higher road which requires optimism steeped in realism of the challenges
ahead. The President’s refrain of Business Unusual provides us with a
framework to seize the moment and pave a new way towards the realisation of
a better life for all our people.

Certain challenges we face are inherited while others are attained through
our own doing. The government, generally, has a clear idea of how to deal
with challenges inherited from the past. It is in dealing with those
challenges brought about by government itself that requires an injection of
Business Unusual. For government to affect meaningful change, Business
Unusual in the FD’s view should be defined as ``shape up or ship out’’,
meaning an intolerance to current business as usual of underperformance and
incompetence.

A place to start is with the Auditor-General’s reports of last year, which
provide a worrying overview of the state of certain government departments
in need of serious overhaul. The Auditor-General intimated the lack of
departmental leadership and government oversight as key problems linked to
the qualified audit against government departments. Business Unusual should
start at revamping and reorganising those departments guilty of gross
negligence.

The FD was greatly encouraged when the President reiterated government’s
apology for the national energy crisis. This indicates a political maturing
in democratic processes. The energy crisis is government’s worst failure to
date, but we fully accept government’s commitment to do everything in its
capacity to practically reduce the impact on the rest to society. Some
would argue that the apology is not enough and that government should also
be held accountable for the crisis. The President says, and I quote: ``This
is not time for finger-pointing but for working together to find
solutions.’’ On this he is partially correct since we need collective co-
operation to tackle the problem. The President, however, is not correct in
not pointing out those who contributed to the energy crisis.

In his appearance, talking about the state of the nation address, the
President connects the energy crisis to the growth of the economy. He is
opposed to any form of recrimination as he believes it is pointing the
country in the wrong direction. However, Mr President, to point the country
in the right direction, will require new faces. Having said this, the FD
believes we will be pointing the country in the wrong direction if we
dissolve Parliament or call for a vote of no confidence in the President.
What the FD believes the right call to be is that the President should
consider reshuffling the Cabinet if he finds weaknesses in the Cabinet that
cannot be addressed in any other way.

Mr President, allow me to use this opportunity to announce the intention of
the FD to participate in the 2009 national elections as part of a much
broader alliance, namely the Christian democratic alliance. Most elections
through the western world are fought under one of three broad ideological
banners, namely social democrats, liberal democrats and the Christian
democrats. In South Africa the social democrats are represented by the
majority party – the ANC and its alliance partners – and many other parties
who do not form part of this alliance. The liberal democrats are
represented by the DA and its partners, including its multiparty governance
partners in the City of Cape Town. The Christian democrats are represented
by more than 11 different registered political parties of which only three
are represented in Parliament. Many of the others have representation at
local government level only. There is no cohesive force that unites all
Christian parties presently and the launch of the Christian Democratic
Alliance later this year will be the first attempt in the history of South
Africa to do so. We have worked on the concept where all political parties
would join the Christian Democratic Alliance; will retain their unique
political identity and leadership, even after the 2009 elections, will
participate but as one united front based on a Biblical worldview during
the 2009 elections.

In conclusion, we live in an age of opportunity where the call for all
hands on deck will promote a united South Africa, embracing one another
across cultural and ethnic barriers to tackle our challenges.

I thank you.

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President and all hon
Members of Parliament ...

Le nna ke lakatsa ho tlatsa mantswe a builweng ke Mohlomphehi Naledi Pandor
ha are re lebohe Mopresidente ka puo eo a faneng ka yona setjhabeng sa
rona. Ke tshepa hore re tla ithuta dintho tse ngata puong ya hae.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[I would also like to concur with the words of the hon Naledi Pandor when
she says that we should thank our President for the state of the nation
address. I trust that we will learn a lot from his speech.]

Madam Speaker, what is central for me, and I believe for all the
governments throughout the whole world, is to better the lives of their own
people in their own respective countries. If government objectives and
programmes that are put in place are not aimed at addressing this important
issue, then, in my opinion, there is no point in having a government. To
me, to better the lives of all our people is central. In spite of the
challenges in the supply of electricity in which our country finds itself
today, the President, in his speech delivered in this House last Friday,
has assured the country that the government remains firm in its commitment
to continue to build a South Africa that has given hope to all our people.
The President also pointed out in his speech to this House that we should
put all our energies towards realising the objective of making the lives of
all our people better than before.

Our policies, regarding every aspect of our lives, are in place and what
needs to be done is to implement them in a way that is different from the
past. This is what I understand by Business Unusual. You may have your own
interpretation.

Our country is faced with many challenges, ranging from health, education,
poverty, unemployment and so forth. To meet these challenges and remain
true to our ideal of building a caring society, everybody must come on
board. In the language of the January 8 Statement of the ANC, this is the
year of mass mobilisation towards creating a caring society.

We are already meeting some of these challenges. More houses are being
built, more funds are being made available every year by the National
Treasury to increase the pension grants to the elderly and the school
feeding in some schools.

As ANC cadres, we should admit that in spite of several efforts made by the
government in alleviating poverty, many families remain caught up in deep
poverty. Therefore, this should not be allowed to continue. That is why the
President pointed out that there is a need for a ``national war room’’ for
war against poverty and that should bring together some government
departments such as social development, provincial and local government.
These are some of the stumbling blocks towards building a caring society.

I have been a member of the ANC for more than 60 years. [Applause.] I
studied Political Science at varsity and obtained an Honours degree in
Political Science, but I have never ever read books or heard of a
government whose aim is to create a caring society for its people. Only the
ANC can do that because it lives and it leads.  [Applause.]

Some people are calling for the dissolution of Parliament and for fresh
elections to be held while others are saying the President and his Cabinet
must resign because he has failed to solve the energy crisis. It is a
serious allegation. It is a serious allegation to say, and I quote: ``We
cannot trust the President.’’ It is very serious indeed! If you think the
ANC is divided and that some members will therefore support you in your
opportunistic tendencies, we challenge you to move a motion of no
confidence now, and not tomorrow, and you will see what will happen.
[Applause.]

The ANC is a united force. We will thrash you. [Applause.] Nevertheless, we
still appeal to you to go out and mobilise the people of South Africa to
work together with the government and all other sectors in the country in
preparing the country for the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and, most
importantly, the 2010 Soccer World Cup. For the benefit of South Africa,
the government has poured large sums of money into making this event a
success. The infrastructure is being attended to and stadia are being built
and others are being renovated. Our airports are being extended and
renovated, roads are being repaired and widened. Hon members will recall
that it was hard to win the bid and when we did, the whole of South Africa
rejoiced. We care for our society. Let us not disappoint the people of
South Africa and the whole African continent, which is fully supportive of
our efforts to make this event a success.

The preliminary draw last September was a resounding success. Even the
experienced FIFA World Cup Project Managers concede that we put together an
excellent performance. I hope the hon members will be pleased to know that
all electricity was provided by the generators. There were no outages.
South Africa was testing our compliance with FIFA rules to have back-up
generators in FIFA venues and stadia. We passed with flying colours.
[Applause.]

It is our stated objective to make the 2010 World Cup a catalyst for
improving the quality of African football players and administration. The
African Cup of Nations, hosted by Ghana, was a marvellous event in
organising, securing and managing the tournament. The standard of the teams
was much higher than two years ago. This includes that of Bafana Bafana.
Yes, we would have loved to have reached the quarter finals and semi-
finals, or even to bring the Cup home. But people with football knowledge
agree that our team played better, with more purpose. Our people want to be
part of the hype and activities. The LOC must make sure that marketing and
outreach programmes reach all people. Mass mobilisation programmes through
sport and recreation, together with education, will kick off at schools in
March this year.

In 1996, I pointed out that sport contributes greatly to the health,
wellbeing and identity of individuals. Most of us will agree that a worker,
in order to be productive in his or her field of work, has to be healthy.
One of the central roles that sport can play in the life of a human being
is to promote good health. By providing facilities such as football
grounds, tennis courts, rugby fields, golf courses and so forth ...
[Interjections.]

Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam Speaker, hon President,
Deputy President, hon members, one would have hoped that in South Africa in
this day and age and, in particular, at a time of severe challenges to our
country, one would not have witnessed the spectacle displayed by the
opposition. It was a display reminiscent of London soapbox oratory – a lot
of noise signifying nothing.

Perhaps there is a perception that, post-Polokwane, the ANC is a wounded
animal and now is the time of going for its jugular. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Yes, Polokwane happened; yes, there has been a
change of the guard, but no, the ANC is not about to die. In fact, it and
its alliance partners will grow even stronger post-Polokwane. [Applause.]

Democracy is alive and well. It would do the opposition well to stick to
its knitting and not waste time with fanciful, wishful thinking. Your noise
makes for good media script, not much else. It adds no value to the
concerns of even your own constituencies. It does, however, play into the
hands of those who would like to see foreign investment go elsewhere; those
who believe we should not be the success we have become; those who believe
that it is about time South Africa was cut down to size.

The Leader of the Opposition, the hon Mayor Helen Zille, met our President
regarding the electricity problems. The President put his cards on the
table, took her into his confidence, did not hide anything, and she left
that meeting pledging support for the government’s programme to resolve the
situation and asking for a united South African response. What does her
leader in this House do? She breaks rank. [Interjections.] She scores cheap
political points. Are we beginning to see the further splintering of the
splinter groups? [Interjections.] Is everything well on that side of the
House? I wonder.

The hon member De Lille stumbles from one party scandal to another; one
internal revolt to another. What does she do? She brings her soapbox to
Parliament – about the only place, by the way, where she still finds
stature; definitely not in her party. It is a shame on all of you.

The comments that have been directed at the President of the Republic are
more indicative of how low members of the opposition are prepared to stoop,
rather than a reflection on the character of our President. Again,
believing that the President was injured, perhaps in Polokwane, they now
want to add insult to the injury. Let me tell you this: If this struggle
was for him; if the freedom for our people was for him; if a better life
for our people was merely for him to look good – and that is what he wanted
– then yes, he would have been injured in Polokwane. But no, unlike some
who are self-interest seeking; who hobnobbed with the enemy; who lived in
luxury whilst this President slept in different beds not knowing when the
enemy would knock; spent his best years in exile, and spent his life in
service of his people and his country, he has nothing to be ashamed of. In
fact, history will prove that he has served his country and his people with
distinction. [Applause.]

He, with others, led the fight that brought our liberation. He played a
singular role in bringing about a peaceful settlement in our country. He is
acknowledged in Africa as a peacemaker on the continent. He is one of the
first African leaders to address the G8. He is recognised throughout the
world as one who champions the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
[Applause.] In South Africa itself, he has led a government that has seen
the longest sustained economic growth in decades. No, hon member Buthelezi,
you may hanker after the homelands. It is understandable. You and only a
few benefited from this system. [Applause.]

Madam Speaker ...

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: That is utter balderdash! [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Madam Speaker, as we
effectively start the penultimate year of the life of this government, the
President has called on us to reflect on what progress we have made in
intervening in the lives of our people.

Mr M WATERS: None whatsoever!

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: He correctly reported on key
critical achievements where he firmly confirmed that we have implemented
the programmes that we have set for ourselves. He has noted, however, that
14 years after democracy, there are still many challenges that confront our
country and that we have not yet been able to fully address the backlog
from the past. Despite these challenges, the message is very clearly the
following: Today is better than yesterday and tomorrow will indeed be much
better than today.

He is saying this because we have, through our record of delivery, met the
core aspirations of our people - that of attaining a better life for all.
Our people are not fighting for ideas. They want to live better; they want
to see their children go to school, and their lives going forward. As the
President said, they cannot wait for strategies, dialogues and workshops.
Provision of basic services such as access to clean water, sanitation,
electricity and housing are critical in our efforts to create a better life
for all, and massive delivery in these areas has, undoubtedly, been at the
core of the successes of our democracy. In our attack in the war on
poverty, we will sharpen our focus and enhance our current efforts to
ensure that, by 2014, all those who are currently without access to these
basic services would have received them.

I would like to read you a paragraph by one of the captains of industry,
Alan Knott-Craig, but I will come back to that a little later. Let me first
deal with the issues that have been raised by hon members regarding service
delivery. We have the hon Godi and hon Pheko who have raised issues around
meeting the bucket eradication target and asking the questions why we have
not done so and have asked the President to respond to this. I will try and
respond to it very briefly today, but I will cover this expansively, as I
give my Budget Vote speech in a few months’ time.

Hon members would recall that, in 2006, when the President made a
commitment to bucket eradication, it was for those people living in
established formal settlements, specifically he said: “I should also
mention that government has decided that we must completely eradicate, in
the established settlements, the bucket toilets by the end of 2007.” We
have indeed replaced over 190 000 buckets in established formal
settlements, and we have given clear practical reasons why the remaining
buckets will only be removed by March this year. Of those remaining, close
to 30 000 are constructed, but waiting for water, and the remaining 14 000
are in various stages of completion. I will expand on this in my budget
debate.
There have been concerns raised in the public domain about the issue that
South Africa is indeed facing or heading for a water crisis. I would like
to say, hon members, I want to assure you that, fortunately, we do not have
a water crisis. We are not facing a water crisis. South Africa still
maintains world-class quality drinking water and our water is safe to
drink. We acknowledge that there are challenges in this sector. We live in
a water-scarce country. There are issues of pollution and contamination,
and I will expand on what we are doing and what the problems, the
challenges, are during my Budget Vote. I welcome the debates on these
issues and I welcome the concerns raised by the members, because I think
together we must make sure we have planned properly, that we have the
security of supply, and that we have measures in place to ensure that we
have clean drinking tap water that we can all be proud of.

Coming now to the Alan Knott-Craig story, Alan Knott-Craig is the captain
of industry who says we must not panic. It is not all gloom and doom. He
says:

   2008 has certainly started with a bang! The future was rosy on 31
   December 2007, but suddenly everyone is buying candles and researching
   property in Perth!


   A combination of recession in the USA ... high interest rates, the
   National Credit Act and power outages have combined to create the perfect
   storm.
   But don’t panic!


   This is not the first time there’s been doom and gloom. Every few years
   the same thing happens. The economy grows, everyone is optimistic, buys
   Nescafé, holiday homes, and Mercedes Benzes. The positivity gets ahead of
   itself and the economy overheats and then panic starts.

The fact of the matter is that the economy is not collapsing. It is
actually just correcting itself. He quotes when it happened: 1989, when we
defaulted on our international loans; 1994 when the ANC came to power and
everyone expected war; 1998, when the interest rate hit 25%. On each of
those occasions, he says, everyone thought it was the end of the world and
that there was no light in sight. Further he says: “And on each occasion,
believe it or not, the world did not actually end. It recovered and in fact
things continued to get better.”

He says that although 2008 may be a tough year, there are opportunities.
What he invites all South Africans to do is to open their eyes to the
opportunities and stop being negative. He continues:

   It’s easy to be negative. Subconsciously, you want to be negative!
   Whenever you open the papers they tell you about the goriest hijacking
   and the most corrupt politicians.

He asks:


   Why don’t they dedicate more pages to the fact that Johannesburg is the
   world’s biggest man-made forest, or to the corruption-free achievements
   of the vast majority of public officials? Because bad news sells and good
   news is boring.

Anyway, I can share with you the website where this whole story is
illustrated. This illustrates that this is the message we need to send to
all of our people: It is not all doom and gloom. We are on course and,
indeed, this is just a very temporary hiccup. These are testing times,
Madam Speaker, for all of us and we need resolute leadership to calm the
populace. Point-scoring and politicking is not going to help us.

As the President said:


   With all hands on deck, and a commitment to conduct our business in an
   unusual and more effective fashion, we shall sustain the process of our
   reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels.


Prince M G BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, can I ask a question to the Minister?

The SPEAKER: Hon member, will you take a question?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Yes, Madam Speaker.

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: I just wanted specifically to ask where in my speech
I spoke about homelands or hankering after homelands? Specifically, where
did I do that? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: There is your question, hon member. I will allow you to
answer, but your time has actually expired.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Well, the hon member might not
necessarily have specifically spoken about... [Interjections.] ... the
KwaZulu-Natal homeland, but he was saying that: “Kwaku bhetele kwa Faro.”
[It was better before.]

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: When did I say that?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: It is in the speech ...
Prince M G BUTHELEZI: Where? Where?

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: ... and it was broadcast live.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I think the issue must be settled outside the
Chamber.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: We can check Hansard.

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker!

The SPEAKER: Hon Buthelezi, I think ...

Prince M G BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, I am glad that my son didn’t marry
her! [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, hon Minister. I don’t know what the insinuation is.
I don’t know what the story is, but I think it is uncalled for to talk
about sons marrying Members of Parliament!

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Agb President, agb Speaker, ek reageer met graagte op u
beroep om eenheid onder die tema “Eenheid in diversiteit”. Agb President,
“!ke e: /xarra //ke” kom uit die Attakwa-dialek wat jare gelede in die
Oudtshoorn-omgewing gepraat is. Die Attakwa, net soos die Outenikwa,
Gourkwa, Hessekwa, en Harrigurikwa was die stamme wat die oorspronklike
voorsate uitgemaak het van die groep wat vandag as bruinmense bekend staan,
honderde jare voor die koms van Europeërs.

Wyle John Gomomo wat, volgens agb Roopnarain, dikwels sy mantras in
Sanskrit uit antieke Indië gedoen het, sou dit interessant gevind het om te
weet dat die linguistieke spoor van al die stamname na Indië lei. Saam met
name soos “Sjona” in Masjonaland, “Pon” in Pongola, “Ab” in Gariab, Komati,
Kamma, Tsitsikama, Matzikama, Keru, Ottentotoe, Kwena, ens.

Voeg hierby artefakte soos hierdie “koentam” of spiespunt. Dit is nie ’n
stuk gereedskap nie; dit is nie prehistories nie. Die kante is skerp. Dit
toon geen verwering. Dit is ’n godsdienstige simbool wat gebruik is om een
van die eienskappe van “Om” uit te beeld, naamlik om al die boosheid in ’n
mens se hart te vernietig. “Om” is ’n heilige lettergreep wat die
alomvattendheid van God beskrywe. Hierdie is dus ’n Om-koentam; deel van my
erfenis, wat die ANC ken as Umkhonto.

Die linguistieke spoor van woorde soos “Om” en “koentam” kan ook na Indië
teruggevoer word. Voeg by die linguistieke spoor en godsdienstige simbole,
ook die makgemaakte diere van hierdie stamme soos die vetstertskape, die
beestipe Bos Indicus en ons het getuienis wat nie langer geïgnoreer kan
word nie.

Natuurlik sal daar ’n geskarrel wees onder sekere historici en antropoloë,
want heelwat doktorale proefskrifte sal weer onder die vergrootglas geplaas
moet word.

Die Dravidiaanse “Ottentottoe” beteken gemeng. Dit het onder groot druk
gekom as gevolg van die skeldnaam, Hotnot, wat baie soos die gekorrupteerde
naam Hottentot klink. Vir politieke korrektheid is ’n onintelligente
konkoksie soos Khoisan gebruik wat net so min ’n woord is as wat dit ’n
naam is. Dit is geskep deur ’n Duitser Leonhard Schulze en die konkoksie
bevat absoluut geen historiese of linguistieke of religieuse of
antropologiese substansie nie. Dit is doodgewoon “stupid”. Die baba is saam
met die badwater uitgesmyt. Die ideologiese agenda wou `n identiteit, ’n
erfenis, ’n roeping en ’n profetiese destinasie vernietig. Ottentottoe
beteken “mixed” en ons is dit nou meer as ooit tevore. Ons is “deurmekaar-
gemix”. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Hon President, hon Speaker, I respond with eagerness to
your call for unity under the theme “Unity in Diversity”. Hon President,
“!ke e: /xarra //ke” comes from the Attaqua dialect that was spoken in the
Oudtshoorn area many years ago. The Attaqua, like the Outeniqua, Gouriqua,
Hessequa and Harringuriqua, was one of the tribes that made up the original
ancestry of the group known today as Brown people, hundreds of years prior
to the arrival of the Europeans.

The late John Gomomo who, according to the hon Roopnarain, often did his
mantras in Sanskrit from ancient India, would have found it interesting to
know that the linguistic print of all these tribes could be traced to
India. This print also includes names like “Shona” in Mashonaland, “Pon” in
Pongola, “Ab” in Gariab, Komati, Kamma, Tsitsikamma, Matzikamma, Keru,
Ottentotoe, Kwena, etc.

Add to these artefacts this “koentam” or spearhead. It is not an implement;
it is not prehistoric. The sides are sharp. It shows no sign of corrosion.
It is a religious symbol that was used to portray one of the
characteristics of “Om”, namely to exorcise all wickedness from one’s
heart. “Om” is a holy syllable that describes the all-embracing nature of
God. Consequently, this is an Om-koentam; which is part of my heritage that
the ANC knows as Umkhonto.

The linguistic print of words like “Om” and “koentam” can also be traced
back to India. Add to this the linguistic print and religious symbols, the
animals that have been tamed by these tribes like the broad-tailed sheep,
the bovine-type known as the Bos Indicus and we have evidence that can no
longer be ignored.

There will, naturally, be a scramble amongst certain historians and
anthropologists, because many doctoral dissertations will have to be put
under the magnifying glass again.

The Dravidian “Ottentottoe” means mixed. It came under tremendous pressure
because of the abusive name, Hotnot, that sounds a lot like a corrupted
form of the name Hottentot. To be politically correct, an unintelligent
concoction like Khoisan has been used, which is neither a word nor a name.
It was created by a German, Leonhard Schulze, and this concoction has
neither historical nor linguistic nor anthropological substance. It is just
plain stupid. The baby had been thrown out with the bathwater. The
ideological agenda wanted to destroy an identity, a heritage, a vocation
and a prophetic destination. Ottentottoe means mixed and that is what we
are now more than ever. We are totally mixed-up now.]

We as a people group are carrying the blood of the nations of the whole
world in us.

Ons is vermeng en daardeur by implikasie verwant, familie, almal se
familie. Daar is geen groep, mnr die President, waarvan ek weet wat so goed
geposisioneer is om, op grond van Ius Sanguinis, die wet van die bloed, as
brugbouers tussen volke in hierdie land op te tree nie. Dit is daarom
moeilik vir enige spesifieke politieke groepering of rassegroep om
bruinmense vir hulself op te eis of in ’n blik te druk, want ons behoort
aan almal oor die hele spektrum heen. Daar is selfs mense wat vir jou stem
in die Vryheidsfront, Pieter.

In ’n verklaring in die Parlement op 11 November 2004 onder die opskrif,
Herkoms en destinasie, sê ek onder andere dat bruinmense sal versoen word.
Ons moet eers met onsself versoen, met ons identiteit versoen, met ons
vorming om in te pas in God se verlossingsplan versoen, voordat ons
bedienaars van versoening in die land van ons geboorte word.

In die musiekblyspel deur ons geskrywe, //ib Koasa Kare re! of Ons sal sy
lof verkondig is die deurlopende verhaal wat vertel word, dié van ’n saad
wat oorgedra, weggesmyt en weer opgetel word. Dit is ’n saad wat verwys na
ons Godgegewe identiteit en potensiaal. Hierdie sentrale tema word
saamgeweef met ’n beskrywing van ons voorouers se interaksie met Dias, Da
Gama, Schmidt en die wedervaringe van Krotoa en sluit af met die lied:

   Daar’s ’n fontein wat bruis
   In die dor woestyn
   Wat weer verkwikking bring
   Dis ’n soet fontein
   Wat weer sal lewe bring
   En van genesing sing


   Daar’s `n brug wat ons weer
   Bymekaar sal bring
   Ons sal mekaar kan dra


   Soos ons hande vat
   Sal ons van vreudge sing
   Dis die jubeljaar


   Dis die tyd
   Dis die tyd
   Vir ’n nuwe lied
   Wat uit vergifnis spruit
   Dis die tyd
   Dis die tyd
   Sing en juig dit uit
   Dit is die Kairostyd.

Mnr die President,as ’n groep wat een komponent uitmaak van die diversiteit
– en ons is nie iets tussen wit en swart nie; ons staan in ons eie reg – is
ons gereed om gemobiliseer te word en te mobiliseer vir ’n verenigde Suid-
Afrika waar die waardigheid van elke mens gerespekteer en verdedig word. ’n
Verenigde Suid-Afrika gebou op die fondamente van reg en geregtigheid. Met
dié deel van die eed het ek geen probleme nie. Dit is egter tyd dat ons
wegbeweeg van gister en nie toelaat dat nuwe geslagte vasgeketting bly aan
die verlede nie. Minister Pandor moet asseblief kennis neem: Dit is tyd vir
’n nuwe lied. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[We are mixed and thereby related by implication, family, everybody’s
family. There is no group that I know of, Mr President, who is so well-
positioned on the basis of Ius Sanguinis, the law of the blood, to act as
bridge-builders between the people of this country. That is why it is
difficult for any specific political group or race group to lay claim to
brown people or to put them in a box, because we belong to everybody over
the full spectrum. There are even those who voted for you in the Freedom
Front, Pieter.

In a statement in Parliament on the 11 November 2004 under the heading,
Origin and Destination, I said inter alia that brown people will become
reconciled. We must first become reconciled with ourselves, reconciled with
our identity, reconciled with our moulding to fit into God’s salvation
plan, before we can become the ministers of reconciliation in the country
of our birth.

In the musical that we have written, //ib Koasa Kare re! or We will
proclaim his praise, the continuous narrative, is about a seed that is
transferred, discarded and picked up again. It is a seed that refers to our
God-given identity and potential. This central theme is weaved together
with a description of our ancestors’ interaction with Diaz, Da Gama,
Schmidt and the experiences of Krotoa and ends with the song:

   Daar’s ’n fontein wat bruis
   In die dor woestyn
   Wat weer verkwikking bring
   Dis ’n soet fontein
   Wat weer sal lewe bring
   En van genesing sing


   Daar’s `n brug wat ons weer
   Bymekaar sal bring
   Ons sal mekaar kan dra


   Soos ons hande vat
   Sal ons van vreudge sing
   Dis die jubeljaar


   Dis die tyd
   Dis die tyd
   Vir ’n nuwe lied
   Wat uit vergifnis spruit
   Dis die tyd
   Dis die tyd
   Sing en juig dit uit
   Dit is die Kairostyd.

Mr President, as a group that constitutes one component of diversity – and
we are not something between white and black; we exist in our own right –
we are prepared to be mobilised and to mobilise for a united South Africa
where the dignity of every person shall be respected and protected. A
united South Africa built on the foundation of law and justice. I do not
have a problem with this part of the pledge. However, it is time to move
away from yesterday and not allow the new generations to remain chained to
the past. Minister Pandor must please take note: It is time for a new song.
I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr J J MAAKE: Madam Speaker, the hon President of the Republic, hon Deputy
President, Ministers and fellow Members of Parliament.
Today, I’m giving a speech in the second decade of our liberation; the
liberation that our people fought for so hard; the liberation which saw our
people lose their loved ones; which saw people jailed, hanged and maimed by
a system which was declared a curse against humanity.

We are now in a democracy that had restored the dignity of our people; in a
democracy that has improved the lives of the majority of our people.
Apartheid was horrible, inhuman, best understood to the full by those of us
who were on the receiving end of it. Today, we can proudly talk about the
growth in the economy for the betterment of our own people.

Madam Speaker, the ANC government always stated as its mission the creation
of a South African nation; united in diversity and located in an African
context; and the main socialising vehicle in achieving this being education
and skills development. Education has a primary role to play in building
social cohesion in a country like ours; which is still in the process of
emerging from years of oppression, inequality and indignity.
How many amongst the opposition in this House ever think about anything in
an African context? We talk about social cohesion; must it not be in the
African context? By social cohesion, our country seems to seek to attain
the following objectives: to promote social cohesion, nation-building, and
national identity; eliminate poverty, unemployment and other symptoms of
underdevelopment; and to eliminate racism, xenophobia and intolerance.

Social cohesion seeks to address two basic problems. The first challenge is
the social fragmentation at the level of communities manifesting itself in
various ways, such as: high levels of domestic violence; criminality;
teenage pregnancies; decline in social values as well as decline in levels
of social solidarity. The second challenge is that of building and
upgrading social infrastructure in our communities.

It is gratifying to see the good work that the ANC government has done for
our people. For instance, if one was to drive from Messina to the Cape,
along the road there are houses which the government has built for its
people. To think that those houses that one sees, because they are along
that particular road, are just but a drop in the ocean.

Some in this House only see what they want to see, which can’t be very
clever if it does not show any objectivity. The opposition is suffering
from a shifting sense of illusion which in this country can only be cured
by the people’s movement, the African National Congress. I would like to
repeat that: This shifting sense of illusion can only be cured by the
people’s movement which is my movement. [Applause.]

The ANC government is putting in place social mobilisation campaigns and
programmes aimed at addressing nonmaterial aspects such as patriotism,
tolerance, mutual respect, self and national identity, and human
solidarity, which are concepts foreign to most of the opposition in this
House.

As the President said in his address last week:

   Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated
   and comprehensive antipoverty strategy that addresses especially sections
   of the population most affected by this scourge. This includes children,
   women, youth, people living in rural areas and urban informal
   settlements, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, and elderly.

Though we can go on and on about our achievements, we still have areas
where we lack and which we need to address. Critical elements of the war
against poverty are: We need to speed up land and agrarian reform with
detailed plans for land acquisition; better implementation of agricultural
support services and household food support; and improving the capital base
and increasing the reach of MAFISA to our people in order to provide
microcredit in this sector.

It is very interesting, Madam Speaker, to note that under apartheid farmers
would be afforded a 65-year lease on their farms, 65 years. But, today
under a democratic government credit of this nature is not afforded to
people who deservedly should be afforded these services.

When people are conquered, their history is obliterated, be it names,
culture and their way of life as a whole. It is not as if these
geographical places didn’t have names, but real names were simply tippexed
out and all we have to do is to remove the tippex and the real names will
appear.

As part of reconciliation and reconstruction, it however remains a duty of
the ANC-led government to demonstrate to the people of South Africa that
the process of name and renaming of our geographical places reflect the
following: our culture; heritage; legends; geography; history; et cetera.
The correct and accurate rendering of geographical names conveys meaning
well beyond the name itself.

The process of naming and renaming of geographical places should be viewed
by the masses as a national effort to build a new South Africa, which is
defined by a common dream. Last year, when President Thabo Mbeki was
responding to questions in this House about the naming and renaming of
geographical places he said:

   Part of the colonial and apartheid strategy was indeed to destroy the
   identity of the majority of people in this country, so that this majority
   should see itself in the image of the colonial and the apartheid masters.
   Hence, we have places such as East London, Parys and Newcastle in South
   Africa; because this was seen as an extension of Europe. So, naturally,
   it would be amiss for a free SA as an Africa country with citizens who
   are Africans not to address this matter. Instead the street names should
   either reflect names of freedom fighters or past leaders, not people who
   previously colonised them.

Madam Speaker, there was war in this country, like in many other countries
that fought for liberation. It would be a fallacy to ever think that there
was never a war. Wars of liberation have its heroes; it definitely has its
veterans, war veterans they are called. In other countries these veterans
are visible for everyone to see and be proud of. Veterans of the liberation
struggle that we can talk about include Solomon Mahlangu, Vuyisile Mini,
Hogia Hende in Angola, Josia Magama Tongogara in Zimbabwe, Didan Kimati in
Kenya, Amilcar Cabral in Guinea Bissau, Alexander Matrosov in the Soviet
Union, Eduardo Mondlane in Mozambique.

I’ve never heard any of the opposition talking about any of these heroes.
Is it because they don’t like them, or is it because they have some other
heroes that they can’t talk freely about? [Laughter.] War veterans who
sacrificed their lives for freedom and justice in many countries enjoy
benefits, for example, free public transport, medical aid, war pensions,
and so on.

The ANC government definitely needs to be looking at this critical issue
and have it resolved as of yesterday. There is no way in which this issue
can be wished away lest it comes back and haunts us in the future.

Our health services have significantly improved. How many clinics do we
have in villages? When I grew up there was no clinic in any village as far
as I can remember. What distance did our people have to walk, be they sick
as they would be, in order to reach a medical facility? Is there anyone in
this House who can disapprove of what I’m saying? In the village that I
come from - I come from Shiluvane in Tzaneen - we had two hospitals less
than 500 m apart from each other: one for Tsonga-speaking people and one
for Northern Sotho speaking people, whilst hundreds of villages didn’t have
any hospital around. That is what the Bantustan system had done to people’s
lives.

The last time I talked to ... [Time expired.]. Thank you.

Ms L L MABE: Speaker, hon President and all members of Parliament, ...

[... I want to start off by saying one swallow does not make a summer.
There is a commotion from the opposition parties who are threatening South
Africans with an alliance. They are making a lot of noise but those who
understand South African politics know very well that this means nothing.
If there was a fire, we would have noticed by the smoke. If something was
to come of their noise, it would have manifested itself earlier. If the ANC
was on fire, we would have been aware. We, the ANC are not scared, because
we have been fighting for freedom and a better life for our people long
before this commotion started.

I would like to say this to the President: Something terrible happened in
Skierlik in Swartruggens in the past few days. If we, as members of this
House, ignore this thing, then we would not be doing our job. Such
discrimination which still persists in our country was visible in Skierlik
in Swartruggens, where a person saw fit to take a gun and shoot black
people in their own area ...]

... people who are ravaged by poverty; people who are ravaged by inequality
because they live in an area where they cannot get services - the farmers
who live there do not want to make it possible for them to get services.

Motho a bo a tsaya tlhobolo ya gagwe a bolaya batho ba mo malatsing a a

[Legofi.]

Fa re re magora go ša mabapi, re kaya gore ... (Translation of Setswana
paragraphs follows.)

[It is embarrassing because the previous day he was making money by selling
chicken to the same people whom he killed with a gun. What got into him?

Whilst I am still talking, I would like you to visualise the picture of
Skierlik and look as to whether what we are doing as members of this House
is right, especially those who still refuse to believe that discrimination
still exists. We don’t want to accept the fact that discrimination still
exists, so that we can fight it. We, as the ANC, have accepted the fact
that it still exists and we are going to get rid of it. We will only be
satisfied when it is finally defeated. [Applause.]

The saying that people living together should help each other implies that
...]

... an injury to one is an injury to all. That is why it is important for
all of us to assist those who are still experiencing racism in our country.
We must assist them in our constituencies as Members of Parliament. That is
why it was important for me and hon Chauke to be absent from this House to
ensure that we were with those people of Skierlik and to ensure that they
got justice.

For your information, I was really disappointed to hear a prosecutor saying
that there was no need to interpret in court so that victims could
understand what was taking place in court. I was really disappointed when
the prosecutor said that as long as the perpetrator and the lawyer of the
perpetrator understood, that was what was important. What about those who
were suffering? What about those who lost their family members? Didn’t they
have the right to understand and hear what was taking place in court?
Didn’t they have the right to understand, in their own language, when the
prosecutor stated what the person was being accused of?

I also want to say that maybe it is time for this House to amend the
Constitution. Section 35 of the Constitution says that those who are
accused must understand the proceedings in court in their own language. It
also says that they must have a legal practitioner to represent them. I
think, ...

... mme Mabandla, a go tsenyeletswe mo Molaotheong gore batlhokofatswa le

[... Ms Mabandla, let the Constitution also include compensation and legal
representation of the victims. We should not do it through the Victims’
Charter but rather through the Constitution so that they too can be
protected. This should send a clear message, especially after the members
of the Skierlik family were killed and injured, that they can get a
representative from the Legal Aid Board.

These people should also be protected against any form of violence. The ANC
would like to remind the Department of Justice and Constitutional
Development that, while we are sitting in courts listening, we also have to
realise that not only the perpetrator but also the deceased have the right
to live. When we make decisions, we should also consider the fact that the
deceased also had the right to live and the law has to intervene.

Even the accused – whom I still regard as a boy because a man who is 18
years of age acts responsibly, and would not have committed this crime -
has been indoctrinated to discriminate and he is not even aware of it.
However, the manner in which he was raised cannot to be used as a scapegoat
to avoid prosecution. His lawyer suggested that he go for psychiatric
evaluation.

Why is it that when a white person kills a black person, it is said he
should go for psychiatric evaluation but when it is the other way around,
psychiatric evaluation is not suggested. Why? This is a clear indication
that we do not treat people equally because of their skin colour. This is
one of the issues that we have to talk about.  I will come up with a
suggestion as to when we are going to talk about discrimination and how far
we have come. It is true that we have made progress in fighting it but we
still have to talk about it. This is a People’s Parliament, now ...]

... let us speak for the people who elected us.

[I want to go back to the future of provinces and say to Mr President, I am
amazed as to why we are not discussing the floor crossing issue. It is
against this background that we got rid of it because they were
complaining. They are talking about the resolutions of the 52nd ANC
conference which are relevant to them. They have long been complaining
about floor crossing, why don’t they complain when it no longer exists? Why
are they not complaining? I am still waiting for you to say that you
discontinued it faster than it was anticipated.

Regarding the province issue, the ANC never said it wanted provinces.
[Interjections.]
We never said we wanted them! It was a way of finding a solution to our
discussions, now they just brought us troubles. Firstly, our people do not
want these geographical borders. They hate them! That is why we experienced
the uprising in Khutsong and Matatiele. Our people want better services.
They see themselves as South Africans and not people from certain
provinces.

This matter has brought us and will continue to bring us problems because
although we should be spending government funds on services for our people,
the funds first have to go to the provinces. When the funds go via the
provinces, services collapse because there is a system that has to be
followed for people to be provided with services.

This is the People’s Parliament and we will ensure that this issue is taken
care of. We will still hold discussions around this issue in order to find
out how the provinces benefit our people, to ensure that they receive
better services while there are funds available to do so. We will revisit
it and I would be pleased if you are prepared to discuss this issue. The
ANC will engage you on this matter ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy President, colleagues, I
believe we have, in this House, moved beyond establishing that we first
find ourselves in a crisis in more than one regard. Every party has thus
been eager to propose all kinds of solutions to the problems and challenges
we face. Some of these proposals were insightful and others crippled by
sheer political opportunism.

It is also apparent that we lack, in this House, the basic skills for
problem solving. It was interesting, but not surprising, to note that most
of what is suggested is nothing more than quick fixes. What is required is
to acknowledge the root of the problem first. The NA believes that the
essence of the challenges and problems lie in the government’s denial that
one of its ideological foundations is the major cause of the poor and
shameful state of affairs in this country. More specifically is the fact
that the government’s transformation model presents a colossal obstacle in
the path of achieving the goal of a better life for all. I want to
emphasise that transformation as a principle is not a problem, but the
model favoured by the governing party is a problem. Rethink this obsession
with transformation coupled with improved planning and we would find
ourselves in a total different situation in this country.

We have been bombarded in the last few years with what government perceives
as progress made. Unfortunately, doing the bare minimum and representing it
as progress is not enough. I say bare minimum because with a vibrant
democracy and the economic growth of the last few years, the poverty
indexes should have reflected a different story.

Die negatiewe toedrag van sake in ons land word aangehelp deur
ondoeltreffende opposisie in hierdie Huis. In plaas van deurdagte,
ewewigtige en blywende bydraes kry ons voorstelle van gevestigde partye wat
niks minder as oppervlakkige kommentaar lewer nie.

Dit is interessant om daarop te let dat sedert die Nasionale Party nie meer
met meer as 20% steun die grootste opposisieparty in hierdie Huis is nie,
die groter opposisiepartye se gesamentlike ondersteuningsbasis gedaal het.
In werklikheid het die ANC-regering se ondersteuningsbasis in hierdie Huis
vergroot van meer as 60% tot meer as 70%.

Net soos Suid-Afrika ’n nuwe regering benodig, benodig ons ’n nuwe, meer
doeltreffende amptelike opposisie, soos waarna die agb Green verwys het. So
’n alternatiewe opposisie sal die weg baan vir ’n toekomstige nuwe
koalisieregering wat ongetwyfeld meer verteenwoordigend sal wees van al
Suid-Afrika se mense. Tot dan sal ons nog ’n hele tydjie die onbeholpenheid
van die ANC moet verdra. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The negative state of affairs in our country is ably assisted by the
ineffective opposition in this House. Instead of well-thought-out, level-
headed, enduring contributions, we get proposals from established parties
that are nothing more than superficial commentary.

It is interesting to note that since the National Party no longer is the
largest opposition party in this House with more than 20% support, the
larger opposition parties’ joint support base has decreased.  In reality
the ANC government’s support base has grown in this House from more than
60% to more than 70%.

Just like South Africa needs a new government, we need a new, more
effective official opposition, as referred to by the hon Green. Such an
alternative opposition party will pave the way for a new coalition
government in the future that will undoubtedly be more representative of
South Africa and its entire people. Until then, we will still have to
suffer the ineptness of the ANC for quite a while. I thank you.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Madam Speaker, Mr President, Deputy President, hon
members. The President’s state of the nation address calls for all South
Africans to unite as never before to meet the challenges facing our
country. Our national success depends on the determination of government,
the private sector and civil society in addition to that of ordinary
individual citizens to stand up, take and make progress for the benefit of
South Africa and the rest of the African continent.

The serious problems and vital issues before us compel me to reflect on the
crucial role of Parliament in attaining our common objective of a better
life for all.

The 18th century British statesman and political philosopher, Edmund Burke,
wrote: “Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and
hostile interests, but a deliberative assembly of one nation with one
nation with one interest, that of the whole.” And so it is today. We may be
elected from different provinces and different parties but we represent one
South Africa, a successful South Africa. [Applause.]

I ask my hon colleagues to consider the special responsibility of
Parliament to provide leadership, to set the example of unity for national
progress and growth.

Sections 55 to 57 of our Constitution give powers to the National Assembly.
Hon members will agree that we still have a great deal of work ahead of us,
despite real time constraints. We are going to need devoted and committed
members to go the extra mile at all times.

McAnda quotes Robert Sobukwe at Fort Hare in 1949, and he says:


   We want to build a new Africa and only we can build it. Let me plead with
   you, lovers of my Africa, to carry with you into the world, the vision of
   a new Africa, an Africa reborn, an Africa rejuvenated, an Africa
   recreated young Africa. We are the first glimmers of a new dawn, and if
   we are persecuted for our views, we should remember the African saying
   that “It is darkest before dawn”. Let us not fail the leaders who came
   before us. [Applause.]

Hon members, we are the first glimmers of democracy. Let us ensure that
future generations will remember us with pride as they enjoy the sweat of
our toils. Let us be proud of our efforts and continue to defend our gains
while we confront our challenges.

How far have we come? When we first met in 1994, it looked like working
together as different parties was impossible, because of what we all went
through before democracy. But we did leap over that hurdle because, hon
members, it is not about us; it is the nation we must think of at all
times.
As we conclude our term, not too long from today, it should be with pride
that we return to our constituencies, to men and women who will be proud of
the work done on their behalf. Our work here at home and elsewhere in the
world speaks volumes. It cannot be a mistake that so many countries have
such a lot of confidence in us. We are an example to the world that,
irrespective of our past, we will, as a collective, give our best to the
country, Mr President. We can still do much better, especially in this
Assembly, where we have the opportunity to express the will of the people
on whose behalf we legislate.

One of our most pressing tasks is to bring material fruit to many South
Africans who remain very poor; that is all they are asking for.

We join you, Mr President, in the war against poverty. As South Africans,
we are the troops in the national war room. Those amongst us who are adept
in war are used like the snake of Mount Chang: when struck on the head, its
tail attacks; when struck on the tail, its head attack; when struck in the
centre, both head and tail attack. [Applause.]

Sun Tsu speaks about the snake in his book The Art of War.

We are ready, more than ever before. We will demonstrate that, like the
snake of Mount Chang, we are capable of instantaneous co-ordination. We are
unstoppable as this collective in the fight against hunger, poverty and
squalor.

We must drive poverty and hopelessness out of our communities. Don’t pass
that little girl who goes to school without shoes or the boy whose pants
are torn. Make it your business. But, above all, we must bring skills to
the communities so that they end up generating income for themselves.

Maloba re ne re gateletswe, mme go bontsha gore tsotlhe tse re neng re di
batla re ne re di batlela Aforika Borwa, re batlela Aforika Borwa batho
botlhe ba Aforika Borwa, re ne ra bona le manaba a maloba a tla mmogo go
rotloetsa puso ya batho. (Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[In the past we were oppressed but it shows that all that we wanted was a
South Africa of all the people. We even saw our former enemies coming
together to encourage the government of the people.]

Together, we buried apartheid, and we gave birth to democracy. Mr
President, we stand head and shoulders with you in the fight against
poverty. We are in the national war room against poverty.

I reiterate: Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and
hostile interests, but a deliberative assembly of one nation with one
interest, that of the whole. [Applause.]
Parliament’s approval of Bills means that there is no law in this country
which has not gone through our hands. We provide directives to the
administrative bodies for the execution of government policies.

As it is Business Unusual for the executive and the country, the burden is
doubly on us. We need to be ready.

The legislative function of Parliament is very important. We need to ask
ourselves the following as representatives of the people: Did I do what I’m
expected to do by the electorate?

Was I available to say: “Yes, Mr President, these 24 apex areas are
important?” And as a voice of the voiceless masses of our country, will I
go an extra mile to ensure that, when my tour of duty has ended, I will be
remembered with pride, as a person who represented a party which left no
stone unturned in pursuit of a better life for all South Africans, or did I
just enjoy the muffins and coffee and no work?

To be able to achieve most of the work facing us this year, we need a
vibrant Parliament. We need members committed to their committee work. This
year, we do not want to hear that a committee could not meet because there
was no quorum. When that happens, we need to be mindful that we are
betraying the confidence of our people. When the departments come to brief
members of Parliament, they should find them. And when questions are put in
the House, the executive should be here to answer them, unless that is
completely unavoidable.

In order to assist members in their tasks, we have launched the Leadership
Development Programme, which is empowering members with the skills
necessary for the performance of their functions.

Democracy needs, amongst others, good leaders. The attention to systematic
development of leaders and the concept of actually leading, rather than
managing or administering, is increasingly becoming a priority as we are
faced with the challenges thrown up by efforts to ensure continuous social
justice in our society.

We as Members of Parliament need to provide the leadership for long-term
change that we need in the country. We need to raise the levels of
consciousness of our citizens about the importance of Parliament and its
role in enhancing good governance and what has been the concern of very
many of our citizens, service delivery.

Mr President, about 60 of our MPs graduated from Rhodes University last
year. [Applause.] A total of 23 MPs satisfied the requirements for a
Diploma in Economics with the University of the Western Cape; 12 MPs
satisfied the requirements for Honours in Economics with the University of
the Western Cape. [Applause.] All things remaining the same, there will be
a big graduation ceremony on 28 February. [Applause.] I met with the Vice-
Chancellor of UWC this morning, and it looks like it’s possible.

On 10 May 2004 former President Mandela, at a Joint Sitting of the National
Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, in his address to
commemorate 10 years of a democratic South Africa, said:

   My wish is that South Africans never give up on the belief in goodness,
   that they cherish the faith in human beings as a cornerstone of our
   democracy. The first value mentioned under the founding principles of our
   Constitution is that of human dignity. We accord a person dignity by
   assuming that they are good, that they share human qualities we ascribe
   to ourselves. Historical enemies succeeded in negotiating a peaceful
   transition from apartheid to democracy exactly because we were prepared
   to accept the inherent capacity or goodness in the other.

As this collective, we can make a lot of things happen, so let us not doubt
the strength that lies within each and everyone of us.

In fact, the respect commanded by South African MPs is enormous. All the
international forums our MPs engage with elect them to positions of
leadership. Among those we count the SADC, the Pan-African Parliament, the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

This morning our Parliament engaged in yet another significant and
potentially enormously constructive engagement: Hon Rebecca Kasienyane,
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Labour; Hon Zoe Kota, Chairperson
of the Portfolio Committee on Housing; hon Ruben Mohlaloga, Chairperson of
the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land Affairs; hon Connie
September, Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Water Affairs and
Forestry and I met with the ambassador of Indonesia, the High Commissioner
of Malaysia, the High Commissioner of the Republic of Singapore and the
Ambassador of Vietnam, to discuss matters of mutual interest to our
parliaments and to see how we can help each other. [Applause.]

I can say with pride that those hon members represented all of you in such
a wonderful manner.

Further evidence of the stature of the South African Parliament and the
leadership which this House gives internationally is to be found in the
fact that, in April this year, we will be hosting the 118th Inter-
Parliamentary Union Assembly here in Cape Town. This is a significant forum
which brings together 148 national parliaments from around the globe, and
serves as an important forum for inter-parliamentary contact. This will be
the first time that South Africa is the host.

There is an enormous amount of work ahead. We will not hesitate to tackle
it. It is for the interests of South Africans that we will join you, Mr
President, in rolling up our sleeves and getting down to work for the
betterment of our people.

Batho ba Aforika Borwa ba itse sentle gore puso e, e dirile go tlala
seatla. Ba a lo rata lona baemedi ba bona. Le itlhoba boroko, le itlhobela
Aforika Borwa wa gaetsho. Re a leboga, le ka moso bagaetsho. (Translation
of Setswana paragraph follows.)
[South Africans know very well that the government has done a lot for them.
They like their representatives. You work tirelessly for the sake of our
country. We thank you for that.]

Up, let your face be bright, for your light has come and the glory of the
Lord is shining on you. Thank you, Mr President. [Applause.]

Mr R COETZEE: Madam Speaker, the ANC has never been more dismal in a state
of the nation debate as it has been in this one. The implication is that
deep down the ANC knows the truth, which is that our ship of state is not
on course; it is off course and in perilous waters, and in danger of
running aground.

The ANC lacks the moral courage and humility to accept reality and take
responsibility – and the hon Chohan in particular seems to have a problem
with taking responsibility. So each ANC speaker stands up here and
dissembles, denies and dismisses criticism with self-righteous contempt.
But, let’s look reality in the eye for a moment.

The reality is that the ANC’s attachment to what it calls “the national
democratic revolution”, and in particular its policy of deploying loyal
cadres to institutions - under the Constitution - that are meant to be
independent of the ruling party, is a direct assault on the Constitution.
The NDR, national democratic revolution, is an anticonstitutional power
grab. The hon Cronin needs to know that, and he needs to give it up.

The reality is that the power outages across South Africa are caused by a
dismal failure of leadership and lack of vision and planning in the face of
clear warnings. The outages are not an act of God; they are not the
consequence of economic success; and they are most emphatically not, and I
quote: “a mere engineering solution to an engineering problem.”

The reality is that corruption has become part of our national culture as a
direct consequence of the ANC elite’s lust for money. The arms deal and the
cover-up of its corruption is a festering sore on the visage of the ANC and
a blight on the reputation of our country. That’s actually the reality out
there.

The reality is that we are failing in the fight against crime because the
Minister responsible is complacent, if not a somnambulist. Our security
agencies are at war with each other because the country’s top cop is in
league with a drug lord.

The reality is that our education system is failing; our response to Aids
is too little and too late; our labour market regime is job-denying; our
Public Service is incapacitated; and our foreign policy is too often an
embarrassment.

The ANC, today, is characterised by arrogance, incompetence, carelessness,
greed and denial. And that’s the moral high ground
you’re on, hon Minister of Safety and Security, and I trust you’re enjoying
the view from up there.

Who is to blame for this reality: Is it apartheid? Is it the opposition? Is
it the media? How about big business? I put it to you, Madam Speaker, that
the ANC is to blame; the responsible Ministers are to blame and the
President is to blame. You see, the flipside of winning power ...

The SPEAKER: Order, hon member, there’s a point of order being raised! What
is the point of order?

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, the hon member says that the ANC is arrogant.
You see, when you say that a movement of this nature is arrogant ...
[Interjections.] ... No, no, wait! I’m not done with my point of order yet.
He said this with his hand in the pocket, pointing at these hon leaders who
have sacrificed so much that today he is able to stand in that podium and
say that they are out of order ...
The SPEAKER: Hon Chauke, that’s not a point of order. Continue, hon member.

Mr R COETZEE: The flipside of winning power, hon Chauke, is that you have
to take responsibility for what you do with it. It’s just not credible,
Prof Asmal said, “to employ the tired trick of measuring the present
against the apartheid past” and say that 2008 is better, as, quite
obviously, is 1968, ’78 and ’88, and then drawing the false and illogical
conclusion that the ANC in power has achieved what it should have achieved
by now.

The trouble with the ANC is that it labours under the delusion and the idea
that it governs by some kind of divine right, as if it is a matter of
destiny that the ANC should represent the majority of South Africans.
Hence, Mr Zuma’s, or should I say Rev Zuma’s, fatuous boast that “the ANC
will rule until Jesus comes”, because who needs accountability when you’re
going to win. Who needs to listen to alternative views? Who needs to be
mindful of criticism? And so we arrive at the arrogance of power.

The ANC will pay a price for its arrogance. I’m here to tell you – and it’s
going into the Hansard record – that one day the ANC will wake up to find
that the voters have moved on. I’m actually trying to give you some helpful
advice, you might want to listen.

The leadership will find itself stranded with its BMWs; its bodyguards; its
Johnnie Walker Blue Labels; the detritus of a forgotten liberation
movement, a vanguard party no more.

It may not happen next year; it may not happen the year after, but happen
it will, because the greatest enemy of corrupt, incompetent and arrogant
governing parties is not the opposition, but time. From the moment they’re
elected, the clock starts ticking. The moral capital with which they began
is progressively squandered. Slowly the patience of the people trickles
away, and then the unthinkable happens, and the powerful come crashing
down. You need to listen to this!

It’s a great irony that a party with so much belief in the primacy of
history, with a capital H, should have so little sense of it.

Madam Speaker, the President is fond of poaching. Perhaps it’s time that
his party contemplated the words of Shelley’s Ozymandias, which I’m going
to read you now:


  I met a traveller from an antique land
  Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
  Half sunk, a shatterd visage lies, who’s frown
  And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
  Which yet survive, stamp’d on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mock’d them and the heart that fed.
  And on the pedestal these words appear:
  “My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
  Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”
  Nothing beside remains: round the decay
  Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
  The lone and level sands stretch far away.

That, Madam Speaker, is the epitaph that one day will be written on the
gravestone of the ANC. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Ke batho ba mme. [They are my
people.]

Somlomo wePhalamende, Mongameli wezwe lakithi, Phini likaMongameli,
oNgqongqoshe namaPhini oNgqongqoshe, amalungu onke eNdlu lena eshaya
umthetho, bantwana bakaMakgatho oLuthuli noTambo, ... (Translation of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Madam Speaker of Parliament, President of our country, Deputy President,
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Members of the legislature, children of
Makgatho, Luthuli and Tambo ...]

Perhaps the hon Coetzee needs to be told that the reality is that we are
changing South Africa from what it was as a result of his forefathers.
[Applause.]

The ANC has declared 2008 as the year of mass mobilisation to build a
caring society and advance in unity towards 2012. The United Nations
General Assembly has proclaimed this year as the International Year of
Languages. It is against this backdrop that I make my contribution on the
mass literacy campaign dubbed the ``Kha Ri Gude Noma Masifunde Sonke’’,
initiated by the Department of Education. The target of this campaign is to
reach 4,7 million adults who are illiterate by the end of 2012. It will
provide access to basic literacy and numeracy to the people of our land.
This is the most revolutionary task and investment we can make in ordinary
people in order for them to enjoy their hard-won freedom.

Our revolution and its defence thereof would never succeed if our people
remained ignorant. In the true spirit of mass mobilisation, all of us need
to take up this campaign to ensure that South Africans, all of us, ...

... siyafunda. [... we are learning.]

In the 8 January statement of the ANC, the movement said:


  As the ANC, we must applaud this initiative and work to ensure its
  success. We must encourage people to participate in this campaign, and
  provide whatever assistance we can at a local level to facilitate its
  implementation.


Again, we need to ensure the mass involvement of the people in the
programme to save energy in the country. To this extent, we need to heed
the call for us to save energy and observe the ten points which Minister
Sonjica has raised. When we criticise electricity shortages, we need to, as
well, take into cognisance that, so far, for the past 13 years, the
government has been involved in the Integrated National Electrification
Programme, which has made it possible for ordinary South Africans to have
access to electricity.

It must be weighed against the assertion by the former government, which
proclaimed that people have access to electricity. We must emphasise that
the democratic government, when it took over, wanted people to have access
to electricity because there was no such thing as access to electricity,
and that access to electricity informed the mothballing of mainly three
power stations in Mpumalanga. We need to remind this House of the 1998
White Paper on Energy, which dealt with diversification of the generation
capacity of electricity. Government availed 30% of power generation to
independent power producers - no one today raises a no-show by the private
sector – and the initiative was led by the Department of Minerals and
Energy. [Interjections.] I am coming to you.
The issue about this gives us another challenge, the challenge which we
need to start tackling, especially this year, of the electricity
distribution industry. So it’s really laughable to listen to some of the
posturing here, which people have displayed. If you take the ID, for
instance, it called on the government to step down. You can see that it’s
just wishful thinking, and by the way, even the person who raised this was
so afraid to come up with this proposal that she made it a point to give it
to the Deputy Chief Whip behind closed doors, because she couldn’t stand
here, hold her head up high and say what she was saying. She was the victim
of circumstances, because they rushed to the media, and put targets they
know they can’t fulfil.

We need to commend the hon Holomisa for keeping the ANC always in the news.
He has left now. [Interjections.] He makes the task of the spokesperson of
the ANC very easy, because it’s always on the agenda. He’s doing quite a
good job. [Interjections.] Even when
there is a thunderstorm, he blames the ANC. It gives the ANC a name, that
he believes in the ANC and that it has these supernatural powers. It can
deal with everything and all the problems of society. [Applause.] He has no
idea of what he stands for, and because of that, he falls for everything.
That is the highest degree of political opportunism we have ever had.

To you, hon Madam ... What’s her name? [Interjections.] We need, again, to
say sorry. This is the only organisation which, as the ANC, must say that
they’re sorry to the DA. We are so sorry that the President disappointed
them. They wanted to see a much divided ANC with a President who was
supposed to pronounce on what their leader has said the President must
pronounce – the stopping of the national democratic revolution. We’re
sorry.

This freaks them out, because this unity of the ANC which is so needed by
this country with this alliance is a pain in their ankle. [Interjections.]

We are also told about individualism, that we are here as individuals, and
that people should have individual posturing and so on and so forth, but
what has happened is that we have been oppressed as a nation. We have not
been oppressed as individuals, as they say. Therefore, what has been
central to us is this building of the nation, and ensuring that Africans,
and not individuals, rejoice in the freedom of their labour.

I heard from the UCDP, from the hon Mfundisi. I don’t know what kind of
South African would rejoice when the national team struggles, because it is
the national team for all of us. I can only sum it up in one way:

Ke batho ba me. Tsa me. [They are my people. It’s mine.]

We need to deal with these conservative ideologies. We are a people, caring
and sharing, which has always been the African perspective and principles
of the way of life. So, there is no way that we would be talking and
looking at ourselves as individuals.

I want to know from Mr Simmons why the model the ANC is following on
transformation is the wrong one. He didn’t provide us with an alternative
model. I think we need to restate, so that he perhaps knows better, because
on this we owe no one any apology: Ours is about the liberation of black
people in general, and Africans in particular, to create a nonracial,
nonsexist and democratic South Africa. So, he shouldn’t do as the DA has
done and call for early elections. People are calling for early
humiliation, really. We can’t do that. I think there is something wrong in
that, because why would you call for your own misery. [Laughter.] It really
doesn’t make sense. [Applause.]

Enkosini yakwaButhelezi, uMntwana wakwaPhindangene, mangithi cha, baba,
sibonile nezinto obuphawula ngazo sizizwile kodwa asivumelani nawe.
Sicabanga ukuthi kuningi osekwenziwe kule Ningizimu Afrika entsha.
Ngingakagxili lapho kakhulu ngizocela nje ukuthi mhlawumbe njengeqembu
siyibuke lento. Intsha yakithi kufanele siyivikele. (Translation of isiZulu
paragraph follows.)

[To the Buthelezi chief, Prince of KwaPhindangene, let me say, hon member,
we have seen and heard about the things that you are commenting on but we
disagree with you. We think that there is a lot that has been done in the
new South Africa. Without focusing much there, perhaps let us look at this
issue as a party. We must protect our youth.]

We must protect our youth. We can’t use young people as political
footballs. The Secretary-General of the ANC received a letter from Miss
Winnie Ntshaba, who plays Kethiwe in Generations, who apologised profusely
saying that she was unaware of the script she was reading. So, really, let
us protect them. We fought so hard for this freedom. We wanted the talent
of young people to be at the disposal of the nation, not to destroy it.

It is very difficult ...

...ukufundisa abantu asebebadala intando yeningi ... [... to teach elders
about democracy.]

... because this is democracy here, multiparty democracy. We are coming
from the past, which is very painful, which we can’t keep on talking about
and keep on glorifying.

In practice here, we are teaching particularly ...

... ubaba uButhelezi ukuthi ... [... hon Buthelezi that ...]

... multiparty democracy is not what we had in the KwaZulu legislative
assembly in the former Bantustan, where you had a one party organisation.
It was a one-party state.

So, this is in contrast to what is happening in South Africa where the
Premier – the Premier, for instance, who has always been attacked here is
the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal - Manzankosi, u-Comrade Ndebele - is a Premier
who is working to build the province of KwaZulu-Natal. As the province
says:

Asisukume sakhe. [Let us stand up and build.]

This is what we are doing there in the province.

Since the ANC took over, there have been many changes of Premiers. So we
don’t want to enter into these discussions because we can go to town on it.
Part of the reason why some of us got into the struggle was because of the
reality back there, both at the level of the apartheid government and the
Bantustan government of the KwaZulu legislature. [Time expired.]

Debate interrupted.

The House adjourned at 19:01.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Report of the Committee on Public Accounts

    An error occurred in the heading to the Fourteenth Report of the
    Standing Committee on Public Accounts, which was published in the
    Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports of 8 February 2008. In
    the third line of the heading, the words “Department of Public Works”
    should replace “Department of Trade and Industry”. The following is the
    correct report:


    Fourteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the
    Consideration of the Approval of the Unauthorised Expenditure incurred
    by the Department of Public Works, dated 29 January 2008:

    The Committee considered unauthorized expenditure relating to  previous
    years. It  also  considered  evidence  of  the  following  unauthorized
    expenditure totaling R 299, 218,429.94 that arose owing to overspending
    on programmes and losses, and reports as follows:

     1. During the 2001/02 financial year, an amount of R 41, 770, 429.  94
        represented unauthorized expenditure. That amount consisted of:


           1. R 32, 738,000.00  related  to  inadequate  budget  allocation
              received for the lease obligations of the National Government
              ; and


           2. R 9,032, 429.94 related to overspending  on  losses  approved
              for write-off or  which there were no funds available.

        Recommendation

        1.3      In light of the above, the Committee recommends that:
              i. Parliament approves the total  amount  of  R  41,770,429.94
                 relating to the 2001/02 financial years.
             ii. The Accounting Officer recovers  the  losses  in  terms  of
                 Treasury Regulations 12 or finance the write  off  relating
                 to losses from savings.

     2. During the 2002/03 financial year, an amount of R 227, 088,  000.00
        was incurred due to amongst  other  things;  lease  not  adequately
        funded, improving capacity of municipality, damages and losses, and
        criminal acts and justice claims.


     3. During the 2003/04  financial  year,  an  unauthorized  expenditure
        amounting to R 30, 360, 000.00 was  incurred  due  overspending  on
        capital  and  maintenance  budgets  and  more   significant   over-
        expenditure on its property rates and municipal services budget.

        The Accounting Officer confirmed that:
          a) Services for the expenditure were received to the  satisfaction
             of the Department;
          b) No individual benefited unduly from such expenditure;
          c)  Control  measures  were  in  place  to   prevent   this   from
             reoccurring.

        Recommendation
        Having  considered  the  evidence  and  the  steps  taken  by   the
        Accounting  Officer  to  prevent  similar  cases  of   unauthorized
        expenditure from recurring, the Committee recommends  the  approval
        of the amount of R 257, 448, 000.00 by Parliament.

    Report to be considered.
