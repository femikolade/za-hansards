                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the ACDP I give notice that I
shall move:


   That the House debates —


     1) whether or not the proposed national school pledge will unite or
        divide the country;


     2) whether or not the perceived need for such a pledge is valid; and


     3) the response of the public to the suggestion.

Dr J T DELPORT: I hereby give notice that I shall move:

  That the House debates the challenges facing the criminal justice system
  in South Africa.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana): I hereby give notice that I shall
move at the next sitting of this House:

   That this House debates —


     1) the positive and negative political and socioeconomic features of
        Western-sponsored democracy in pre and post colonial Africa; and


     2) the search for a conflict-free model of democracy appropriate to
        peace, stability, co-operation and development for the wellbeing of
        all the peoples of Africa.


                    SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR WINS GRAMMY AWARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


   That the House —


     1) notes that on 11 February 2008 the Soweto Gospel Choir won a Grammy
        Award in the best Traditional World Music category for their album
        African Spirit;


     2) further notes that this is the choir’s second consecutive Grammy
        Award and that they follow in the footsteps of South African music
        greats like Ladysmith Black Mambazo;


     3) recognises that the choir is truly representative, not only
        consisting of members between the ages of sixteen and forty but
        also singing in six of South Africa’s eleven official languages;


     4) further recognises that in 2003 the choir founded its own Aids
        orphans foundation, Vukani, which raises funds for Aids orphans
        establishments that receive little or no government or private
        funding and are ambassadors for Nelson Mandela’s 46664 campaign;


     5) acknowledges the vital role the choir plays not only in inspiring
        all young South African musicians, but also in showcasing the
        unique talent our country has to the rest of the world; and

     6) congratulates the Soweto Gospel Choir on the great honour that has
        been bestowed on them and wishes them well for their current United
        Kingdom tour and upcoming tours that include Lebanon, Australia and
        Fiji.

Thank you. [Applause.]

Agreed to.

   DEATH OF HEAD OF PROTOCOL IN OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, MR JOHAN REINDERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

   That the House —

      1) notes with profound sadness the death of the head of protocol in
         the office of the President, Johan Reinders, at the age of 56 on
         Monday, 18 February 2008;


      2) recognises that he is the longest serving official in the
         President’s office and worked for former presidents such as F W de
         Klerk and Nelson Mandela;


      3) acknowledges the fundamental role he played in ensuring all
         functions and public engagements hosted and attended by the
         President and Deputy President were properly managed, co-ordinated
         and of a high standard;

      4) further recognises that last week’s opening of Parliament was the
         first one he had missed in twenty-seven years; and

      5) conveys its condolences to his family and friends.


Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: The condolences of the National Assembly and the presiding
officers will also be conveyed to the Reinders family.

              PUBLIC PROTECTOR’S FINDING ON CLAIMS BY MR WATERS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr B L MASHILE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC welcomes the decision by the
Public Protector that by publishing unfounded and unverified allegations of
misconduct against the President and the medical team of the Donald Gordon
Centre, and by failing to co-operate with the Public Protector in the
investigation of his complaint, the hon Waters acted unconstitutionally and
in a manner that is unbecoming of a member of this Parliament.
The Public Protector has found that the claims that the hon Waters made in
this regard were without any foundation or substance. The ANC agrees with
the Public Protector that the public has a right to be informed of any
misconduct by the President. However, reasonable steps must be taken to
verify the information before it is published.

It is scandalous that hon Waters did not do this. It is telling that the
hon Waters has been found to have acted in a manner inimical to the very
Constitution he has sworn to uphold. In accordance with the findings and
recommendations of the Public Protector in this regard, we call on the DA
to demonstrate its loyalty to our Constitution and democratic institutions
by acting firmly against hon Waters. I thank you. [Applause.]

                      INDEPENDENCE OF PUBLIC PROTECTOR

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M J ELLIS (DA): Madam Speaker, I’m particularly pleased to be able to
rise after the previous speaker, because I wish to make the following
statement: Public Protector Lawrence Mushwana’s recent recommendation that
Parliament should take action against DA MP, hon Mike Waters merely serves
to demonstrate once again the ANC’s complete lack of respect for the
Constitution. This shows that the ANC would rather choose to pursue its own
interests, no matter what the constitutional costs may be.

While the Public Protector is meant to be completely independent from
government and any political party, past decisions made by Mushwana, such
as those relating to Oilgate, leave no confusion over where his allegiances
lie. This is a concern which was raised by the DA as far back as 2002 when
he supposedly resigned from being an active member of the ANC to take up
his position as Public Protector.

What is confusing though, Madam Speaker, is the Public Protector’s decision
to ...

Prof A K ASMAL: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Will the hon member
recognise in the House that under Chapter 7 of the Constitution every
member of the House is obliged to respect the authority and status of the
Public Protector? Will he recognise that if he has any objection to the
role of the Public Protector he should put down a motion which this House
can discuss? Otherwise I would like you to rule, Madam Speaker, that it’s
totally improper and out of order for him to impugn the integrity of the
Public Protector. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, in actual fact you will also recognise that that is
true.
Mr M J ELLIS: Yes. Can I finish my statement?

The SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, as long as your statement does not impugn the
integrity of the Public Protector.

Mr M J ELLIS: I don’t believe it does, Madam Speaker. I want to say that
very categorically. May I continue and I want to say ...

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: No, it’s not a question of
whether his statement will impugn, the statement has already impugned his
integrity. And he needs to withdraw it.

Mr M J ELLIS: Not at all, Madam Speaker. I do not believe that it can
impugn his integrity.

The SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, the hon members are pointing out something that
comes out of the statement you have just read. In actual fact, in as far as
your statement casts aspersions on the integrity of the Public Protector,
it actually has to be withdrawn. Because constitutionally and legally it is
wrong to do that, except through a substantive motion, in the same way as
it relates to other members of Parliament.

Mr M J Ellis: Madam Speaker, I will obey your ruling. I will withdraw the
statement, but I wish to give notice then that we will be moving a
substantive motion in this House in the very near future. Thank you.

               AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT APOLOGISES TO ABORIGINES

                            (Member’s Statement)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr M B Skosana (IFP)): Madam Speaker, we commend the
Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Parliament of Australia for
formally apologising on behalf of the people of Australia for the grave
injustices committed against the Aborigines for more than two centuries. Mr
Rudd said, “We apologise for the laws and policies of successive
parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering
and loss on these our fellow Aborigines.”

The forceful removal of Aborigine children from their families in order to
assimilate them into the white settler colonies has resulted in what is now
known as “the stolen generations”, ie a people marooned in a political and
cultural wilderness. In his book, The African Predicament, Kofi Awoonor
recalls Nkrumah’s perspective on a relative situation when he said the
following:


   Unblessed with the arts of good government, material and spiritual
   progress, we were still regarded as representing the infancy of mankind.
   Our highly sophisticated culture was said to be simple, paralysed by
   inertia and we had to be encumbered with tutelage.
Thank you.

                    ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF HOUSES IN DELFT

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms Z A KOTA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Cape High Court has ruled that
members of the public who were instigated by a DA councillor to illegally
occupy houses in Delft must vacate them. The DA, true to form, has again
acted opportunistically and manipulated the difficult circumstances that
our people and the country face in an attempt to score cheap political
points. They have encouraged ordinary people to break the law in an attempt
to burnish their tarnished image.

The DA have, uncaringly and without concern, abused poor people’s
aspirations for decent housing. This is despicable, shameless politicking
of the worst order. All South Africans have a right to a secure place in
which to live in peace and dignity. Housing is a human right. The ANC-led
government is committed to the goal of realising a better life for all our
people, including the provision of decent housing for all.

The ANC urges all people who have been asked to vacate those houses to
ensure that they register and that their names appear on the housing list.
The ANC is urging the Minister for Provincial and Local Government Sydney
Mufamadi to investigate the behaviour of the councillor concerned and act
appropriately. The DA leader, Helen Zille, must show leadership by acting
on this matter as a matter of urgency. I thank you.

              ALLEGATIONS AGAINST NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSIONER

                            (Member’s Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Madam Speaker, in response to questions I raised
with the President regarding the serious allegations against the National
Police Commissioner, the President said that I must explain to this House
and the nation why, “I saw fit to make the grievous insult which sought to
challenge not only the integrity of the person of the President of the
Republic, but also the Office of the President and our government as a
whole”.

In my speech I said that the ACDP believes that in the light of the very
serious revelations contained in Advocate Mpshe’s affidavit, the President
owed the public an explanation as to exactly when he became aware of the
serious allegations against Mr Selebi. The President must explain also why
he failed to suspend him, rather than answer my straightforward questions,
albeit based on allegations. The President chose to see our questions as an
insult which sought to challenge his and the government’s integrity.

Whenever there are perceived contradictions coming from government and the
Presidency, the ACDP will always ask for clarity and for the truth to be
told. We believe that the truth must be told to and by individuals, also to
restore the integrity of government. Only the President can tell us the
truth regarding this matter.

Now it is even more important, following the further allegations by
Advocate Vusi Pikoli’s lawyer that his client will tell the Ginwala
Commission that everything points to the fact that his suspension was
linked to attempts to stop the Selebi investigation. Therefore, our
question to the President still stands; we want to know when he first
became aware of the serious allegations against Commissioner Selebi and why
he did not immediately suspend him or, at the very least, in September 2007
after the NPA had obtained warrants of search and arrest? Thank you.

             ENFORCEMENT OF NEW PLEDGE AT SOUTH AFRICAN SCHOOLS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr C P MULDER (FF Plus): Madam Speaker, the FF Plus finds it shocking that
whilst the government has phased out compulsory religious education,
scripture reading and prayers at public schools, it now wants to expose
those same children to a new ideology. Minister Pandor was quick to state
that the wording of the proposed pledge comes from the Constitution.
However, that is only half the truth.

Why did the ANC government decide to conveniently ignore the very next
phrase in the preamble of the Constitution that says, “We respect those who
have worked to build and develop our country and believe that South Africa
belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity”. That was ignored.

Children, especially from the minority groups, do not know the past which
they now have to distance themselves from through this oath. What they are
experiencing at present is the persistent way in which affirmative action
is now being forced on them. It is rather necessary to teach children basic
values such as respect for life and for the property of others.

The FF Plus cannot accept that any government through whatever means wants
to lay claim to the consciences of South African children. Do we have to
remind the Minister of Education and the ANC government of the provisions
of section 15 of the Bill of Rights that guarantee freedom of conscience,
belief and opinion? The FF Plus is opposed in principle to the concept of
introducing any pledge or oath into our schools and will oppose any efforts
by this government to force this new plan on our children.

                           TRANSFORMATION IN SPORT
                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M M DIKGACWI (ANC): Madam Speaker, last year Parliament passed the
National Sport and Recreation Bill, which, amongst others, made provision
for all sports federations to enter into performance agreements with the
Department of Sport on transformation matters. It also reserved the right
for the Minister to intervene in federations where sport is brought into
disrepute.

Extensive public hearings were held across the country to enrich the
legislation. In Parliament a wide range of stakeholders participated in the
proceedings of the portfolio committee, including AfriForum which is
closely aligned to the FF Plus. AfriForum raised objections to the
principles of transformation, equity, equality in sport and alleged
political interference in sport.

On the other hand the SA Rugby Union raised concerns which were addressed
in the final version of the Bill. During the debate on the Bill, the FF
Plus threatened to approach the Constitutional Court if the President
assented to the Bill. The Bill has subsequently been signed into law by
President Mbeki. The ANC notes with concern the approach taken by AfriForum
in collaboration with former Springbok captains to use individuals in SA
Rugby as a conduit to raise their objections to alleged political
interference in rugby with the International Rugby Board.

It is ironic that the FF Plus accused the ANC of political interference in
sport while they use AfriForum, former rugby captains and naïve individuals
in the South African rugby leadership to pursue a political agenda. The FF
Plus and AfriForum know very well that the Sport and Recreation Act is
morally and constitutionally sound. The ANC calls on all South Africans to
embrace transformation in sport as an integral instrument to build a caring
and inclusive society. Thank you.

             UNUSED ROLL-OVER FUNDS DUE TO POOR SERVICE DELIVERY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr P H K DITSHETELO (UCDP): The Departments of Provincial and Local
Government and Housing have come up with a programme to assist provinces to
run their affairs efficiently and successfully. However, the question still
remains unanswered. What is the use of compiling a budget for a department
which is not going to follow it? Nothing, of course! We are being requested
to help in the alleviation of poverty, year in and year out but the amount
earmarked for the purpose is rolled over, again and again every year.

For example, the budget of the Department of Agriculture in North West was
R366,7 million and the expenditure stood at R270,9 million; which is 73,8%
of the total budget. The figure for environmental affairs was R56,9 million
and the spending was only R33,6% million; which is 59% of the allocation.
The amount budgeted for conditional grants was R8,28 million and only 2,8%
of it was spent.

Is this because the need for the original budget has become irrelevant?
Surely not. I think it is just poor service delivery. What are the reasons
for the underspending?

                        POLITICISING OF SCHOOL PLEDGE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms D VAN DER WALT (DA): Thank you Madam Speaker. The DA wishes to express
its general support for the idea of a pledge for learners. Such a pledge,
if based on values and a genuine effort to unite, can serve as a
constructive point of departure for helping young South Africans engaged
with issues of good citizenship, responsibility and social cohesion.

However, the DA would like to draw attention to the possibility of the
proposed pledge doing more harm than good, if the public is not consulted
and involved sufficiently in the process. If this pledge is designed to
build better social cohesion, there must be a well-planned and structured
mechanism for people of all ages to participate and give their views. This
must happen in order for people to feel included and to prevent resentment
at having a decision imposed upon them.

Watter versekering of waarborg bied die Minister aan die publiek dat hul
insette oorweeg sal word? [What assurance or guarantee can the Minister
offer the public that their inputs will be considered?]

Furthermore, the DA wishes to draw attention to the need for broader social
engagement with issues of responsibility, ethics and good citizenship. It
is more important that our children see in the leaders of the country
exemplary conduct and impeccable ethics that at all times provide clear
examples for them to emulate. We must hold our leaders to account using the
same standards we would want our children to live by.

When a Bill regarding the responsibilities of the youth of South Africa is
tabled, the DA will call for a First Reading debate on it. Thank you.

           REVIVAL OF RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN EAST LONDON AND MTHATHA

                            (Member’s Statement)

Nksz B N DAMBUZA (ANC): Somlomo, urhulumente oxhuzula imikhala nokhokelwa
ngumbutho wesizwe i-ANC usebenzisana nabantu ekwakheni ubomi obungcono
babantu bonke beli loMzantsi Afrika. Ukuzalisekisa esi sithembiso,
urhulumente weMpuma Koloni uvuselela umzila kaloliwe odibanisa iMonti
noMthatha. Ukuvuselela lo mzila kudle urhulumente isixa semali esimalunga
ne-117 lezigidi zeerandi.

Uvuselelo lwalo mzila kulindeleke ukuba luqinise amathuba ezoqoqosho
kwingingqi yomPhesheya kweNciba. Amatikiti aya kuthengiswa kwezi zikhululo
zikaloliwe zilandelayo: eMonti, eAMabhele, eQumrha, eGcuwa kunye
naseMthatha. La matikiti aya kuxabisa ama-R30 ukusuka eMonti ukuya
eMthatha.

Ukhuseleko lwabahambi-ngololiwe luya kuqinisekiswa ngamapolisa kaloliwe. Lo
loliwe uya kuqala ukusebenza ngomhla wokuqala kweyoKwindla okanye uMatshi
apha kowama-2008.

Thina singamalungu e-ANC, siya kuthi gqolo sisebenzisana nabantu ekwakheni
ubomi obungcono obuya kungcanyulwa nguye wonke ubani singajonge bala
lamntu. Ndiyabulela. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa member’s
statement follows.)

[Ms B N DAMBUZA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC-led government, in
partnership with the people of South Africa, is striving to achieve a
better life for all. In this regard, the government of the Eastern Cape has
revived the railway line between East London and Mthatha at a cost of R117
million.

The revival of this railway line is expected to lay a firm foundation for
future economic expansion in the impoverished eastern half of the province.
Train tickets will be available for sale at East London, Amabele, Komga,
Butterworth and Mthatha stations. A one-way trip from East London to
Mthatha will cost R30,00.

South Africa’s railway police will be responsible for the safety of train
commuters. The service is expected to be operational by 1 March 2008.

As members of the ANC we will always work with the people towards creating
a better future for all. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                        PRICE-FIXING AT ADCOCK INGRAM

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr H J BEKKER (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP is extremely concerned that
Tiger Brands’ Health Care Unit Adcock Ingram and several smaller health
care groups faced the threat of huge fines for colluding to fix tenders and
prices. This incident is highlighted at a time when the public is being hit
by the rising cost of food, electricity, petrol and health care. It also
comes shortly after Tiger Brands were fined R98,8 million following the
bread price-fixing scandal.

We also note that the fine paid by Tiger Brands at that time did not
benefit any of the victims of poverty. The IFP would therefore like to call
on the National Treasury to amend the regulations on the deposit of
Competition Commission fines into the Revenue Fund, and to rather provide
for the victims of anti-competitive behaviour to benefit in a direct
manner.

We believe that government should not be the main beneficiary of this
scandalous behaviour of consumer groups but that the poorest of the poor
and especially HIV sufferers should benefit if Adcock Ingram and others are
to be fined because of this latest scandal. I thank you.

                           MAKING OUR SCHOOLS WORK

member’s statement follows.)

[Mr J B SIBANYONI: This is a statement about the campaign to make schools
work effectively.

We would like to express our appreciation for the role played by the
following stakeholders from Metsweding district: The Department of
Education in Gauteng and the Gauteng Department of Education, Northern
District; the Community Parliamentary Constituency Office based in
Kungwini, Bronkhorstspruit; the Community Parliamentary Constituency based
in Nokeng Tsa Taemane and the Metsweding District Municipality.

During December 2007, and from January to February 2008, the Kungwini and
Nokeng Tsa Taemane Municipality, together with the Gauteng Youth
Commission, conducted a campaign to encourage learners to go back to
school. This was done by providing cleaning workshops to ensure that
learners and teachers go back to school on the opening day of schools, in
order to ensure that learning and teaching start on the first day of the
opening of schools.

This campaign was completed with a celebration ceremony held at Cullinan
Combined School, where schools and learners who performed very well last
year, were issued with certificates, awards and printers.

We would like to thank all the companies for their sponsorships, and would
also like to thank teachers for helping schools and learners to win so that
they become leaders.

This campaign is held at the beginning of each year. We encourage Grade 12
learners of 2008 to work even harder so that they will rise above those of
the previous years, and so that there will be more schools and more
learners who will be heroes. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                REASONS FOR SOUTH AFRICA’S ELECTRICITY CRISIS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr S M VAN DYK (DA): Speaker, gegewe die landswye elektrisiteitskrisis
waarin Suid-Afrika verkeer, is dit onaanvaarbaar dat die regering slegs om
verskoning vra daarvoor, maar steeds weier om die ware redes wat tot die
fiasko bygedra het te erken.

Die argument dat Suid-Afrika die slagoffer is van sy eie  ekonomiese  groei,
is  ’n  skande.  Die  gevolge  van  die  ANC-regering  se  agtelosigheid  in
behoorlike ekonomiese beplanning,  ondeurdagte  owerheidsbesteding,  en  die
ANC se ekonomiese magsbeheptheid, wat privaatbelegging blokkeer,  kos  Suid-
Afrika nou R2 miljard in verlore produksie per dag en ’n afname in  die  BBP
van 2,2% per jaar. Tog weier die regering dat die ware redes,  naamlik  swak
bestuur, ’n tekort aan kundigheid, Eskom  se  monopolie-posisie,  gebrekkige
instandhouding, en onaantreklike beleggingsmoontlikhede van  die  vernaamste
redes vir die krisis was.
Nou sit Suid-Afrika met ’n vooruitsig  van  groter  werkloosheid,  emigrasie
van kundiges, en groter onsekerhede  by  buitelandse  sakelui  om  in  Suid-
Afrika te belê. Die regering behoort nou ’n eed af  te  lê  aan  alle  Suid-
Afrikaners en te verklaar dat  hy  sy  transformasiebeleid  sal  hersien  om
kundigheid en kapasiteit te herwin; verder dat  die  ANC  ook  sy  politieke
beleid van inmenging  in  die  ekonomie  sal  wysig  sodat  markkragte,  die
privaatsektor en buitelandse beleggers die land se ekonomie sal laat groei.

Die regering behoort ’n belofte af te lê aan Suid-Afrika dat hulle die  land
van nou af so sal regeer dat  Suid-Afrika  se  belange  bo  ANC-partybelange
gestel word en dat ’n toekoms vir  alle  Suid-Afrikaners  geskep  word  waar
almal veilig en ekonomies welvarend sal kan leef.  Dankie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Dr S M VAN DYK (DA): Speaker, given the nationwide  electricity  crisis  in
which South Africa  finds itself, it is  unacceptable  that  the  government
has only apologised for the crisis, but is  still  refusing  to  acknowledge
the real reasons which have contributed to this fiasco.

The argument that South Africa is a victim of its  own  economic  growth  is
disgraceful. The consequences of the ANC-led government’s carelessness  with
proper  economic  planning,  ill-considered  government  spending  and   its
obsession with economic power that blocks private investments, has now  cost
South Africa R2 billion in lost production per day and  has  resulted  in  a
decline in the GDP of 2,2 % per year. Yet the government  still  refuses  to
admit that some of the most important reasons  for  this  crisis,  are  poor
management,  a   shortage   of   expertise,   Eskom’s   monopoly   position,
insufficient maintenance, and unattractive investment possibilities.

South Africa now faces the prospect of greater unemployment,  emigration  of
experts, and greater uncertainty on the part of foreign businessmen when  it
comes to investing in South Africa. The government should now  lay  down  an
oath  and  declare  to  all  South  Africans  that  it   will   review   its
transformation policy in  order  to  reclaim  expertise  and  capacity;  and
furthermore that the ANC will adjust its political  policy  of  interference
in the economy so  that  market  forces,  the  private  sector  and  foreign
investors will allow the country’s economy to grow.

The government should make a promise to South Africa that from now on it
will govern South Africa in such a manner that South Africa’s interests are
placed above ANC party interests and a future is created in which all South
Africans will be able to live safely and prosperously. Thank you.]

                       MANAGEMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J D ARENDSE (ANC): Chairperson, marine resources must be managed and
controlled for the benefit of all South Africans, especially those
communities whose livelihood depends on resources from the sea. The fishing
stock must be managed in a way that promotes a sustainable yield and the
development of new species.

The ANC will always assist people in having access to these resources.
Barely three weeks after the diving ban regulations on abalone were
gazetted authorities have arrested 17 suspected poachers during a night-
long operation in Hout Bay and Robben Island.

There are four areas where a total ban has been placed on driving as part
of the measures for the protection of wild abalone and to promote the
recovery and rebuilding of the resource. The arrests follow collaborated
enforcement between officials from the Department of Environmental Affairs
and Tourism and the SAPS.

Amongst the equipment seized during the arrests were the following: a super-
duck fishing vessel, 77 pieces of abalone and abalone shucking equipment.
The ANC-led government is continuously providing skills to law enforcement
agencies to more than match the criminals and their syndicates. I thank
you.

            BETTER CAPACITY-BUILDING TO ENHANCE SERVICE DELIVERY

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr C D KEKANA (ANC): Chairperson, the primary task of the ANC remains the
mobilisation of all classes and strata that objectively stand to benefit
from social change. The dictum that the people are their own liberators
remains as relevant today as it was during the days of the anti-apartheid
struggle.

The Northern Cape provincial government led by the ANC has committed R90
million towards ensuring community participation in the government
development programmes. The plans to be funded include the following:
community and social development workers; safety volunteers; school
governing bodies; ward committees; and community safety forums.

The ANC believes that all spheres of government should invest in
strengthening capacity in pursuance of enhanced service delivery. The goal
of the ANC is to create a South Africa in which all experience an improved
quality of life, and enjoy human rights with access to opportunities that
freedom has brought about, bound together by our humanity. I thank you.
             ENFORCEMENT OF NEW PLEDGE AT SOUTH AFRICAN SCHOOLS

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, allow me to begin, unusually, by
thanking the DA for this statement on the pledge, and we certainly look
forward to their suggestions as to the wording, because we have published a
Gazette and welcome comments on the proposed pledge.

Now, as far as I recall, not a single line of the pledge makes reference to
the ANC, and I don’t know where the hon Mulder got that reference from.
But, of course, we would expect him to object to anything that seeks to
build a nation and seeks to inculcate positive values in the children of
our country.

If one looks at the values that are elaborated in the current draft - and
it is a draft - it refers to very positive values that we would want our
children to internalise and reflect both in their conduct as well as in
their attention to our society. However, as I have said, we look forward
with great interest to the submissions in response to the gazetting.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Thank you, Minister.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Sorry, I wonder, Chairperson, if you could
briefly allow me to say that, in the bill of responsibilities, hon Van der
Walt, the word ``Bill’’ is used in order to link the document with the Bill
of Rights. It is not a formal Bill which would come before the House but it
would be available for debate in society, schools, colleges, universities
and the broader public domain.

So, it is not a formal instrument. It does what all of us have been talking
about, which is that, as we have tabled rights before the nation, let us
also get the nation to understand that rights come with responsibilities.
So we have sought to elaborate what some of the responsibilities that are
attached to the rights in our Bill of Rights are, and we hope that the
South African public will welcome such an elaboration, which many of us
have called for in the past. [Applause.]

                REASONS FOR SOUTH AFRICA’S ELECTRICITY CRISIS

                           (Minister’s Statement)

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: I regret I can’t thank the DA for
their statement on energy. [Laughter.] In fact, I find it somewhat sad that
although we had a three-hour briefing this morning where we dealt in detail
with a whole range of matters around the energy issue, the hon Van Dyk, 14
years into democracy, is essentially arguing that every problem that has
occurred with energy is as a result of affirmative action.

I think that is a very sad statement for a party that should try and
represent all the people of this country and not just your people.
[Interjections.] That is the problem, because you are essentially implying
that race is at the heart of this. I haven’t heard a single statement from
that side of the House that’s committed that party to doing something about
energy, and the hon Van Wyk, in particular, I think would really like to
see a disaster in this country, because you do nothing to support
investment in this country; you do nothing other than attack the policies
of this government, and frankly, I think that you’re an anachronism and
your position, in my view, is blatantly racist. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon Ellis, are you rising on a
point of order?

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I ask you, sir, to rule along the lines of what
the hon Minister has said. He has said that the party is racist and I
believe that that is unparliamentary. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I distinctly
heard Minister Erwin saying that ``your position is racist’’, but if you
want to consult Hansard and rule on the matter ... [Interjections.]
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order, order! The comment made by
the hon Minister is not unparliamentary. We will now proceed with the
response from Minister of Housing. [Interjections.]

I am going to ask the hon members to observe the Rules. If you don’t know
what the Rules are, then I will have to remind you from the Chair. When an
hon member has the floor, we ought to give that hon member an opportunity
to be heard. Now, if you contravene the Rules, I have to take action from
the Chair. I asked for order and didn’t get a positive response.

I am now going to allow the Minister of Housing to go ahead. I don’t know
what you are heckling for, because the Minister hasn’t even spoken yet!
Please proceed, hon Minister.

                    ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF HOUSES IN DELFT

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I am very glad I
come in at this point when we are talking about the issue of race. I would
like to commend the hon Zoe Kota for her very incisive statement on the
situation in Delft. I think it is an absolute disgrace that the DA should
sink so low in its desperate bid to rally support. It has deliberately
sought to sow racial tension and divisions in the Western Cape.
I must commend the people who have been moved from Langa and are presently
living in temporary shelter. I commend them for their restraint and
understanding in the face of this violation. I would also like to thank the
other backyard dwellers in Delft who did not respond to the irresponsible
calls of the DA councillor. The matter will now be rectified, and the
intended beneficiaries should move in very soon.

I welcome the hon Kota’s call for the DA Mayor of the City to deal with her
delinquent councillor. I would also like know from the DA members here what
their responsibility is in the face of this racial problem that is being
sown. If, in fact, the opposition and in particular, this particular
opposition, does not subscribe to the definition of being called racist, I
would like them to show that they actually will not stand by a councillor
who is blatantly racist. [Applause.]

                           TRANSFORMATION IN SPORT

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Chairperson, Mr Peter de Villiers is
a young South African citizen from the small town of Paarl. He is an
excellent rugby coach by his own records. As a matter of fact, in the
records of South African rugby, the Springboks have never had a better
qualified rugby coach in the whole history of the Springboks from 1906 to
date. So, for everybody ... [Interjections.] Of course, this is a fact.

Chairperson, Peter de Villiers started his coaching at school. He brought
back the World Cup for the under-19s, the under-21s, and the A side.
[Applause.] Nobody else has ever done it before him. We don’t know if there
will be anyone who will do it after him.

The fact that he is black has nothing to do with the fact that he is a
Springbok coach today. It has to do with the excellence that this young man
displays in the art of coaching rugby.

For the politicians who are in rugby tracksuits... [Interjections.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: On a point of order, Chairperson. I rise on a point of
order. Is the hon Minister prepared to take a question?

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Yes, I am.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, I want to ask the hon Minister this: If Mr
Peter de Villiers is the best qualified coach since 1906, why was he not
appointed and why was Jake White appointed?

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: You should know better – because of
political interference, which is always ascribed to us, when in fact it
comes from yourselves. My father was never a Minister in the apartheid
government. [Interjections.] It is a point; it is the root of the answer to
your question. I’m tracing that answer to its roots - the root of parallel
development; the root of multinationalism in sport. That is the root of the
answer to your question. [Interjections.]

We have now eradicated that root and Peter de Villiers, purely on the basis
of his ability and his curriculum vitae and credentials, has been
identified as such. As for those skeletons in rugby tracksuits masquerading
as sportspersons, when in fact they are ultraconservative politicians, we
say they must go back to the ideological Jurassic park where they belong.
We move forward. [Applause.]

  THE PRICE OF BREAD, THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE PRICE OF BREAD ON SOCIETY
                    AND THE NEED FOR URGENT INTERVENTION

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chair, hon Ministers, colleagues, food inflation in South
Africa is clearly out of control, especially the price of bread. For the
ACDP, this is a cause for extreme concern as it affects poor and vulnerable
people without exception. Behind the emotional reaction to soaring bread
prices - we are told - two indisputable facts stand out: Firstly, that the
dramatic surge in the price of wheat in the past 18 months is here to stay,
and secondly that higher prices are likely to hit South Africa’s
independent bakers, who are the producers of 45% of the country’s bread,
far harder than they will hit big companies.
Over the past twelve months the price of wheat has risen from R1 700 to
R4 000 a ton; global wheat stockpiles are at a 30-year low as climate
change has taken its toll; and wheat consumption has outstripped global
supply for the last four years. South Africa produced 1,77 million tons of
wheat last year but consumed 2,8 million tons. At the same time a growing
demand for biofuels has enticed farmers to shift from wheat to maize
production, and the price of fuel is continuing to escalate, adding to a
long list of factors contributing to bread price increases.

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, on a point of order: We cannot hear the speaker
at this stage. Could we have some silence, if possible? [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! Order!

Mrs C DUDLEY: Global markets and the rand value are, of course, also
culprits and often used to explain price increases. We are, however, yet to
see a decrease in the price of staple foods when the rand actually
strengthens. I’m not used to the silence. [Interjections.] Come to think of
it – why would white bread increase by 2,8% and brown bread by 5,4% when
production processes and inputs are the same for both? Interesting!

The National Agri-Marketing Association still has to evaluate costs and
margins in the industry, but what we do know right now is that bakeries and
dairies have been colluding, and collusion leads to higher prices. The
speedy and thorough action being taken and significant consequences in the
form of hefty fines are commendable.

In future, the ACDP hopes collusion will be viewed as bad for business.
Even so, the ACDP calls on government to tell us into whose coffers the
R100 million admission-of-guilt fine has gone? Who will benefit from this
and other fines? How will this money be utilised to relieve the burden of
bread price increases on society?

The outrage sparked by the price-fixing scandal and the recent price
increases has elicited several calls for government to intervene, with
labour unions and others arguing that the rising cost of staple foods could
force millions of people deeper into poverty. The argument against
government intervention is that it distorts the market allocation of goods
and services. When prices are kept artificially low, suppliers allocate
fewer resources to the production of goods, leading to shortages.

It is argued that if producers were making superprofits in bread
production, consumers could simply vote with their feet and force the bread
companies to lower their prices to win back customers. The problem with
this argument is that when it comes to a staple food like bread, consumers
have no choice but to pay higher prices – whatever they are. Consumer
demand is therefore price insensitive and bread producers could increase
prices without suffering the reduction in demand that would usually go with
price hikes.

One very interesting piece of the puzzle, however, is highlighted in
research by South Africa’s milling industry, which shows that government,
through VAT, is in fact the biggest beneficiary of the recent bread price
hikes. It is estimated that government will earn about R1,29 billion in VAT
on white bread alone this year. Brown bread, of course, is VAT exempt.

The fiscal benefit for government does not stop there, as VAT is earned on
products right along the value chain – from the farmer to the miller and
baker, not forgetting the 2% import duty per ton of wheat. Is it perhaps
time for white bread also to be VAT exempt, and what about the import duty
on wheat? Certainly, these are options which government must seriously look
at. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnu S J NJIKELANA: Sihlalo obekekileyo, Baphathiswa abahloniphekileyo,
Malungu ePalamente kunye nabo bonke abemi beloMzantsi Afrika. Kukho umntu
owakhe wathi abantu befuna isonka waphendula wathi “banike ikeyiki”.
Ndithemba ndiqinisekisile ke noko ukuba kwezi nzingo sijongene nazo kwezi
ntsuku, urhulumente wethu unxaxhile kwimpendulo elolo hlobo. (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Mr S J NJIKELANA: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, Members of Parliament as
well as all fellow South Africans, there was once a person who, when people
were asking for bread responded by saying “give them cake”. I trust that
with all the challenges that face us our government would not respond in
such a negative manner.]

The recent incidents of increases in the bread price are definitely a cause
for alarm. At the same time we need not exaggerate alarm on this matter. We
have a government that is always responsive to issues that affect the poor.
It is obviously on this basis that this Parliament is addressing the matter
of increases in the bread price.

We need to delve quite deeply into the causes. Certain quarters claim that
the astronomical price rises in respect of wheat and fuel and other factors
are the cause of the recent price increases. However, in the words of
Cosatu in KwaZulu-Natal, and I quote:

   This situation threatens the livelihood of many workers and their
   families. Living standards are becoming unbearable for the unemployed
   people in our communities.

When inaccessibility of staple foods becomes an issue, as is the case in
our country, this obviously constitutes a challenge to, amongst other
things, food self-sufficiency, which is central to food security, as it has
become an issue due to the liberalisation of agriculture-based economies.
The Board on Tariffs and Trade investigated prices in the food chain in
1992 and observed two divergences, namely that food price inflation was
higher than overall inflation between 1981 and 1991, and that retail food
price inflation was higher than farm-gate inflation over the same period.
In response to this situation, the Department of Agriculture and Land
Affairs is currently busy increasing local wheat production, strengthening
co-operatives along the bread production value chain, as well as
encouraging local bakeries in peri-urban and rural areas.

The recent incident of bread price-fixing has brought to our attention
lessons such as the callousness of those driven by greed and avarice, who
have been exposed as siphoning even the last penny from the poor.
Deficiencies in the current price regulatory systems need serious
attention. In any case, the growing effectiveness of regulatory
institutions, such as the Competition Commission, has come to the fore.
Recently, the commission has uncovered a number of fraudulent pricing
practices and ensured that culprits were brought to book. This has also
enhanced public awareness of the institution’s activities, although more
still has to be done.

There are challenges with regard to economic morality. Raising the price of
bread despite recent penalties is one cause for concern. As if that was not
enough, collusion on pharmaceutical products has just been exposed as well.
An interesting feature is the deafening silence on the morality of making a
living out of the plight of the poor. In fact, the question is: At what
stage can we say price collusion and/or fixing is devoid of fraud and
criminality in its character, since this is an activity that results in the
misery of those whose daily struggle is to fill their stomachs?

The role of directors, shareholders and consumers has never been so
challenged. The rampant excuse of saying “we did not know” is brought under
the spotlight by these circumstances. Let me say that active shareholding
can no longer be mere lip service. Shareholders must ensure that their
managers account for their activities. The need to focus on consumption as
part of the economic cycle in South Africa has never been so strong.

I am definitely making a strong call to consumer groups to intensify their
awareness campaigns and, amongst other things, to ensure that citizens, as
consumers, are able to influence the pricing of commodities to ensure
accessibility thereto. Public accountability of private companies is almost
nonexistent. These should be a special focus on businesses that produce
bread, whether it be producing wheat, baking or distributing. They should
ensure that they are as transparent as is necessary.

The current focus on economic transformation is supposed to be enablement
more than regulation. However, unfortunately, recent events display a
demand for the latter. The unfortunate part is that resources that are
supposed to be allocated to enabling economic development have to be
redirected to punitive measures due to malpractices in the prices of
commodities, including bread.

The culture of exploitation of the poor through, inter alia, price
collusion by large cartels has triggered a lot of responses, as reported in
the newspapers. Our government should therefore intervene in this matter
and ensure food security for the poor and the economically marginalised,
who are the most vulnerable targets of this practice, which is best
described by the CEO of Tiger Brands, Mr Nick Dennis, when he says, and I
quote:


   The anticompetitive activity that took place was completely unacceptable
   and contrary to our ethical standards.

Indeed, the practice is not only anticompetitive but also unethical.
Unfortunately, the practice continues in other companies.

Any intervention undoubtedly has to include the following considerations:
Enhancement of the social wage by government such that the poor are able to
absorb any dramatic price increases, especially on staple food, which must
be given urgent attention; the development of a vibrant and dynamic
consumer movement in keeping with our historical goal of deepening
democracy – as consumers, South Africans need to resocialise themselves and
consumer activists have to mobilise intensively for the highest possible
consumer consciousness; a strong focus on small, medium and micro
enterprises, in particular co-operatives, could provide some viable
solutions; and further enablement and/or empowerment of the Competition
Commission and  sister regulatory bodies.

Whilst short-term interventions are more than essential, it is only long-
term strategies that will address this quagmire on a sustainable basis.
Some of these long-term strategies are: The refinement of relevant
legislation; compliance with company policies to be made a public issue;
enhancement of global alliances against price collusion at global level;
the need to intensify moral regeneration beyond the current focus into
economic morality; the possibility of the reintroduction of the regulation
of food prices, especially on staple foods, has to be debated; and
addressing the broad socioeconomic issues that shape the overall
environment for the determination of food prices.

Our government needs to heed the call of the resolutions that were taken at
the ANC’s 52nd National Conference, which spoke of “transforming the
structures of production and ownership, including through antimonopoly and
anticoncentration policy, aimed at creating competitive markets, broadening
ownership and participation by our people, addressing monopoly pricing and
other forms of rent-seeking and anticompetitive behaviour.”

Food price-fixing should be seen as an effect whose cause is the further
growth of monopoly capital and its accrual of profit at all costs results
in exploiting and further impoverishing the poor and economically
marginalised. Chairperson, I see my time is up. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Chairperson, the recent escalation in food prices and in
particular the recent hike in the price of bread has enraged consumers with
reference to particular segments of the food industry.

The milling industry was criticised when it was announced that the four big
bread producers, namely Tiger Brands, Pioneer Foods, Foodcorp and Premier
Foods, are being investigated by the Competition Commission for collusion
in setting bread prices. Tiger Brands has already paid a R100 million
admission of guilt fine, while Foodcorp and Pioneer are set to be charged
by the Competition Commission.

Chairperson, price fixing of staple foods like bread is totally
unacceptable. In light of the fact that millions of needy South African
consumers are battling at the present moment to make ends meet, bread is a
key component of the daily diet of needy consumers.

I am perfectly aware that any tax system must be as simple and
straightforward as possible, but recent research conducted by South
Africa’s milling industry shows that since the escalation of the price of
bread the government’s VAT income has increased to 76c on the cost of a
single loaf of white bread which sells for R6,20. This is of grave concern.

I am aware that brown bread is VAT exempt but it must be mentioned that the
government earns VAT on products along the value chain, from the farmer to
the miller and baker.

The DA welcomes the government’s initiative in asking the National
Agricultural Marketing Council to investigate and evaluate costs and
margins in the baking industry. My request, however, is that government
investigates and evaluates the cost possibility of reducing the VAT to zero-
rating on white bread.

South African bakeries produced roughly 1,7 million loaves of white bread
and 1,1 billion loaves of brown bread in 2007. What is of concern however
is that the CEO of the Chamber of Milling, Mr Jannie de Villiers, says that
Albany Bakery, a subsidiary of Tiger Brands and the South African market
leader, has been losing 40 cents per loaf of bread since August 2007. I am
saying this because if an industry is not able to break even, retrenchments
and jobs losses are inevitable.

The bread industry was heavily regulated in the past. It is an undeniable
fact that price-fixing and the manipulation of trading conditions lead to
higher prices. The bread industry has been deregulated, and as has been
stated before any anticompetitive business practice in this sector affects
needy consumers negatively.

The DA is aware that the price of bread is of vital importance to the
wellbeing of millions of needy consumers. We appeal to all the respective
role-players, farmers, bakers, millers, transport, the retail sector and
government, to refrain from unfair trade practices.

Die bekamping van armoede is van groot belang vir ’n groeiende,
vooruitstrewende Suid-Afrika. Voldoende, bekostigbare voedsel - in dié
geval die prys van brood – moet gesien word in die maatskaplike
omstandighede wat in Suid-Afrika heers. Indien instellings egter broodpryse
vir korttermyn finansiële gewin manipuleer, word streng optrede teen
sodanige instellings verwelkom.

Armoede as normatiewe verskynsel word teen die sogenaamde broodlyn gemeet.
Dit is die regering van die dag se plig om toe te sien dat, soos
persoonlike veiligheid, brood en ander graangewasse, soos byvoorbeeld
mieliemeel, ook bekostigbaar vir die verbruiker is. Indien dit nie gebeur
nie, toon die geskiedenis dat sosiale onrus onafwendbaar is. Ek dank u.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Combating poverty is of great importance to a growing, prosperous South
Africa. Sufficient, affordable food – in this instance the price of bread –
should be seen in the light of the social circumstances that prevail in
South Africa. If, however, institutions manipulate bread prices for short-
term financial gain, strict steps against such institutions would be
welcomed.

Poverty, as a normative phenomenon, is measured against the so-called
breadline. It is the government of the day’s duty to make sure that, like
personal safety, bread and other cereals, for example maize meal, are also
affordable for the consumer. If this does not happen, history has shown us
that social unrest will be unavoidable. I thank you.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Baie dankie, mnr die Voorsitter. [Thank you, Chairperson.]

Chairperson, one characteristic of our fledging democracy is the great
disparity that still exists between the various communities of our society.
While many people are thriving and have improved their lives greatly, there
are still too many South Africans who struggle daily with the devastating
effects that hunger and poverty have on their lives. It is these people, in
particular, who are the worst affected by the unscrupulous actions of those
companies involved in this pricing scandal.

We in the IFP strongly condemn the unethical behaviour displayed by the
companies in this price-fixing scandal. In their attempts to further
increase their profit margins they have inflicted much suffering and pain
on people who are amongst the most vulnerable in our land. Strong action
should be taken against the companies and individuals responsible for this
unethical behaviour. They must be held accountable for their actions and
should apologise to the public.

We therefore welcome the resignation of the chief executive officer of
Tiger Brands as being honourbound when he figuratively fell on to his own
sword. The IFP also welcomes the massive fine issued to Tiger Brands in the
amount of R98,8 million following this bread price-fixing scandal.

It is interesting though that the shareholding, and the Stock Exchange,
because of this incident and, of course, there is also the natural loading
of the share prices on the Stock Exchange, has lost R350 million. This is
also an indication that the public and even the investors are taking this
particular matter very seriously.

However, we note that this fine paid by Tiger Brands did not benefit any of
the victims. Therefore, the IFP calls on National Treasury to amend their
regulations on the deposit of Competition Commission fines into the Revenue
Fund and rather to provide for the victims of anticompetitive behaviour to
benefit in a direct manner.

We believe that the government should not be the main beneficiary of this
scandalous behaviour of consumer groups but that the poorest of the poor
should rather be the beneficiary in the future.

For the future, one must realise that the price of wheat has, for the first
time, smashed the R4 000 per ton barrier, thereby doubling in price within
one year. This is a bad omen for the future of the bread price. We will
have to dig deep and become original in our thinking, particularly in view
of global demands and the weakening of the South African rand.

The IFP, in its philosophy of self-sufficiency and self-help, would
encourage consumers to bake their own bread but then there must be
sufficient and economical bread flour on the shelves. Should the South
African milling industry not be coming to the table, then import duties and
levies should be zeroed.

Government and particularly the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs
must also look into the situation of the farmers. There is virtually no
support for our farming industry. The production of the farmers is going
down and we must ask ourselves: Why?

Is it not time that we should look at our farmers and assist them with
this? Because we must also bear in mind, in terms of corporate governance
and the King Report, that we must not look at the bottom line of profit
only. There must be a triple bottom line which embraces the economic,
environmental and social aspects of a company’s activities.

Corporate governance and social responsibility are issues that should be
ingrained into every organisation’s culture at every level, from the top to
the bottom of that organisation. I thank you.

Mr J BICI: Chair, hon members, the UDM has noted with dismay the exposure
of the price-fixing racket that has been a feature of the bread industry
for several years. The one inescapable fact is that bread is a major staple
food in this country. Therefore, the poor must not be excluded from
accessing this food. Yet, the escalating price is effectively putting this
staple food beyond the reach of many people.

The steep fine that has been imposed for the price fixing does not
translate into any relief for the poor. Since the imposition of the fine,
the price of bread has risen again and it is still to increase by a further
40c.

Various factors have an impact on the price of bread. For example, maize
prices play a major role and a combination of supply shortages as well as
the use of export parity pricing by domestic maize producers places
continuous upward pressure on the price of maize and therefore of bread.

These factors all collide at a time when the economy is slowing down, and
the hardships of the poor are on the increase. The onus is on the
government to find creative ways of encouraging lower bread prices. For
example, the government can intervene by way of subsidies. The other option
is to regulate that a percentage of the penalties realised on price fixing
should be used on a bread subsidy. I thank you.

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you, Chairperson. The
Ministry for Agriculture and Land Affairs is gravely concerned about the
rise in the bread price, as this inevitably affects the poor and vulnerable
groups most, for whom bread is a staple food.

Although various explanations have been given by various role-players from
the milling and baking industries and other organisations, the perception
still exists that increases in bread prices constitute misuse of market
power. In this regard, two aspects need to be explained: Firstly, the
extent to which international market forces contribute to an increase in
the price of bread; and secondly, the dynamics in the local wheat-to-bread
value chain and the role of wheat producers, processors or millers and
retailers in the pricing of bread.

International market forces in the wheat-to-bread value chain have had a
great impact on the price of wheat and bread in South Africa today. The
prices of food worldwide, including grain products such as bread, have been
decreasing for decades following the Green Revolution. Research shows that
there are indications that we have reached the end of that downward trend.

This reversal is the result of a rising demand for food, animal feed and
fuel, particularly from the great nations of the East. This is exacerbated
by climate change having a negative impact on crop yields leading to low
supplies of food commodities, especially grains. Grain is also increasingly
in demand in the production of biofuels and this is also putting additional
pressure on the supply and the price of food.

The current low stock of grain globally and the slow rate of growth in
outputs, have unfortunately resulted in a continuation of the upward trends
in food price right into the forcible future.

South Africa is a net importer of wheat, which makes it the main input in
the production of bread. We are therefore exposed to these international
forces owing to the fact that we have to import wheat at import parity
prices. We are discussing this matter with the Minister of Trade and
Industry.

In the past, South Africa produced a lot of wheat in the Western Cape
Province and it still does, even though it is not as much as in the past.
The Eastern Cape and the Free State used to produce wheat as well, but they
have ceased doing so and we need to ensure that we encourage production
again in these two provinces.

We should go back to ensuring that we increase wheat production, to ensure
food security as well as to stabilise the price of wheat and food in the
long run. It has been shown in the current Safex wheat prices that in the
past year the price of wheat has increased by almost 200%. Recent hikes in
the price of bread have been justified to a certain extent by using these
explanations.

Notwithstanding the international forces we have referred to above, in
addition, South Africa has been rocked by price-fixing scandals involving
the bread industry and the dairy industry. I want to support the hon
members who have condemned these practices; I also want to commend the
Competition Commission which has come out with very clear investigations
and sanctions against these companies. I would suggest that we introduce
firmer measures and sanctions to ensure that we discourage these practices.
We have expressed our grave concern, especially considering that the poor
are most affected by the rising food prices.

On 25 January 2008, I met with the collective key stakeholders in the
agriculture sector to look into the escalation of the bread price and to
find common working solutions to make bread affordable to all South
Africans. During that meeting the role-players resolved that a detailed
investigation into the wheat-to-bread value chain is necessary in order to
ascertain that we have ensured that there is no unreasonable profiteering
by certain firms at the expense of the poor and other role-players in the
value chain.

The Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Agriculture and
Land Affairs are also looking at the tariffs, especially the wheat tariffs,
to ensure that they do not have a negative impact on the price of bread.
The National Agricultural Marketing Council – NAMC - was subsequently
requested to establish a section 7 committee to investigate the entire
wheat-to-bread value chain.

Section 7 of the Marketing and Agricultural Products Act, Act 24 of 1996,
empowers the NAMC to establish section 7 committees to undertake
investigations; as they may be needed on matters concerning agricultural
marketing, especially those issues that affect the poor, and make
recommendations to the Ministry for Agriculture and Land Affairs.

The meeting was attended by farmers, millers, bakers, retailers and
consumers. At this meeting the grain producers committed themselves to
increasing wheat production in the country to strengthen co-operatives
along the bread production value chain. Also, as the department, we have
made a commitment to ensuring that we encourage the establishment of these
co-operatives for the production of bread.
We will also assist local bakeries, especially in our rural areas and peri-
urban areas to produce their own bread. The Ministry has made a commitment
to assist farmers in ensuring that they increase wheat production locally
and in ensuring that we set up co-operatives and small businesses.

We would also like to work with women‘s organisations and encourage them
wherever they are to bake their own bread. We believe that this would go a
long way towards ensuring food security and stabilising the price of bread.


I want to close off by saying that as the Department of Agriculture and
Land Affairs, together with other role-players in the wheat-to-bread value
chain, we are committed to ensuring that we work together and continue to
examine this issue. It’ll not only be the bread prices, but we are also
working with the dairy industry on dairy products prices, like milk prices,
that are also increasing.

We would like to call on all hon members and all stakeholders to come
together, to pool our resources and work on a strategy that will ensure
that we reduce the price of bread. We have joined forces with trade unions,
community organisations and churches to join their campaign to ensure that
we fight the escalating price of bread, milk and all foodstuffs in the
country. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr M H HOOSEN: Chairperson, the collusion and blatant exploitation of the
poor by the main bread producers in South Africa is not only an insult to
the nation, but a deliberate and premeditated attack on the poorest people
of our country.

The R99 million fine imposed on Tiger Brands last year was not enough to
deter cartels from colluding with each other at the expense of the most
vulnerable in our society. The need to strengthen the hand of the
Competition Commission to impose harsher and stricter penalties has now
become more evident than ever.

The existing Act of Parliament that mandates the Competition Commission
needs to be urgently amended. Currently the Act allows the commission only
to impose a fine, but it needs to be changed to make provision for criminal
prosecution as well.

We live in an equal society which the ID has shown must treat corrupt
politicians and businessmen the same. We would also like to propose that
government implements specific rural development programmes to increase the
local production of wheat. I thank you.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agbare Voorsitter, ek wil in hierdie debat begin om ’n
wanpersepsie uit die weg te ruim. Daardie wanpersepsie ontstaan wanneer die
publiek van Suid-Afrika op televisie sien dat die prys van koring R4 000 ’n
ton is en almal dink dit is die boere wat hierdie geweldige voordeel kry.
Dit is nie die boere nie. Die boere het Desembermaand reeds klaar hulle
koring geoes en hulle kry beslis nie R4 000 ’n ton soos wat gesê word nie.

Wat is die kern van die problem van die hoë broodprys? Die kern van die
problem is weer eens die skuld van die ANC-regering en spesifiek die
Minister vir Landbou en Grondsake. Hoekom sê ek dit? Die agb Minister het
dit netnou hier in ’n mate erken. Sy’t gesê die Oos-Kaap, die Wes-Kaap en
die Vrystaat produseer nie meer koring nie. Hoekom nie, agb Minister? Weet
u hoekom hulle nie meer koring produseer nie? Omdat dit nie meer
kostedoeltreffend is vir ’n boer om koring te produseer nie.

GraanSA het die ANC-regering en u voorganger Thoko Didiza in 2000 gewaarsku
en gesê ons moet ’n behoorlike landboubeleid kry sodat ons die voedsel in
Suid-Afrika kan beskerm, maar toe was dit mos nou goedkoop om koring van
die buiteland in te voer. En wat gebeur as ’n mens koring goedkoop kan
invoer? Dit is nie vir die boer kostedoeltreffend om dan met koring voort
te boer nie.

GraanSA het u gewaarsku, maar u het nie geluister nie, net soos in die
geval van Eskom, want u word lank voor die tyd gewaarsku, maar u dink net
aan korttermyn-beplanning en nie aan langtermyn-beplanning nie. Dit is
hoekom die boere in daardie provinsies nie meer produseer nie.

Nee, agb Minister, as u die probleem wil oplos, moet u ophou om ‘n
ideologies gedrewe beleid in die landbou uit te voer. U moet begin om
landbou te dien en sorg dat die boere ’n behoorlike beleid kry wat hulle
ook kan beskerm in onsekere tye, want die ANC staan deesdae net vir
“ANother Crisis”. U moet die krisisse begin oplos. Dankie. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, in this debate I want to commence by
getting rid of a misconception. That misconception arises when the South
African public sees on television that the price of wheat is R4 000 per ton
and everyone thinks that it is the farmers who gain this tremendous
benefit. It is not the farmers. The farmers had already finished harvesting
their wheat in December and they most certainly do not get R4 000 per ton
as is suggested.

What is the crux of the problem of the high bread price? The crux of the
problem is once again the fault of the ANC-led government and particularly
the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs. Why do I say this? The hon
Minister admitted it to a certain extent just now. She said that the
Eastern Cape, the Western Cape and the Free State no longer produce wheat.
Why not, hon Minister? Do you know why they no longer produce wheat?
Because it is no longer cost-effective for a farmer to produce wheat.

GrainSA warned the ANC-led government and your predecessor Thoko Didiza in
2000 and it said that we need a proper agricultural policy in order to
protect food in South Africa, but then it was cheap to import wheat from
overseas. And what happens when one can import wheat cheaply? Then it is no
longer cost-effective for a farmer to continue farming with wheat.

GrainSA warned you, but you did not listen, just as in Eskom’s case,
because you are warned for in advance, but you only think of short-term
planning and not long-term planning. This is why the farmers in those
provinces no longer produce wheat.

No, hon Minister, if you want to solve the problem, you have to stop
implementing an ideologically driven policy in agriculture. You must begin
to serve agriculture and ensure that the farmers get a proper policy which
can also protect them in uncertain times, because these days ANC is only
short for “ANother Crisis”. You should start solving these crises. Thank
you.]

Mr D M DLALI: Chairperson, “the people shall share in the country’s
wealth”. How we can express this clause of the Freedom Charter in the
context of a democratic developmental state is another question. In this
context the ANC conference said:


   Our most effective weapon in the campaign against poverty is the creation
   of decent work. Moreover, the challenges of poverty and inequality
   require that accelerated growth takes place in the context of an
   effective strategy of redistribution.
The President of the Republic of South Africa said in his state of the
nation address that we require a national war room for a war against
poverty, bringing together all the departments concerned, different spheres
of government and civic organisations to deal with this war collectively as
a matter of urgency.

Having said the above, the critical issue that we need to address and deal
with is the question of food security. Poor South Africans need food at all
times. There is no doubt about the fact that the price of bread has a
negative impact on society and in particular the poorest of the poor.

The big businesses that monopolise and take advantage of the ANC-led
government’s approach of being a caring government, and want this
government also to take care of them, are making a big mistake. These
monopolies are making a big mistake – monopolies such as Tiger Brands,
Pioneer Foods, the producer of Albany bread, and Premier Foods raised the
price of a loaf of bread by between 30c and 35c in the week before
Christmas. Their timing was also wrong and taking advantage of the
Christmas holidays.

I’m also informed that this situation threatens the livelihood of many
workers and families. The living standard has become unbearable for the
poor, underpaid and unemployed people in our communities.

The Times of Wednesday, 6 February 2008, first edition, stated on page 18,
“Consumers must rise against the outrageous prices”. It went on to say:


   The news is not good. As everyone who has done regular grocery shopping
   will tell you, food inflation in South Africa is out of control. The
   deregulation of agricultural markets that began in the dying days of the
   protectionist apartheid government has led to greater efficiency in the
   market.

One may agree with some of the issues raised here, but may not agree
entirely with others, the reason being that the markets always want a hands-
off approach in order for them to do what they want. As a democratic
developmental state we’ll have to intervene in the markets, not be dictated
to and driven by the markets.
The same article went on to say:


   The Competition Commission has rightly begun investigating the pricing of
   basic foodstuffs such as bread and milk, and has already fined Tiger
   Brands for price-fixing. But this is not enough. Consumers need to stand
   up and make their voice heard over the extortion they encounter while
   buying staple foods.


Again, there are certain issues that are correct in this article, while one
may not agree with other issues raised here. But the message is loud and
clear that we need to advance the agrarian revolution we spoke of at the
ANC conference. This also underlines the necessity for effective rural
development programmes, ensuring that investment in infrastructure,
services and training reaches those areas of the country that have been
most adversely affected. We need to advance the agrarian revolution for a
war against poverty.

I’m also informed that accelerating growth and transforming the economy
require a democratic developmental state that is able to lead in the
definitions of a national economic agenda and mobilise society and direct
resources towards achieving this agenda. Unlike the said quote from the
Times of 6 February, while acting to promote growth, efficiency and
productivity, it must be equally effective in addressing the social
conditions of the masses of our people and realising economic progress for
the poor.

I’m further informed that the developmental state should maintain its
strategic role in shaping the key sectors of the economy. In my view this
debate today centres around the role of a democratic developmental state
and where it is supposed to allocate its priorities. Therefore the ANC
leads and the ANC lives.

Getting back to the agrarian revolution, the producers of wheat, the
farmers in South Africa, are not subsidised in the way that wheat producers
in the EU, US and Canada are. Agriculture is heavily subsidised in the EU,
US, Japan and many other countries. The input cost is not felt by those
farmers or producers at all, and the result of this is that Africa becomes
a dumping ground, while we also import wheat at a very high cost from these
countries that subsidise their producers.

At the general GrainSA meeting held recently in Elsenburg in the Western
Cape, Neels Ferreira, chairperson of GrainSA, claimed that South African
producers had the capacity to supply the local wheat demand and were eager
to do so. Unfortunately, wheat prices, combined with the high input costs,
did not justify such an expansion. What next then?

Due to reduced earnings, farmers downscaled wheat production, but now there
is an international wheat shortage. Prices have skyrocketed, making it more
expensive to import wheat.

Sakkie van Zyl, market researcher and economist at GrainSA, says the wheat
supply is at a historic low. Due to climatic conditions, international
production was hampered in three of the five major exporting countries,
namely Australia, the EU and Canada, so production expansion amounted to
only 602,5 million tons in 2007, compared to 591,5 million tons in 2006. At
the same time international consumption rose from 610 million tons to
620 million tons, decreasing supply levels by 110 million tons and
resulting in a supply-consumption ratio of only 18% compared to 20% in
2006.

Increased local production will not happen overnight. I’m told that many
farmers have lost faith in the wheat industry and have restructured their
enterprises around strong livestock components. Agricultural input costs
have also increased astronomically, in some cases by 70%.

Neels Ferreira, chairperson of GrainSA, said there is a misperception that
higher consumer prices are due to farmers making huge profits. This is not
true. Distribution costs have had a much greater impact on the wheat price
over the past year than producer prices. He further said:


   We are currently evaluating the whole supply chain to identify exactly
   where the money is going to. We need to ensure the whole industry
   functions in a free-market environment.

There is also the view that producers who want to produce very fine quality
wheat must be rewarded for it and those who would rather aim at mass
production must be rewarded for that. I’m not sure whether this approach is
correct. We need to debate this issue. We need to look carefully at these
suggestions and how and by whom they can be effected.

I’m also informed that government could intervene in the bread price by
removing the tax on white bread, which would reduce the price by 80c and
would also force down the price of bread. I’m not sure of this either.
We’ll just need to look at this carefully.

Given South Africa’s deregulated and open-market economy, global market
trends have important implications ... [Time expired.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Chairperson, when the regulation of agricultural marketing
was introduced in South Africa, the main objectives were as follows: To
achieve a more efficient use of this country’s agricultural resources; to
ensure investment and employment in agricultural marketing activities; to
conserve political and bureaucratic time and energy formerly spent on price
setting; to place less of a burden on government finances; and to lower
real food prices.

Chairperson, deregulation of the agricultural sector has assisted in
ensuring that prices started to become regionally differentiated to reflect
transport costs and regional variations in demand and supply. One of the
main objectives of agricultural deregulation has been to promote
competition and to reduce costs throughout the supply chain of various
agricultural products to the benefit of consumers as well as farmers.

The key question is: Has deregulation reduced food price inflation and as
such benefited the majority of the poor consumers for whom food constitutes
an important part of their total expenditure?
The government needs to strengthen co-operatives within the agricultural
sector to ensure that they become significant economic actors as this has
proved to be effective in other countries like Brazil, Canada and Uruguay.
Research by SA Milling Industry shows that government, through VAT ...
[Time expired.] Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr B E PULE: Chairperson, the levels of poverty in South Africa have risen.
The number of unemployed people has also risen. There are also a
considerable number of people seeking work, and this includes a greater
proportion of women from rural areas. The gap between the rich and the poor
is enormous. All these classes of people pay the same price for a loaf of
bread.

This increase indeed has a negative impact on the poorest of the poor. The
UCDP calls upon the Competition Commission to investigate whether big bread
producers have not connived to increase the price artificially. This has to
be done in the milling, storage and baking value chain.

South Africans are really reeling with the increase in the price of basic
foods and energy and interest rates. Regulators, watchdogs and audit bodies
have not decisively intervened by way of investigation. The claim by Tiger
Brands Ltd that the 40c increase in the price of a loaf of bread results
from the rise in the price of wheat and fuel is not acceptable. No amount
of good reasons will really convince the poorest of the poor.

The UCDP, however, appreciates the attempt by the hon Minister for
Agriculture and Land Affairs to have discussions with interested parties
and to also look into ways of increasing local wheat production and the
strengthening of co-operatives along the bread production value chain. I
thank you.

Mr R B BHOOLA: Chairperson, in terms of the price-fixing scandal on bread,
it appears that role-players have been severely fined and that the 90%
dominance in the milling industry that these parties have luxuriously
indulged in, has now come to an end.

It is understood that the deregulation of the wheat market has introduced a
lot of competition since 1997. It is indeed upsetting that this dominance
of power has also led to collusion in the fixing of prices. We are an
impoverished nation that requires the private sector’s assistance to
overcome poverty, stimulate social and economic growth and assist in
transforming South Africa into a first world country.

Both affirmative action and black economic empowerment or BEE, were used to
force the private sector into the process of transformation. But, it
appears that some in the private sector remain profit-driven and refuse to
form part of the bigger South African vision of and for democracy.

We have to realise that bread is part of a basic diet. While prices
continue to increase, we have an increase in the number of families that
cannot afford the exorbitant price of bread.

With poverty comes malnutrition. If we are to constructively turn hungry
bellies into full bellies then we need to address the prices of basic
necessities such as bread, milk, rice, maize, salt, sugar, eggs, meat,
chicken, fish and vegetables. We have children who go to school hungry. We
have government striving to address the dilemma through a feeding scheme.
Then we have the private sector working hard at impeding our progress to
assist the hungry for their own greedy profitable gain.

Government needs to evaluate what may be deemed as basic necessities in
food and also look at addressing the pricing in the market so that not only
the poor but also the aged may survive. The MF sincerely feels that we need
to evaluate the cost of living and serve the community by making survival
more accessible by reducing the cost of living. I thank you.

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chairperson, hon Ministers and colleagues, the SA Reserve
Bank noted in the December 2007 quarterly bulletin that inflationary
pressures in the domestic economy intensified concurrently at the producer
and consumer price levels from the middle of 2006, primarily due to
sustained increases in food prices.

The bank further noted that owing to an increase in international grain
prices, the drought conditions during the planting and harvesting seasons,
and a weaker exchange rate, particularly in the first half of 2006, food
price inflation already exceeded the upper end of the inflation target
range for 18 consecutive months. These developments in domestic food prices
were also evident on the international front as demonstrated by the
acceleration of food prices in numerous other countries over the past two
years.

On 17 January this year, China imposed price controls on a wide range of
goods, ranging from grain, edible oil, milk, meat and liquefied petroleum
gas to school fees and fertilisers. Producers of specified products or
services are now required to submit any planned increases in prices of more
than 4% to the government for approval 10 days prior to any adjustments.

In addition, the Chinese cabinet amended the regulation on administrative
punishment for price violations to allow harsher penalties for price
manipulation, collusion and other price-related malpractices. Meanwhile,
local governments have been instructed to conduct special checks on grain,
oil, meat and liquefied gas prices to ensure price stability and enforce
the new regulations.

What I’m saying in a long-winded way is that food price increases are
inevitable in the face of increasing oil prices, which has a knock-on
effect on other commodities and basic necessities such as food and
transport. However, this does not mean that millers, bakeries and other
role-players involved downstream should be unscrupulous and take advantage
of the situation.

Various studies have been done on the income and expenditure of the poor
sections of our country, and the indications are that the majority of our
people in South Africa spend more than 50% of their income on food.
Therefore, the increase in food prices, especially bread, denies this
majority better socioeconomic conditions and food security.

Talking of food security, it exists when all people, at all times, have
physical and economic access to sufficient food to meet their dietary needs
for a productive and healthy life. To sustain food security, availability,
access and utilisation of food have to be secured.

South Africa has the most advanced economy on the African continent, with
an abundance of natural resources. Statistically, South Africa has
sufficient food resources to feed its population. It also has a relatively
high per capita income compared to its neighbouring states. The alarming
food insecurity is clearly a failure of livelihood to guarantee access to
sufficient food at the household level and not primarily an agricultural
failure, as it might be in other Southern African states.

The negative trends in agriculture, in my view, seem related to
government’s strong ideological leaning towards free market economies. In
my view, we followed an economic strategy with full liberalisation of
agricultural markets, and failed to introduce a system of stockpiling and
further state control in the setting of tariffs and prices for agricultural
products so as to secure affordable access to sufficient food for everyone.
Our land reform programme, based on the willing seller-willing buyer
principle, has redistributed less than 10% of the land to date, and is a
key factor in the food insecurity of many families in the rural areas.

Again, this does not mean that the likes of Tiger Brands and others must be
let off the hook. Their price fixing is an indication of market failure
and, to some extent, a weak regulatory environment as far as the
Competition Commission is concerned. Collusion is a bad business practice
and is equivalent to unethical behaviour. For us to have a caring society
and a better life for all, we need to impose stiffer sentences on companies
that cheat.

In the new Bill that is under discussion in Australia, price fixing and
collusion is an offence which can land a director or directors of that
company in jail for a period of up to three years. The company might be
fined up to 10 million Australian dollars or 10% of its annual revenue,
depending on which is the greatest. Even though the penalties in South
Africa are higher than those in Australia, I would still advocate for
harsher penalties, because this price collusion will have a greater impact
on the day-to-day lives of the poor.

A study conducted by Watkinson and Makgetla in 2002 on the fishing industry
in the Western Cape concluded that globalisation, through external policy
prescription, is not the only reason why vulnerable communities with little
or no disposable income are facing deeper social inequalities. Therefore,
our policies also need to be in favour of the poor. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, hope is the poor man’s bread. The escalating
prices of food, milk and other daily nutritional foodstuff are an assault
on the poor of our country. This situation is stealing hope from the hearts
of millions who depend on bread for their daily sustenance. Bread has
always been a measure of human survival. It has been said that, ``to the
hungry, God is bread’’.

Our country has the means and capacity to eliminate hunger from our daily
lives. We need only the will, a real political will that will defeat the
hunger and poverty from which millions of our people suffer. The question
we have to ask ourselves is: On which side is our bread buttered? Is it
buttered on the side on those who want to exploit the poor with price
increases they cannot afford or is our bread buttered to end poverty?

The PAC believes that it is not just bread but food that should be secured,
because food prices have escalated dramatically. Food sovereignty is based
on the human rights to food, to self-determination, on the rights of rural
people to produce food for local and national markets. Food sovereignty
depends on agriculture, with farmers and fisheries. Give our people land
and skills to produce their own bread and not be subjected to bread
companies that exploit them.

The state must play a strong role in policies of agrarian reform and food
production. The state must apply policies that recognise rights and
democratise access to land, to coastal areas, forests ... [Time expired.]
Thank you very much.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, it is people like Mr Imraahn Mukaddam, the
independent bread distributor in Cape Town responsible for exposing price
fixing in the milling industry, who deserve to be honoured today as true
patriots and defenders of peoples’ rights and interest. His courage in
standing up to big business cartels has brought to light the increasing
levels of unethical behaviour within white-collar business in South Africa.

Corporate South Africa, with its continued anticompetitive practices and
disdain for the ordinary consumer, is in need of justice. Price collusion
is but one example of an endemic practice fuelled by greed, control and
unrestrained power. Should such business practices collude with willing
partners in politics, the rules of governance are geared to benefit the
few.

The FD feels that collusion like white-collar crime should be viewed as a
criminal offence punishable by imprisonment, yet most companies can expect
a hefty fine from bodies like the Competition Commission, while in most
cases the responsible action taken by an executive or director is to resign
from the affected company.

We wish to commend the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs and her
department for the announcement that she made here today concerning the
role of co-operatives to ensure food security. We believe that is a step in
the right direction.

Collusion is a crime against humanity, and it is unconscionable that South
Africa, with its high rate of poverty and unemployment, should endure
companies like Tiger Brands and others that care very little for our
endeavour to overcome the injustices of the past and build a society in
which all our people can prosper.

The company was fined 5,7 per cent of its bread sales last year, which
amounted to R98,8 million, which indicates that collusion is a profit-
making strategy irrespective of who may suffer as a result. Such a practice
is unethical and reprehensible. Although a fine cannot wipe away these
companies’ contribution in perpetuating poverty, it at least helps in
naming and shaming them for what they are.

As a result of its collusion it is reported that Tiger Brands shareholders
have lost about R6 billion. The CEO of Tiger Brands, at the time, is
alleged to have said that the anticompetitive activity that took place was
completely unacceptable and contrary to their ethical standards.
Unfortunately, events of recent weeks seem to contradict this statement, as
the company is again embroiled in price-fixing scandals with a
pharmaceutical company.

The FD, an alliance partner of the Christian Democratic Alliance,
recommends that the fines imposed on Tiger Brands and other companies
should not be handed over to the Competition Commission,  but passed on to
the consumer through a subsidy to keep bread prices low.

Finally, as a further recommendation of the FD, we would like to suggest to
government that it use those funds as a start-up fund to adopt a bread
policy whereby certain brands are governed by a government pricing
structure as a means of protecting the price of bread. Thank you.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Thank you, Chair. Hon Minister, I would like to direct
this to you today because the high bread price that we are dealing with is
a negative symptom of a serious economic disease, which, if left unattended
as the government of the day is doing, will eventually affect all of us in
South Africa, with extremely high food prices and no bread on the table for
the poor.

Die kern van die probleem rondom wisselende broodpryse is die bron en die
beskikbaarheid van koring en in Suid-Afrika ten opsigte van ingevoerde
koring. Ek wil dit hard en duidelik stel: Die broodprys is nie ’n
eenvoudige storie nie, maar tot dusver het die regering van die dag in sy
apatie vir die probleem van die koringbedryf, soos geopenbaar in die
optrede van die Ministers van Handel en Nywerheid en van Landbou, grootliks
tot hierdie probleem bygedra.

Die publiek en arm mense betaal nou die hoë prys as gevolg van die regering
en sy Ministers, wat die kommersiële landbou en veral koringboere nie na
waarde gereken het nie en die koringboere se advies konstant eenkant gegooi
het en totaal geïgnoreer het. Daar is nie geluister na die waarskuwings uit
die bedryf oor wat sal gebeur met voedselpryse indien die land nie na sy
landbou omsien nie en boere gevolglik ophou om koring te plant – soos wat
deur Neels Ferreira van die georganiseerde landbou daargestel word.
Wêreldvoorrade van voedsel neem af. Die Financial Mail verklaar –

      ... global production of wheat will this year fall short of demand to
      make it the fifth of the last six years where demand has exceeded
      supply.


Nogtans, ten spyte hiervan, het die regering van die dag rustig sit en kyk
hoe ingevoerde koring die land binnekom. Hulle het niks daaromtrent gedoen
nie. Vertoë vir ’n heffing om dit te keer, is eenkant toe geskuif, want
goedkoop kos moet inkom. Die prys word nou betaal as gevolg van die
ingevoerde koring. Boere kon nie meer suksesvol produseer nie ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The crux of the problem concerning fluctuations in the bread price is the
source and availability of wheat and in South Africa, in respect of
imported wheat. I want to say it loud and clear: The bread price is not a
simple matter, but to date the government of the day, in its apathy towards
the problems of the wheat industry, has greatly contributed to this
problem, as revealed in the actions of the Minister of Trade and Industry,
and the Minister for Agriculture.

The public and the poor are now paying a high price because of the
government and its Ministers, who failed to appreciate the importance of
commercial agriculture in general, and of wheat farmers in particular, and
who constantly cast aside and totally ignored the wheat farmers’ advice. No
attention was paid to warnings from within the industry as to what would
happen to food prices if the country failed to take care of its
agriculture, and if farmers consequently stopped cultivating wheat, as
organised agriculture’s Neels Ferreira has pointed out.

The world’s food stocks are declining. The Financial Mail declared that -

    ... global production of wheat will this year fall short of demand to
    make it the fifth of the last six years where demand has exceeded
    supply.

Nevertheless, and in spite of all this, the government of the day calmly
stood by and watched as imported wheat entered the country. They did
nothing about it. Requests for a levy to prevent this were set aside,
because cheap food had to enter the country. Now we are paying the price
for the imported wheat. Farmers could no longer successfully produce wheat
...]

... and that is why people in the eastern parts of our country stopped
producing wheat. They couldn’t, because there was no profit in it and we
were depending on imported wheat. That resulted in cheap prices. All of a
sudden the international supply just disappeared. What happened in South
Africa? In the past we had 1,4 million hectares under wheat and now we only
have 600 hectares under wheat. In the past we produced 2,5 million tons of
wheat, but now we only produce 1,8 million tons of wheat.

Currently we have 1,2 million tons of wheat being imported every year
whereas in the past we imported only 400 000 tons of wheat. This resulted
in a drop in our food security. In the past our food security was 84% for
wheat and it has now dropped to 60%. What is going to happen in the future?
People will depend on what happens outside.

The price of wheat has increased from R1 500 to R3 000 per ton and now it
is nearly R4 000 per ton, and the ad valorem tariff of 2% that government
has is still has not been attended to. Why? Because the Department of Trade
and Industry did not have a single person from agriculture to help them to
decide what the correct tariff should be. The implication of what will
happen was not really judged by the department, and agriculture was
relaxing. So, there was negligence, as far as I am concerned, on the part
of the government of the day and the Ministers concerned, because they just
ignored all the ...

... waarskuwings wat hulle gekry het oor tyd. [... warnings they received
over time.]

They didn’t do anything and now we have a fait accompli, with
800 000 tons more being imported than previously; that means
R1,6 billion in foreign exchange.

Thousands of jobs have been lost. The bread price is high and our food
security is low. What must we do? The first thing that has to happen is
that the Department of Agriculture and the Minister must let their
arrogance towards agriculture pass ... [Time expired.]

Ms L L MABE: Hon Chair, I would like to appeal to South Africans. We need
to be vigilant when it comes to consumer education. Where we are treated
unfairly we also need to take action to protect ourselves. That is one of
our rights as consumers in this country. We are exploited by those who
control the market; we are exploited by those who control the means of
wealth at the expense of the poor in this country. It is time that we take
action to protect ourselves as consumers.

We also need to educate our people on consumer issues so that they
understand the difference between a 700g and a 800g loaf of bread; so that
they can tackle head on those flouting the laws and the rules of the
country.

I would also like to thank the Minister of Education for the massive
literacy campaign, which will further enable our people to read and make
them aware of the issues that affect them as consumers.

I would also like to appeal to all the departments, including tertiary
institutions, that they need to train more people on economic issues. The
departments should also take the responsibility of ensuring that unemployed
graduates are trained to become inspectors across all fields not only on
trade and industry issues, but also on agriculture and other issues. The
more inspectors we have, the more people we’ll have to check whether or not
people are flouting the laws of this country.

I would also like to indicate that without further massive skills training
we will always have problems of collusion, abuse of monopoly of power, etc.
Therefore, it is important that we make a massive effort. That is why the
ANC, in its January 8 statement, said that education is a right and we must
make a massive drive in the sphere of education.

I would also like to point out some of the issues that members have
indicated that impact on the increase in the price of bread. One of the
issues is biofuel production. This is economically fashionable, and if we
are not careful, hon Minister, we will also have a problem with maize,
because of the increase in the maize price. At the moment it is very
difficult for a poor person to buy a bag of maize meal. It is also very
expensive for a poor person to buy a loaf of bread.

How possible is it going to be for school children to buy “sephatlho”
[bunny chow]? It will be very expensive. These learners depend on
“sephatlho” [bunny chow] for their lunch. In some areas it costs R6,00 and
in some areas R8,00, which is a lot for a poor person to spend in just half
a day. We need to take a look at some of these issues.

Another issue that I would also like to raise is the rise in the price of
both wheat and maize that impacts negatively on the poor, especially in
Southern Africa, because this is where the two commodities form the staple
food. If we do not have control over the price of bread - and I am not
saying that government must determine the price of bread, but we need to
have some control to ensure that the poor are not impacted on negatively –
we’ll be in trouble.

Another thing that we cannot ignore is that the rise in oil prices as a
result of attacks in the Middle East is also causing a problem. The
question is: Is taking up arms, fighting against other countries which
produce oil, the only way we could solve problems in the Middle East? The
price of oil is almost US$100 a barrel. This impacts negatively on the
price of basic foodstuffs.

Maybe we need to change our approach towards the behaviour of farmers in
our country. Farmers need to co-operate with farmworkers and we need to
give more land to farmworkers and to previously disadvantaged people so
that they can produce more food and enable us to have food security.

It seems like the hon Van Niekerk and the FF Plus have said that the ANC’s
ideological policies are what is at fault. I do not agree with that
argument, because without ANC ideological policies you cannot change
production or landownership in this country. Therefore, there is no way
that we can run away from ANC ideological policies because it is the ruling
party and its ideological policies must be put into effect. We cannot allow
the minority ideological points or positions of the minority to be the
position of the government of the majority. It is not possible.

It is important that the price of bread is re-examined. As I said, we need
to have inspectors. When you consider the people who receive social grants,
the more the price of bread increases the less they will have to spend on
such commodities; the less they will have to spend on maize; and the less
they will have to spend on transport. Unfortunately, most of them rely on
the “yellow pages” [they travel on foot]. They cannot afford cars, taxi
fares and all these luxurious commodities. It therefore means we must re-
examine how our policies can benefit the poor more than the rich.

Subsidies are one of the issues, because the US, the EU and other developed
countries continue to subsidise their farmers and maybe it’s time that we
also look at subsidising emerging farmers. I am not referring to all
farmers, but to emerging farmers only, so that they can become sustainable
and produce more foods, including maize which we are experiencing problems
with at the moment; that is why the price of bread is increasing the way it
is.

An article in today’s Business Day says:


  While there has been an outcry in South Africa, bread prices here still
  lag behind global prices with bread in the US, UK and Australia costing
  as much as R15,00 a loaf.

The person who wrote this article has forgotten that he is comparing a
developing country to developed countries. This is an unfair comparison.
Why can’t the person compare developing countries with each other, because
as South Africa we must compare ourselves to developing countries that are
poor like us? We are not as rich as the developed countries.
[Interjections.] Zimbabwe is fine, don’t worry about it.

I also want to say that it is important for us to ensure that, as Members
of Parliament, and as the public, we go out and fight for our rights. These
rights of low bread prices, of no collusion on bread prices, will assist
our children. I pity our children who rely on R6,00 or R8,00 a day to buy
“sephatlho” [bunny chow] with chips and “machangani wors” [Vienna
sausages]. This kind of meal means a lot to those children. Let us all take
our position and assist these people to have food security.

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chair and hon Minister, in spite of some confusing
statements, clearly nobody refutes the fact that food inflation is out of
control, especially the bread price, and everyone shares grave concerns for
poor and vulnerable people.

The ACDP notes your commitment, hon Minister, to various projects intended
to impact positively on the bread price and we support those proposals. By
the way, I also wanted to know why we have stopped producing wheat in the
Eastern Cape and other provinces. And thank you, hon Van Niekerk, for your
perspective.

The ACDP is very aware that agricultural and land policies are of critical
importance and must be handled wisely or the people will perish.

We may not be able to make immediate inroads with regard to the production
of wheat, the value of the rand value or fuel prices, but certainly it has
been shown that collusion will not be tolerated and again the ACDP applauds
those who have aggressively addressed this plight.

The ACDP calls on government to ensure that victims of the collusion
scandal benefit directly and indirectly with immediate effect. The ACDP
welcomes calls for government to intervene, but exactly how this should be
done may still be in contention.

Should bread prices be controlled or should there rather be subsidies which
target the poor? Perhaps it would be more appropriate to start by
cancelling out government’s hands out of the past in the issue by part
exempting white bread from VAT. The import duty on wheat must also be
urgently re-evaluated.

Interventions by governments in other countries to keep bread prices from
rising include Argentina which placed a ban on wheat exports; Brazil and
the EU which lowered import duties on wheat; Israel which removed state
price controls on bread and provided subsidies for the poorest members of
society. Many other examples exist and should be seriously considered.

I want to thank everybody for participating in this debate and for
responding to the ACDP’s call to facilitate it. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

   CONSIDERATION OF SECOND TO FOURTEENTH REPORTS OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON
                               PUBLIC ACCOUNTS

Mr N T GODI: Chairperson, comrades and hon members, it is my pleasure and
honour to present to the House the 13 reports of Scopa, the Standing
Committee on Public Accounts, as part of our oversight work. These reports
can be divided into two, firstly, those dealing with unauthorised
expenditure and, secondly, those dealing with our review of annual reports.

In the annual reports review, Scopa is gravely concerned at the
deteriorating state of affairs in the Department of Defence. There has been
some deterioration, with more than double the qualification issues compared
to the previous year.

Whilst there have been some improvements in the Department of Health,
concerns remain about the Division of Revenue Act and the effectiveness of
monitoring by management to ensure compliance with legislation, policies
and procedures.

We are also concerned about underexpenditure on programmes dealing with HIV
and Aids. We are also unhappy about the nonactivity of the SA National Aids
Trust, which is a contravention of the Deed of Trust, section 3 of the
Public Finance Management Act and the Public Audit Act.

The Department of Correctional Services is another department that needs
“Business Unusual”. However, I’d like to highlight Scopa’s concern about,
amongst others, the public-private partnership jails. In the year under
review, the department incurred a cost of
R560 million from these PPPs. As Scopa, we are worried whether this huge
cost is justifiable and whether the department is run cost-effectively.

Comrades will recall the corruption that went with the negotiation of these
deals. Thus Scopa is calling on the department to supply Parliament with
the cost benefit analysis in terms of value for money to the taxpayer
within 60 days of the adoption of this report by the House.

We are also concerned about governance arrangements in the Department of
Justice and Constitutional Development insofar as it relates to third-party
funds, that is moneys in trust that got a disclaimer of opinion. This
largely results from reluctance on the part of the department to accept
accountability and responsibility for the funds.

The National Prosecuting Authority got a qualified audit opinion as a
vacancy rate of 30,7% impacts negatively on the strategic objectives and
operations of the NPA. We recommend that these vacancies be filled urgently
to enable to the NPA to the fulfil its mandate.

We are also concerned about the Criminal Asset Recovery Account that is run
by the Criminal Asset Recovery Unit: there are no systems or processes to
account for and track the status of finalised confiscation and forfeiture
orders, and to track all cases handed over to curators.

CARA or the Criminal Asset Recovery Account, has a vacancy rate of 8%. This
bad state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist.

I’m now coming to unauthorised expenditure. With the passing of these
resolutions, we will have dealt with all outstanding cases of unauthorised
expenditure that were brought before the committee. We want to thank the
Auditor-General’s Office and the National Treasury for their assistance in
this regard.

In all the reports, we are recommending that the House approves the amounts
involved. We do so because the accounting officers have confirmed that,
one, services for the expenditure were to the department’s satisfaction;
two, no individual benefited unduly; three, measures are in place to
prevent a recurrence.

The unauthorised expenditure involved the following departments and
amounts: The Department of Foreign Affairs, an amount of R6 879 000; the
Department of Land Affairs, an amount of R7 182; The Presidency, an amount
of R15 331,06; the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, an
amount of R139 052 849,71; the Department of Trade and Industry, an amount
of R32 246 285,72; the Department of Public Works, an amount of R299 218
429,94.

Lastly, we are greatly impressed with the improved co-ordination between
Scopa and all role-players, which saw the reports before the House in
record time. We commend these reports to the House. Thank you.

Ms L M MASHIANE: Chairperson, from what the chairperson, hon Godi, has
said, Scopa does not only review the financial management side of
performance by departments and entities in order to determine compliance
with the frameworks that Parliament has put in place, such as the Public
Finance Management Act. Scopa also carries out this vigorous scrutiny,
because there is a link between service delivery and sound financial
management.

Today Scopa is tabling before this House reports, and departments and
entities were all called to a hearing. I’m going to name them, specifically
because if we keep this under wraps departments’ performance does not
improve. The departments that were called to hearings are: The Department
of Defence; the Department of Health; the Department of Correctional
Services; the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development; the
Department of Public Service and Administration.

Regarding unauthorised expenditure, which has been tabled by hon Godi, the
following departments were involved: The Department of Foreign Affairs; the
Department of Land Affairs; The Presidency; the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development; the Department of Trade and Industry; the
Department of Public Works.

Furthermore, the Department of Public Works continues to face serious
challenges regarding ownership of assets. This is in relation to moneys for
refurbishment and improvements, paid by the departments concerned, not
being transferred to the department, as well as classification as current
versus capital expenditure.

Scopa would like the House to note that it is far from satisfied with the
general position regarding public sector financial management, especially
taking into account that some of these departments appear before the
committee each and every year. If one considers the key elements of
effective financial management, one can assess the ability of a department
to manage its finances and, therefore, to deliver on its mandate on a daily
basis.

We are able to assess whether a department is at an elementary level of
financial management or has progressed to stronger, effective financial
management and resource utilisation.

The key challenge is a proper control environment. Without proper controls
and associated practices, there is lack of sustainable practices of
financial management. Without a basic control environment, assets might not
be adequately protected or resources adequately controlled.

We do come across too many departments and entities that establish a proper
control environment where the required capacity has not yet been reached,
for example with respect to internal audit units, audit committees, fixed
asset registers.

I would also like to ask portfolio committees, when they deal with their
reports, to look not only at the policy, but also at the strategies of the
department versus the finances of that particular department. That will
also give you an indication of whether there is proper monitoring going on
within that particular department.

Another key challenge is the availability, reliability and utilisation of
sound financial and operational data, commonly referred to as “management
information”. Once a stable control environment has been established,
departments can focus on integrating their financial and nonfinancial
systems, practices and procedures. The aim is to provide information that
can be used to manage resources and take decisions with caution, in an
efficient and economical manner.

This information provides the basis for developing performance indicators
and cost and quality measures, and for monitoring performance to ensure
that intended results are achieved and to demonstrate accountability.

We still come across too many instances where the management of information
is of a poor quality. Surprisingly, we also come across instances where it
seems as if management does not use the information available. Thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr J J M STEPHENS: Chairperson, hon members, we are very pleased to note
that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts’ resolutions are now put
before the House much closer to the time they were passed by the committee.
This makes for a timelier and more relevant debate, as the hon Trent argued
previously. It is indeed a very positive development in our parliamentary
practice.

Many colleagues inform me that this debate is traditionally regarded as the
most boring of them all. I have no intention of breaking with such an
esteemed tradition, and I shall consequently endeavour to make my five
minutes feel like 10.

Scopa reports, by their very nature, deal with history, a subject many
would instinctively avoid. They are probably regarded as boring, because
what happened a year or so ago does not seem relevant to the here and now.
They have nothing to do with the present challenges; with today’s
headlines. They do not deal with the future, but rather dwell on the past.
It is these perceptions that I wish to challenge.

It was Cicero who said that those who are ignorant of the past remain
forever children. And Sir Winston Churchill had it right when he said that
when we are ignorant of history we are forever condemned to repeat it.
Clearly, knowledge of the past serves as a guide to the future, and that is
how Scopa reports should be viewed.

As a Parliament we have the exacting and onerous responsibility of
oversight. We cannot put all our effort and attention into developing
policies and passing budgets, enacting legislation, monitoring expenditure
and then be laissez faire about the utilisation of state resources in the
process of implementation.

Scopa recommendations must serve as a basis for oversight. The fundamental
question the Auditor-General and Scopa ask of every role-player is this:


  Can you account fully and satisfactorily, at an accepted reporting
  standard, for the performance of the directives you have been given and
  the money you received from this Parliament in order to carry out those
  directives?

All other questions are ancillary to that fundamental question, but the
answer is sealed in a simple yes or no. Sometimes, like the case of the
Department of Home Affairs, the answer is no. In others, such as the case
of South African Airways in the second report now before the House, the
answer is yes. But mostly there are degrees of compliance.

Once the fundamental question has been answered, recommendations are
required. What must be done to rectify and / or improve the situation?  It
is not only a very bad audit report that should cause portfolio committees
to sit up and take notice. Valuable recommendations abound, even after a
clean audit report.

In the present case of SAA, which has a clean audit report, there are
nevertheless three areas of concern on which recommendations are made: SAA
as a going concern; compliance with legislation; and capacity and / or
people-related issues. To ensure that these recommendations are implemented
properly and that we get value for money and our effort, we will require a
regular and persistent inquiry by the Portfolio Committee on Public
Enterprises in this case.

Scopa cannot monitor the implementation of its recommendations. That must
be the function of the portfolio committees, but that is seldom, if ever
done. This lack of follow-up causes departments to have the same problems
year after year, when they come to Scopa, and often they backslide ever
deeper into the mire.  Nothing is fixed, because only the Auditor-General
and Scopa complain of the inadequacies. Everyone else ignores these
reports. They are filed never to be read again, apparently.

We shall never get the service delivery we seek and we shall never get the
service quality our people so desperately need, if we fail to rectify the
identified deficiencies, mistakes and attitudinal problems of the past.

I want to appeal to all portfolio committees to set aside at least one
session every year to deal with the relevant Scopa reports. Please
interrogate them, analyse them and internalise them. Only then will you be
able to oversee their proper implementation. It is an ongoing process that
has to be persistently pursued throughout the year as you interact with
your departments.

It is an iterative process to build an efficient and devoted civil service.
We all have a role to play. Scopa reports are an excellent point to start
from. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr K O Bapela): Hon member, if you wanted to ask a
question you should have stood up at the time when the member was still at
the podium. When I wanted to recognise you, you then withdrew. I am sorry
about that.

Mr H J BEKKER: Chairperson, if the hon Eddie Trent so desperately wants to
ask a question, he can ask me, but anyway, I don’t think he will try me on
this. It is a known fact that the previous Auditor-General, as the present
one in terms of philosophy, has increased and lifted the bar in terms of
audit reporting and, particularly, in terms of financial reporting. Thus,
the relevant departments are now being scrutinised year by year in a
stronger way and this is to get our public accounting up to scratch and to
get it in right.

The Scopa reports before this House reflect inter alia that the Departments
of Defence, Correctional Services, Justice and Health received qualified
audit opinions from the Auditor-General for the 2006-07 financial year. The
IFP is very concerned that these departments have become serial offenders.
Bear in mind that we are talking now about, for instance, Correctional
Services and it may ring a bell if we’re saying serial offenders in terms
of that specific department.

It is also of great concern that the shortcomings or failures in their
financial management are repeated from one financial year to the other.
Some of these failures include inadequately trained and skilled financial
personnel, high vacancy rates, non-compliance with Treasury regulations and
the Public Finance Management Act and inadequate asset management.

What is most worrying is that the accounting officers at these departments
appear to be incapable of effectively addressing these failures. If they
did, the departments would not have received qualified audits on an ongoing
basis.

Repeated qualified audits raise questions whether these accounting officers
are capable financial managers that are fit to take overall responsibility
for their departments and account to Parliament. That does not appear to be
the case, and the IFP would therefore want to see a situation where
stronger action is taken specifically against the accounting officers who
fail in their duties.

South African taxpayers deserve full value for their contributions to the
national fiscus, but in respect of certain state departments this does not
appear to be the case at all.

We’ve also got SAA, which is being referred to here, and although this is
not directly relevant to the specific financial year, I just want to issue
a personal view with regard to the issue of Mango, which indirectly is
being subsidised by the taxpayer. Should it, in the next financial year,
appear that there is no real profit-making so that this could be paid back,
this should surely be looked upon as irregular expenditure.

The IFP supports the recommendations made by the committee, and looks
forward to full compliance by the accounting officers involved with these
recommendations ... [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Scopa has an extremely positive role to play as
an instrument of transparency and effective governance. We call for all
bodies to be extremely co-operative under their review and to take the
recommendations made by Scopa seriously.

We believe that Scopa reports need to be made more accessible to the public
for scrutiny on the positive running of government structures.

The MF feels that maybe we have lost sight on the fact that we are a
government by the people for the people. That clearly indicates that we are
answerable to the people and dependent upon the decision of the people. The
people have a right to decide and we have a right and duty to serve.

The MF thanks Scopa for its assistance in serving the nation and we support
the reports. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P A GERBER: Mr Chairperson, thank you for the opportunity to address
this House on the 13 Scopa reports tabled before us today. I would also
like to thank the Whippery for bringing them to the House so soon after we
passed them in the committee. Normally, these reports are discussed at the
end of our term, when it is basically “injury time”. So, I would like to
thank them.

Scopa never used to debate its resolutions or reports in the past. This is
a new practice which we have developed in this House in the past couple of
years. In essence, Scopa is basically “a resolution factory”. So, we all
welcome this new extension of Scopa’s work.

I do, however, wish to say that it is totally unfair that every time Scopa
debates its reports in this House, it is always at the end of the day’s
sitting, with very few members in attendance. This is also the case with
some other committees. I think we should rectify this. If there are other
committees, and there might well be, that experience the same problem, then
that should also be rectified.

I also want to convey my disappointment that while we are dealing here with
at least ten Ministries there is only one Deputy Minister present in the
House. That is not fair, really. [Applause.]

Scopa has undertaken a couple of overseas study visits in recent past years
to enhance training for our members. Various models were investigated. I
think the one that has shown the most potential that we can use in South
Africa is the one that the public accounts committees are using in India.

In India there are two public accounts committees – one dealing only with
departments and the other one dealing with parastatals and government
companies only. This is a model we should investigate as it could be used
in South Africa. At the moment, in terms of parastatals and government
companies, we are only scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Scopa has in recent years decided to do more monitoring of parastatals,
with excellent results. We need to do even more.

Often, when you look at the financial statements of these parastatals, who
mostly have external auditors, they appear to be very clean and in a good
state. Many of the external audit reports are one-pagers. If you look at
the Transnet Report on page 140, the external auditor’s report is a one-
pager. If you look at Eskom, pages 25-26, it is two pages. If you look at
SAA, page 18, it is a one-pager.

We at Scopa decided that these one-pager picnics can no longer continue.
So, we decided to call some of these parastatals for public hearings over
the past couple of months.

When we do call a particular parastatal to a public hearing, the Auditor-
General and the external auditors of that specific parastatal must, in
conjunction with each other, prepare a briefing to Scopa before such a
hearing can take place.

One such parastatal with a one-page external auditor’s financial report
that we did decide to call to Scopa was SAA. Since the promulgation of the
Public Audit Act until now, the Auditor-General has not exercised his right
to elect to audit SAA, and SAA has thus continued to appoint external
auditors in terms of the Companies Act. Perhaps the Auditor-General should
review his decision not to audit SAA.

The financial report of the external auditors of SAA is once again a one-
pager. That is on page 18. However, when we called SAA for a hearing, their
external auditors supplied us with the real external auditor’s report, and
here it is, all 104 pages of it. So, what you get is from one page to 104
pages. Parastatals must put fewer pages with fancy pictures in their annual
reports and more financial information.

Many issues and problems came to the fore from these 104 pages of financial
information. For example, for the 2006 period, the SAA had expired
contracts with 12 companies which they continued to pay to the extent of
more than R192 million. There were also contracts with 11 companies that
did not go through the Tender Board, totalling more than R70 million. Then
there were also contracts with four companies totalling more than R20
million that could not be located. In total, in 2006 R283 million slipped
through the cracks at SAA. This we would not have been able to pick up had
we not called in SAA for a hearing.

Another issue that came up was that the Minister of Trade and Industry
issued his report, compiled in terms of section 258 of the Companies Act,
resulting from an inquiry into the affairs of SAA. The report invalidated
the share issue arising from the R6 billion recapitalisation, which
occurred in 2004.

The issuing of shares in parastatals to employees is a matter that should
be dealt with very carefully. I raise this matter because Eskom, in their
latest report, have a deferred bonus scheme which offers bonus shares to
the CEO, the finance director and the divisional managing directors. So far
Eskom has awarded more than 35 million shares to these individuals. But, on
the other hand, we stand here and we say government is a single
shareholder. That doesn’t make sense.

Another significant issue that came out of these 104 pages of external
audits is that various SAA subsidiaries were technically insolvent in 2006.
For example, SAA Technical incurred a further loss of R253 million and Air
Chefs incurred a further loss of R32 million.

In the executive summary conclusion - this is a thick report - the
following comments were made by the auditors, and I would like to read this
to you:


  SAA has some work to do on its internal control system ...


  The responsibility for implementation of sound internal controls is
  broader than just a finance team. Every department within the airline
  must be committed to the implementation of controls.


  This may require a substantial increase in the number of suitably skilled
  individuals, with appropriate financial and commercial skills.


  It may also be necessary for the entire Exco team to undergo training on
  COSO, or some other globally accepted governance best practice, to ensure
  consistency of understanding in regard to internal controls.

My question is: Why didn’t the external auditors mention this in the tabled
report to Parliament for us as parliamentarians? I think it shows
disrespect for Parliament and it could actually be interpreted as
misleading when it comes to not giving all the information. This kind of
economical skeleton financial reporting has in the past led to the Enron
and Parmalat disasters that we have read about in the past couple of years.
We must not allow this to happen in South Africa! [Applause.]

With regard to the Mango issue, the resolution before the House, in clause
4, specifically asks SAA to report to the House on their Mango operation.
At 31 March 2007, Mango had an accumulated loss of R61 million. This
includes the prestart-up expenditure of R33,8 million.

We therefore ask that SAA provides the House with a cost benefit analysis
in terms of value for money to the taxpayer of why we are doing what we are
doing. We need this study to be supplied to Parliament before the Mango
hits the fan.

We should standardise and expand the skeleton financial reports of external
auditors to Parliament. For instance, I would like to read to you, just in
short, the notes from the 2006 report of the external auditors on SAA:


  Based on the audit procedures performed, we are unable to express an
  unqualified opinion on SAA’s PFMA compliance.

It doesn’t say that it is qualified; it says it is “unable to express an
unqualified opinion”. So, it’s already softening it. Yet, in 2006 it
doesn’t even have any qualification; it just has an emphasis of matter.

When we get to the 2007 report – also from the thick report which I have
shown you – it says here:

  Based on the audit procedures performed, we are unable to express an
  unmodified opinion.
Why doesn’t it say it’s “qualified” again in plain English?

In conclusion, these statements are very, very economical with the truth or
reality. We need to take all steps, as members of Parliament, to have more
comprehensive and complete financial reporting by external auditors to
Parliament so that we don’t have a disaster in a couple of years time.

With these few words, I would like to put these 13 resolutions to the
House. Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chair, I move, on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority
Party:

  That the reports be adopted.

Thank you.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 16:40.

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly
1.    REPORT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON CORRECTIONAL SERVICES ON THE
   ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL
   SERVICES FOR 2006/07, DATED 20 NOVEMBER 2007

The Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services, having considered the
Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Department of Correctional
Services for 2006/07, reports as follows:

1.    Introduction

The Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services scrutinised the 2005/06
Annual Report of the Department of Correctional Services (DCS). The
oversight process comprised briefings and discussions with the Department
as well as public hearings on the DCS Annual Report. The Committee also
participated in meetings held by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts
(SCOPA) and the Portfolio Committee on Finance, where the DCS’ audit report
and request for a rollover of R515 million were discussed.

2.    Research Analysis of the 2006/07 Annual Report

The research analysis revealed the following findings in terms of certain
selected targets.

2.1   Programme 1: Administration

Strategically the DCS planned to in 2006/07 prioritise and implement a
range of measures aimed at streamlining its human resource strategy, as
well as to develop comprehensive, standardised training on the Minimum
Information Security Standards and Minimum Security Standards for Head of
Security, Heads of Correctional Centres and Area Commissioners. The
implementation of certain recommendations emanating from the Report of the
Jali Commission would also have been implemented. The Department planned to
continue to provide training for junior and middle management staff and to
extend its leadership training to senior management.
While the Department managed to reduce its audit qualifications in 2006/07,
train 970 financial and supply chain management personnel at Head Office as
well as in all six regions, establish a baseline of the identified risks of
corruption, fraud and maladministration, recruit 2 211 new employees and to
ensure that many of its decisions were informed by adequate research, it
failed to ensure that its Head Office and regions were capacitated to
perform financial and supply chain management, to vet its officials, to
train management at Centres of Excellence on policy implementation and to
reduce its vacancy rate by the envisioned 3%. These deficiencies could have
far-reaching consequences especially with regard to the widespread
corruption within the institution. The Annual Report is not clear as to
whether the Department’s investigation, prosecution and censure of fraud,
corruption and maladministration was successful nor on whether its
retention strategy has been approved.


Expenditure: 96,05% of the R2,668,061 allocated budget.


2.2   Programme 2: Security
The Department planned to complete and implement the biometric system and
install fences. It also aimed to develop and implement a 5-year security
plan based on the Minimum Security Standards as well as to build capacity
for its security information management.


It succeeded in reducing the number of escapes by 17%, 7% more than their
target. Despite this success the DCS failed to meet the targeted 10%
decrease in assaults and the 5% decrease in unnatural deaths. It also did
not manage to develop a 5-year security management plan, to submit
quarterly security analysis reports at those centres fitted with CCTV
cameras, or to approve its anti-gang strategy.

Expenditure: 100% of R2,931,981 allocated budget

2.3   Programme 3: Corrections
The Department intended to implement the Offender Rehabilitation Path,
corrections programmes via accredited service providers, systems for
improving centre and offender management and to develop and implement
policy.

As far as unit management is concerned the DCS succeeded in determining a
baseline, implementation at Centres of Excellence and 25% of other centres
and to approve the framework for structured day-programme as a principle of
unit management, but failed to fully implement risk assessment and
profiling tools, the correctional sentence plan and correctional sentence
plan revision framework (at all centres of excellence) or to approve,
finance and implement the case management committees, comprehensive
assessment units, CIUs or CRTs at all centres of excellence. It also did
not succeed in approving policy procedures in the areas of privilege
systems, the orientation programme for ATDs, correctional programmes or
restorative justice. The report is not clear as to the implementation of a
structured day programme at COEs, the approval of the national offender
profiling system or the report on the implementation of the 4 external
programmes at centres of excellence.


Expenditure: 98,76% of the R731,049 allocated budget.


2.4   Programme 4: Development
The Department intended to finalise its policy on compulsory programmes,
implement the Offender Skills Development Plan, provide existing skills and
education programmes and expand national agriculture and production
workshops.

Although the DCS succeeded in surpassing its envisioned daily average
number of work opportunities (internally by 125 and externally by almost
100%) the number of offenders employed in agricultural work decreased by
about 250, and those in production workshops decreased by about 20. The
programme also did not succeed as far as the targeted number of offenders
involved in agricultural, textile, wood and steel workshop training.
Although the number of inmates involved in skills development programmes
was nearly doubled, those participating in formal education programmes did
not reach the desired level. The report is not clear as far as whether the
approved policies and procedures were implemented in 50% of management
areas as was the target.


Expenditure: 94,94% of the R365,553 allocated budget.


2.5   Programme 5: Care
The Department set out to finalise the HIV prevalence survey and the policy
on compulsory programmes, to phase in provision of primary health care and
to provide needs based programmes (social work, spiritual and psychological
programmes).


While the DCS managed to provide psychological services to 17 818
offenders, it failed to provide the targeted number of social work
sessions. The Department submitted its policy on compulsory programmes but
failed to report on the pilot phase of its implementation in 6 COEs.
According to the report the policies in relation to development and care,
social work services, youth, offenders with disabilities and infants and
mothers were approved, but it is not clear on whether these policies had
been implemented at COEs. The report also states that a number of new care
programmes were developed but gives no indication as to whether these were
implemented.


Expenditure: 97,89% of the R1,114,156 allocated budget.


2.6   Programme 6: Social Reintegration
The Department intended to prioritise social reintegration and ensure
improved community participation, to improve the functioning of
departmental paroling system (CSPB & CS & PRB),to implement classification
system for Parolees and probationers, and to develop programmes for pre-
release, supervision and reintegration.


There appears to have been little or no success as far as meeting the
targets set for this programme too. The ratio of probationers and parolees
to supervisory officer is still at 46:1, 16 probationers and parolees per
supervisory officer too many. Only 28% of absconders have been traced and
only 14 235 of the targeted 40 000 released offenders received financial
and material assistance. Neither the targeted implementation of the social
reintegration policy and framework, nor the implementation of the
assessment tools for probationers and parolees, or the implementation of
integrated support systems were achieved. Only 36 of the 52 positions of
chairpersons of the parole boards were filled. 24 720 offenders underwent
pre-release programmes, but the report is not clear as to the overall
implementation of pre-release programmes.


Expenditure: 98,43% of the R324,258 allocated budget.

2.7   Programme 7: Facilities
The Department’s strategy for this programme entailed the continued
management of upgrading, the building new facilities, the development of
departmental capacity for its own resource and management of devolution of
functions from DPW, and the development of Medium Term Facility Development
and Management Plan.


The Department appears to have failed dismally in achieving any of its
targets for this programme. The five year facilities programme was not
finalized, construction on only one of the first four new prisons began,
none of the feasibility reports for the second group of these prisons were
approved, the budgeting of the prisons was not finalized. The feasibility
study of the new head office was not completed. Due to financial
constraints the Department could not commence with the feasibility study on
the cost effectiveness of small correctional centres. The maintenance plan
has not yet been developed. The upgrading programme was still in the
consultation phase. The Annual Report is unclear as to whether the target
to implement 10% of the maintenance programme focusing at centres of
excellence had been met.


Expenditure: 75,30% of the R1,696,454 allocated budget.

2.8   SUMMARY OF MAJOR CONCERNS EMANATING FROM THE RESEARCH ANALYSIS:

i)    Although the number of escapes decreased there is growing concern
      about the increasingly violent nature of these escapes.
ii)   The dramatic increase in the number of unnatural deaths is worrying
      and needs explanation.
iii)  The unexplained failure to submit quarterly reports on centres where
      the CCTV’s and biometric security equipment is being used is a matter
      of concern.
iv)   It is worrying that a number of security management related policies
      and plans have been carried over to the 2007/08 financial year. Safety
      and security in correctional centres is of integral importance.
v)    Although the total personnel capacity increased by 11%, the vacancy
      rate has increased from 5% to 8% in the past two financial years.
      Doctors, pharmacists, psychologists and nurses show very high turnover
      rates.
vi)   Only 25% of the total number of employees are women and the
      Department needs to do more to do more in terms of achieving greater
      equity.
vii)  Unless the procedure for the vetting of officials is finalised and
      agreed upon with other relevant agencies, that weakness will pose a
      threat to efforts to address corruption and ultimately to safety and
      security.
viii) The decrease in the number of social work sessions will inhibit
      efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders as per the aims of
      the White Paper on Corrections.
ix)   Excessive virement, even within the National Treasury limit of 8%, is
      not good practice. Virement could also possibly have negative
      implications including the misalignment of expenditure to strategy and
      poor planning.
x)    There is a lack of correlation between the targets outlined in the
      2006 Estimates of National Expenditure, the targets in the Strategic
      Plan 2006/07 – 2010/11 and those reported on the 2006/07 Annual
      Report. It is hoped that the alignment of planning, budgeting and
      reporting which is underway will bear visible results in the next
      reporting cycle.

3.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 2006/07 the DCS received a budget of R10,63 billion. This allocation was
adjusted to R9,83 billion and the Department managed to spend R9,25 billion
i.e. it under spent on its budget by R580 million. About 24, 7% of the
allocation to the facilities programme was not spent - most of the under
spending can be ascribed to the delays in the tendering process for the
Kimberley centre. The department requested rollovers of R4,3 million to
finance vehicles for the KwaZulu-Natal region, and R512 million to finance
the Kimberley Correctional Centre project. Funds were shifted between
numerous programmes, mainly to finance the Kimberley Correctional Centre,
the shortfall in the nutritional Services and to fill vacancies.
The Portfolio Committee on Finance, because of its concern regarding the
amount the DCS has requested to be rolled over, invited the Department to
brief Members on the motivation for its rollover request. The Portfolio
Committee on Correctional Services participated in that discussion.

3.1   THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS EMANATED FROM THAT INTERACTION:
     i) Concern around the length of time it is taking to make real
        progress as far as the building of the new correctional facilities,
        specifically the Kimberley facility, towards which much of the
        virement had been directed and for which the bulk of the rollover
        would be used. The project has been receiving allocations since
        2002 and yet no progress appears to have been made. The many delays
        could be indicative of weaknesses as far as contract and project
        management. The fact that very little is reported regarding the
        other 7 facilities is also a matter of concern.


    ii) Concerns were raised regarding the fact that although it would take
        R344 million to get the Kimberley facility on track, a rollover of
        R515 million was being requested.

   iii) The apparently casual manner in which money had been shifted from
        programme to programme, and the fact that the DCS was identified as
        a “usual customer” when it came to rollover requests, reflected
        poor planning on the part of the Department.
    iv) The Annual Report did not make the targets and deliverables with
        regard to the construction of these facilities clear. This made it
        difficult to assess how much progress had actually been made or how
        well past allocations had been spent.

     v) Many difficulties arise from the fact that although DCS is
        providing the funding for the construction of the facilities in
        question, the DPW is in charge of the actual project. A meeting of
        the National Treasury, the DPW as well as the DCS should be held as
        soon as possible so that matters of concern could be addressed and
        cleared up.

4.    AUDITOR GENERAL’S REPORT

The Department received a qualified audit report for the 6th year running.
Although it has managed to reduce the matters of qualification from 5 to 4,
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, pointed out that the matter on
which they improved, related to housing loan guarantees was thus not to the
DCS’ core function. Deficiencies in the areas of asset management, medical
expenditure, staff debt and understated accruals remained and were the
basis of the year under review’s qualification. The Department has drawn up
an action plan aimed at ensuring full compliance with internal controls,
good governance policies and regulations and has reported to the Portfolio
Committee on the progress made on the plan.

The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) met with the Department
to discuss its Audit Report. The Portfolio Committee on Correctional
Services was invited to take part in these discussions.

   1. MAJOR CONCERNS EMANATING FROM THAT INTERACTION INCLUDE:
        i) Despite the continued concern regarding poor internal controls
           and despite it being an area of audit qualification, monthly
           reconciliation of staff debt is still not being done. The
           Auditor General has also raised concerns about deficiencies in
           controls in the following areas: asset management, medical aid
           contributions, staff receivables, poor and inefficient control
           activities,


       ii) Despite the implementation of a new recruitment strategy the
           vacancy rate in key management areas remains high.

      iii) The Department’s under spending and the high staff turnover is
           worrying and can be directly linked to challenges in terms of
           service delivery.

       iv) The huge increase in the money spent on employee compensation –
           expenditure in that area increased by more than R 500 million -
           only 4 412 additional people were employed.

        v) The R53 million increase to the spending on consultants brings
           the total expenditure in that area to R206 million. Departments
           should source skills inter departmentally instead of using
           consultants.

       vi) The fleet management remains weak and in 2006/07 saw R3 million
           in material losses.

      vii) The amount spent on claims against the Department is also a
           cause for concern. SCOPA requested the Department to provide it
           with a breakdown of the details of those claims.

     viii) The backlog as far as the building of the new correctional
           facilities reflects poor management and poor planning on the
           side of the Department.

       ix) There is a need for a multifaceted approach to overcrowding.
           Such an approach would require participation from all role
           players.

        x) The Committee raised concerns about the fact that it had had to
           learn about the contents of the Judicial Inspectorate of
           Prison’s report through the media. From media reports it
           appeared as though the report contained useful information as
           far as the conditions in prison especially as far as the impact
           the large number of awaiting trial has on overcrowding.

       xi) SCOPA recommends that the Portfolio Committee on Correctional
           Services closely monitor the areas of concern it had identified.
           The Department should provide that Committee with regular and
           detailed progress reports.

5.    DEPARTMENT BRIEFING

The Department acknowledged the Committee’s rigorous oversight of its
activities. DCS officials worked in a challenging environment and in
2006/07 had successes in key areas – the 2006/07 Annual Report was an
improvement on previous years’ reports. It was emphasized that further
successes would be heavily dependent upon unity so as to ensure greater
harmony in the provision of services.

5.1   Key developments and challenges in 2006/07
      (i)   There was a need to reassess the DCS’ planning cycle so that
           planning is done at local level, and so that the Head Office’s
           role would be to monitor and report on what was happening at
           ground level. To this end the Department has established the
           Operations and Management support component which would focus on
           streamlining the DCS’ operations.


       ii) A joint pilot project between National Treasury and the DCS was
           aimed at identifying clearer indicators for performance
           management. This project would measure not only outcomes but
           also input and would include monitoring of the DCS’ expenditure.


      iii) The managing of overcrowding in prisons remained a challenge
           especially in relation to awaiting trial detainees. The
           Department emphasised that the Department of Justice and
           Constitutional Development was responsible for the efficient
           processing of awaiting trial detainees. While the DCS attempted
           to reduce the number of awaiting trial detainees through its
           Management Remand Detention, the efficiency of the Justice
           Department’s case flow management impacted on the success of
           that programme.

       iv) The DCS has appointed a Chief Financial Officer. This
           appointment would assist it in strengthening its internal audit
           weaknesses. The DCS would henceforth pay greater attention to
           financial management and audit-related issues.

        v) The building of five new correctional facilities has been
           approved by National Treasury. Upon the instruction of the
           Minister work on two of the facilities had been halted but the
           work on the Kimberley project was progressing well and it is
           expected that that facility will be completed by 2009.
       vi) The Kokstad correctional facility had been identified and
           rehabilitated for the incarceration of dangerous criminals. The
           DCS concurred with the Committee on the fact that dangerous and
           violent offenders ought to be isolated.

      vii) The Department had made some inroads as far as its audit
           qualifications of the previous year are concerned: the housing
           loan guarantees were being monitored on a monthly basis,
           qualifications related to asset procurement have been addressed
           and life certificates have been issued to continuation members
           thus addressing the qualification on medical expenditure. In
           addition the functionality of the accounting system has been
           enhanced and progress has been made as far as the implementation
           of the Judge White cases.

     viii) The migration to the LOGIS asset management system has been
           approved. The 2006/07 qualification related to asset management
           and the absence of an asset register. The Department explained
           that assets occupied by the DCS were actually owned by the
           Department of Public Works. The system used for the recording of
           asset values reflected incorrect figures. The DCS would strive
           to reconcile both book and current values. The Department failed
           to meet targets with respect to fixed assets structure but was
           working on addressing that weakness.

       ix) The Department was in the process of updating its asset
           register. Intangible assets were not disclosed in 2007, and the
           DCS should seek clarity from the Office of the Auditor General
           as to how items should be defined.

        x) The Department was in the process of reconciling the debtors’
           files, but did not have the details of former members who had
           debtors. The qualification on receivables resulted from the non-
           delivery of some files containing the records of old debtors who
           still owed money.

       xi) The non-reconciliation between the personnel system PERSAL, and
           the BAS accounting system also resulted in a qualification. In
           response the Department reviewed its system so as to identify
           ways of recovering debt from the debtors’ pension fund.

      xii) Government was in the process of migrating from a cash basis to
           a modified cash basis and this involved much manual
           intervention. Because the DCS was very decentralised it was
           difficult to handle issues of accruals. The Department has
           requested the Auditor General to supply them with cut-off dates
           for the submission of accrual statements.

6.    PUBLIC HEARINGS

The Committee received submissions from the South African Council of
Churches (SACC), the Civil Society Prison Reform Initiative (CSPRI), the
Police and Prisoners’ Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) and Khulisa Services.


6.1.  SACC submission
      The SACC identified four main areas of concern namely overcrowding and
      the criminal justice strategy, the monitoring of recidivism and
      rehabilitation, inmate care and social reintegration. Despite the
      budget proposal’s claim that the DCS’ central focus has shifted to
      rehabilitation, recidivism –related evidence remains “anecdotal”.
      Although the long-term strategy envisages greater community
      mobilisation around issues such as social cohesion, social justice,
      moral and ethical values and socio-economic development, joint
      ventures between civil society and the DCS are not being provided for
      in the financial allocation.


      While the SACC commends the DCS for its commitment to the introduction
      of three meals a day, it fears that the amount allocated to the
      process would not be sufficient to ensure that those meals are
      nutritious. Concerns were also raised about the provisions of the US
      President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which tie assistance to
      abstinence and fidelity based initiatives. Concerns were also raised
      about the fact that spiritual care services, which could play a major
      role in social reintegration and rehabilitation programmes as well as
      restorative justice projects, have enjoyed an exceedingly small
      allocation.


      Receiving less than 4% of the budget, the after care programme for
      released offenders remains the most poorly supported programme within
      the correctional services budget. This was particularly worrying
      considering the DCS’ new focus on social reintegration and
      rehabilitation.


      Recommendations

        i) The minimum sentencing legislation should be amended in an
           attempt to alleviate overcrowding.
       ii) Joint ventures between civil society and the Department that
           would promote the mobilisation of the community so as to unlock
           resources and to generate additional data analysis as well as to
           halt and understand the cycle of crime, should be provided for
           in the budget.
      iii) A balanced and multi-faceted HIV/AIDS programme that promoted
           the use of condoms as a legitimate and effective option to
           prevent transmission of the virus needs to be implemented.
       iv) The number of spiritual care sessions should be improved and
           spiritual and moral development workers should enjoy additional
           support as they have the capacity to complement the work of
           chaplains and thus could contribute to restorative justice
           initiatives.
        v) The social reintegration programme needs to be expanded so as to
           ensure that former prisoners have genuine alternatives to crime.
           This would contribute to the reduction of recidivism.
       vi) Additional resources should be allocated to promote employment
           creation opportunities as well as support for community based
           training institutions.
      vii) The Department should explore the possibility of funding halfway
           houses for just released offenders.
     viii) Strategies of restorative justice that build community skills in
           mediation and resolution of specified social problems should be
           developed.

6.2   Civil Society Prison Reform Initiative submission
      The organisation’s main concern related to inmate - safety. It raised
      concerns about the dramatic increase in the number of unnatural deaths
      and the number of reported assaults. There was also concern that
      although South Africa was a signatory to the United Nations’
      Convention Against Torture (CAT), it has failed to meet its
      obligations. The fact that the South African Police Service seldom
      followed through on the cases inmates made against DCS officials was
      also worrying.

      Recommendations


         i) The Portfolio Committee should liaise with its Justice and
            Constitutional Development counterpart with regard to the
            progress made towards criminalizing torture.
        ii) The JIOP should hold a thorough investigation to determine what
            the underlying and direct causes for unnatural deaths are as
            well as what actions had been taken in cases where officials
            were implicated.
       iii) DCS staff should receive training on the CAT especially as far
            as the provisions relating to the use of minimum force so as to
            ensure that that provision was implemented within the
            limitations contained in Article 10 of that convention.
        iv) General awareness raising programmes on the prohibition of
            torture, cruelty, inhuman and degrading treatment of inmates
            must be put in place.
         v) Prisoners must upon admission be informed of their rights
            especially in relation to torture. This information should be
            reinforced on a continuous basis.
        vi) The JIOP should monitor the progress made as far as the
            investigations dealing with assaults and deaths.
       vii) Results of investigations on the unnatural deaths should be made
            public in the interest of transparency and accountability.

6.3.  POPCRU Submission


      POPCRU raised a number of concerns in its submission. The major
      concerns related to the relationship between the union and the
      Department. The union argued for greater involvement in the policy
      development and pleaded for adherence to the skills development
      legislation. It also called for measures to address the areas of audit
      qualification. POPCRU was convinced that the high levels of corruption
      could be ascribed to systemic problems and expressed concern that the
      media created the impression that all officials were corrupt. Concern
      was also expressed at the large number of consultants the Department
      used for functions it should be performing itself. There was also a
      concern that these consultants comprise disgruntled former employees
      of the Department and that therefore their “expertise” was
      questionable. It was felt that contrary to what was currently the
      case, the largest number of officials should be deployed at the lower
      levels – at the moment the DCS structure was top-heavy with too many
      officials appointed at the head quarters.

      Recommendations

      (i)   The Relationship Building by Objectives platform should be fully
           implemented, so that unions can play a greater role as far as
           policy development is concerned.
       ii) Personnel should be most concentrated at the lower levels –
           excess staff should be redeployed so that they can beef up
           facilities across the country.
      iii) Measures that would address the concerns raised in the Auditor
           General’s report around audit control, should be implemented.
       iv) POPCRU sees over reliance on consultants as waste of resources
           and calls for that practice to be halted immediately.
        v) Adherence to the time frames and targets as far employment
           equity is concerned.


6.4   KHULISA submission


      Khulisa’s concerns centred on corrections, development and care
      programmes. They felt that the DCS’ budget did not allow for the rapid
      introduction of delivery in terms of the White Paper and that
      therefore there should be greater cooperation among the Department and
      the NGO sector. The presenter also expressed concern about the fact
      that the DCS was losing a lot of staff and thus a lot of institutional
      memory. It was hoped that efforts have been put in place so that new
      recruits are fully aware of what the DSC organisational changes and
      that they were trained in the new approach towards corrections.
      Concern was raised about the limited use of the NGO sector especially
      in areas where the DCS is under-resourced and not able to run
      sufficient corrections, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes.


      Recommendations


        i) A personal development component to the development programmes
           offered to inmates would prove useful in the prevention of
           recidivism.
       ii) Government should explore the creation of a Department dedicated
           to juvenile or youth offenders. Such a department should pay
           particular attention to the young offenders who can still be
           easily rehabilitated.

7.    COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

The  Portfolio  Committee  on  Correctional  Services  makes  the  following
recommendations with respect to the  2006/07  Annual  Report  and  Financial
Statements of the Department of Correctional Services:

      (i)   Members were concerned that the Department appeared to have set
           targets that it could not reach. There was a need for better and
           more realistic planning. Information should match the targets
           set out in the strategic plan with the outcomes reflected in the
           Annual Report.
       ii) A large amount was spent on claims against the Department. While
           the Committee is pleased that the Department won most of these
           cases, Members are concerned about the financial impact drawn-
           out court proceedings have. The Department has set aside
           contingency funds for claims but such cases should be avoided
           and unsubstantiated claims must be resolved speedily, so as to
           minimize their financial impact.


      (iii) The high staff turnover in critical areas remains a concern as
           it impacts directly on delivery. It was worrying that despite
           the recruitment strategy, vacancies in the Department had
           increased, not decreased. While the report made mention of the
           retention strategy that had been finalized, the problem
           persists. Concerns were also raised about how the new recruits
           were distributed and about whether the rural areas which were in
           dire need of staff were adequately provided for. The DCS should
           in addition make sure that its processes for filling vacancies
           are in line with regulations especially when it came to job
           evaluations. It was not acceptable that 617 of the 690 posts at
           salary levels 9-12 had not been evaluated.


      (iv)  Asset management is a longstanding problem within the
           Department. The Department must provide the Committee with a
           record of all the buildings it was leasing from the Department
           of Public Works. The Committee will give the Department clear
           deadlines by which to provide it with progress reports as far as
           its asset management systems are concerned. While the Committee
           appreciates the complexities around cataloguing and managing
           assets, the Department could not function without the necessary
           asset management systems.


      (v)   Collusion between officials and inmates is a matter of serious
           concern because it poses a threat both to the safety of
           offenders who are incarcerated, as well as to ordinary South
           Africans when such collusion leads to escapes. The Committee
           sees such collusion in the most serious light and the Department
           must put all necessary measures in place to ensure that security
           at correctional centres is not compromised.


       vi) The Committee remains concerned about the speed with which the
           Department concludes its disciplinary proceedings and
           investigations. These proceedings and investigations are often
           long drawn out procedures, which see officials suspended for
           long periods of time (according to POPCRU, up to two years).
           This places a burden not only on the functioning of the already
           understaffed and under-resourced Department, but also on the
           taxpayers. The Department of Correctional Services has agreed to
           provide a written response on the length of time that officials
           have been suspended without pay. This refers to the 4 cases
           identified in Table 5.5.6 in the Annual Report. This information
           must be forwarded to the Committee by 1 March 2008. The
           Committee will closely monitor developments in this regard.

      vii) The Department must ensure that its representation of women is
           in accordance with Government policy. At present only 47 of the
           125 management positions were occupied by women. That is
           unacceptable and must be increased.

     viii) The Committee acknowledges the need for inmates to be treated
           fairly but emphasises that many offenders commit violent crimes
           including the killing of police officers and correctional
           officials. Correctional officers therefore deal with offenders
           who pose a threat to their lives on a continuous basis. Although
           there are cases where inmates assaulted officers, the
           presentations made no mention of them. While the Portfolio
           Committee would never condone assault, it had to be very
           objective in its assessment of the environment correctional
           officers worked in. The Committee requests all stakeholders to,
           in their recommendations and comments, be mindful of the reality
           correctional officers are faced with on a daily basis.

       ix) The Committee was interested in how many released offenders were
           able to get employment upon their release. Being able to earn an
           honest living was an important part of the after care process as
           it played a major role in the prevention of recidivism. The
           Department should provide the Committee with regular updates
           regarding its after-care and rehabilitation programmes.

        x) The Committee agreed that it was important that the needs of
           officials were provided for – a strong management component was
           of little consequence if the officers on the ground, who dealt
           with inmates on a daily basis, were not well taken care of. It
           was also important to instill the sense that while officials had
           certain rights, those rights came with an enormous
           responsibility.

       xi) The Department of Correctional Services must ensure that, in all
           future annual reports, there is alignment of the targets
           reported on in terms of the Estimates of National Expenditure
           and the Strategic Plans for that year. Performance in terms of
           all (and not just some) of the targets should be included in the
           Reports.

      xii) More effort should be made in future annual reports to ensure
           that when progress is reported, it is made clear as to whether
           the relevant target has been achieved or not achieved.

     xiii) In future reports, more effort should be made to explain the
           failure to reach targets when these have not been met.

      xiv) The Department should also provide information in the reports
           when targets have been reduced (instead of increased) in
           comparison with the previous year. More specifically, the Annual
           Report does not stipulate which targets where revised during the
           mid term review process. This information should be contained in
           all future reports.

       xv) The Committee notes with concern the fact that the Department
           has again received a qualified audit opinion, but acknowledges
           some of the progress that has been made during the 2006/07
           financial year.  The Department of Correctional Services must
           provide a written report to the Committee by 30 April 2008 on
           steps taken to address the audit qualifications outlined in the
           2006/07 Report and provide the Committee with clear timeframes
           as to when each of these qualifications is expected to be
           completely resolved.

      xvi) The results of the HIV and AIDS prevalence survey will
           apparently be made public on 30 November 2007. The Report on the
           Survey must be made available to the Committee as soon as the
           report is made public. The Department will be expected to brief
           the Committee on the results of the Survey in the first quarter
           of 2008.

     xvii) The Department of Correctional Services must provide the
           Committee with written documentation and meet with the Committee
           on a quarterly basis on the following issues, in order to ensure
           effective oversight:

         • A quarterly expenditure report
         • Progress made on audit qualifications and matters of emphasis
         • Performance progress per programme
         • Progress on implementation of recommendations made by the
           Inspecting Judge

Report to be considered.

1.Fifteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the
 Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial
 Statements of the Department of Public Enterprises for the Financial Year
 ending 31 March 2007, dated 06 February 2008.


The Standing Committee on Public  Accounts  (SCOPA),  heard  and  considered
evidence on the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-General  on  the
financial statements of the Department of Public Enterprises, for  the  year
ended 31 March 2007.

The  Committee  commends  the  management  of  the  Department   of   Public
Enterprises for the unqualified audit  opinion  expressed  by  the  Auditor-
General and trusts that future audit opinions shall be equally  unqualified.
However, the Committee raised concerns that needed urgent  interaction  with
the Accounting Officer and reports as follows:
General matters

The Committee noted with concern the following issues raised in  the  annual
report:

   1. a turnover of 10.8 percent, especially in skilled and  contract  level
      for the 06/07 financial year, and
   2. the Department incurred  a  fruitless  expenditure  amounting  to  R80
      thousand regarding late cancellation of a  conference.  The  officials
      involved have since left the Department.  Approval has   been  granted
      to write off  the amount.

The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer:

   1. Establishes  and  review  reasons  for  staff  turnover,  develop  and
      implement strategies that will eliminate the problems experienced.


   The Committee expects the Accounting Officer to expeditiously rectify the
   issues in question.
   The Committee will await  the  report  of  the  Auditor-General  for  the
   2007/08  financial  year  to  determine  whether  there  had   been   any
   improvement on these issues.

Report to be considered.

2.Sixteenth Report of the Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  on  the
 Annual Report and the Report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the  Financial
 Statements of the Department of Public Works (DPW) for the Financial  Year
 ending 31 March 2007, dated 06 February 2008.

The  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  (SCOPA),  having  heard  and
considered evidence on the Annual Report and  the  Report  of  the  Auditor-
General on the financial  statements  of  the  Department  of  Public  Works
(DPW), for the year ended 31 March 2007, reports as follows:

1. Capacity and/or people related issues
   The Committee is concerned about the high level of vacancies  within  the
   department.  The previous year’s report indicated that the Department had
   an average rate of 19, 3% vacant posts and currently, the average rate is
   17, 5%. Of these, a high percentage is on critical posts.


   The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:


   a. vacancies, especially the senior management and  positions  in  highly
      skilled levels, are filled;
   b. applicants with relevant skills and qualifictions  are  considered  in
      filling those posts and appropriate training is provided where  it  is
      lacking;
   c.  Parliament  is  updated  quarterly  with  the  progress  on  how  the
      Department is addressing the high level rate of vacancies.


   2. Asset management
   The report highlighted some significant shortcommings in  the  management
   and control of assets which were caused by the following:


   a. inadquate monitoring  over  some  movable  assets,  resulting  in  the
      questionable integrity over the completeness, accuracy  and  valuation
      of the movable asset register;
   b.  inadequate  policies  and  procedures  regarding  the  monitoring  of
      immovable properties, resulting in the questionable integrity over the
      completeness, accuracy and valuation of the immoveable asset register;
   c. lack of monitoring over the completeness, rights and obligations  over
      state-owned properties, resulting in the non-confirmation  of  amounts
      disclosed in the financial statements;
   d. lack of monitoring over  issuing  of  confirmation  letters  to  other
      departments, and
   e.  no  direct  classification  of  current  and  capital   expenses   in
      maintenance, repairs and running costs.

   The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer:


   a.  excercises  strict  controls  over  management  and  all   staff   in
      supervisory positions;
   b. ensures that all asset registers are accurately updated;
   c. must put controls in place to ensure that there are complete, accurate
      and valid asset registers;
   d. ensures that training as well as disciplinary action are taken against
      staff members who do not perform as required;
   e.  ensures  that  the  management  consistently  monitor  policies   and
      procedures;
   f. must ensure that National  Treasury  classifies  the  expenditure  and
      gives report back to Parliament;
   g. ensures that outstanding balances and  all  unallocated  deposits  are
      collected, reconcilled, and cleared


   3. Internal control weaknesses


   The report highlighted significant  control  weaknesses  with  regard  to
   recovery of rental debtors, policies and procedures not implemented,  and
   non-compliance  with   applicable   legislation.   The   report   further
   highlighted various shortcomings in information technology environment.


   The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensures that:


   a.  the  management  implements  proper  monitoring  controls  to  ensure
      compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures;


   b. follow- up on outstanding debts is done  before  any  write-offs  take
      place;
   c. strict controls are implemented and executed against officials who are
      not adherering to rules, and
   d. qualified candidates are taken into account for employment in order to
      enhance service delivery and reduce systems deficiency.



Report to be considered

3.Seventeenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the
 Consideration of the Approval of Unauthorised Expenditure incurred by the
 Department of Public Enterprises, dated 06 February 2008.
 Expenditure totaling R 11,006,245.00 incurred during the 1997/98 to  99/00
 financial  years was regarded as unauthorized in terms  of  the  Exchequer
 Act, 975 (Act No. 66 of 1975).

 The Committee considered the following  incidents  which  arose  owing  to
 procedural contravention of Treasury Regulations, State Tender  Board  and
 procurement procedures.
   1. R10,928,245.00 arising out  of  a  request  of  the  inter-Ministerial
      Committee on restructuring, for the incumbent consultants contract  to
      be extended, however State Tender Board ratification was not obtained;


   2. R78,000.00 was paid to  a  consultant  for  a  leadership  development
      programme without  having invited official tenders.

The Accounting Officer confirmed that:

1. Services for the expenditure were received to  the  satisfaction  of  the
   department;
2. Control measures are in place to prevent this from reoccurring;
3. Systems have been  put  in  place  to  address  expenditure  control  and
   financial management;
4. Official procurement training was conducted  for  all  officials  in  the
   department  in  2006,  which  was  compulsory.  When  new  officials  are
   appointed there is a compulsory induction programme  in  place.  Training
   and education on expenditure control,  procurement  and  finance  related
   issues are part of this process. Further all policies and procedures  are
   available on the department’s intranet  for  easy  reference,  and  these
   documents are revised as and when needed.
   Having considered the evidence and the  steps  taken  by  the  Accounting
   Officer to   prevent  similar  cases  of  unauthorized  expenditure  from
   recurring, the Committee recommends the approval of the  amount  of  R11,
   006,245 by Parliament.

Report to be considered.
