                             SOCIAL HOUSING BILL

            (Decision of Question on Bill and of Report thereon)

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON(Mr T S Setona): Order! I shall now put the question.
The question is that the Bill be agreed to. As the decision is dealt with
in terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether
all delegation heads are present in the House. I will note the absence of
Gauteng’s delegation head in the House.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces the opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish.

We shall now proceed to voting on the question. I shall do this in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please insert their
cards. Before I call for the voting to proceed, please press button number
one to confirm your presence.

When I call the name of the province the delegation head will vote by
pressing number four, for those who vote in favour; button number two, for
those who vote against; and button number three, for those who abstain.

Have all the provinces voted? I must bring it to the attention of hon
members that the voting and mandates from provinces are in front of me. So,
should anyone vote without a mandate, I would be able to make a ruling on
that accordingly. I call upon the staff to bring the votes.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape,
North West and Western Cape.

AGAINST: KwaZulu-Natal.

ABSTAIN: Gauteng (absent).

Bill accordingly agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution.

IN FAVOUR: Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape,
