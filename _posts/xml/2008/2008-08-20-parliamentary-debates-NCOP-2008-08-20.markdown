       their technical division is not up to standard;
    3) senior management at the technical division of the SAA have already
       resigned because they do not wish to be party to a drop in
       standards;


    4) in the past the technical services at the SAA were some of the best
       in the world, but they have now deteriorated to such an extent that
       experts are expecting a disaster at any time; and


    5) the ANC government will have to give urgent attention to this
       unacceptable situation and rethink affirmative action and
       privatization.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the NCOP, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

                NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: WASTE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): I first would like to welcome the
Deputy Minister of Environmental Affair and Tourism. I call upon the hon
Deputy Minister to open the debate. Hon Minister, you have to come to the
podium.  We have a podium now.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Thank you, hon
Chair. Last time when I was here we used to do it from our seats. I didn’t
know you have gone higher.

Hon members, we all know what our Constitution says in section 24.  I  don’t
need to repeat that. We have to conserve our environment, which is not  only
for us but for the generations to come, because we have only one planet.  If
we damage it, we damage it for, life and there won’t be any life  again.  So
what we are going to talk about is something that will  assist  in  cleaning
up the environment, the health of the people and their  planet  as  well  as
the  right  to  have  an  environment  that  is  protected   by   reasonable
legislation. This is because we have a responsibility as government  to  see
to it that the environment is clean and also that we  follow  what  we  have
legislated because, even if we have wonderful laws, if those  laws  are  not
implemented they just going to sit somewhere gathering dust, and  that  will
not help.

In order to give effect to the constitutional rights to a safe  environment,
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  reviewed  environmental
legislation  in  1996.  The  review  resulted   in   the   development   and
promulgation of  the  National  Environmental  Management  Act  in  1998  as
overarching framework legislation for environmental management.

In order to deal  with  the  waste  management  challenges,  the  department
started the development of  the  National  Environmental  Management:  Waste
Bill in 2005 as subsidiary framework legislation which seeks to  give  legal
effect to the White Paper that we have on  integrated  pollution  and  waste
management  that  was  developed  in  2000.   The   National   Environmental
Management: Waste Bill has therefore been in the making for many years.

South Africa has a large and complex problem pertaining to waste  management
because waste and its consequent pollution have never been dealt with  in  a
more focused way. As a nation, we are a throw-away society and  most  people
do not consider what happens to the  things  they  throw  away.  You’ll  see
people throwing things out of the windows of moving cars and  wherever  they
are in the parks. You know, it’s a sad story when we get to  our  parks  and
you find that there is so much litter, and the  Bill  is  just  right  there
because we are a throw-away society. And we have to change the  mind-set  of
our people.

The fragmentation of waste management legislation has resulted in a lack  of
effective waste management which presents huge challenges  in  our  country.
The impact of improper waste  management,  for  example,  and  its  negative
impacts   on   health   and   the   environment   are   unfortunately    and
disproportionately borne by poor communities.  I’m  sure  we  know  of  open
spaces in our villages and townships where you’ll see waste dumps. And  it’s
quite a painful experience that we are going through.

This Bill has gone through an extensive  public  participation  process.  It
was gazetted for comment from 12 January 2007 to 12 April 2007.  During  the
drafting process in 2006, there was  extensive  consultation  in  government
and with stakeholders before the Bill went to  Cabinet.  In  some  provinces
there was more than one workshop.

There was a major government Waste Management Conference in March 2007
which some of you attended, consultations with NGOs and other people and
meetings with various business and industry sectors. Bilateral meetings
were also held with the Department of Trade and Industry and National
Treasury, amongst others.

The chief state law adviser certified the Bill in terms of its
constitutionality and the Bill was tabled in Parliament in June 2007. The
public hearings on the Bill yielded very good and desirable alterations to
the Bill.

The Bill is largely framework legislation which provides the basis for the
regulation of waste management. The application of the waste Bill is
limited only to waste streams that are not dealt with by other pieces of
legislation in order to avoid duplication and to complement existing
legislation.

Waste management has very real and major implications for the economy.
Therefore the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has
considered what needs to be done nationally in order to maintain economic
consistency in relation to matters that would have an impact on the
economy.

Furthermore, whilst the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has
to ensure that it deals even-handedly with waste as a commodity and that
there was one set of rules, the legislation has been drafted in such a way
that it does not contravene South Africa’s obligations in terms of
international trade.

The legislation provides for a range of waste management measures including
the declaration of priority waste by the Minister and the preparation of
waste management plans by industry or organs of state. Priority waste would
not necessarily be large quantities of waste but this would be waste
streams that have become a serious problem or are toxic and therefore
require specific and focused attention in the way they are managed.
The purpose of the waste management plans by organs of state is to provide
for organs of state to set out how they intend to manage waste in carrying
out their function or mandate whilst the purpose of the plans by industry
is for industry to set out how it will deal with the waste it generates.
They should know that it is not only about making money, but also about
what they are doing and where it ends up.

In order not to overregulate, only industries that are identified will be
required to do this. This is primarily a mechanism aimed at large waste
generators. Other industries can prepare their plans voluntarily.

There are a few new concepts in the Bill which have not previously been  set
out in South African law.  Firstly,  the  general  duty  for  waste  holders
states that every person is responsible for how they deal with their  waste.
All of us as citizens of this country, when we are drinking a cool drink  or
when you’re putting it in a dustbin, should  be  worried  about  where  that
dustbin ends up because  somebody  might  have  a  contract  to  remove  the
dustbin but then they dump it next to  my  aunt  or  somewhere  in  an  open
space.

Secondly, for the first time, legislation has been used to drive a waste
minimisation approach, which is based on the waste hierarchy and will
ensure that the ‘‘cradle to grave’’ approach is used in managing waste. As
a result of this approach, municipalities will now be required, inter alia,
to provide containers so that recyclable waste can be collected.

Although these have cost implications, separating waste will mean that in
the long run the waste can be used to generate income. We should also have
the foresight to realise that the more we recycle, the more we are
conserving the natural resources because, if we don’t recycle, we keep on
cutting down trees, we keep on using the sources of material that we are
going to use. By doing so, we are destroying the environment and it gets
degraded, but if we keep on recycling we will be conserving.

Thirdly, this legislation has a section dedicated to contaminated land.
Historically, in South Africa, it has been relatively easy to contaminate
land without any serious consequences because there were no ways of holding
polluters accountable. This resulted in situations where government ended
up having to deal with and finance the cleaning up of contaminated land.

The contaminated land section of the Bill provides for the remediation of
contaminated land. The department can identify land as contaminated and
conduct investigations to determine the extent of contamination as well as
the form of remediation required. There will be a database or register of
all contaminated land. The department has taken the view that the cost of
reducing pollution must be shared amongst the people who are responsible
for waste.

Whilst the Bill is largely framework legislation, the licensing of waste
management has been drafted at a much more detailed level than would be
found in framework legislation. The reason for this is that the
department’s experience over the last 10 years has been that in order to
license effectively, there must be the power to do so in legislation.

Only identified activities will require a licence and this will enable the
department to focus on key activities through the introduction of
thresholds and proper descriptive wording relating to activities requiring
licensing. It also enables the creation of a streamlined permitting process
with, environmental impact assessment, EIA, requirements to make the
authorisation process less cumbersome than it is at present.

Furthermore, the Bill caters for microindustries to be regulated, if
necessary, in ways other than through licensing, for example, by the
setting of standards. An example may be the small collectors of recyclable
waste. The department will be the competent authority to license hazardous
waste facilities because of the associated environmental risks, and
provinces will license the general waste facilities.

The Bill also provides for compliance and enforcement. What is different
about these provisions is that, unlike in other pieces of legislation, here
the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry has been given powers to enforce
compliance in respect of waste-related issues that can impact on water
resources.

The exercise of these powers, however, must be done after consultation with
the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism or the relevant MEC for
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The legislation provides for the drawing
up of a National Waste Management Strategy within two years of
promulgation. It is acknowledged that implementation of the legislation
will not happen overnight. The National Waste Management Strategy will be
the master plan that will guide the implementation of the legislation.

After another round of consultations and public hearings, the Bill was
adopted by the NA at the beginning of May 2008 and was then referred to the
NCOP. In view of the above, the department is of the view that the National
Environmental Management: Waste Bill will introduce a revolutionary way of
managing waste in South Africa. This revolutionary way should not be done
by us only, but we are appealing to all citizens of this country to change
their mind-set of putting everything together. They should start to sort
waste at source. This is a great challenge to everyone, our constituencies
and our churches. Let us try to spread this message of sorting waste at
source and take it to buy-back centres.
The department and our partners are establishing buy-back centres and we
are encouraging people to sort and sell waste which will be recycled. Those
buy-back centres must belong to the communities, to groups of unemployed
youths or women. They must be trained. We often see people whom we call
scavengers; they can be sent for training like we did in certain areas.
They are good recyclers, and by doing that we will be spreading the word in
schools as many schools have already started this recycling project.

The learners are also teaching their parents to make compost. We all want
healthy, organically grown vegetables and fruit. We start by not throwing
anything away and by recycling bottles and plastic. We must turn this waste
into wealth by employing people and creating jobs for the unemployed youth
and women.

Finally, I would like to thank members of the select committee for the
wonderful work they have done in a short period of time, as well as for
their valuable contribution in the finalisation of the National
Environmental Management: Waste Bill. In particular, I would like to thank
the chairperson for his leadership in the process. Thank you.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, the Minister, hon members, the department, all
stakeholders, special delegates present here, in 1996 the Department of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism undertook to review the existing
environmental legislation in order to ensure that environmental legislation
was aligned to the Constitution and new policies, and to consolidate and
streamline legislation governing the environment.

The National Environmental Management Act of 1998 was developed as the
overarching framework legislation for environmental management in South
Africa.  More recently, as part of the law reform process, DEAT undertook
to develop national legislation governing pollution and waste management.

The National Environmental Management: Waste Bill lays the foundation for
the regulation and management of pollution and waste. The aim of the Bill
is to reform laws regulating waste management by providing reasonable
measures for integrated pollution and waste management, providing for
compliance with those measures and generally giving effect to section 24 of
the Constitution in order to achieve an environment that is not harmful to
the health and wellbeing of our people.

The Bill places a general duty on the state to put in place uniform
measures that seek to reduce the amount of waste generated and to ensure
that waste is reused, recycled and recovered in an environmentally sound
manner before being safely treated and disposed of.

The Bill also seeks to provide for the establishment of a National Waste
Management Strategy that organs of state must give effect to when
exercising a power and performing a duty in terms of the Act or any other
legislation that regulates waste management.

The Bill specifically provides for the following: institutional arrangement
for waste management that outlines the roles and responsibilities of all
spheres of government in respect of waste management; strategic and
planning frameworks as well as norms and standards for waste management;
obligations relating to various aspects of waste management; licensing of
waste management activities; enforcement of the provisions of the Bill; the
designation of waste management officers and their role and
responsibilities; and the declaration of waste as a priority and
consequences thereto.

In institutional planning, we have waste management officers who will be
appointed by the Minister, MECs and municipalities. The purpose of waste
management officers is to provide a person for the public to consult with
regard to waste management issues in all spheres of government.

The integrated management plan’s purpose is to provide for organs of state
to set out how they intend to carry out their function with regard to waste
management. We also have the industrial waste management plans that provide
for the preparation, contents, consultation, consideration and review of
industry waste management plans. The purpose of industry waste management
plans is to provide for industry and certain organs of state to set out how
to deal with the waste generated.

The Minister and MECs may require industry waste management plans to be
provided. Industry waste management plans may be prepared by the provincial
departments of environmental affairs and tourism on behalf of the industry
and they may recover the costs. This is a new section in the waste
legislation and the purpose of this section is to provide for remediation
of contaminated land.

Go botlhokwa gore lefatshe lo seke lwa leswefadiwa mme batho ba rona ba
tshwanetse go rutiwa gore ... [It is very important that the environment is
not contaminated and our people should be taught that ...]

... cleanliness is next to godliness, and if cleanliness is next to
godliness we must advance for purity and cleanliness at all costs.

Fa re dira jalo e tla nna gore ... [If we do this, it will imply that ...]

... prevention is better than cure. If we prevent any kind of ailment we
shall be creating a better future for the people of this country.
Ke ka lebaka leo re ratang go baya Molaotlhomo o o fa pele ga Ntlo e, o o
nang le diphetogo tse di rileng, gore Ntlo e o amogele. Ke a leboga. [It is
for this reason that we would like to put this Bill before this House, with
amendments, so that it can be adopted. Thank you.]

Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, when this
Bill was debated in the NA earlier this year my colleague Gareth Morgan
made the point that South Africa is a wasteful country and that we have
become accustomed to using far more than we need to. The Minister also made
the same point a while ago. I agree with them and therefore welcome any
measures that are aimed at improving the lives of our people by ensuring a
cleaner and healthier environment while seeking to enhance the preservation
of fauna, flora and the soil we live on.

I am, however, somewhat confused. Here we have legislation that is on the
one hand part of an omnibus of a number of pieces of national legislation
introduced by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, all
aimed at improving the management of our environment and therefore
fostering much needed preservation. On the other hand, however, we learned
with great disappointment this week that the Department of Minerals and
Energy has granted mining concessions to Mineral Commodities Ltd to mine a
portion of the Xolobeni Mineral Sands project, slap bang within one of the
most pristine areas along a stretch of unspoilt coastline of the Wild
Coast, one of the world’s most important biodiversity hotspots.

Yes, this is one of the most impoverished areas in South Africa and yes,
mining will create jobs for some but only for a limited period while the
environment is uprooted and contaminated by industrial waste. Many more
jobs, and ones more suitable and sustainable at that, could have been
created by the introduction of the professional management of ecotourism in
this very same area.

The Environmental Affairs Minister is on record as saying that he supports
ecotourism as opposed to mining in the Wild Coast, but his hands are tied
because in terms of present legislation the Minister does not have the
power to grant or deny environmental authorisation for mines. This must be
changed if we are truly serious about conservation and a waste-free
environment. The Minister will have to use all the opportunities at his
disposal to prevent any further rights from being granted in this area.

Another matter that I find upsetting about this Bill, and which I have
raised in connection with other Bills before in this House, is the
unacceptable timing and passage of this important piece of legislation
through the NCOP and provinces. This Bill has been tagged as a section 76
Bill which means it was judged as being of significant importance to
provinces and to local government. As it is, municipalities will play a
pivotal role in the implementation and management of the provisions
envisaged in this legislation.

We have learnt that all in all it took some five years in terms of the
prior arrangements that were done before it was brought to Parliament when
it was finally adopted by the NA on 8 May 2008. I say five years, yet five
days later on 30 May 2008, the NCOP select committee was briefed by
officials of the department. After this briefing only 28 days remained in
which the provincial portfolio committees had to be briefed by permanent
delegates of this House and in which they in turn had to conduct public
hearings and themselves had to consider the Bill.

By 10 June negotiating mandates were considered by the select committee and
on 24 June final mandates were adopted. If it had not been for the
constituency period commencing the next day, we would have debated and
passed the Bill before the end of June. After months of deliberations,
therefore, our colleagues in the NA must know every comma and full stop in
the Bill, but permanent delegates are expected to do justice to their
duties only after a few hours of briefings. This cannot be correct and
provinces must also be given much more time for scrutiny, public hearings
and deliberations. We know there was a lot of consultation; we know that
there were public hearings, but the Constitution obliges us to hold public
hearings in the provinces. If we are not equipped to go and do proper
briefings then the provinces are not equipped to also consider the Bills
properly. I think this is something that needs urgent attention.

The last matter that I also am concerned about is in regard to the
implementation of the provisions of the Bill. That is because
municipalities which fall under this legislation also have many obligations
and may take an eternity to do so. Most municipalities outside the metros
are unable to execute the most basic of their present core functions and I
would like to say that the vast majority of them are not in a position to
implement their responsibilities in regard to this Act.

It is noted that the department has budgeted for significant funding in the
years of implementation in order to help build capacity and infrastructure,
but I warn that checks and balances will have to be introduced to ensure
uniformity across provinces and municipalities. The DA supports this very
important piece of legislation. I thank you.

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, colleagues, the department’s
review of environmental legislation began many years ago in order to ensure
that there was an alignment with the Constitution as well as to consolidate
and streamline legislation governing the environment. As part of these
processes the department undertook to develop national legislation
governing pollution and waste management and the Bill before us today aims
to do just that.
In this age where climate change and global warming are upon us and cannot
be ignored any longer, the need for legislation to deal with pollution and
waste is of paramount importance. A change in the attitude and behaviour of
all South Africans is needed if we are to successfully deal with these
problems and provide better protection for our environment. It is the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism which must play a leading
role in this regard and provide the foundation needed to ensure
environmental responsibility and serve as an example to all South Africans.


In the past waste pollution was never a priority issue and always seemed to
take the back seat to other issues that were deemed more pressing at the
time. This attitude and behaviour resulted in waste disposal methods that
were not only detrimental to the environment but also to the health of the
people. We have all seen or read about medical or other waste being dumped
near communities or about how pollution from factories or waste affects the
health of people living on contaminated land.

In most cases the people and communities who are worst affected by these
actions are the poorest members of our society. A change of attitude is
needed and issues such as recycling and environmentally friendly behaviour
must become part of everybody’s routine.

Hopefully this Bill will remedy some of these issues surrounding waste and
pollution that have plagued us for so long and have had such a negative
impact on our environment, health and quality of life. We must all pull
together and play our part. We support this Bill

Kodwa-ke mina Ngqongqoshe ake ngibeke kancane nje ukuthi uke wathinta

(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[However, Minister, let me comment briefly on something you touched on
regarding the townships. Littering has become a common practice simply
because waste bins are placed far from the people, and they are not
collected on time when they are full which results in people resorting to
littering because they do not have anywhere to dispose of their waste.
Stricter measures must be exercised on those who do not remove waste bins.
Besides that, Minister, you can continue making the lives of South Africans
better. Thank you.]

Ms E PRINCE (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and members of
the NCOP.

Verlede week, tydens die ANC-Vroueliga se Wes-Kaapse kongres het mev Angie
Motshekga, die Vroueliga se President, dit onomwonde gestel dat ons as
vroue baie beter na ons omgewing moet kyk en die sorg van ons omgewing moet
eien, aangesien dit so is dat wanneer die omgewing ly, dit vroue is wat
swaarkry.

Hierdie realitieit is nie versteek nie. Ons het onmiddelik gesien watter
negatiewe impak armoede op ons omgewing het en hoe dit veral van ons
omgewing direk daartoe aanleiding gee tot groter armoede. Hierdie
departement het die afgelope 14 jaar hard gewerk om seker te maak dat ons
omgewing skoon bly en vir nageslagte behoue sal bly.

Verder het hierdie departement ook gemeenskapsbetrokkenheid geprioretiseer
om sodoende te verseker dat die gemeenskappe verantwoordelik gehou word vir
die versorging van hul omgewing. So is hierdie wetsontwerp weereens ’n
manier om te sorg dat ons omgewing veiliger en meer leefbaar sal wees
deurdat ons die afvalbestuurprobleem vir eens en vir altyd daardeur
aanspreek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Last week, during the ANC Women’s League Western Cape Congress, Mrs Angie
Motshekga, President of the Women’s League, plainly stated that we as women
should do more to look after our environment and that we should take it
upon ourselves to care for the environment, since it is known that when the
environment suffers, it is women who are increasingly burdened.
This reality is not concealed. The negative impact poverty has on our
environment, and especially how this leads directly to greater poverty, was
immediately apparent. This department has worked hard over the past 14
years to ensure that our environment stays clean and is preserved for
posterity.

This department has, furthermore, prioritised communal participation to
ensure that the communities are held responsible for caring for their
environment. Therefore, this Bill is once again a way to ensure that our
environment will be safer and more habitable by addressing the waste
management problem once and for all.]

In doing so, this Bill prioritises waste minimisation by promoting
avoidance, recovery, re-use and recycling and using the disposal of waste
as a last resort. As stated by the department’s Joanne Yawitch earlier this
year, this is indeed what we as a country need and this Bill provides the
answer.

Dit was juis die Adjunkminister van hierdie departement, mev Joyce
Mabudafhasi, wat in Maart verlede jaar gesê het dat ons nie kan toelaat dat
ons hierdie nasie verdrink in afval, terwyl ons dit kan gebruik om werk te
skep en armoede te bestry nie. Ons het ’n verantwoordelikheid om die ganse
mensdom en generasies wat opkom te bevry en die dreigement te verweer van
leef op ’n planeet wat onherstelbaar verniel is deur menslike aktiwiteite,
met skaars hulpbronne wat ons nie langer kan onderhou nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It was, in fact, the Deputy Minister of this department, Mrs Joyce
Mabudafhasi, who said in March last year that we cannot allow this nation
to drown in waste, while we are able to use it to create jobs and to fight
poverty. We have a responsibility to free the entire human race and
generations to follow, and to defend ourselves from the threat of living on
a planet that has been damaged irreparably by human activities, with scarce
resources that cannot support us for long.]

Generally the Western Cape Province supports the National Environmental
Management: Waste Bill of 2007. Waste minimisation is strongly emphasised
in this Bill.

Public hearings were held in the province by the Provincial Department of
Environmental Affairs and Development Planning. It played an active role in
commenting on and providing input on the Bill over a period of time and has
played a strong role in facilitating the input from municipalities.
However, we have raised and want to emphasise the following concerns: We
feel the Bill has not made sufficient provision for costs incurred, given
the extended mandates to the province and the municipalities. Our major
concern here is that most landfills in the province and nationally are not
managed properly or meeting minimum requirements. Thus clause 35(2) must be
omitted, because banks own most of the land and must take up their
responsibility to remediate contaminated land that is owned by them.

The rehabilitation of small waste deposit sites could conservatively amount
to R2 million per site. As the department closes more landfills, there is
an average of five year’s of landfill space left on most landfills in the
Western Cape. More transfer stations and drop-off facilities could be
opened, implying that provincial administrative obligations would increase.
We will need a far better arrangement in respect of drafts and current
involvement in giving inputs with regard to landfills and their impact on
the water quality aspect when these functions are assigned to the
provinces. I thank you.

Mr W M DOUGLAS: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, in South
Africa until as recently as 1997, waste management, incorporating waste
minimisation, was not regarded as a national or provincial priority issue.
The ACDP, therefore, commends the department for addressing the numerous
deficiencies through this legislation.

Waste management across South Africa has been in a mess traditionally. The
lack of waste management planning and bad habits in dealing with waste
inherited from the previous dispensation is a major problem. Other problems
include waste disposal on river banks, the creation of open dump disposal
areas threatening bordering residents, the general burning of waste causing
air pollution and unauthorised waste processing involving hazardous
substances.

Today South Africa has set a national target to reduce by 70% by 2022 the
amount of big-five waste products going to landfills, namely plastic, cans,
paper, glass and tyres. It also intends to have plans in place to decrease
and treat the remaining 30% of its waste. This is good news for us and it
is good news for the environment and we applaud the department in this
regard. The National Environmental Management: Waste Bill aims to achieve
the goal of entrenching waste management best practices into law.

For example, this Bill will replace the obsolete and weak end-of-pipe
approach with a new, more environmentally accountable and sustainable
approach. End-of-pipe management refers to the way in which rubbish is
typically collected by municipal waste companies, disposed of at landfills
and covered with soil. These landfills eventually exceed their capacity,
necessitating new landfill sites. The Bill will also reform the law,
regulating waste management in order to protect health and environment by
providing reasonable measures for the prevention of pollution and
ecological degradation, and for securing ecologically sustainable
development while promoting justifiable economic and social development. In
other words, it will provide for national norms, standards and measures for
regulating the management of waste by all spheres of government.
Moreover, it has been said that South Africa has a sad legacy with regard
to the incineration of waste. For example, Bobby Peek, Director of
groundWork, stated that, according to the Danish and Norwegian technical
consultants hired by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,
if South Africa goes ahead with plans to burn waste, as proposed by the
waste Bill, it will cost us R140 billion over the next 25 years. This
equates to the entire SA Health Budget at current estimates for more than
12 years.

The ACDP is deeply concerned about the burning of waste and believes that
it is not the way to go; however, the ACDP supports this Bill. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr R J TAU: Deputy Minister, the Deputy President of the ANC’s Women’s
League and hon members, one must say that this is a very important piece of
legislation. I think we have all agreed on that because we are debating
this piece of legislation on a very important day of a very important
month, of course.

Many of us will remember that during those days, to mobilise for the United
Democratic Front, UDF, it was the young people who ensured that they formed
the backbone of the United Democratic Front and were at the forefront of
mobilising and galvanising South African society.

As young people, one of the key things that we were mobilised to do was to
ensure that our environment is clean. Historically, we were subjected to
areas that were quite dirty and neglected and were made to feel that we are
Africans and that living in unhealthy environments was appropriate for
Africans.

Therefore, one of the key strategies of the UDF then was to ensure that
when mobilising and conscientising young people we looked at the issues we
had to deal with. We needed to go out there and clean our parks, pick up
the dirt and teach our people that being African is not a curse, but one
thing that we had to do to ensure that we would be proud of being Africans
and Blacks, in general, was to keep our environment clean.

In this context, it is important for us also to remember that as we engage
with this issue of waste management one of the key things that we need to
remind ourselves of, once more, is the extent to which these things affect
young people and women. We have to ensure that what we raise becomes
practical, that is, using waste for economic development.

How do we mobilise young people and young women by forming co-operatives?
How do we ensure that young people and women are supported through the
strengthening of local government, also materially and resource-wise, to
form themselves into those co-operatives that will manage these landfills,
because if you look at this at the local government level, landfills are a
contested area of big capital.

Through the management of landfills, big capital sees an opportunity to
make money. It ensures that things which don’t need to be put out to
tender, are put out to tender by municipalities or local government. This
makes it extremely difficult for young people and women to benefit from
such processes. This is an important issue and we need to look at how best
we can build that capacity within our municipalities to ensure that simple
things like landfills are not put out to tender.

I’m raising this particular issue precisely because most of the people who
are affected are the poor people in our communities. I don’t know if the
officials from the departments have assisted the Minister or the Ministry,
in general, in looking at the kind of submissions that were made by our
communities during public hearings, because one of the key things that came
up very strongly is the issue of how we translate waste into an instrument
of economic development. It was raised so sharply that I remember in the
North West one submission went to the extent of wanting to reject the Bill
if it does not address this particular issue related to economic
development. And I think it is a very important issue for us to consider.

The hon Watson raised very important issues with regard to the internal
processes of development of legislation in the National Council of
Provinces. It is unfortunate because it’s an opportunity lost, precisely
because the hon member’s contribution in this particular debate would have
been much more effective in the debate on Parliament’s Vote because it
would have assisted Parliament in reviewing its systems and mechanisms in
dealing with legislation. I’m saying today that we have missed that
particular opportunity.

It is on that note that I want to end by saying that as the ANC we support
this Bill and we encourage the department to do its best to ensure that it
won’t only, once more be – as you said Deputy Minister - a paper that is
going to gather dust, but that it will actually be a practical paper that
will benefit the working class and the poor. Thank you very much.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon Tau, in future, please address our Chief
Whip properly. In terms of the Rules of the House, she is the Chief Whip of
the NCOP.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, I
would like to thank everyone for their contributions to this Bill. We
always know that it takes a long time to achieve good things. When we buy
things and we are told that they are handcrafted or handwoven, we know that
those are things of quality. This Bill took a long time because we wanted a
quality Bill that would address all our aspirations. And there is no way
that it will collect dust because we have a law enforcement directorate in
our department that will be monitoring it and seeing to it that it is
implemented and implemented correctly. We call them the Green Scorpions,
but they are law-enforcers.

Through the commitment that you’ve shown there is no way that it will
collect dust because all of us here are going to be implementing it. When
talking to the next person you are already implementing it.

We had a very successful women and environment conference last week at
which all provinces were represented, especially the women in the
communities out there. Even SADC women Ministers said, invited or not, they
were coming because we are all concerned about waste.

Since we launched what we now call the borderless SADC, we now work as SADC
because when there is waste at our borders it can be blown in either
direction. So we have now committed ourselves to work with our neighbours;
we are cleaning our border post jointly with, for example, Lesotho,
Swaziland and others because we feel that waste does not have boundaries;
it does not need passports. That is one of the things that we are
strengthening.

The other thing that we did not mention is the issue of reducing waste. Why
are we recycling? Besides for economic purposes and our health, we need to
reduce the landfills. We need this land for many things like agriculture
and housing and if we can get it right, we will only have a little bit of
waste for which we will need landfills. We will then have more land.
Recycling therefore has a big impact also, of course, as the hon Tau was
saying, for economic purposes.

One can understand very well why we are recycling waste, why we are dealing
with waste - besides cleaning we are also developing the economy. As I
said, we have these buy-back centres and recycling places and of course
there are those who would like to cheat us and say that they are doing
recycling yet they are doing other things. Fortunately there are people who
always alert us to people who say they have certificates or permission to
recycle glass only to find that they are collecting all types of waste
which end up affecting the communities and the land.

I really thank you very much for the contributions that were made. We
haven’t done everything. There is a lot to say about waste but what is more
important is for us to go back to mobilise more people, especially the
youth out there. We have so much waste that we can employ almost half the
population of our youth and the women out there to clean the country while
they are developing the economy and becoming businesspeople.

Here in Cape Town, just outside Philippi, there are former prisoners who
are now rehabilitated and they are running a very good recycling project.
They are recycling bottles and papers. We need to support them. It is
important that the Department of Provincial and Local Government and the
municipalities out there all work together. We can talk until we are blue
in the face but of course they have the responsibility of putting out the
instruments like bins and other things and it is very important that they
are working with everybody. So all the departments are included.

Lastly, we should use the instruments and partners that are there, even
other industries that are interested in working with us. And I am sure that
they can help us, especially the industries, as they are the generators of
waste and they must see to it that that waste becomes a resource, something
that we can re-use, and they must put in money to assist us with the
necessary technology.

With those few words I really want to say I appreciate the hard work you
did within such a short space of time. It showed the commitment we have to
get South Africa, our country, to where it was in the past before it was
polluted and before we degraded it. Thank you. [Applause.]

                  NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT LAWS AMENDMENT BILL


                 (Consideration of Bill and Report thereon)

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister and hon members, the National
Environmental Laws Amendment Bill was published in Government Gazette 30142
on 3 August 2007 and in the ATCs of 9 July 2008.

The essence of the Bill is to establish a comprehensive legislative mandate
for EMIs, which, hon Themba – through you, Chair – are Environmental
Management Inspectors.

The function of an EMI is to monitor and enforce compliance with the law
for which he or she has been designated in order to carry out this
function. The EMIs have been accorded a range of statutory powers,
including inspection, investigation, enforcement and administrative powers.
Currently, however, there are only three pieces of legislation that EMIs
may enforce. One is the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity
Act, Act 10 of 2004, Nema, and the National Environmental Management:
Protected Areas Act of 2004.

The current mandate of EMIs, therefore, covers what are traditionally
perceived as green issues - the Minister has referred to the Green
Scorpions – for example, biodiversity and protected areas, and
environmental impact assessments, but excludes brown issues such as
pollution and waste. This is due to the fact that the national legislation
regulating pollution and waste matters, particularly the National
Environmental Management: Air Quality Bill, of 2004 is not yet fully in
effect. Furthermore, the National Environmental Management: Waste Bill
still has to be tabled; I think it has just been tabled.

Until these two pieces of legislation are fully in effect, it is crucial
that EMIs are given the mandate to enforce and monitor compliance with the
Environment Conservation Act of 1989 and the Atmospheric Pollution
Prevention Act of 1965, and with the provisions of the National
Environmental Management: Air Quality Act that are already in effect.
Chair, I put this report to the House for adoption. Thank you.

Debate concluded.

Voting deferred.

                       LIQUOR PRODUCTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Hon Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, the
Liquor Products Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Liquor Products Act,
Act 60 of 1989. As we all know, South Africa recently signed the SA-EU Wine
and Spirits Agreement, which places certain obligations on South Africa as
a major wine-producing country.

Therefore, the amendments proposed in the Bill are, firstly, to create the
framework for the country’s international obligations under this agreement.
This includes the protection of geographical indications in terms of the
agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,
Trips. Secondly, the proposed amendments are to ensure compliance regarding
the importation of liquor products in terms of the said agreement and,
thirdly, to ensure the traceability of products as required by the
international agreement.

A further objective of the Bill is to amend the composition of the Wine and
Spirit Board to ensure the representativeness of the entire industry. This
is due to structural changes within the industry where KWV and the Cape
Wine and Spirit Institute are no longer fully representative of all the
participants in the industry. In this regard, the Select Committee on Land
and Environmental Affairs proposed a further amendment whereby the
appointment of the board by the Minister must be in consultation with
Parliament.

The Bill will also assist emerging farmers by allowing the introduction and
cultivation of cheaper vines for the production of wines. This will not
only increase their cash flow, but will also facilitate easier access to
the wine industry at the producer level. The Select Committee on Land and
Environmental Affairs fully supports the Bill with the amendments and
therefore requests this House to also support the Bill with the amendments.
Thank you.

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with
section 75 of the Constitution.
